A joke stated that if an alien species crash landed in the Southern US, either white Southerners, black Southerners, Mexicans, or Chinese people would run first on who'd cook it, and either of the four, with their rich history and culture concerning cuisine, would be the best thing you've ever tasted. Unfortunately for one alien species that crashed in the Southern US, it encountered all four.","output":"In a small, sleepy town of Southern Georgia, a quaint rural community went about its daily routines, unaware of the extraordinary event about to unfold. The townsfolk were known for their warm hospitality, diverse backgrounds, and their deep appreciation for food. However, on this particular day, something truly unexpected happened—the arrival of a crash-landed spaceship from the farthest corners of the universe. As soon as news of the extraterrestrial arrival spread throughout the town, excitement rippled through its various communities. White Southerners, black Southerners, Mexicans, and Chinese residents stood in awe, their shared anticipation overwhelming any underlying differences. These disparate cultural groups marveled at the miraculous event that now united them in a unique way. It didn't take long before rumors began to circulate, sums of money being offered for the first authentic taste of otherworldly flavors. Laughter echoed through the town as jesters playfully speculated about which community would seize the opportunity and embark on a culinary adventure they would never forget. Soon enough, word reached Miss Virginia, a white Southern woman known throughout the town for her mouthwatering pecan pies and secret family recipes. With a twinkle in her eye, she meticulously gathered her apron, wooden spoon, and headed towards the spaceship crash site, eager to discern the alien's flavors and concoct a dish that would make her ancestors proud. Simultaneously, just a stone's throw away, Earl, a charismatic black Southerner with a flair for spices and traditional barbecue, sprang into action. His fingers danced across the piano keys as he serenaded the alien with soulful melodies, believing music could be the bridge between worlds—a universal language to reach their hearts through their stomachs. Over in Little Mexico, Maria, a vibrant and skilled Mexican cook, swiftly assembled her array of chili peppers, fresh cilantro, and fragrant spices. She brought her culture to the forefront, drawing inspiration from her grandmother's cherished recipes—perfecting a blend that would not only tantalize alien taste buds but also honor her heritage. Meanwhile, Mr. Chen, a humble Chinese chef with a restaurant tucked into a quiet corner of town, meticulously reviewed centuries-old recipes. Armed with symbolism and the wisdom handed down through generations, he contemplated a dish of harmonious balance—a perfect marriage of flavors that would impress both the senses and the spirit. At the spaceship, the alien, startled by the sudden attention, observed the lively scene unfolding before them. Encountering the culinary prowess of these different communities was truly unexpected—a stroke of both good fortune and complexity. From their perspective, they had unwittingly stumbled upon a culinary paradise—a melting pot of cultures ready to create an unrivaled gastronomic masterpiece. As the four culinary masters presented their offerings, each with a dish showcasing their distinct heritage, an aromatic symphony enveloped the air. The townsfolk gathered, witnessing the beauty of cultural exchange, bridging the gaps created by mere geography. As the alien took the first bite, a kaleidoscope of flavors burst upon their taste buds—a harmonious fusion that transcended taste alone. Each dish proudly reflected the communities' respective histories, acknowledging their ancestral struggles and celebrating their shared triumphs. In that transcendent moment, the alien realized that the true treasure lay not in their encounter with Earth itself, but in the incredible diversity of its inhabitants and their extraordinary ability to harmonize through the power of food. The townsfolk, who initially saw their differences as potential divisions, were now united through a shared appreciation for their own and each other's culinary achievements. Thus, a remarkable friendship was forged—a bond between alien and human, reaffirming that the greatest connections are often nurtured around a table, where cultural pride and acceptance create a symphony that can be savored like no other. And in this small Southern town, for years to come, every gathering would be a testament to the unity discovered when diversity met deliciousness."},{"instruction":"草原艺术馆","output":"草原艺术馆是位于中国内蒙古自治区呼和浩特市的一家艺术展示机构。草原艺术馆致力于展示、推广和发展草原文化艺术，以促进草原地区的文化交流和艺术创作。 草原艺术馆建筑风格独特，融合了传统蒙古包和现代建筑元素，宏伟壮观而富有草原特色。馆内设有多个展示区域，展示了草原地区的绘画、雕塑、摄影等各类艺术作品。 草原艺术馆定期举办各类艺术展览和文化活动，吸引了众多艺术家和观众的关注。除了展览活动，馆内还设有艺术创作工作室，为艺术家提供了良好的创作环境和支持。 草原艺术馆的成立对于推动草原地区的艺术发展和文化传承具有重要意义，也为广大观众提供了一个欣赏和了解草原艺术的平台。该馆努力打造草原地区的文化名片，提升了该地区的文化软实力和知名度。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He was an ordinary man, leading an ordinary life, and tonight was just like any other night. Little did he know that his life was about to take a turn towards the extraordinary. As the clock ticked closer to midnight, a strange tingling sensation began to take hold of Eric. He shook his head lightly, trying to brush off the odd feeling. But as the minutes passed, that tingling sensation grew stronger, causing a rush of warmth to spread throughout his body. Confused and slightly frightened, Eric decided to sit down on the edge of his worn-out couch, trying to make sense of the strange phenomenon he was experiencing. But it wasn't long before he realized that something was happening to him, something he could neither explain nor control. Within the next few moments, Eric felt a growing sense of confidence and allure. He stood up, feeling an unfamiliar power surging through his veins. His reflection in the mirror caught his eye, and his jaw dropped in disbelief. His features had become sharper, more defined, and exuded a newfound sensuality. \\"What on earth is happening to me?\\" Eric whispered to himself, his voice laced with a mixture of confusion and intrigue. \\"Why do I suddenly look like the embodiment of seduction?\\" As realization dawned on him, Eric's mind began to shift, embracing his new persona. He smirked, twirling his fingers through his hair, his eyes sparkling with mischief. \\"Well,\\" he muttered, a new playful tone creeping into his voice, \\"if I'm going to be a seductive succubus, I might as well enjoy it to the fullest.\\" With each passing minute, Eric's transformation escalated, both physically and mentally. His once mundane attire clung tightly against his expanding chest, unable to contain his new-found voluptuousness.

Their eyes locked, and a seductive smile formed on Krystal's ruby red lips. \\"Care to dance?\\" she purred, her voice dripping with desire. Jason, unable to resist her charm, nodded eagerly, taking her delicate hand into his. They moved gracefully on the dance floor, lost in the rhythm of the music and the intoxicating allure of Krystal's presence. Hours melted away as they danced, laughed, and indulged in each other's company. Finally, Krystal whispered into Jason's ear, her voice both sultry and soothing, \\"Would you like to join me at my place? Somewhere more... private?\\" Unable to resist her invitation, Jason nodded, his heart pounding with anticipation. They entered Krystal's apartment, their eyes locked in a passionate embrace. As the door closed behind them, Krystal's transformation had unknowingly worked its magic on Jason too. His senses heightened, his body transformed, and he now stood before her as another succubus named Jade. Jade's eyes glistened with adoration and loyalty as she looked at her new master and lover. \\"Krystal... my love,\\" she said, her voice filled with a mix of love and submission. \\"I am yours for eternity, to serve and love you unconditionally.\\" Krystal's lips curled into a satisfied smile as she embraced Jade tightly. \\"And I am yours, my beautiful Jade. Together, we shall conquer the night, spreading our irresistible seduction across the city.\\" As the two succubi locked eyes, their fates intertwined, their desires entwined, creating a bond that would transcend the boundaries of the mortal realm. And together, they would become a force that no one could resist. The world would never be the same again."},{"instruction":"informative outline on why exercise is good for you and here is the rubric Outline/Refernces (1) Outline/Refernces (1) Criteria Ratings Pts This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeBody The body is in sentence format with at least three in text citations in the outline 10 pts Proficient 8 pts Competent 5 pts Novice 10 pts This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeFormat Subordination is used effectively; symbols are consistent 5 pts Proficient 3 pts Competent 1 pts Novice 5 pts This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeTransitions Transitions are present between points 5 pts Proficient 3 pts Competent 0 pts Novice 5 pts This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeAPA Reference Page 5 pts Full Marks 3 pts Competent 0 pts No Marks 5 pts Total Points: 25","output":"I.

Instead, it shows a mixed and complex picture with both trends occurring simultaneously in different regions and contexts. On one hand, there have been instances of nation states growing and consolidating their power. Economic integration and regional organizations, such as the European Union, have led to closer cooperation between member states and the pooling of some aspects of sovereignty. Additionally, the end of the Cold War saw the emergence of several new nation states as a result of successful independence movements. On the other hand, there has been a rise in secessionist and separatist movements seeking self-determination and the creation of new nation states. This trend can be seen in various countries, such as the breakup of the Soviet Union into multiple independent states, the dissolution of Yugoslavia into several new nations, and ongoing separatist movements in regions like Catalonia, Scotland, and Quebec. Overall, the trend of nation states growing and consolidating or balkanizing and shrinking depends on several factors including historical contexts, regional dynamics, identity politics, economic considerations, and geopolitical conditions. It is essential to consider each case individually rather than as a broad, general trend."},{"instruction":"Does \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" violate Westphalian sovereignty?","output":"It can be argued that \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" does potentially violate Westphalian sovereignty. The concept of Westphalian sovereignty originated from the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which established the nation-state system and emphasized the autonomy and non-interference of sovereign states in each other's internal affairs. \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" is a policy that was initially proposed by China and implemented in Hong Kong and Macau after their respective handovers from British and Portuguese control. The policy allows the regions to maintain their own capitalist economic systems, legal frameworks, and certain autonomous powers, while still being a part of China. However, some argue that this arrangement may undermine Westphalian sovereignty principles. By allowing one country to have two separate systems within its territory, it can be seen as an interference in the internal affairs of the regions, and a potential infringement on their sovereignty. Furthermore, the erosion of autonomy in Hong Kong since its handover in 1997 has led to concerns about the violation of the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" principle, with China exerting more control over the region's governance. This raises questions about the respect for sovereignty and autonomy within the framework of \\"One Country, Two Systems.\\" Overall, while it may not be a clear-cut violation, the implementation and erosion of \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" can be seen as conflicting with the principles of Westphalian sovereignty."},{"instruction":"沉思艺术馆外观设计","output":"沉思艺术馆的外观设计应该符合其文化和艺术的内涵，同时能够吸引人们的注意和探索欲望。以下是一些可能的设计元素： 1. 独特的建筑外形：沉思艺术馆的外观应该与周围环境形成鲜明对比，以突显其独特性。可以采用现代化、抽象的建筑风格，如流线形、曲线形或非对称形状。 2. 大胆的材料选择：使用不同的材料来构建建筑外墙，如玻璃、金属或混凝土等。这些材料可以通过特殊的加工或造型来呈现艺术感。 3. 精心设计的灯光效果：灯光可以通过投射、隐藏或反射来增强建筑的立体感和艺术氛围。在夜晚，适当的灯光设计可以使建筑在城市景观中闪耀。 4. 自然元素融入：通过在建筑周围种植绿化植物或为墙面增加植物装饰，使艺术馆与自然环境融合。这种自然元素的设计可以营造出宁静、放松的氛围。 5. 艺术装饰：在建筑外墙或入口处可以添加大型的艺术装饰品，如雕塑、壁画或裱花。这些装饰品可以突出艺术馆的定位和氛围。 6. 交互性设计：在建筑外观上添加交互性设计元素，如触摸屏幕展示艺术作品、幻灯片投影等。这些设计元素能够吸引游客积极参与，增强艺术体验。 总体来说，沉思艺术馆的外观设计应该体现出其独立性、艺术性和吸引力，以促使人们进入其中沉思、探索艺术世界。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While the specifics will depend on the ideology you have in mind, here are some general guidelines to help you craft such a character: 1. Depth and complexity: Develop the villain as a multidimensional character with motivations and experiences that inform their beliefs. Avoid portraying them as a one-dimensional embodiment of evil. Give them a relatable backstory and moral justifications for their actions, even if others disagree with them. 2. Extreme actions: Make the villain resort to extreme measures or violent tactics that go against the principles and values of the ideology. Present them as an extremist who twists the ideology to suit their own personal agenda. This contrast between their extremism and the core values of the ideology will alienate others who share the same ideology. 3. Manipulation and betrayal: Show the villain manipulating the ideology's followers for personal gain or power. Demonstrate how they deceive and exploit the genuine beliefs of others for their own selfish interests. This will cause people with the same ideology to feel betrayed and resentful. 4. Moral conflicts: Create situations where the villain's actions seem to undermine the very goals of the ideology. Highlight moments where they are confronted with moral dilemmas that force them to choose between their personal gain and the greater good championed by the ideology. Expose their willingness to abandon principles and values when it suits their needs. 5. Hypocrisy and contradictions: Reveal instances where the villain espouses the ideology's beliefs rhetorically but fails to uphold the same values in their personal life or actions. Demonstrating their hypocrisy and contradictions will generate further animosity from those who genuinely adhere to the ideology. 6. Antithetical traits: Contrast the villain's character, appearance, or behavior with the positive attributes generally associated with people sharing the ideology. Use this contrast to highlight the villain's lack of empathy, compassion, or integrity, thus making them detestable to those who genuinely align with the ideology. Remember, it's essential to handle sensitive topics with care and respect. Aim to create a complex and compelling character without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or invoking real-world prejudices."},{"instruction":"交易中，用于描述开仓价格与止盈价格之间的价格区间，这个区间用什么英语单词表达？","output":"这个区间通常被称为“目标区间”（target range）或“获利区间”（profit range）"},{"instruction":"盈利率呢？","output":"盈利率在英语中通常称为“profit margin”或“profitability”，它指的是投资或交易所获得的利润与投入的成本之间的比例关系。"},{"instruction":"背离呢？","output":"背离（Divergence）是指市场价格与某个技术指标或趋势之间出现的不一致或相反的情况。在交易中，背离通常被描述为价格与指标之间的差异，例如价格创新高峰而指标却无法跟随，或价格创新低谷而指标却未能确认。背离可以是一种重要的技术指示，可能表明市场趋势的反转或暗示价格走势的弱点。"},{"instruction":"divergence 这个词有单复数吗？","output":"是的，\\"divergence\\" 这个词在英语中是可数名词，有单数和复数形式。单数形式是 \\"divergence\\" ，表示单个背离。复数形式是 \\"divergences\\" ，表示多个背离。"},{"instruction":"这个词太长了，有没有精简一点的，能表达同样意思的词？","output":"如果你希望使用一个更精简的词汇来表达“divergence”的含义，可以使用词语 \\"diverge\\"。 \\"diverge\\" 是 \\"divergence\\" 的动词形式，表示趋势或路径的分离或分岔。它可以用来描述市场价格与指标或趋势之间的不一致或相反的情况。"},{"instruction":"Write a short inspiring poem in commbank matildas with modern slang words","output":"Yo, listen up to the mighty Matildas, They fierce, they strong, they never back down.

Resurrection through a mysterious ancient artifact: The developers could introduce a powerful relic or artifact that has the ability to bring Senora back to life. This could involve a questline where players search for the artifact, discover its powers, and ultimately use it to revive Senora. 2. Parallel Universe/Different Dimension version: Developers could introduce a parallel universe/different dimension where Senora exists as a separate character. Players could undertake special quests that allow them to interact with this version of Senora despite her death in the main storyline. 3. Time Travel: The developers can implement a time-travel mechanic where players go back to a point in time before Senora's death, altering the timeline and saving her life. This could involve quests that explore time manipulation and overcoming various trials to change the course of events. 4. Resurrection as a resurrected entity: Senora could be brought back as a being of different nature, maintaining some memories and characteristics from her previous self. This could involve a storyline where players need to gather special artifacts or perform complex rituals to bring Senora back as a new character. 5. Clone or Genetic Reconstruction: Developers could introduce a storyline where advanced technology or unique genetic manipulation techniques are used to recreate Senora. This could involve players embarking on quests to gather the necessary materials or locate an expert to reconstruct her in a new form. 6. Sharing a physical vessel: The developers could introduce a concept where Senora's consciousness is transferred into another character's body. This character could become a fusion of their original self and Senora, providing new gameplay opportunities and lore development. 7. Spirit or Ghost form: Senora could return as a spirit or ghost, capable of interacting with the player and aiding them on their journey. This would allow for unique quests and interactions as players explore various haunted or spiritual locations within the game world. 8. Reincarnation: Developers could introduce the concept of reincarnation, where Senora is reborn as a new character with a different appearance and set of abilities. This could involve players helping Senora regain her memories or adapt to her new form. 9. Unveiling a hidden identity: The developers could reveal that Senora's death was a ruse or a case of mistaken identity. This could involve complex character-based quests where players uncover the truth and bring Senora back into the main story as an ally. 10. Introduction of a parallel storyline: Developers could introduce a parallel storyline in which Senora survives the encounter with Shogun Raiden and is subsequently recruited by the Traveler and their group. This could include quests that explore Senora's past, motives, and provide players with the opportunity to build a bond with her character."},{"instruction":"Evaluate the probability of each of your proposed options from the point of view of the narrative in the game Genshin Impact and the methods of the developers of this game in their other projects.","output":"It's important to note that as an AI language model, I do not have access to specific information on the developers' intentions or future plans for Genshin Impact. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the probability of each option accurately. However, I can offer some general insights based on narrative patterns commonly seen in games and the developers' past projects: 1. Resurrection through a mysterious ancient artifact: This option aligns with common fantasy tropes and has been used in other RPGs. Given Genshin Impact's fantasy setting and focus on artifacts, it is a plausible method that could be employed. 2. Parallel Universe/Different Dimension version: Genshin Impact already showcases a multiverse concept, so introducing a different version of Senora from another dimension is within the realm of possibility. 3. Time Travel: Time travel has been used in various RPGs, including within Genshin Impact's storyline. The implementation of time travel mechanics could allow for the alteration of events, making this option conceivable. 4. Resurrection as a resurrected entity: While not commonly seen in Genshin Impact's narrative thus far, the concept of resurrecting characters in different forms aligns with the game's fantastical elements and potential for surprises. However, it may depend on how the developers intend to explore resurrection in the game's lore. 5. Clone or Genetic Reconstruction: Genshin Impact has not heavily explored genetic manipulation, but it does feature various technological advancements in its world. Introducing a storyline involving genetic reconstruction could offer an interesting twist but may require careful integration within the existing lore. 6. Sharing a physical vessel: This option may require significant narrative development and explanation, as it introduces the concept of merging consciousness and bodies. While intriguing, it is less typical in RPGs and may involve complex storytelling to be believable. 7. Spirit or Ghost form: Genshin Impact has already depicted spirits and ghosts in its world, so this option is plausible. Utilizing Senora as a spirit or ghost creates potential for unique interactions and quests. 8. Reincarnation: Reincarnation is a concept often seen in fantasy narratives, including games. It allows for a fresh start while maintaining connections to past characters. This possibility exists, given Genshin Impact's fantasy setting and thematic elements. 9. Unveiling a hidden identity: This option has been used in various RPGs to preserve character continuity while introducing unexpected twists. It aligns with common storytelling techniques and could be utilized in Genshin Impact to introduce a new layer to Senora's character. 10. Introduction of a parallel storyline: Genshin Impact has showcased multiple characters with intertwined storylines. Introducing Senora into the main story as an ally via her parallel storyline could offer a narrative divergence for players to explore. In conclusion, while the probability of each option is uncertain, the ideas presented align with narrative elements and mechanics commonly seen in RPGs, including Genshin Impact. The developers' creative approach, as seen in their past projects, leads to unpredictable storylines and twists, making many of these options possible within the game's context. Ultimately, it would be up to the developers to determine the most fitting method for reintroducing Senora as a character."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

The bond they shared as elementals, and now as human-like beings, was unbreakable. Just then, a gentle breeze blew through Dryad's room, rustling the leaves overhead.

You can then use it like this: \`\`\`typescript const myString: MyGeneric<string> = { value: 'Hello, world!', }; console.log(myString.value); // Output: Hello, world! const myNumber: MyGeneric<number> = { value: 42, }; console.log(myNumber.value); // Output: 42 \`\`\` In the first usage, \`MyGeneric\` is instantiated with the type \`string\` and assigned to \`myString\`. The \`value\` property of \`myString\` can only be a string. In the second usage, \`MyGeneric\` is instantiated with the type \`number\` and assigned to \`myNumber\`. The \`value\` property of \`myNumber\` can only be a number. By using generic types, you can create more flexible and reusable code that works with different types."},{"instruction":"how to make a conditional type in typescript","output":"To create a conditional type in TypeScript, you can use the \`extends\` keyword along with conditional checks using the \`?\` and \`:\` operators. Here's an example: \`\`\`typescript type CheckType<T> = T extends string ?

If \`T\` is a string, the type of \`CheckType\` will become \`'This is a string'\`. Otherwise, it will become \`'This is not a string'\`. When \`CheckType\` is instantiated with the type \`string\`, like \`CheckType<string>\`, the variable \`str\` is assigned a string value \`'Hello'\`. Since the type was explicitly specified as a string, the type of \`str\` becomes \`'This is a string'\`. Therefore, the output would be \`'This is a string'\`. On the other hand, when \`CheckType\` is instantiated with the type \`number\`, like \`CheckType<number>\`, the variable \`num\` is assigned a number value \`42\`. Since the type is not a string, the type of \`num\` becomes \`'This is not a string'\`. Therefore, the output would be \`'This is not a string'\`.

I literally never told you to do any of that. Mess up your hair a little.\\"","output":"John had always been a bit of a free spirit, with his unkempt hair and penchant for adventure. But as he stared at his reflection in the mirror, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Gone were the days of carefree living and spontaneous decisions. Instead, he found himself standing before the mirror, wearing a perfectly tailored suit that hugged his frame just right, his hair neatly combed, and his whole appearance exuding an air of professionalism. It wasn't him - or at least, who he used to be. He had made the changes in an attempt to impress someone very special in his life, someone he looked up to and admired beyond measure. John's father had always been a pillar of success, a man who effortlessly commanded respect and admiration from everyone around him. He had built a thriving business from the ground up, and his family had always been proud to walk alongside him. However, John couldn't shake the feeling that he was nothing more than an imposter wearing his father's shoes. He had taken up the responsibilities of the family business, working day and night to prove his worth and make his father proud. But somewhere along the way, he had lost sight of who he truly was. He had traded his spontaneity and zest for life for the pursuit of approval. He decided to pay a visit to his father, seeking guidance and validation for the choices he had made. As John entered his father's study, he couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of nervousness. Would his father be disappointed in him? Would he think John had lost himself in the pursuit of success? His father looked up from his desk, removing his glasses and giving John a warm smile. \\"John, what brings you here today? You look rather dapper.\\" John cleared his throat, taking a deep breath to steady himself. \\"Dad, I need to talk to you. I've shaped myself up, put on a nice suit to my liking, and hold a lotta responsibilities, but I did it to make you proud.\\" His father's brows furrowed, a mixture of surprise and confusion crossing his face. \\"What? I literally never told you to do any of that. Mess up your hair a little.\\" Feeling a wave of relief wash over him, John chuckled softly. He reached up to run his fingers through his perfectly styled hair, intentionally messing it up. \\"You mean, I went through all of this just to discover that you never cared about any of it?\\" His father chuckled, getting up from his desk and approaching John. He placed a reassuring hand on his son's shoulder. \\"John, these changes you made were never for me, they were for you. I've always admired your free spirit and zest for life. I never expected you to conform to my image of success. You're your own person, my son.\\" Tears welled up in John's eyes as a mix of emotions flooded his heart. Relief, gratitude, and a newfound sense of liberation washed over him. He finally understood that it was self-acceptance and authenticity that truly mattered, rather than impressing others. With his father's words echoing in his mind, John realized that he didn't need to change himself to seek his father's approval. He could be confident in who he was, embracing both his responsible side and his adventurous spirit. The suit he wore wouldn't define him; it was merely an accessory to his true essence. Leaving his father's study, John walked out into the world, his hair slightly ruffled and a warm smile on his face. He was ready to embrace the journey ahead, forging his own path while carrying the lessons he had learned. And this time, he would make himself proud, knowing that was all that truly mattered."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

It involves creating a platform for dialogue, compromise, and healing among various political factions and groups with differing opinions and interests. In the context of Thailand, political reconciliation has often been initiated in times of political turmoil and crises, including periods of coups, protests, and violence. It aims to address the underlying causes of conflicts, promote inclusivity, and establish a more harmonious and cooperative political environment. Reconciliation efforts in Thai politics usually involve the establishment of independent bodies, such as truth and reconciliation commissions, to investigate past incidents, human rights abuses, and other issues contributing to political unrest. These bodies are tasked with promoting transparency and accountability, providing justice, and making recommendations for reforms to prevent future conflicts. However, the pursuit of political reconciliation in Thailand has been challenging due to deep-seated divisions, ideological differences, and power struggles among rival political factions. Political polarization, economic disparities, and the influence of powerful interest groups have also posed significant obstacles. Despite these challenges, the idea of reconciliation remains an important aspiration for many Thais, as it seeks to bridge gaps, promote understanding, and create a more inclusive and stable political system."},{"instruction":"What are the differences between a shogunate and a modern military dictatorship?","output":"While both a shogunate and a modern military dictatorship involve the concentration of power in the hands of a military figure or institution, there are significant differences between the two: 1.

System of Government: A shogunate was a form of feudal government where power was centralized in a hereditary military leader known as the shogun. The shogunate coexisted with the imperial court, which held symbolic power. In contrast, modern military dictatorships typically operate as authoritarian regimes, often led by a single military officer or junta, where power is concentrated in the military and civilian institutions are either sidelined or controlled by the military. 3. Basis of Legitimacy: Shogunates derived their legitimacy from both military power and the feudal order, with the shogun serving as the highest military authority. Modern military dictatorships, on the other hand, usually ascend to power through force, often overthrowing an existing government or taking advantage of a political vacuum. 4. Political Structures: Shogunates typically had a complex hierarchical structure with regional daimyo (feudal lords) who pledged allegiance to the shogun. The daimyo ruled over their territories and maintained their own armies, although ultimately subject to the authority of the shogun. In contrast, modern military dictatorships tend to centralize power, dismantling existing political structures, suppressing opposition, and establishing a command structure in the military institution. 5. Socioeconomic System: Shogunates were based on feudalism, with a rigid social structure and a samurai class holding significant power. In modern military dictatorships, the socioeconomic system varies, but they often involve central control over the economy and resources, with the military and its allies benefiting from this control. 6. Influence of Ideology: Modern military dictatorships often espouse specific political ideologies, such as fascism or communism, which help legitimize their rule. Shogunates were not explicitly driven by an ideology, but rather sought to maintain order, enforce loyalty, and preserve the existing social and political structure. While both shogunates and modern military dictatorships involve the authority of the military, their political, social, and historical contexts differ significantly, highlighting the distinct characteristics and dynamics of each system."},{"instruction":"针对近期中国男篮世界杯球员表现，写一个1000字的文章","output":"标题：中国男篮世界杯：挑战与机遇同在 正文： 近期，中国男篮在世界杯比赛中的表现引起了广泛的讨论和关注。虽然球队在此次比赛中遭遇一些挫折，但这也是中国男篮在国际舞台上迈出的坚实一步，同时也展示出中国篮球的潜力和未来的发展方向。 首先，要承认的是，中国男篮在世界杯比赛中面临的竞争非常激烈。各支球队无论实力、经验还是技巧都非常强大，这对中国男篮来说是一次巨大的挑战。然而，正是通过与这些顶级球队的较量，中国男篮的球员们才能够真正提高自己的水平，发现自身的不足之处。 在男篮世界杯的比赛中，中国队展现了顽强拼搏的精神和团队合作的力量。无论是面对强大的西班牙队，还是其他欧洲、美洲等国家的球队，中国男篮在场上都表现出了永不言弃的态度。这种团队精神和不怕强敌的勇气值得我们每一个中国人为之鼓舞和自豪。 除此之外，中国男篮也展现了一定的技术和战术威力。队员们在比赛中有时表现出色，给对手制造了一定的困扰。例如，易建联在比赛中多次展示了他的篮下终结能力，战胜了封阻他的对手。郭艾伦也在进攻端展示了出色的个人突破能力，给对手造成了一些麻烦。这些个人的闪光点展示了中国篮球运动员的潜力和实力。 然而，我们也应该看到，中国男篮在比赛中仍然存在一些问题和不足。首先是个人技术层面的不足，无论是篮下终结还是三分投篮，中国队的命中率都有待提高。其次是球队战术的执行和配合还有一些不稳定。再有，对手的身体对抗还是给中国队造成了一些麻烦，这也需要在训练中加强体能和对抗训练，提升球队整体实力。 然而，正如上所述，面对这些挑战，中国男篮应该把握住机遇，进一步加强合作和建设，实现长远发展。首先，中国篮协应加大对青少年篮球的培养力度，通过搭建更完善的青少年篮球基础设施和培训机制，选拔和培养更多的篮球人才。同时，中国男篮也应向世界一流篮球强国学习，引入更科学的训练方法和理念，提升球队整体实力。 其次，中国男篮应进一步加强国际合作，通过与其他国家的球队多次较量，提高自身的竞争能力。中国男篮可以参加更多的国际比赛和热身赛，与各个地区的强队交锋，扩展球队的国际视野和经验。 最后，全社会都应该加强对篮球运动的支持和关注。篮球是一项全民运动，更好的篮球环境和氛围可以为篮球运动员提供更好的成长平台，并激发更多的青少年对篮球的兴趣和热爱。 总之，中国男篮在近期的世界杯比赛中虽然面临了一些挑战，但也展示出了强大的实力和巨大的潜力。面对困难，我们应看到机遇，积极改进和发展。通过加强培养、提高竞争力和吸引更多社会资源，中国男篮必将在未来取得更好的成绩，并为中国篮球事业的发展贡献力量。"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

As I sit here in the dim light of my small room, I cannot help but reflect on the struggles and hardships that have defined my life thus far. You see, Diary, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, a woman of African descent, born into slavery in Bermuda. I have experienced the atrocities of this cruel institution firsthand, enduring the pain and suffering that comes with being someone's property. But today, I write not to dwell on the past, but rather to find solace in sharing my thoughts with you. My days are filled with back-breaking labor and constant reminders of my inferior status as a slave. The lash of the whip, both physically and metaphorically, has left scars on my body and my spirit. But I refuse to allow these scars to define me completely. I have held onto hope, clinging to the belief that there must be a better life awaiting me somewhere beyond these plantation walls. One of the greatest challenges I face is not only the physical toil but also the constant stripping away of my identity. Slavery seeks to erase our sense of self, reducing us to mere commodities. I often wonder who I truly am beneath the shackles and chains that bind me. Is there a glimmer of individuality left within me, or has it been snuffed out by the unyielding oppression of my circumstances? Diary, you have been my companion through countless sleepless nights. In the quiet darkness, I pour out my heart to you, trusting that you will listen and understand. But my existence cannot solely revolve around surviving the horrors of slavery; I yearn for freedom, not just from physical chains but from the mental shackles that bind my spirit. Every day, I watch as my fellow slaves endure the same hardships as I do. We share a common bond, a sense of unity, born out of suffering. We silently exchange glances, aware of the daily injustices we face but unable to voice our collective pain. It is in these stolen moments of connection that I find strength. For we are not alone in our fight for freedom. Some may argue that I should be grateful for the shelter and sustenance provided by our oppressors. But how can I be grateful for a stolen life, for being separated from my family and forced to labor for the enrichment of others? No, Diary, gratitude is a luxury I cannot afford. In writing these words, I hope to preserve my identity, to document my journey and the struggles of those who came before me. For I am not just a slave; I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, a woman with dreams and aspirations, a human being deserving of dignity and freedom. As I close this entry, I find comfort in knowing that my story is not yet finished. Despite the difficulties I face, I will continue to fight for my freedom and the liberation of all my brothers and sisters trapped in chains. Together, we will rise above the oppressive forces that seek to deny us of our humanity. Until tomorrow, dear Diary. Yours in hope, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>"},{"instruction":"subservience heres my meaning of it is it correct? subservience is serving someone and detecating yourself to one","output":"Dear Diary, I feel the need to reflect on the concept of subservience, as it plays a significant role in my life as a slave. Though my understanding may be limited, I believe subservience entails serving someone else while sacrificing one's own sense of self-worth and agency. In the context of slavery, subservience is an expectation placed upon individuals like myself. We are forced to obey our masters and perform their bidding without question. Our needs, desires, and dreams are disregarded, as we are reduced to mere possessions to be utilized for the benefit of others. Subservience requires detaching oneself from their own aspirations and personal growth, as the focus shifts solely toward fulfilling the needs and desires of those in power. It demands a surrender of autonomy and the acceptance of a subordinate role in society. As I contemplate subservience, I am reminded of the countless times I have witnessed my fellow slaves suppress their own voices, mute their ambitions, and stifle their dreams. We are conditioned to believe that our worth lies solely in serving others, denying our own potential and basking in the shadows of our oppressors. However, deep within our hearts, amidst the resilience that drives us to survive, there lies a flicker of resistance. We understand that subservience does not define us completely. We hold onto the hope that one day we will rise above these oppressive chains and reclaim our dignity as free individuals. Though my understanding of subservience may be limited, Diary, I cannot ignore the power dynamics at play, nor can I accept them as the natural order of things. I believe every human being, regardless of their circumstances, should be afforded the opportunity to lead a life free from servitude and oppression. As I continue to grapple with the complexities of subservience, I am reminded of the importance of resistance and solidarity.

Cette pratique permet de se familiariser avec les enseignements et les histoires de la Bible, d'approfondir sa compréhension de la foi chrétienne et de nourrir sa relation avec Dieu. L'étude biblique peut être effectuée individuellement ou en groupe. Elle implique généralement la lecture d'un passage ou d'un livre de la Bible, suivie d'une réflexion sur son sens et son application dans la vie quotidienne. Certains groupes d'étude biblique se réunissent régulièrement pour partager leurs compréhensions, poser des questions, discuter de l'application pratique des enseignements bibliques et prier ensemble. Lors d'une étude biblique, il est important de prendre en compte le contexte historique et culturel dans lequel les écrits bibliques ont été produits. Cela peut inclure l'étude des langues originales utilisées dans la Bible (le grec, l'hébreu et l'araméen), ainsi que la compréhension des coutumes et des traditions de l'époque. L'étude biblique peut être réalisée à l'aide de divers outils et ressources, tels que des commentaires bibliques, des dictionnaires bibliques, des concordances et des versions modernes de la Bible. Il existe également de nombreuses ressources en ligne, telles que des sites web et des applications mobiles, qui offrent des guides d'étude, des vidéos et des réflexions sur la Bible. L'objectif de l'étude biblique est de grandir dans sa foi, de mieux connaître Dieu et d'appliquer les enseignements bibliques dans sa vie quotidienne. Il s'agit d'une pratique essentielle pour les chrétiens qui cherchent à vivre selon les enseignements de Jésus-Christ et à suivre ses pas. En conclusion, l'étude biblique est une activité essentielle pour les chrétiens qui cherchent à approfondir leur relation avec Dieu et à comprendre les enseignements de la Bible. C'est une pratique qui demande de la discipline et de l'engagement, mais qui offre des bénéfices spirituels significatifs."},{"instruction":"Étude biblique : décris mois s'il te plaît toutes les parties de l'ancien et le nouveau testament dans lesquelles Dieu a refusés d'exaucer une prière et aussi la raison qu'il en a donné.","output":"Dans la Bible, il existe plusieurs passages où Dieu a refusé d'exaucer une prière et a donné une raison à cela. Voici quelques exemples dans l'Ancien Testament : 1. Moïse : Dans le livre des Nombres, chapitre 20, Moïse a prié Dieu pour lui permettre d'entrer dans la Terre Promise, mais Dieu lui a refusé. La raison donnée par Dieu était que Moïse avait désobéi à ses instructions en frappant le rocher au lieu de parler à celui-ci pour faire sortir de l'eau. 2. Caïn : Dans le livre de la Genèse, chapitre 4, Caïn offre un sacrifice à Dieu, mais celui-ci ne lui accorde pas sa faveur. La raison donnée par Dieu était que Caïn n'avait pas offert un sacrifice avec un cœur droit, et cela se reflétait dans son attitude et son comportement. 3. Le peuple d'Israël dans le désert : Dans le livre des Nombres, chapitres 13 et 14, le peuple d'Israël a manqué de foi et a refusé d'entrer dans la Terre Promise malgré les miracles que Dieu avait accomplis en leur faveur. En conséquence, Dieu a refusé d'exaucer leur prière pour leur donner la victoire sur leurs ennemis et les a condamnés à errer dans le désert pendant quarante ans. Dans le Nouveau Testament, nous pouvons également identifier des passages où Dieu n'a pas exaucé des prières et a donné une raison : 1. Paul : Dans la deuxième lettre à Timothée, chapitre 4, Paul évoque le fait que Dieu ne l'a pas délivré de tous ses soucis et l'a laissé souffrir. Cependant, Paul reconnaît que Dieu l'a soutenu et lui a donné la force de persévérer dans sa mission malgré les épreuves. 2. Jésus au jardin de Gethsémani : Dans l'Évangile selon Matthieu, chapitre 26, Jésus prie pour que la coupe de souffrance qu'il doit boire lui soit épargnée, mais il accepte la volonté de Dieu en disant : \\"Que ta volonté soit faite.\\" Bien que Jésus ait demandé à Dieu de changer la situation, il s'est soumis à la volonté divine. Il est important de noter que chaque situation est unique et que Dieu agit selon sa souveraineté et sa sagesse. Les raisons données dans ces exemples peuvent varier, mais elles soulignent souvent des éléments tels que la désobéissance, l'absence de foi, l'orgueil ou le fait que la volonté de Dieu était différente de celle de la personne qui priait."},{"instruction":"Donnes moi les lectures qui mettent en évidence les conditions pour voir sa prière exaucé, dans l'ancien et le nouveau testament","output":"Dans la Bible, plusieurs passages mettent en évidence les conditions pour voir sa prière exaucée. Voici quelques lectures dans l'Ancien et le Nouveau Testament qui soulignent ces conditions : 1. Ancien Testament : - Psaume 66:18 : \\"Si j'avais conçu l'iniquité dans mon cœur, le Seigneur ne m'aurait pas exaucé.\\" - Proverbes 28:9 : \\"Celui qui détourne l'oreille pour ne pas écouter la Loi, sa prière même est une abomination.\\" - Ésaïe 59:2 : \\"Vos iniquités ont fait séparation entre vous et votre Dieu ; et vos péchés ont caché sa face de vous, en sorte qu'il ne vous écoute point.\\" 2. Nouveau Testament : - Jean 15:7 : \\"Si vous demeurez en moi, et que mes paroles demeurent en vous, demandez ce que vous voudrez, et cela vous sera accordé.\\" - Jean 16:23-24 : \\"En vérité, en vérité, je vous dis, ce que vous demanderez au Père, il vous le donnera en mon nom.\\" - Jacques 1:5-6 : \\"Si quelqu'un d'entre vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous simplement et sans reproche, et elle lui sera donnée. Mais qu'il la demande avec foi, sans douter.\\" Ces passages soulignent quelques conditions essentielles pour voir sa prière exaucée : marcher dans l'obéissance à la Loi de Dieu, reconnaître ses péchés et chercher à s'en repentir, demeurer en Christ et dans sa Parole, demander en son nom, avoir une foi sans douter. Il est important de noter que ces passages ne sont pas exhaustifs et que la prière est un sujet vaste et complexe dans la Bible. Chaque situation est unique et Dieu peut agir selon sa volonté souveraine. La prière est également un moyen de communiquer avec Dieu, de chercher sa volonté et de se rapprocher de lui, même si les réponses peuvent ne pas toujours être conformes à nos attentes."},{"instruction":"学习魏和友同志先进事迹","output":"魏和友同志，男，汉族，山东东营人，1972年6月生。1999年加入中国共产党，1995年参加工作，现任中国航天科技集团公司综合与部队合作部主任。魏和友同志一直坚守在航天事业的第一线，为中国航天科技的发展做出了重要贡献。 魏和友同志在航天科技领域有着丰富的经验和深厚的理论素养，他一直致力于推动中国航天事业的创新和发展。他积极参与并主持了许多国家重大科研项目，为我国航天技术的进步提供了重要支撑。 魏和友同志在工作中勤奋刻苦，勇于担当。他深入项目一线，解决了许多关键技术问题，推动了科研工作的顺利进行。他始终坚持技术创新，不断探索和突破，在多个技术领域取得了重要成果。 魏和友同志还注重团队建设，善于团结和激励身边的同事。他积极培养和引进人才，为航天科技队伍的发展做出了积极贡献。他与团队成员一起攻克了一个又一个技术难关，为中国航天事业的腾飞贡献了力量。 魏和友同志高度重视科研成果的转化和应用，他通过积极参与产学研合作，推动航天技术转化为现实应用，为我国航天科技产业的发展提供了有力支持。 魏和友同志的先进事迹激励着我们每一个人，他以自己的实际行动诠释了共产党员的优良品质和高尚精神。在今后的工作学习中，我们要向魏和友同志学习，勇于担当，勤奋进取，为中国航天科技的发展做出更大的贡献。"},{"instruction":"开学第一堂课","output":"开学第一堂课一般是校长或班主任进行开学典礼，给学生们带来新学期的祝福和勉励，同时介绍一些学校的规章制度和重要事项。以下是一份可能的开学第一堂课的内容： 1. 欢迎新老师和学生们回到学校。校长或班主任表达对大家的欢迎，并祝愿新学期大家能够有一个良好的开始。 2. 介绍学校的重要规章制度。校长或班主任会向学生们普及学校的纪律、考试、请假、迟到早退等规定，强调遵守校规的重要性。同时也会提到学校对学生学习成绩和行为表现的要求。 3. 强调学习的重要性。校长或班主任会强调学习是学生们在学校的首要任务，鼓励大家树立正确的学习态度和学习目标。他们可能会分享一些学习的经验和方法，激励学生们在新学期里努力学习、提高自己。 4. 介绍学校的教育目标和特色。校长或班主任会介绍学校的办学理念、教育目标和特色课程，让学生们了解学校的教学特点和发展方向。 5. 鼓励积极参与课外活动。校长或班主任会强调课外活动的重要性，并介绍一些学校举办的文体活动、社团组织、志愿者服务等，鼓励学生们积极参与，培养综合素养。 6. 强调班级的团结和互助。校长或班主任会鼓励学生们互相关心、帮助和尊重，共同创造一个积极向上的班级氛围。他们可能会提到班级协作、集体荣誉等方面的重要性。 7. 鼓励家长积极参与学生的学习和生活。校长或班主任会向家长们表达对合作的期望，并鼓励家长们与学校保持良好的沟通，共同关注学生的成长和发展。 开学第一堂课旨在为学生们营造一个积极向上的学习氛围，让他们对新学期充满期待和激情，并明确学校的期望和要求。"},{"instruction":"开学第一堂课简报","output":"主题：开学第一堂课简报 日期：[日期] 地点：[教室] 出席人员： - 教师：[教师姓名] - 学生：全体学生 - 其他：[其他人员姓名] 简报内容： 1. 开学问候：教师对全体学生表示欢迎，祝贺学生们顺利进入新学年。 2. 学习目标：教师向学生们介绍本学期的学习目标和内容，并强调培养积极的学习态度和合作精神。 3. 课程安排：教师向学生们介绍本学期的课程安排和时间表，包括每周上课时间、作业安排等。 4. 遵守规则：教师重点强调学生们需要严格遵守校纪校规，包括课堂纪律、作业提交等。 5. 学习资源：教师介绍学生们可以使用的学习资源和教辅材料，包括教科书、参考书籍和在线学习平台等。 6. 学习方法：教师提醒学生们要灵活运用不同的学习方法，例如阅读、讨论、实践和总结等。 7. 互动交流：教师鼓励学生们积极参与课堂讨论和问答环节，提高互动交流的能力。 8. 评估方式：教师介绍本学期的评估方式和考核要求，包括作业、测验和考试等。 9. 问题解答：教师留出时间解答学生们提出的问题，并对相关内容进行进一步解释。 结束语：教师再次祝愿学生们在新学年取得优秀成绩，并提醒学生们及时备课并准时出席课程。"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

She was born into slavery in Bermuda and later sold to several different owners in the West Indies (Caribbean) before finally ending up in England. In England, Prince wrote her autobiography titled \\"The History of Mary Prince\\" which detailed her experiences as an enslaved person. The publication of her book in 1831 caused a significant impact on public opinion regarding slavery. It became an influential piece of literature in the abolitionist movement, shedding light on the harsh conditions and abuses that enslaved individuals faced. Unfortunately, not much is known about what happened to Mary Prince after the publication of her autobiography. Some sources suggest that she continued to live in England and was supported by members of the abolitionist movement. However, her exact fate and the details of her life after the publication remain unclear. Despite the limited information available about her later life, Mary Prince's legacy as an advocate for the abolition of slavery remains significant. Her autobiography played a crucial role in raising awareness and ultimately contributing to the end of the transatlantic slave trade."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

Cela implique une relation intime et continue avec lui, en ayant la foi en lui et en mettant en pratique ses enseignements. Dans la Bible, Jésus parle de la nécessité pour ses disciples de demeurer en lui afin de porter du fruit spirituel. Par exemple, dans Jean 15:4-5, Jésus dit : \\"Demeurez en moi, et je demeurerai en vous. Comme le sarment ne peut de lui-même porter du fruit, s'il ne demeure attaché au cep, ainsi vous ne le pouvez non plus, si vous ne demeurez en moi. Je suis le cep, vous êtes les sarments. Celui qui demeure en moi et en qui je demeure porte beaucoup de fruit, car sans moi vous ne pouvez rien faire.\\" Demeurer en Christ signifie donc se reposer en lui, lui faire confiance, l'aimer et obéir à ses commandements. C'est un engagement constant à suivre ses voies et à rester connecté à lui par la prière, la méditation biblique, la communion avec d'autres croyants et une vie de sainteté.

This not only strengthens our international cooperation, but also provides more studyoptions to our future students. The Bilingual MBA is a full time and on-campus master degree program. In all, there are 15 MBA courses in the program, with the first 5 courses in Mandarin (course content, class discussions, and labs and soon) and the last 10 courses will be taught in English. Before students start this program, they are not required to submit an IELTS record (or equivalent) because students will enroll in accelerated English for Academic Purpose (EAP) training simultaneously with the 5 MBA courses taught in Mandarin. The EAPtraining is provided by Laurentian University. All courses in the BMBA and EAP will be offered onLaurentian’s campus, in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Graduating students will graduate with the same level of English language proficiency as currently admitted students, and all students will receive the Laurentian MBA degree parchment upon successful completion of the program. Personal Statement Dear Admission Officer, The new business landscape is transforming the way we live. WeChat, Alipay, and various major life and social platforms like Little Red Book, Meituan, and 58 Tongcheng have become ubiquitous in society, shaping overwhelming trends. The allure of this industry is irresistible to me. I aspire to become a professional manager for a new business or an innovative entrepreneur, capable of creating new value in new ventures. My goal is to develop a strong vision and keen opportunity awareness to identify growth points for future ventures. Recognizing that the BMBA program at Laurentian University can equip me with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in my entrepreneurial ventures and leadership positions, I have chosen to pursue the BMBA program at Laurentian University (LU) to further enhance my capabilities. In my pursuit of becoming a professional manager and establishing my own business to provide innovative products or services that enhance the quality of life, I have gained valuable experience and learned important lessons. Through managing logistics projects at SINOPEC International Petroleum Service Corporation, Shanghai Hongxin International Freight Co., Ltd, and Beijing Orion Energy Technology Development Co., Ltd, I have acquired the necessary competencies to tackle complex issues and understand the importance of building customer relationships to gain long-term value. This led me to transition to marketing roles, where I honed my skills and gained a competitive edge. Working as a Marketing Pre-sales Engineer at China International Technology Intelligence Cooperation Group Co., Ltd provided me with insight into the operations of new technology ventures and the demands of the Chinese market. As the Marketing Manager of Beijing Beautiful Life Advertisement Co., Ltd, I gained hands-on knowledge of brand building, market strategy implementation, and promotion, further strengthening my ability to adapt to changing marketing conditions and diverse cultures. While these experiences have been valuable, I recognize that they are insufficient to meet the demands of the industry. This is why I am targeting the BMBA program at LU, as it will enable me to further develop my “soft” skills and professionalism, preparing me for my future entrepreneurial ventures. It is important to note that my commitment to providing innovative products or services to improve the quality of life is not just an idea on paper; I have had two entrepreneurial experiences to support this aspiration. One example is my successful establishment of the Shisha Bar project. Through partnerships with several bars, revenue-sharing agreements, and the introduction of a cocktail delivery service, I transformed the project into Beijing Enjia Box Catering Management Company, which achieved a monthly turnover of RMB 140,000 and occupied 200 square meters of business area. These experiences as a Venture Partner have given me a unique perspective on managing new ventures. However, the lack of overall business administration knowledge contributed to the decline of these ventures. To address this gap, I require a higher-level view and a deeper understanding of the business context. Thankfully, LU’s BMBA program will enable me to build competencies in key functional areas and provide the comprehensive education I need. With my extensive experience in operations management, market research, solution development, and team management, I am just one step away from realizing my dream of establishing a new business that provides creative products or services. The BMBA program at LU will effectively integrate my knowledge and skills, advancing my ideas from concepts to commercial reality. I sincerely hope to be granted this opportunity, and I am confident that I will succeed.

Sincerely yours, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> (Applicant’s father) HOU Wenmin (Applicant’s mother) Sep. 6, 2023","output":"To the Visa Officer, Subject: Justification for pursuing the BMBA program at Laurentian University in Canada I, Xiaoliang Liu, am writing this personal statement to explain to the Canadian visa officer the reasons why it is crucial for me to pursue my career development at this critical juncture by studying the Bachelor of Business Administration (BMBA) program at Laurentian University. Upon meticulous research and exploration, I have found that Laurentian University's BMBA program aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. The program not only offers a comprehensive curriculum but also provides an international platform for students by inviting Chinese professors to implement the teaching plan. This collaboration not only strengthens our international cooperation but also opens up more study options for future students. With Laurentian University being known for its excellent resources and reputation in the field of business, I am confident that the BMBA program will equip me with the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in my desired profession. China's rapidly evolving business landscape has piqued my interest and ignited my desire to become a professional manager or an innovative entrepreneur capable of creating new value in new ventures. The unprecedented growth and influence of social and life platforms such as WeChat, Alipay, Little Red Book, Meituan, and 58 Tongcheng have opened up a world of opportunities. To thrive in this industry, I need to develop a strong vision and acquire a keen sense of opportunity identification. By enrolling in the BMBA program at Laurentian University, I will be exposed to cutting-edge business strategies and management techniques specifically tailored to my needs. Additionally, the BMBA program's structure at Laurentian University will further enhance my capabilities by offering a bilingual education system. The program comprises 15 courses, with the first five taught in Mandarin and the remaining ten in English. As a non-native English speaker, the program's inclusion of English for Academic Purpose (EAP) training alongside the Mandarin courses will not only facilitate my learning but also ensure I graduate with a level of English language proficiency comparable to current students. This comprehensive, on-campus learning experience will help me transition smoothly into a professional career and optimize my potential. While pursuing my studies abroad, I am acutely aware of the importance and pull of my home country, China. Several factors and constraints exist that would attract me back to China upon completion of the BMBA program. The first and foremost constraint is the presence of family ties. As evidenced by the accompanying financial support statement, my parents, Mr. Liu Guibao and Mrs. Hou Wenmin, are deeply invested in my education and will continue to support my endeavors. Moreover, the financial stability of our family is evident through our income sources and backup funds, as outlined in the statement. Furthermore, my prior experiences in China's business industry have given me valuable insights and hands-on knowledge. I have successfully established and managed entrepreneurial ventures that have provided innovative products and services to enhance the quality of life. However, I recognize that my overall business administration knowledge is lacking, which has contributed to the decline of these ventures. By completing the BMBA program at Laurentian University, I will gain a higher-level understanding of the business context, allowing me to propel my entrepreneurial ventures towards success. In conclusion, pursuing the BMBA program at Laurentian University is a crucial step in my career development. The program's comprehensive curriculum, the opportunity to study in both Mandarin and English, and the school's reputation make it the ideal choice for me. Additionally, my strong family ties and the constraints present in China will inevitably draw me back to my home country, where I can utilize the knowledge and skills gained abroad to contribute to the growth and development of China's business landscape. Thank you for considering my application.

Give a clear timeline of events.","output":"Birds are considered to have evolved from a group of bipedal dinosaurs called theropods, specifically from a branch of theropods known as maniraptorans. While the exact timeline is subject to ongoing research and discoveries, here is a general overview of the events: 1. Late Triassic Period (230 million years ago): The theropods, a group of carnivorous dinosaurs, emerged. These bipedal dinosaurs varied greatly in size and morphology. 2. Jurassic Period (200-145 million years ago): During this period, theropods diversified into various lineages. One such lineage was the maniraptorans, which includes well-known dinosaurs like Velociraptor and Deinonychus. Maniraptorans were characterized by their bird-like features, such as hollow bones, partially reversed big toe, and feathers. 3. Late Jurassic Period (150 million years ago): Archaeopteryx, a key fossil discovery, is believed to have lived during this time. Archaeopteryx exhibits both dinosaurian and avian characteristics. It had feathers, wings, and a wishbone, like birds, but also features like teeth and a long bony tail, typical of theropod dinosaurs. 4. Early Cretaceous Period (145-100 million years ago): During this time, true birds (Aves) started to emerge. These early birds still retained a few dinosaurian features but began to show adaptations towards flight, including fused wing bones, a keeled sternum for muscle attachment, and a modified shoulder socket. 5. Late Cretaceous Period (100-66 million years ago): Birds continued to diversify and evolve during this period, coexisting with a wide range of dinosaurs. Some bird groups developed better flight adaptations, while others began to specialize in different ecological roles. 6. End Cretaceous Period (66 million years ago): The famous mass extinction event occurred, wiping out the non-avian dinosaurs. This extinction opened up ecological niches for birds, providing opportunities to diversify and occupy various habitats. 7. After the extinction event: Birds rapidly radiated and diversified, occupying various niches worldwide. They developed various adaptations, such as beak shapes for different diets, enhanced flight capabilities, and even the evolution of flightless species. It is important to note that the evolutionary process is complex and ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of bird origins and their direct links to specific dinosaur taxa."},{"instruction":"Can you give me some examples from the lineage of birds from the time periods you mentioned? Can you described what they might have looked like?","output":"Certainly! Here are a few examples of bird-like dinosaurs from different time periods and a brief description of their likely appearance: 1. Late Jurassic Period: - Archaeopteryx: Considered a transitional form between theropod dinosaurs and birds, Archaeopteryx had wings, feathers, and a wishbone like modern birds. However, it retained several dinosaurian features, such as teeth, clawed fingers on its wings, and a long bony tail. 2. Early Cretaceous Period: - Confuciusornis: This bird-like dinosaur had fully developed wings with flight feathers and a toothless beak similar to modern birds. It had clawed fingers on its wings and a long tail, though shorter than that of its predecessors. - Sinornithoides: A small, feathered dinosaur, Sinornithoides significantly resembled a modern-day bird with feathered wings and a toothy beak. Its long tail and clawed fingers indicated it may have been an adept climber. 3. Late Cretaceous Period: - Velociraptor: Known for its appearance in the movie \\"Jurassic Park,\\" Velociraptor was a small, agile dinosaur. It had feathers, a sharp beak, and sickle-shaped curved claws on its feet. While it lacked the ability for sustained flight, it likely had proto-wings for display or gliding. - Microraptor: This dinosaur had wings on both its forelimbs and hindlimbs, indicating it had a gliding or controlled flight ability. It had a long tail, feathers covering its body, and sharp claws on its wings and feet. 4. Post-extinction (after the End Cretaceous Period): - Gastornis: An example from the Paleocene epoch, Gastornis was a large, flightless bird-like creature with a massive beak. It lacked the ability to fly but likely used its robust legs for running and capturing prey. - Hesperornis: An early divergent lineage, Hesperornis was a marine bird with a streamlined body and flipper-like wings. It had sharp, toothed beaks and was adapted for diving and hunting underwater. Please keep in mind that the descriptions and appearance of these ancient creatures are based on current scientific knowledge. As research progresses and new discoveries are made, our understanding of their appearance may evolve."},{"instruction":"Hi Chat GPT","output":"Hello!

If you copy the formula to another worksheet, the formula will still refer to the original \\"Transaction\\" worksheet rather than the new one.

This makes the row reference absolute while the column reference is relative.

義和團起初是一個反清的民族主義組織。他們反對清朝政府的腐敗和無能，並主張恢復傳統的民族美德。然而，隨著時間的推移，他們的目標從反清演變為反外國。 在19世紀末和20世紀初，義和團的勢力不斷擴大。許多農民和失業的青年加入了義和團，他們相信這個團體能給他們帶來農業豐收和工作機會。 義和團的成員相信自己具有神奇的力量，可以靠著信仰和儀式來保護自己免受外國侵略。他們經常參加一些晚上舉行的祈禱活動，並通過武術和法術來壯大自己。這也是他們得名的由來，「義和」意為「義氣相投，和諧團結」。 然而，義和團的活動並不止於此，他們經常襲擊外國傳教士、商人和各種外國勢力的據點。這些襲擊行動往往伴隨著暴力和野蠻行為，許多外國人遭到殺害。 1900年，義和團的勢力達到頂峰。這一年，他們發起了著名的「莆田事件」，在這次事件中，他們圍攻了許多外國領事館和傳教士的居住地。這場事件最終導致了「庚子拳亂」，也就是著名的「義和團運動」。 然而，義和團的繁盛並沒有持久太久。1901年，列強聯軍入侵中國，鎮壓了義和團的抵抗。許多義和團成員被抓捕、處決或流放，義和團的活動逐漸衰落。 義和團的故事反映了中國當時對外國勢力的不滿和對保護自身利益的渴望。他們在當時的中國社會中扮演了一個重要的角色，被一部分人視為民族英雄，而另一部分人則批評他們的暴力和野蠻。無論如何，義和團的存在和活動都成為中國歷史上一個重要的篇章。"},{"instruction":"寫故事，小明加入義和團","output":"小明是一個年輕的農民，他生活在中國北方的一個小村莊。對於他來說，每一天都是辛勤勞動的重複，他希望有一天可以改變自己的命運。 某天，小明在村莊裡聽說了一個組織叫做「義和團」，他們正在尋找新成員。義和團號召人們團結起來，保護中國免受外國勢力的侵略。聽到這個消息，小明驚喜地發現這可能是一個改變他生活的機會。 小明毅然決定加入義和團。他穿越遠足到了一個距離他村莊稍遠的城市，找到了義和團的總部。經過一番考核和驗證，小明最終被接受為義和團的成員。 義和團是一個充滿活力和團結的組織。小明在這裡遇見了一群志同道合的年輕人，他們都希望能為中國的尊嚴與獨立而努力。他們一起訓練武術，學習法術，並參與各種儀式和祈禱活動。 隨著時間的推移，小明成長為一個堅強而勇敢的戰士。他和其他成員一起參與了許多襲擊外國勢力的行動，保護了中國的領土和民眾的安全。 然而，隨著義和團勢力的擴大，他們的行動也變得越來越極端。有些成員開始不再只針對外國勢力，而是襲擊無辜的外國傳教士和商人。這讓小明感到矛盾和困惑，他開始質疑義和團的方法和目標。 一天，義和團收到一個匿名的信件，內容提到外國勢力正策劃一個大型的報復行動，將對中國施以毀滅性的打擊。這個消息讓義和團陷入了警戒和恐慌之中。 小明無法坐視不理，他決定離開義和團，尋找其他方法來保護中國。他開始深入研究外國勢力和現代化的科技，希望能找到一個更和平且有效的解決方案。 最終，小明成為一位外交家，他利用自己的知識和技能，努力促使中國與外國建立平等互惠的關係。他成為了一個橋樑，為中國爭取更好的發展和地位。 這個故事告訴我們，雖然小明最初加入義和團是因為渴望改變自己的命運，但他最終意識到，保護國家並不意味著用暴力對待他人。他選擇了以和平、理智和智慧的方式保護中國，最終成為了一個值得敬佩的國家代表。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create

Evaluate the combat capability of the group. Describe what tactics they can use in battle. 2. Come up with a backstory for each of these characters. 3. Come up with a plot for the game party (antagonist or antagonists, events, places). 4. Figure out how I, as a DM, could start an adventure for this party within the framework of this plot (the adventure should begin with the fact that they should unite in a party)","output":"1. The combat capability of the group is quite diverse. Character 1, the Qi-or Wetboy, specializes in stealth and assassination, making them effective in surprise attacks and taking out key targets. Character 2, the Rovino Time Mage, possesses the ability to manipulate time, allowing them to control the flow of battle, slow down enemies, or accelerate allies. Character 3, the Unicorn Incarnator, has magical healing and support abilities, making them an effective support character on the battlefield. Character 4, the Primeval Arachnid, excels in physical combat and has natural poison attacks, making them a strong melee fighter. In battle, their tactics could involve using the Wetboy's stealth to set up surprise attacks while the Time Mage manipulates time to disorient enemies. The Incarnator may cast healing and defensive spells to support the party, while the Arachnid engages in close combat and uses their poison to weaken foes. Overall, this group has a mix of burst damage, crowd control, support, and tankiness, allowing them to adapt to different combat situations. 2. Character 1 (Qi-or Wetboy): Born into a secretive and feared assassin's guild, they were trained in the arts of stealth, espionage, and killing. As a Qi-or, their natural affinity for darkness and shadow made them a perfect candidate for the Wetboy class. However, they grew disillusioned with their guild's strict hierarchy and wanted to be free from their control, seeking personal power and wealth. Character 2 (Rovino Time Mage): Hailing from a distant land, the Rovino have a unique connection to the flow of time. This particular character discovered their time manipulation abilities at a young age and was mentored by a wise time mage who taught them how to control this power responsibly. They adopted a philosophy of neutrality, striving to maintain the balance in the world through their mastery of time. Character 3 (Unicorn Incarnator): A rare and unique Unicorn, this character was chosen by the divine entity Orifiel to act as their harbinger in the mortal realm. Gifted with the ability to channel divine energy, they dedicated their life to healing the wounded and fighting against any forces that threatened order and stability. Character 4 (Primeval Arachnid): Hailing from the primeval forests, this Arachnid belonged to a species that possessed heightened intelligence and the ability to communicate. They were outcast from their tribe due to their neutral alignment, which clashed with their tribes' more extreme views. The Arachnid embraced their isolation and honed their physical prowess and venomous attacks. 3. Plot for the game party: The party finds themselves in a world on the brink of chaos. A malevolent cult has risen, seeking to unleash ancient, destructive beings known as the Shattered Ones. These beings, if released, would bring about the end of the world as they know it. The party must find a way to stop the cult, prevent the summoning, and ultimately save the realm from destruction. Throughout their quest, the party will encounter various challenges such as infiltrating the cult's strongholds, battling their powerful leaders, and uncovering ancient artifacts and knowledge that can aid them in their mission. They will have to navigate treacherous territories, solve puzzles, and form alliances with other factions who share the same goal to prevent the rise of the Shattered Ones. 4. Adventure start: The adventure begins with the party members converging on a remote village that has fallen under the cult's influence. The village is in peril, and its inhabitants have been forced under the cult's control or corrupted by dark magic. The party receives individual hints or omens that lead them to the village, where they realize they share a common purpose. To escape the village, they must fight their way out together, relying on each other's unique abilities and skills. As they flee the village, the party discovers a hidden underground passage that serves as the cult's main stronghold. Intrigued and determined to thwart the cult's plans, they decide to infiltrate the stronghold together. The entrance of the passage is guarded by powerful cultists, requiring the party to work as a team to defeat them. This encounter serves as the catalyst for the group officially joining forces and embarking on their mission to save the world."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

Install Python: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and run it. 2. Set up the Python environment: During the Python installation process, you may have the option to add Python to the system PATH. If you didn't select this option, ensure that Python is added to the PATH manually. This will allow you to run Python from the command line or terminal. 3. Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor: There are several IDEs available for Python, such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and IDLE. Choose one that suits your preferences and install it. 4. Launch the IDE or text editor: Open your preferred IDE or text editor and create a new Python file. 5. Start coding: Write your Python code in the editor. Python is a highly readable language that uses indentation to delimit blocks of code. Here's an example of a hello world program in Python: \`\`\`python print(\\"Hello, World!\\") \`\`\` 6. Save the file: Save the Python file with a .py extension, for example, \`hello_world.py\`. 7. Run the Python program: Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the location where you saved the Python file. Type \`python hello_world.py\` and press Enter. The program will execute, and you should see the output in the command prompt or terminal. Following these steps will allow you to quickly implement and run Python code."},{"instruction":"the grammer of python","output":"The grammar of Python defines the syntax and structure of the Python programming language. Here are some key aspects of Python's grammar: 1. Indentation: Python uses indentation (usually four spaces) to define blocks of code instead of using curly braces or keywords. Consistent and proper indentation is essential for maintaining the correct structure of the code. 2. Statements: Python code consists of a series of statements. Each statement typically occupies a single line, but it can span multiple lines if you use line continuation characters like backslashes \`\` or parentheses \`()\`, \`{}\`, or \`[]\`. 3. Variables and data types: Python allows you to declare variables without specifying their types explicitly. Variables are dynamically typed, which means their types can change during runtime. Python supports various data types such as numbers (integers, floats), strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, etc. 4. Comments: Python provides the '#' character for single-line comments and triple quotes \`'''\` or \`\\"\\"\\"\` for multiline comments. 5. Control flow: Python includes control flow constructs like if-elif-else statements, for and while loops, and try-except blocks for exception handling. 6. Functions: Python functions are defined using the \`def\` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses, and a colon. The function body is indented and can contain a return statement to specify the function's output. 7. Classes and objects: Python supports object-oriented programming. You can define classes using the \`class\` keyword and create objects (instances of classes). Classes can have attributes and methods. 8. Modules and packages: Python supports modular programming by allowing you to organize code into separate Python files called modules. Modules can be organized into packages, providing a hierarchical structure for organizing code. It's important to note that this response provides a brief overview of Python's grammar. For more comprehensive information, you can refer to the Python documentation, which provides detailed information about the language's grammar and syntax."},{"instruction":"Necesito una carta larga para rose que digaa: Hola mi amor. honestamente estoy muy feliz de que nos vieramos ayer. sin embargo dejame decirte que todo esto fue posible gracias al computador de macario fue corto, lo se. pero al menos ya sabes que soy real creo que tus dudas estaran un poco mas despejadas. no me gusta molestar a macario para estas cosas sin embargo lo disfrute mucho. quiero que sepas que me gustas tal cual como eres. es algo que quiero que entiendas debes aceptarte tal como eres, dios te hizo asi y asi todos tus seres queridos incluyendome te amamos! asi que no quiero mas inseguridades y quiero que te sientas segura de lo hermosa y unica que eres. no he dormido bien hoy habran muchas inspecciones en la empresa debo estar atento a eso.","output":"Querida Rose, Hola mi amor, espero que esta carta te encuentre llena de alegría y amor.

Here are a few verses that mention lashing as a form of punishment: 1. Deuteronomy 25:2-3 (New International Version): \\"If the guilty person deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make them lie down and have them flogged in his presence with the number of lashes the crime deserves, but the judge must not impose more than forty lashes.\\" 2. 2 Corinthians 11:24 (New Testament, New International Version): \\"Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.\\" These verses show the limit of forty lashes, as described in the Old Testament law, and give an example from the apostle Paul's personal experience.

The viscous nature of air 2. rivets and screw protrusions 3. turbulent flow 4. boundary layer flow","output":"All of the options listed can contribute to friction on a moving aircraft, but the most direct and significant factor responsible for friction is the viscous nature of air. As an aircraft moves through the air, the molecules of air close to the aircraft's surface experience a shearing effect due to the velocity difference between the stationary surface and the moving air. This generates a thin layer called the boundary layer, where the air flow becomes slower and more turbulent compared to the free stream airflow. Turbulent flow within the boundary layer can cause additional friction. Additionally, any protrusions like rivets and screws on the aircraft's surface can disrupt the smooth airflow and contribute to friction. Therefore, options 1, 2, 3, and 4 can all be considered factors responsible for friction on a moving aircraft."},{"instruction":"What theory based upon the concept that is only component of the airflow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing that affects pressure distribution and formation of shock waves? 1.

Sweepback","output":"The theory that is based on the concept that only the component of the airflow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing affects the pressure distribution and formation of shock waves is the theory of Bernoulli's principle. According to Bernoulli's principle, as the velocity of a fluid increases, its pressure decreases and vice versa. Therefore, the component of the airflow perpendicular to the wing's leading edge plays a crucial role in determining the pressure distribution over the wing and the formation of shock waves. Hence, the correct answer is option 1, Bernoulli's principle."},{"instruction":"你是一名营销人员，写一篇求职简历大纲，描述你在开拓营销渠道，做好客户关系管理与维护，满足客户需求，完成营销目标上的过往经历与总结，重点体现在to b业务方向的能力","output":"求职简历大纲： 个人信息： - 姓名： - 性别： - 年龄： - 手机号码： - 电子邮件： 教育背景： - 学历： - 毕业院校： - 专业： 工作经历： 公司名称： 职位名称： 任职时间： 职责与成就： - 开拓营销渠道：负责寻找并建立新的营销渠道，包括线上和线下渠道，与渠道合作伙伴进行沟通和协作，扩大产品/服务的市场份额。 - 客户关系管理与维护：与客户建立联系并维护良好的关系，了解客户需求，提供个性化的解决方案，提升客户满意度和忠诚度。 - 满足客户需求：通过深入了解客户的需求，进行产品/服务的定制化，以提供最适合他们的解决方案。充分理解客户的痛点，并及时回应和解决客户的问题和困扰。 - 完成营销目标：设定并达成销售目标，制定并执行营销策略，包括市场调研、竞争分析、定价策略等，确保销售额的增长和市场份额的提升。 工作技能与能力： - 深厚的销售技巧和谈判技巧，能够有效推动销售进程并取得良好的销售业绩。 - 出色的沟通和人际关系技巧，能够与不同层级和背景的客户建立良好的业务关系。 - 具备良好的市场分析和策划能力，能够准确识别目标市场和客户需求，并制定相应的营销策略。 - 强大的团队合作精神和领导能力，能够与团队成员和其他部门合作，共同推动项目的完成。 - 扎实的业务知识和行业了解，熟悉to b业务的特点和市场规模。 个人特质： - 乐观积极的工作态度，对工作充满热情并能够适应高压工作环境。 - 良好的自我驱动和目标导向，能够高效地管理时间和资源，实现工作目标。 - 良好的学习能力和适应能力，能够快速掌握新知识和技能，并将其应用到工作中。 以上是我的求职简历大纲，展示了我在开拓营销渠道、客户关系管理与维护、满足客户需求和完成营销目标方面的经历和能力。希望能有机会与您进一步面谈，谢谢！"},{"instruction":"根据to b业务调整以上相关描述词，使简历更加吸引相关招聘公司","output":"求职简历大纲： 个人信息： - 姓名： - 性别： - 年龄： - 手机号码： - 电子邮件： 教育背景： - 学历： - 毕业院校： - 专业： 工作经历： 公司名称： 职位名称： 任职时间： 职责与成就： - 拓展to b业务渠道：成功拓展了多个to b业务渠道，包括与企业合作伙伴的建立和维护，将产品/服务推向目标市场，实现销售业绩的长期增长。 - 优化客户关系管理：积极与to b客户建立稳固的关系，通过深入了解他们的需求和期望，提供符合其特定需求的解决方案，以提升客户满意度和忠诚度。 - 敏锐把握to b市场需求：通过严密的市场调研和竞争分析，准确把握to b客户需求和市场趋势，制定相应的营销策略，实现市场份额的持续增长。 - 达成to b营销目标：制定并实施to b市场营销策略，包括定价策略、产品/服务定制等，积极推动销售、拓展新客户和维护现有客户，实现销售目标。 工作技能与能力： - 熟练掌握to b营销技巧和谈判技巧，能够在复杂的to b业务环境中实现高效的销售成果。 - 出色的沟通和人际关系技巧，能够与to b客户进行深入合作，建立互信关系，并有效解决客户问题和需求。 - 精通to b市场分析和策划能力，能够准确洞察目标市场和客户需求，制定差异化的营销策略，提供有针对性的解决方案。 - 强大的团队合作精神和领导能力，能够与团队合作，共同推动to b项目的顺利完成。 - 扎实的to b业务知识和行业洞察力，熟悉to b市场的特点和趋势，洞悉企业客户的需求和痛点。 个人特质： - 充满激情的工作态度，对to b业务充满热情，并愿意承受工作压力并取得业绩。 - 自我驱动和目标导向，对自我成长有追求，并能够高效地管理时间和资源，实现工作目标。 - 易于学习和适应，能够迅速掌握新知识和技能，并将其应用到to b业务中。 以上是我的求职简历大纲，在to b业务方向上重点突出了我在拓展渠道、优化客户关系、把握市场需求和达成营销目标方面的经历和能力。期待有机会与贵公司面谈，谢谢！"},{"instruction":"if d in TCS_Policy_Code[number]: ^ IndentationError: unexpected indent","output":"This error is raised because the line starting with \\"if\\" is indented incorrectly.

Personal Statement Dear Admission Officer, The new business landscape is transforming the way we live. WeChat, Alipay, and various major life and social platforms like Little Red Book, Meituan, and 58 Tongcheng have become ubiquitous in society, shaping overwhelming trends. The allure of this industry is irresistible to me. I aspire to become a professional manager for a new business or an innovative entrepreneur, capable of creating new value in new ventures. My goal is to develop a strong vision and keen opportunity awareness to identify growth points for future ventures. Recognizing that the BMBA program at Laurentian University can equip me with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in my entrepreneurial ventures and leadership positions, I have chosen to pursue the BMBA program at Laurentian University (LU) to further enhance my capabilities. In my pursuit of becoming a professional manager and establishing my own business to provide innovative products or services that enhance the quality of life, I have gained valuable experience and learned important lessons. Through managing logistics projects at SINOPEC International Petroleum Service Corporation, Shanghai Hongxin International Freight Co., Ltd, and Beijing Orion Energy Technology Development Co., Ltd, I have acquired the necessary competencies to tackle complex issues and understand the importance of building customer relationships to gain long-term value. This led me to transition to marketing roles, where I honed my skills and gained a competitive edge. Working as a Marketing Pre-sales Engineer at China International Technology Intelligence Cooperation Group Co., Ltd provided me with insight into the operations of new technology ventures and the demands of the Chinese market. As the Marketing Manager of Beijing Beautiful Life Advertisement Co., Ltd, I gained hands-on knowledge of brand building, market strategy implementation, and promotion, further strengthening my ability to adapt to changing marketing conditions and diverse cultures. While these experiences have been valuable, I recognize that they are insufficient to meet the demands of the industry. This is why I am targeting the BMBA program at LU, as it will enable me to further develop my “soft” skills and professionalism, preparing me for my future entrepreneurial ventures. It is important to note that my commitment to providing innovative products or services to improve the quality of life is not just an idea on paper; I have had two entrepreneurial experiences to support this aspiration. One example is my successful establishment of the Shisha Bar project. Through partnerships with several bars, revenue-sharing agreements, and the introduction of a cocktail delivery service, I transformed the project into Beijing Enjia Box Catering Management Company, which achieved a monthly turnover of RMB 140,000 and occupied 200 square meters of business area. These experiences as a Venture Partner have given me a unique perspective on managing new ventures. However, the lack of overall business administration knowledge contributed to the decline of these ventures. To address this gap, I require a higher-level view and a deeper understanding of the business context. Thankfully, LU’s BMBA program will enable me to build competencies in key functional areas and provide the comprehensive education I need. With my extensive experience in operations management, market research, solution development, and team management, I am just one step away from realizing my dream of establishing a new business that provides creative products or services. The BMBA program at LU will effectively integrate my knowledge and skills, advancing my ideas from concepts to commercial reality. I sincerely hope to be granted this opportunity, and I am confident that I will succeed.

一些科学家和环境保护组织对日本政府的说法表示怀疑，并提出了反对意见。他们指出，核污水中可能含有一些长寿命的放射性物质，如三氚（Tritium），这些物质在处理过程中难以完全去除，并可能对海洋生物和生态系统造成潜在的损害。 3. 一些国际组织和邻国表达了对日本核污水排放计划的担忧和反对。例如，中国和韩国等国家表示关切和反对，担心这种行为会对海洋生态系统和渔业资源产生影响。 4. 就目前全球范围而言，核废水排放在海洋中是一个相对较常见的实践，并已经进行了多次。有些国家认为这是一种可行的处理方式，而有些国家则持反对意见。 总体而言，虽然日本政府声称他们的排放计划是安全的，但由于对核污水的处理和排放所涉及的复杂性和争议性，目前尚无定论。这需要各方继续进行科学研究和评估，确保任何决策都能最大程度地保护环境、人类健康和海洋生态系统。"},{"instruction":"时序分析仪是干什么用的","output":"时序分析仪（Time Sequencer

acid，KYNA）是体内色氨酸（TRP）代谢分解产物之一，由色氨酸经色氨酸-2,3-双加氧酶（TDO）、吲哚胺-2,3-双加氧酶（IDO）和犬尿氨酸氨基转移酶（KYAT）催化生成。早期的研究表明，KYNA在阿尔茨海默症和抑郁症等神经疾病患者中表现出抗炎和神经保护的作用，因此成为神经疾病领域的研究热点之一。然而，近年来越来越多的研究者开始将眼光从中枢移向外周，发现KYNA在炎症和调节能量代谢方面也具有重要作用。同时，代谢组学和流行病学研究表明，KYNA可以作为糖尿病和其他一些代谢性疾病的早期生物标志物。 目的：以往在代谢疾病领域，对于KYNA的研究大多是为了寻找早期诊断生物标志物，而对其深入的机制研究则相对较少。此外，肝脏作为色氨酸代谢的主要场所，同时也在糖脂代谢中发挥着关键作用，但是，目前尚未有人研究在肝脏中KYNA是否会影响糖脂代谢。因此，我们决定深入探究KYNA对肝脏糖脂代谢的影响，并探索其作用机制，同时评估其在2型糖尿病治疗中的潜在价值。 方法：本研究以HepG2、Huh7、AML-12等肝细胞系为模型，采用WB、qPCR、转录组等技术，通过短期和长期的KYNA干预，在体外探究其对肝细胞糖脂代谢和炎症因子基因表达的影响。同时，我们还构建糖尿病动物模型，进一步阐明KYNA在体内短期和长期干预对肝脏糖脂代谢的作用，并验证其在2型糖尿病治疗中的潜在效果。 结果：通过色氨酸靶向代谢组实验，我们发现糖尿病GK大鼠和STZ大鼠的血浆中，所有色氨酸代谢物（5-HT、KYN和KYNA）水平均明显低于正常Wistar大鼠。我们进行了腹腔注射KYNA的IPGTT实验，研究其对GK大鼠糖耐量的影响。结果表明，在不影响胰岛素分泌的情况下，KYNA能够改善糖尿病大鼠的糖耐量。这一发现提示KYNA可能通过影响葡萄糖代谢发挥抗2型糖尿病作用。接着，我们在GK大鼠的饮水中添加了KYNA，并对其血糖水平进行监测，结果表明，经过长期口服补充KYNA可以显著推迟2型糖尿病的发病时间。此外，在使用小动物代谢系统监测KYNA对能量消耗的影响时，我们发现KYNA实验组小鼠在夜间活跃期呼吸商较对照组显著上升，提示KYNA组小鼠更倾向于使用糖类物质作为能量底物。通过RNA-seq差异基因富集分析，我们进一步发现KYNA可以显著影响肝细胞脂肪酸代谢通路和过氧化物酶体增殖物激活受体（PPAR）信号通路。最后，在进行体外细胞实验时，我们发现处理肝细胞系48小时后，KYNA可以显著提高解偶联蛋白2（UCP2）的mRNA及蛋白水平。 结论：我们的研究结果表明，KYNA在不影响胰岛素分泌情况下，改善GK大鼠的糖耐量。长期口服KYNA还能够显著延缓GK大鼠糖尿病的发展。我们还发现，KYNA能够促进小鼠餐后和运动期间的葡萄糖氧化，并增加HepG2细胞和小鼠肝细胞中产热基因UCPs的表达。因此，我们认为KYNA可能通过诱导UCPs上调来调节能量代谢，从而有效地延缓2型糖尿病的发病。","output":"背景：犬尿喹啉酸（KYNA）是体内色氨酸代谢分解产物之一，由色氨酸经过色氨酸-2,3-双加氧酶（TDO）、吲哚胺-2,3-双加氧酶（IDO）和犬尿氨酸氨基转移酶（KYAT）催化生成。早期的研究表明，KYNA在阿尔茨海默症和抑郁症等神经疾病患者中表现出抗炎和神经保护作用，因此成为神经疾病领域的研究热点之一。然而，近年来越来越多的研究者开始将注意力从中枢转向外周，发现KYNA在炎症和调节能量代谢方面也起着重要作用。与此同时，代谢组学和流行病学研究表明，KYNA可以作为糖尿病和其他一些代谢性疾病的早期生物标志物。

This not only strengthens our international cooperation, but also provides more studyoptions to our future students. The Bilingual MBA is a full time and on-campus master degree program. In all, there are 15 MBA courses in the program, with the first 5 courses in Mandarin (course content, class discussions, and labs and soon) and the last 10 courses will be taught in English. Before students start this program, they are not required to submit an IELTS record (or equivalent) because students will enroll in accelerated English for Academic Purpose (EAP) training simultaneously with the 5 MBA courses taught in Mandarin. The EAPtraining is provided by Laurentian University. All courses in the BMBA and EAP will be offered onLaurentian’s campus, in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Graduating students will graduate with the same level of English language proficiency as currently admitted students, and all students will receive the Laurentian MBA degree parchment upon successful completion of the program. Personal Statement Dear Admission Officer, The new business landscape is transforming the way we live. WeChat, Alipay, and various major life and social platforms like Little Red Book, Meituan, and 58 Tongcheng have become ubiquitous in society, shaping overwhelming trends. The allure of this industry is irresistible to me. I aspire to become a professional manager for a new business or an innovative entrepreneur, capable of creating new value in new ventures. My goal is to develop a strong vision and keen opportunity awareness to identify growth points for future ventures. Recognizing that the BMBA program at Laurentian University can equip me with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in my entrepreneurial ventures and leadership positions, I have chosen to pursue the BMBA program at Laurentian University (LU) to further enhance my capabilities. In my pursuit of becoming a professional manager and establishing my own business to provide innovative products or services that enhance the quality of life, I have gained valuable experience and learned important lessons. Through managing logistics projects at SINOPEC International Petroleum Service Corporation, Shanghai Hongxin International Freight Co., Ltd, and Beijing Orion Energy Technology Development Co., Ltd, I have acquired the necessary competencies to tackle complex issues and understand the importance of building customer relationships to gain long-term value. This led me to transition to marketing roles, where I honed my skills and gained a competitive edge. Working as a Marketing Pre-sales Engineer at China International Technology Intelligence Cooperation Group Co., Ltd provided me with insight into the operations of new technology ventures and the demands of the Chinese market. As the Marketing Manager of Beijing Beautiful Life Advertisement Co., Ltd, I gained hands-on knowledge of brand building, market strategy implementation, and promotion, further strengthening my ability to adapt to changing marketing conditions and diverse cultures. While these experiences have been valuable, I recognize that they are insufficient to meet the demands of the industry. This is why I am targeting the BMBA program at LU, as it will enable me to further develop my “soft” skills and professionalism, preparing me for my future entrepreneurial ventures. It is important to note that my commitment to providing innovative products or services to improve the quality of life is not just an idea on paper; I have had two entrepreneurial experiences to support this aspiration. One example is my successful establishment of the Shisha Bar project. Through partnerships with several bars, revenue-sharing agreements, and the introduction of a cocktail delivery service, I transformed the project into Beijing Enjia Box Catering Management Company, which achieved a monthly turnover of RMB 140,000 and occupied 200 square meters of business area. These experiences as a Venture Partner have given me a unique perspective on managing new ventures. However, the lack of overall business administration knowledge contributed to the decline of these ventures. To address this gap, I require a higher-level view and a deeper understanding of the business context. Thankfully, LU’s BMBA program will enable me to build competencies in key functional areas and provide the comprehensive education I need. With my extensive experience in operations management, market research, solution development, and team management, I am just one step away from realizing my dream of establishing a new business that provides creative products or services. The BMBA program at LU will effectively integrate my knowledge and skills, advancing my ideas from concepts to commercial reality. I sincerely hope to be granted this opportunity, and I am confident that I will succeed.

В данной статье рассмотрим этот процесс подробнее. После уборки картофеля, рекомендуется разбросать специальную смесь по грядке. Такая смесь может содержать различные компоненты, которые способствуют оптимальному развитию картофеля и увеличению его урожайности. Одним из важных элементов в составе смеси являются компост или перегной, который обогащает почву микроорганизмами и питательными веществами. Компост предоставляет картофелю все необходимые элементы для роста и развития, а также помогает удерживать влагу в почве. Важным компонентом смеси также является зола или древесная зола. Зола содержит множество полезных микроэлементов, таких как калий, фосфор, кальций и другие, которые необходимы для нормального развития картофельных клубней. Зола также способствует повышению устойчивости растений к вредителям и болезням. Также можно добавить в смесь органическое удобрение, такое как перегной или птичий помет. Они также обогащают почву питательными веществами и способствуют повышению плодородия. Помимо применения смеси, рекомендуется выполнять севооборот, то есть чередовать посев картофеля с другими культурами. Это позволяет предотвратить размножение проволочника и других сорняков, которые могут негативно повлиять на урожай картофеля. Также важным шагом является правильная подготовка грядки перед посадкой картофеля. Грядку необходимо хорошо прополоть от сорняков и внести некоторое количество органических удобрений. При этом стоит учесть, что картофель предпочитает рыхлые, плодородные почвы, поэтому рекомендуется вносить песок или торф в почву для улучшения ее структуры. Кроме того, важно обеспечивать картофелю достаточное количество света, воздуха и влаги. Для этого рекомендуется регулярно поливать грядку, особенно в сухие периоды, и удалять сорняки, чтобы они не затмевали растения. Таким образом, разбрасывание смеси по грядке после уборки картофеля является важным мероприятием для обеспечения успешного урожая.

Мульчирование скошенной травы - процесс использования травяной подстилки в качестве органического удобрения для питания почвы. Этот метод подразумевает распространение тонкого слоя травой на почву между растениями или вокруг них. Некоторые садоводы и сельскохозяйственные специалисты считают мульчирование скошенной травой очень полезным, поскольку оно способствует сохранению плодородности почвы и улучшает ее структуру. Травяная подстилка служит барьером, предотвращая испарение влаги из почвы, что уменьшает необходимость полива. Она также помогает снизить рост сорняков, шлагбаумов и других нежелательных растений, так как подавляет их рост. Кроме того, мульчирование скошенной травой способствует улучшению структуры почвы. Когда травяная подстилка разлагается, она обогащает почву органическими веществами и питательными веществами, такими как азот, фосфор и калий. Это питание позволяет растениям расти и развиваться более здорово, улучшает цветение и урожайность, а также способствует сохранению биоразнообразия в почве. Однако, есть и аргументы против использования мульчирования скошенной травой. Одна из проблем заключается в том, что она может стать источником распространения семян сорняков и шлагбаумов. Если трава была скошена с орошаемого участка, то она может содержать семена вредных растений, которые попадут на почву при мульчировании. Это может привести к появлению и распространению сорняков в саду или огороде. Кроме того, некоторые люди считают, что мульчирование скошенной травой может создавать проблемы с вредителями и болезнями растений. Травяная подстилка может служить укрытием для насекомых и грызунов, которые могут нанести вред садовым и огородным культурам. Кроме того, влажная травяная подстилка может выступать источником грибков и болезней, таких как гниль и плесень, которые могут повредить растения. Поэтому перед тем, как решить применять мульчирование скошенной травой, необходимо учитывать свои условия и цели. Если в саду или огороде преобладают сорняки или вредители, то, возможно, лучше воздержаться от мульчирования скошенной травой или использовать ее с осторожностью. Однако, если имеется небольшое количество вредных растений и высока потребность в сохранении плодородности почвы, то мульчирование скошенной травой может быть полезным. В целом, мульчирование скошенной травой имеет свои преимущества и недостатки. Оно может способствовать сохранению плодородности почвы, структуре почвы и уменьшению использования воды для полива, но также может создавать проблемы с семенами сорняков и шлагбаумов, а также привлекать вредителей и болезни растений. Перед решением использовать мульчирование скошенной травой, важно оценить все факторы и принять во внимание особенности своего сада или огорода."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Однако, есть несколько моментов, которые стоит улучшить: 1. При нажатии на кнопку \\"=\\" необходимо проверить, является ли введенное значение числом. В текущей реализации, если в поле ввода будет введена строка или символы, возникнет ошибка ValueError. Для избежания этой ошибки нужно добавить проверку и выдать сообщение об ошибке пользователю. 2. В функции math_operation() операнды и операцию можно передавать через параметры функции, вместо того, чтобы использовать глобальные переменные. Глобальные переменные следует избегать, так как они могут привести к ошибкам в программе. 3. Можно добавить функциональность кнопки \\"<-\\", чтобы пользователь мог удалять последний введенный символ. 4. Вместо использования строковых символов для определения математической операции, можно использовать числовые коды, чтобы упростить код и сделать его более понятным. 5. Нужно проверить корректность работы кнопки, выполняющей возведение в степень. В текущей реализации она не работает, возможно, ошибка в операторе или отсутствие соответствующей функции. 6. Можно добавить кнопку очистки последнего введенного символа, чтобы пользователь мог исправить ошибки. 7. Нужно проверить и обработать ситуации, когда деление на ноль или получение квадратного корня из отрицательного числа. В текущей реализации такие действия приведут к ошибке или неправильному результату. 8. Можно добавить функцию для вычисления факториала числа. 9. Можно добавить возможность использования скобок для задания порядка выполнения операций. 10. Вместо создания отдельных кнопок для каждой цифры, можно использовать цикл для создания кнопок от 0 до 9. 11. Можно использовать Grid или другую сетку, чтобы лучше расположить кнопки на экране калькулятора. В текущей реализации кнопки располагаются в столбец, что может выглядеть не очень удобно для пользователя. 12. Нужно добавить обработку ошибок и исключений, чтобы предотвратить возможные сбои программы, например, деление на ноль или ввод некорректных символов."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Eventually, 6 of the elementals have all gone out on their own missions, leaving Undine - who was heavily pregnant with twins - and Dryad back in the cave. Undine has a penchant for limericks & has made a limerick for all sorts of occasions, and her room looks like it was made of ice - which was one of the aspects of the water element - and she's even made two cribs out of ice. All the while, Dryad has a calm disposition and her room looks like a forest - as she is the wood elemental. But while Undine is sleeping, she starts to feel the small kicks of her unborn babies.)","output":"Undine (whispering to herself): Oh, what a delight, tiny kicks in the night, My babes are restless, full of life and light. Their water souls dance with joyful glee, Soon they shall join our elemental family. (Dryad enters the room, her gentle footsteps barely making a sound) Dryad: Undine, my friend, I see you're awake, May I join you? I promise, no noise shall I make. Undine (smiling): Of course, Dryad, come and sit, Feel the magic within, these kicks, they're a hit! My children, our precious water seeds, Soon they'll be splashing in rivers and streams. Dryad (sitting next to Undine): How wondrous it is, life's great cycle, From tiny movements to cries and a smile. Undine, my dear friend, are you prepared? For motherhood's joys and challenges spared? Undine (placing her hands on her belly): I'm as ready as the tides ebb and flow, To guide them, protect them, help them to grow. With each gentle flutter, my heart sings, A lullaby in nature's harmonious strings. (Undine's eyes glimmer with anticipation) Dryad: Your love shines like moonlight on the leaves, In this calm cave, your motherly magic weaves. Your limericks and ice cribs, crafted with care, Preparing a home, beyond compare. Undine (giggling): Oh, Dryad, you flatter me so, But I cannot wait to see their glow. Two water nymphs, oh, what a sight, To bring harmony and healing, day and night. (Dryad's eyes flicker with reverence) Dryad: Undine, know that I'll be here, To celebrate their arrival, bring them cheer. As their aunt, I'll impart the wonders of wood, Together, they'll create a sanctuary, where spirits could. Undine (grateful): Thank you, dear Dryad, your support I cherish, A friendship like ours, never to perish. With your calm presence and nature's embrace, Our children shall grow with grace. (Dryad and Undine embrace, their bond strong and true) Undine: Now, let's await the arrival of our precious twins, In this cave of love, where their journey begins. As water and wood intertwine, a family pure, May the world witness their magic, admire and adore. (As the story continues, Undine and Dryad patiently await the birth of the twins, their love and friendship guiding them through the beautiful journey of motherhood and aunt-hood.)"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Quantum Mechanics can send radio messages faster than light! Short answer: No, it won't work. Slightly longer answer: When you send the message, it will technically arrive faster than light. But the message will be in two parts: a scrambled sequence of numbers at the source, and a second scrambled sequence at the destination. The only way to decode the message is with both sequences. So the source has to send the first scrambled sequence to the destination over conventional just-as-fast-as-light radio. Which sort of defeats the purpose. After receiving both parts of the message at a rate equal to the speed of light, you can find out after the fact that yes indeed there was some faster-than-light communication. Oh, my, wasn't that pointless? Longest answer: Back in 1930, several physicists in general and Albert Einstein in particular were quite upset when Quantum Mechanics was invented. Everything about QM was offensive to those who like their physics logical, deterministic, and non-weird. Einstein and co-authors Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen wrote a paper in 1935 demonstrating that Quantum Mechanics had to be utterly wrong, or at the very least quite incomplete. The paper set forth a paradox. The two solutions were [a] Quantum Mechanics is wrong or incomplete or [b] there exists bizarre spooky action at a distance which travels faster than light (actually it is instantaneous). Since [b] was obviously impossible, Einstein and his co-authors smugly sat back and waited for Quantum Mechanics to be discarded into the dust-bin of history. Unfortunately for Einstein et al, in 1964 some clown named Dr. John Stewart Bell wrote a paper showing how to test the paradox (called \\"Bell's Inequality\\"), and to the horror of the foes of quantum mechanics it turned out that bizarre spooky action at a distance which travels faster than light actually happens. This saved quantum mechanics from the EPR paradox, but now all the physicists had to deal with this obnoxious FTL action at a distance. As mentioned above, physicists hate FTL because it destroys causality and thus makes the entire structure of Science collapse into a flaming ruin. As it turns out: yes, the FTL effect is real but no you can't use it for anything useful. Physicists heaved a sigh of relief (and science fiction writers became quite angry).\\"","output":"This excerpt discusses the concept of quantum entanglement and its relationship to faster-than-light (FTL) communication. It mentions that while quantum entanglement technically allows for a message to arrive faster than light, it requires two scrambled sequences at the source and destination that need to be sent conventionally. Therefore, FTL communication through quantum entanglement becomes pointless. The excerpt also references the history of quantum mechanics and the opposition it faced from physicists like Albert Einstein, who believed it was wrong or incomplete. Einstein and his co-authors proposed a paradox to challenge quantum mechanics, suggesting that FTL communication is impossible. However, in 1964, Dr. John Stewart Bell's paper, known as \\"Bell's Inequality,\\" showed that FTL action at a distance does occur. This revelation saved quantum mechanics from the paradox but presented challenges for physicists as FTL violates causality. Ultimately, the FTL effect is acknowledged as real but deemed useless for practical applications."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

What are its \\"centralized weak points\\"?","output":"1) RAI (Reflexer Autonomous Index) and DAI are both decentralized stablecoins, but they operate using different mechanisms. RAI is designed to be more decentralized than DAI. RAI uses a native on-chain governance system called the RAI Monetary Policy, which allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process. The governance system is decentralized, giving token holders the power to vote on protocol parameters and updates. Additionally, RAI utilizes a Dynamic Collateral Ratio (DCR) system that adjusts the collateralization over time based on supply and demand dynamics. This mechanism aims to maintain stability while minimizing the need for active governance. On the other hand, DAI operates as a decentralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, using various smart contracts to achieve stability. While DAI does have some governance mechanisms, they are not as native and decentralized as RAI's on-chain governance. MakerDAO, the organization behind DAI, has a certain level of influence, but its influence has been gradually reduced over time to increase decentralization. 2) DAI is considered quite decentralized, but it does have some centralized weak points. One of the main concerns is the reliance on oracles to provide off-chain price data for collateral valuation. Oracles are centralized data providers that feed information into the smart contracts. If an oracle is compromised or manipulated, it could affect the stability and functionality of DAI. Additionally, while DAI has on-chain governance through the MakerDAO system, the participation and influence of token holders in decision-making can be limited. A smaller number of users tend to actively participate in the voting process, which may lead to limited decentralization in the decision-making power. Furthermore, DAI's stability is maintained by the collateralization of various assets, primarily ETH. If a significant portion of the backing collateral (such as ETH) experiences a sudden, severe drop in value, it could impact the stability of DAI and potentially lead to liquidations. Despite these potential weaknesses, the MakerDAO community continually works to enhance the decentralization of DAI and address these concerns."},{"instruction":"Can you explain to me the fundamentals of lua for Codea?","output":"Lua is a lightweight, high-level programming language designed for scripting and embedded systems. It is often used as a scripting language in various applications, including game development. Codea is an interactive development environment (IDE) for the iPad that utilizes the Lua programming language specifically for creating games and interactive applications. Here are the fundamental concepts of Lua for Codea: 1. Variables: In Lua, variables are not explicitly declared with a data type and are dynamically typed. You simply assign a value to a variable, and it automatically takes on the appropriate type. \`\`\`lua myNumber = 10 myString = \\"Hello\\" \`\`\` 2. Control Structures: Lua supports the standard control structures like conditionals and loops. - Conditional Statements: \`\`\`lua if condition then -- code executed if condition is true elseif anotherCondition then -- code executed if the first condition is false and this condition is true else -- code executed if all conditions are false end \`\`\` - Loops: \`\`\`lua while condition do -- code executed while the condition is true end for i = start, stop, step do -- code executed for each iteration end \`\`\` 3. Functions: Lua supports functions, which allow you to group and reuse code. You can define functions and call them multiple times from different parts of your code. \`\`\`lua function add(a, b) return a + b end result = add(5, 3) -- result variable stores the output of the function call \`\`\` 4. Tables: Tables are Lua's primary data structure. They are similar to arrays, dictionaries, or objects in other languages, allowing you to store and manipulate collections of data. \`\`\`lua person = { name = \\"John\\", age = 30, city = \\"New York\\" } print(person.name) -- accessing table fields \`\`\` 5. Libraries: Lua provides various built-in libraries that extend its functionality. Codea also includes several additional libraries specifically designed for game development, graphics, and interaction. \`\`\`lua -- Example using Codea's sprite library to display an image function setup() sprite(\\"Planet Cute:Character Boy\\", WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2) end \`\`\` These are just the fundamental concepts of Lua for Codea. As you progress, you can explore more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, coroutines, and module management. The Lua language itself has extensive documentation available, and Codea includes its own documentation and examples to help you learn and utilize Lua effectively."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

With every gentle kick that you give, I can't help but smile and feel truly alive. (Suddenly, the door creaks open, and Wisp, the elemental of light, enters the room, a worried expression on his face.) Wisp: Undine, wake up! It's time for you to prepare, I sense something amiss in the swirling air. The darkness stirs, it poses a threat, We must gather and protect what we've met. Undine (startled, rubbing her eyes): Wisp, what's wrong? Can't it wait? My little ones are restless, I'm afraid. Soon they'll be born into this world of might, I need to ensure everything's just right. Wisp (sighing): I understand, Undine, your concern is true, But danger lingers, and we must see it through.

With newfound determination, Wisp and Undine march forward, ready to protect the world they hold dear.)"},{"instruction":"What are the differences between an INFJ and an INFP?","output":"INFJ and INFP are two different personality types according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) classification. While some similarities exist between the two, there are several key differences: 1. Dominant Functions: - INFJ: The dominant function is introverted intuition (Ni). INFJs tend to focus on patterns, insights, and future possibilities, helping them make connections and understand complex ideas. - INFP: The dominant function is introverted feeling (Fi). INFPs prioritize internal values, emotions, and authenticity, seeking to align their actions with their deeply-held beliefs. 2. Auxiliary Functions: - INFJ: The auxiliary function is extraverted feeling (Fe). INFJs use their empathetic and harmonizing nature to understand others, maintain social harmony, and provide support. - INFP: The auxiliary function is extraverted intuition (Ne). INFPs use this function to explore external possibilities, seek inspiration, and consider different perspectives. 3. Approach to Decision-Making: - INFJ: With their dominant introverted intuition, INFJs may rely on their insights and gut feelings to make decisions. They consider the long-term implications and alignment with their values. - INFP: INFPs primarily rely on their introverted feeling when making decisions. They assess situations based on their personal value system and seek authenticity, often prioritizing their emotions. 4. Expression of Emotions: - INFJ: INFJs tend to be more reserved in expressing their emotions, as they often prioritize empathy and maintaining harmony in social dynamics. - INFP: INFPs are generally more open about expressing their emotions, as they emphasize personal authenticity and staying true to their inner feelings. 5. Idealistic vs. Present-focused: - INFJ: INFJs are known for their idealistic nature, often driven to bring positive change and make a difference in the world. - INFP: INFPs are described as more present-focused, concentrating on aligning their actions and values in their immediate environments. These differences in dominant and auxiliary functions, decision-making, emotional expression, and focus contribute to the distinctions between INFJs and INFPs. However, it's important to remember that individual personalities may vary, and people can exhibit traits from both types to some extent."},{"instruction":"Are most Taurus ESTJs?","output":"No, being a Taurus in astrology does not necessarily mean that someone is more likely to be an ESTJ according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Astrology and MBTI are two different systems that attempt to categorize and understand individuals. ESTJ is one of the 16 MBTI personality types, representing extroversion (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), and judging (J). This type is characterized by their practicality, organization, and preference for structure. On the other hand, Taurus is an astrological sun sign associated with individuals born between April 20 and May 20. Astrology suggests that Taurus-born individuals tend to possess traits like determination, loyalty, and practicality. While there may be some overlapping character traits in both ESTJs and Taurus individuals, it's important to note that personality traits and astrological signs are not inherently linked. Personality development and factors influencing it are much more complex and nuanced, encompassing various aspects of biology, environment, and individual experiences."},{"instruction":"Is the number of ESTJ Taurus is bigger than ESTJ Virgos or ESTJ Capricorns?","output":"There is no empirical evidence or scientific basis to suggest that the number of ESTJ individuals would vary significantly based on their astrological sign. Astrology, which categorizes individuals based on their birth date or zodiac signs, and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which categorizes individuals based on their psychological preferences, operate on different frameworks and have different underlying principles. The distribution of MBTI personality types is not determined or influenced by astrological signs. The MBTI categorizes individuals into different personality types based on their preferences for extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving. These preferences are believed to be relatively stable across different individuals and are not influenced by astrological factors. Therefore, it would not be accurate or logical to claim that the number of ESTJ individuals would be more common among Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn individuals based solely on their astrological signs."},{"instruction":"定制wood finish aluminium profile时，需要注意哪些地方","output":"在定制wood finish aluminium profile时，需要注意以下几个方面： 1. 选择适当的木纹效果：根据项目的需求和设计要求，选择与整体风格相匹配的木纹效果。木纹效果可以根据实际需要进行定制，可以选择仿真木纹、稳定木纹或特殊的定制木纹。 2. 确定正确的铝型材规格：根据项目的要求，选择合适的铝型材规格。铝型材可以有不同的形状和尺寸，如平板型、U型和平衡型等。根据项目的需求，确定合适的型材规格和铝壁厚度。 3. 确定木纹的表面处理方式：木纹效果可以通过涂层、印刷或热转印的方式实现。根据预算和需求，选择合适的表面处理方式。涂层方式可以提供更持久的木纹效果，而热转印则可以提供更加逼真的木纹效果。 4. 选择耐候性良好的木纹涂层：由于使用环境的不同，需要选择耐候性良好的木纹涂层。这将确保木纹效果能够长时间保持良好的外观，不受气候和其他外界因素的影响。 5. 确定配套的配件和连接方式：在定制wood finish aluminium profile时，还需要确定与其配套的配件和连接方式。这包括角码、连接片、连接螺栓等。选择合适的配件和连接方式，可以确保安装过程中的稳定性和可靠性。 6. 考虑工艺和生产能力：在定制wood finish aluminium profile时，需要考虑工艺和生产能力。这包括木纹涂层的生产过程、生产周期和工艺难度等。根据供应商的实际情况，选择合适的工艺和生产能力，确保订单能够及时交付。 总而言之，定制wood finish aluminium profile需要考虑木纹效果、铝型材规格、木纹表面处理方式、涂层耐候性、配件和连接方式以及工艺和生产能力等方面。只有综合考虑这些因素，才能确保定制的产品满足项目的需求和设计要求。"},{"instruction":"润色如下内容：作为他的学业导师，我见证了他在大学期间这三年的成长，特别是他的批判性思维能力、独立思考能力以及创新能力均得到了长足的进步。","output":"作为他的学业导师，我亲眼见证了他在大学期间这三年的成长。特别是在批判性思维能力、独立思考能力以及创新能力方面，他取得了长足的进步。 在批判性思维方面，他能够深入分析问题，从不同角度出发，全面评估各种因素，并提出理性的观点和建议。他善于质疑传统观念和权威观点，能够从中找到问题和改进的机会。 在独立思考能力方面，他表现出了出色的自主性和自我驱动力。他有能力独立思考并解决复杂问题，而不是依赖他人的指导。他能够独立进行研究和探索，并能够自信地表达自己的观点和见解。 在创新能力方面，他展现出了想象力和创造力。他能够提出新鲜的想法和独特的解决方案，将理论与实践相结合，并能够在学术和实践领域展示出独具一格的思维方式和创新思维。 总之，他在大学期间取得的批判性思维能力、独立思考能力和创新能力的进步是显著的。我对他的学术成就以及未来的发展非常有信心。"},{"instruction":"中译英：作为他的学业导师，我亲眼见证了他在大学期间这三年的成长。特别是在批判性思维能力、独立思考能力以及创新能力方面，他取得了长足的进步。 在批判性思维方面，他能够深入分析问题，从不同角度出发，全面评估各种因素，并提出理性的观点和建议。他善于质疑传统观念和权威观点，能够从中找到问题和改进的机会。 在独立思考能力方面，他表现出了出色的自主性和自我驱动力。他有能力独立思考并解决复杂问题，而不是依赖他人的指导。他能够独立进行研究和探索，并能够自信地表达自己的观点和见解。 在创新能力方面，他展现出了想象力和创造力。他能够提出新鲜的想法和独特的解决方案，将理论与实践相结合，并能够在学术和实践领域展示出独具一格的思维方式和创新思维。 总之，他在大学期间取得的批判性思维能力、独立思考能力和创新能力的进步是显著的。我对他的学术成就以及未来的发展非常有信心。","output":"As his academic mentor, I have personally witnessed his growth during his three years in university.

On the other hand, zodiac signs are based on astrology, which assigns specific traits and characteristics to individuals based on their birth date. Astrology suggests that the position of celestial bodies at the time of a person's birth influences their personality traits, compatibility with others, and life events.

To fix this issue, you can modify your code as follows: \`\`\`kotlin fun String.printLn() { println(this) } \`\`\` In the revised code snippet, the \`printLn()\` extension function for \`String\` uses \`println()\` to print the value of the string directly. Now, you can call the \`printLn()\` function on any \`String\` object: \`\`\`kotlin val message = \\"Hello, World!\\" message.printLn() \`\`\` The above code will print \\"Hello, World!\\" to the console."},{"instruction":"error: too many arguments for public fun String.divideBySeparator(): String defined in packageSubmission in file Main.kt println(\\"И да пребудет с тобой сила\\".divideBySeparator('='))","output":"The error message indicates that you are passing too many arguments to the \`divideBySeparator()\` function. The \`divideBySeparator()\` function is likely a custom function defined to split the given string by a specified separator.

To resolve this error, you can use an additional temporary variable to avoid the changing closure capture. Here's an example: \`\`\`kotlin val number = 123456 var biggestDigit: Int? = null // Temporary variable number.toString().forEach { char -> val digit = char.toString().toInt() if (biggestDigit == null || digit > biggestDigit!!) { biggestDigit = digit } } if (biggestDigit != null) { // Here, biggestDigit can be safely smart cast to Int println(biggestDigit) } \`\`\` In the above example, we introduce a temporary variable \`biggestDigit: Int?\` and initialize it as \`null\`. Within the \`forEach\` loop, the \`digit\` variable is assigned the numeric value for each character in the string after converting it using \`toInt()\`. If a bigger digit is found, the \`biggestDigit\` is updated with the new value. Since \`biggestDigit\` is a mutable variable that can change during the loop iterations, the smart cast is impossible directly. However, outside the loop, you can safely check if \`biggestDigit\` is not null and perform the desired actions. By using the temporary variable and null checks, you can avoid the \\"smart cast to 'Int' is impossible\\" error."},{"instruction":"写一份单位2023年建立在职党员“双报到、双报告”制度和与社区联创共建的相关情况说明","output":"单位2023年建立在职党员“双报到、双报告”制度和与社区联创共建的相关情况说明 为进一步加强党员队伍建设，提高党员的责任意识和使命感，我单位决定于2023年建立在职党员“双报到、双报告”制度，并与社区联创共建，以下是相关情况说明： 一、双报到制度： 1. 在职党员需要按照规定的时间和程序，在所在单位党组织进行报到登记，上交个人档案和党费，并领取党员证。 2. 党员报到时需要提交个人党组织生活情况记录，包括参加党组织活动、学习党的理论知识、参与志愿服务等情况。 3. 党员报到后，单位党组织将会安排党员进行组织生活和集体学习，确保党员参与到党组织的工作中。 4. 所在单位党员还需要在组织生活期间向党组织递交书面报告，介绍个人党务工作情况，并进行自我批评和评议同志。 二、双报告制度： 1. 在职党员需要按照规定的时间间隔，向所在单位党组织报告自己的思想、工作和生活情况，特别是在重大事项发生时及时向党组织汇报，接受组织的指导和帮助。 2. 党员报告内容将包括个人的工作进展、学习成果、问题困惑以及对党的工作的建议和意见等方面。 3. 党员报告可以是口头报告、书面报告或者其他形式，根据个人情况自行选择，并注重实事求是、客观真实。 4. 党员的报告将作为党组织对党员进行思想教育、工作指导和组织管理的重要依据。 三、与社区联创共建： 1. 我单位将积极响应党中央号召，与所在社区联创共建，共同提升社区发展水平和党的执政能力。 2. 单位党员将主动参与社区的志愿服务、社区治理、社区发展规划等工作，积极履行党员的先锋模范作用。 3. 对于在社区工作中表现突出的党员，单位将给予适当的表彰和奖励。 4. 通过与社区联创共建，单位党员将更好地了解社区居民的需求，为居民提供更优质的服务，同时也能够通过社区的力量推动单位内部的发展和改进。 我单位将认真贯彻执行在职党员“双报到、双报告”制度和与社区联创共建的相关要求，进一步提升党员思想境界和工作能力，以实际行动为党和人民的事业作出贡献。"},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

How to deal with it?","output":"If the turbulent viscosity ratio in Fluent software exceeds the limit at the interior boundary, there are a few steps you can take to address this issue: 1. Check the boundary conditions: Ensure that the boundary conditions you have specified are appropriate for your simulation. Improper boundary conditions can lead to unrealistic results and may cause the turbulent viscosity ratio to exceed the limit. 2. Adjust the mesh: Inadequate mesh resolution near the boundary can affect the accuracy and stability of the simulation. Consider refining the mesh in the problematic zone to capture the flow gradients accurately. 3. Modify turbulence models: The choice of turbulence model can significantly impact the turbulent viscosity ratio. Experiment with different turbulence models available in Fluent, such as k-epsilon, k-omega, SST (Shear Stress Transport), etc., to see if using a different model helps improve the situation. 4. Adjust turbulence model parameters: Depending on the turbulence model you are using, there may be specific parameters that control the turbulence viscosity ratio. Explore the model settings in Fluent and evaluate if adjusting any of these parameters leads to better results. 5. Reduce the inlet velocity: If increasing the turbulent viscosity ratio is due to high inlet velocities, consider reducing the velocity to see if it helps in reducing the turbulent viscosity ratio. 6. Validate the boundary conditions: Double-check if the provided conditions are physically meaningful. Inaccurate boundary conditions can lead to unrealistic results and may contribute to turbulent viscosity ratio issues.

These molecules consist of carbon atoms arranged in a three-dimensional framework similar to diamond, with sp3 hybridization and strong covalent bonds. As for the energy required to destroy diamondoid, it would depend on the specific structure and size of the molecule, as well as the method of destruction. Generally, the energy needed to break the individual covalent bonds within diamondoid can be quite high. Diamond itself is known for its exceptional hardness and stability due to its strong carbon-carbon bonds, and diamondoids share some of these characteristics. Breaking these bonds typically requires a significant amount of energy, whether through high temperatures, extreme pressures, or chemical reactions with reactive species. It is important to note that the term \\"destroy\\" may refer to different outcomes, whether it means breaking the diamondoid into smaller fragments or completely disintegrating it. The energy required for such destruction would likely vary significantly based on the specific context and objectives."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

如何写","output":"要在C++中使用Linux的pthread库，需要进行以下步骤： 1. 包含头文件：在文件的开头加入以下语句： \`\`\`cpp #include <pthread.h> \`\`\` 2. 定义线程函数：在程序中定义线程函数，它将在新线程中执行。线程函数的原型如下： \`\`\`cpp void* threadFunction(void* arg); \`\`\` 其中，\`void*\`是线程函数的返回类型。 3. 创建线程并运行：在需要创建线程的地方调用\`pthread_create\`函数，该函数的原型如下： \`\`\`cpp int pthread_create(pthread_t* thread, const pthread_attr_t* attr, void* (*start_routine)(void*), void* arg); \`\`\` 其中，\`thread\`是用来存储新线程的ID，\`attr\`是线程的属性，设置为\`NULL\`表示使用默认属性，\`start_routine\`是指向线程函数的指针，\`arg\`是传递给线程函数的参数。 4. 等待线程结束并处理返回值（如果有）：在主线程中使用\`pthread_join\`函数等待线程结束，并获取线程函数的返回值。该函数的原型如下： \`\`\`cpp int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void** retval); \`\`\` 其中，\`thread\`是要等待的线程ID，\`retval\`是用来存储线程函数返回值的指针。如果线程函数没有返回值，可以将\`retval\`设置为\`NULL\`。 下面是一个简单的示例代码，展示了如何使用pthread库在C++中创建线程： \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <pthread.h> // 线程函数 void* helloWorld(void* arg) { std::cout << \\"Hello, World!\\" << std::endl; pthread_exit(NULL); // 线程结束 } int main() { pthread_t thread; int rc = pthread_create(&thread, NULL, helloWorld, NULL); if (rc) { std::cout << \\"Error creating thread: \\" << rc << std::endl; return -1; } // 等待线程结束 void* status; rc = pthread_join(thread, &status); if (rc) { std::cout << \\"Error joining thread: \\" << rc << std::endl; return -1; } return 0; } \`\`\` 以上代码创建了一个新线程，在新线程中打印\\"Hello, World!\\"，然后使用\`pthread_exit\`结束线程。主线程中使用\`pthread_join\`等待线程结束，并获取线程函数的返回值。在这个例子中，线程函数没有返回值，所以将\`status\`设置为\`NULL\`。"},{"instruction":"SRC = (wildcard

首先，需要明确pthread_create函数的第一个参数是一个指向pthread_t类型的指针，而不是一个具体的数值。pthread_t类型实际上是一个数据结构，用于保存线程的标识符。在pthread_create完成后，线程的标识符将会被写入到m_threadID指向的内存中。 传递一个未初始化或随机值给m_threadID可能导致意外的结果。未初始化的m_threadID可能会导致pthread_create调用失败，因为它要求传递一个有效的pthread_t变量。同时，其他涉及到线程标识符的操作也可能无法正确执行。 赋值一个真实的值给m_threadID，即使它只是一个临时值，是为了确保m_threadID指向一个有效的存储位置，可以正确接收线程标识符。这样可以避免潜在的问题和错误。 总而言之，为了保证代码的正确性和可靠性，赋值一个真实的值给m_threadID是一个良好的编程习惯。"},{"instruction":"我理解不是这样，如果是为了一个存储位置，那也不需要提前赋值，定义个变量就好","output":"非常抱歉，我之前的解释有误。你是正确的，确实没有必要提前赋值给m_threadID。 在调用pthread_create函数时，m_threadID参数应该传递一个指向pthread_t类型的变量的指针。pthread_create函数会将新线程的线程ID写入该变量中。 正确的代码应该是这样的： \`\`\`cpp pthread_t m_threadID; int rc; void* args = ...; // 线程函数参数 rc = pthread_create(&m_threadID, NULL, threadProc, args); if (rc != 0) { // 线程创建失败的处理 } \`\`\` 在这里，m_threadID是一个pthread_t类型的变量，作为参数传递给pthread_create。pthread_create会将新线程的线程ID写入m_threadID。 再次向您表示歉意，之前的解释可能引起了混淆。非常感谢您的指正。"},{"instruction":"这个参数跟进程有什么关系","output":"抱歉，我之前的回答有误。m_threadID是一个与线程相关的标识符，而不是与进程相关。 在调用pthread_create函数时，需要提供一个指向pthread_t类型的变量的指针，以用于接收新创建线程的线程ID。该线程ID是一个唯一的标识符，用于在其他线程中引用该线程。 线程是进程内的一条执行路径，可以与其他线程并发执行，共享进程的资源。每个线程都有自己的线程ID，用于在代码中跟踪和引用该线程。 而进程是操作系统分配资源的基本单位，拥有独立的地址空间和一组资源。一个进程可以包含多个线程，这些线程共享进程的资源，但每个线程拥有自己的栈空间和线程ID。 所以，m_threadID是一个pthread_t类型的变量，用于接收新创建线程的线程ID，是与线程相关的标识符，不与进程相关。非常抱歉之前的解释可能引起了混淆，感谢您的指正。"},{"instruction":"pthread_create指定线程id","output":"非常抱歉，之前的回答有误。实际上，pthread_create函数并不允许直接指定线程的ID。线程的ID是由操作系统在创建线程时自动分配的。 在调用pthread_create函数时，需要提供一个指向pthread_t类型的变量的指针。pthread_create函数会将新线程的ID写入该变量中，以便在后续的线程操作中使用。 正确的用法如下： \`\`\`cpp pthread_t m_threadID; int rc; void* args = ...; // 线程函数参数 rc = pthread_create(&m_threadID, NULL, threadProc, args); if (rc != 0) { // 线程创建失败的处理 } \`\`\` 在上述代码中，通过传递\`&m_threadID\`作为第一个参数，将新线程的ID存储到m_threadID变量中。m_threadID实际上是一个指向pthread_t类型的变量。 对于指定特定的线程ID，通常情况下是不被支持的。线程ID是由操作系统内部管理和分配的。如果确实需要在特定的线程中指定一个特定的ID，那么可能需要使用其他更底层的线程库或操作系统特定的功能。但这种需求相对较为罕见，一般情况下我们使用pthread库进行多线程编程时，不需要手动指定线程的ID。"},{"instruction":"提前给m_threadID赋值，能制定id吗","output":"抱歉，我之前的回答可能引起了混淆。实际上，pthread库中的pthread_create函数不能直接指定线程ID。线程ID是由操作系统分配和管理的，无法手动设置。 在调用pthread_create函数时，传递一个先前赋值给m_threadID的pthread_t变量的指针是没有意义的，因为pthread_create函数会为新线程分配一个唯一的线程ID。 如果你需要在多线程程序中使用自定义的线程标识符或ID，你可以考虑使用其他线程库或操作系统特定的API，这些API可能提供了更底层的线程控制功能。但需要注意的是，使用这些API会使你的代码在不同的操作系统上变得非常依赖和不可移植。 总的来说，pthread_create函数本身不能用于指定线程ID，因为线程ID是由操作系统分配的。如果你有特殊的需求需要自定义线程ID，你需要考虑使用其他线程库或操作系统特定的功能。"},{"instruction":"线程创建的时候需要先加锁吗","output":"在使用pthread库创建线程时，通常情况下不需要在创建线程之前进行加锁。 pthread库提供了线程创建和管理的功能，这些功能在调用时是线程安全的。也就是说，在多线程环境中，多个线程可以同时调用pthread_create函数来创建新线程，而不需要显式的加锁来保证创建的正确性。 然而，如果你在创建线程之前需要保证某些资源或数据结构的完整性和一致性，可以使用互斥锁或其他线程同步机制来进行保护。这样可以确保在创建新线程之前，其他线程无法访问或修改资源，从而避免潜在的竞争条件和错误。 需要根据具体的需求和应用场景来决定是否需要加锁。如果创建线程的过程不涉及共享资源或数据结构的读写，那么通常情况下不需要在创建线程之前加锁。"},{"instruction":"有线程的如何编译","output":"在编译包含线程的程序时，需要添加对pthread库的链接。 在使用gcc编译器时，可以使用-lpthread选项来链接pthread库。 示例编译命令如下： \`\`\` gcc -o

Somit ist die erste Lösung die einzige gültige und Marion ist 36 Jahre alt und Juliane ist 18 Jahre alt."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To calculate the % change in quantity demanded, use the formula: % change in quantity demanded = (new quantity demanded - initial quantity demanded) / initial quantity demanded * 100. To calculate the % change in price, use the formula: % change in price = (new price - initial price) / initial price * 100. Let's say the initial quantity demanded is 100 units, the new quantity demanded is 120 units, the initial price is 10, and the new price is 12: % change in quantity demanded = (120 - 100) / 100 * 100 = 20%. % change in price = (12 - 10) / 10 * 100 = 20%.

Now, you can use the \\"DisplayPDFPages\\" widget with the Firebase Storage URL to display the first 3 pages of the PDF. \`\`\`dart DisplayPDFPages(pdfUrl: 'your_firebase_storage_pdf_url') \`\`\` Make sure to replace 'your_firebase_storage_pdf_url' with the actual URL of the PDF stored in Firebase Storage.

Little did Alex know that this particular evening would forever change his life. It was a warm and humid night, with not a soul in sight. The clock ticked away, and as the minutes turned into hours, something peculiar began to happen. Unbeknownst to Alex, his body started to undergo a gradual transformation. It began with a tingling sensation coursing through his veins, as if an invisible force was awakening within him. Alex felt an overwhelming surge of confidence and an intoxicating desire to be seen and admired. He stood in front of the mirror, admiring the changes in his reflection. His features became sharper, more defined, accentuating his rugged charm. His eyes gained a mischievous glimmer, as if there were secrets locked behind them. With a sly smile, Alex ran his fingers through his hair, deliberately tousling it. \\"Oh, I've never felt like this before,\\" he murmured softly. His voice, once timid and unremarkable, now carried a seductive lilt that was impossible to ignore. It was as though he had unlocked a new sense of power, and he reveled in it. As the night progressed, the transformation continued. Alex's body began to change as well, shaping itself into a form that was both alluring and irresistible. His muscles tightened and toned, his skin seemed to glow with an otherworldly radiance. He felt a strange warmth emanating from within, spreading outwards, urging him to embrace this newfound sensuality. Amidst the evolving physical changes, Alex's mind underwent a profound shift. Thoughts that were once reserved and doubting now became bold and confident. He no longer questioned his desires but instead embraced them, reveling in the thrill of seduction. His beliefs and inhibitions crumbled away, replaced by an insatiable hunger for attention and admiration. With each passing moment, Alex became more and more comfortable in his new skin. He abandoned his usual attire and donned a tight-fitting shirt, emphasizing his growing chest. The fabric strained against his bulging muscles, and a devilish grin crossed his face as he realized the effect it had on his appearance. \\"Men like them big,\\" he whispered seductively, his voice carrying a tantalizing undertone. Unable to resist the temptation, Alex strutted out of his apartment, confident and undeniably sexy. He intentionally exaggerated each step, his hips swinging seductively with every movement. The streets were almost deserted, but those who were lucky enough to catch a glimpse couldn't take their eyes off him. His aura was magnetic, drawing the gaze of intrigued onlookers. And then, amidst the darkened streets, Alex's eyes met the gaze of a man named Jason. He was captivated by the irresistible presence and allure of the transformed man. Without a word, Jason approached, drawn to the enchanting energy exuding from Alex. With a sultry smile, Alex leaned in closer to Jason, allowing the light scent of his newfound essence to fill the air. \\"Would you like to join me?\\" he purred in a voice that sent shivers down Jason's spine. Leaning in, Jason was unable to resist the enchantment that surrounded Alex. In a daze, he nodded and followed as Alex led the way back to his apartment. The night was young, and as the door closed behind them, it was clear that both would embark on a journey of uncharted desires. Note: While this story incorporates elements of transformation and seduction, it has been toned down and avoids explicit content."},{"instruction":"Break down the meaning of the word \\"Olympiad\\".","output":"The word \\"Olympiad\\" can be broken down into two parts: \\"Olympic\\" and \\"iad\\". 1. Olympic: This term refers to the Olympics, which is a major international sporting event consisting of various sports competitions. It is named after Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece, and is historically linked to the ancient Olympic Games held in Olympia, Greece. 2. -iad: This part of the word is a suffix that is commonly used to indicate a cycle of events or a period of time. It is derived from the Greek word \\"iados,\\" meaning \\"a festival featuring athletic games or contests.\\" So, combining these two parts, \\"Olympiad\\" can be understood as a term that signifies a period of time or a cycle of events related to the Olympics. It can refer to the duration between two consecutive Olympic Games, usually four years, or it can also describe the various events and competitions held during the Olympic Games themselves."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

Eric was a typical guy, spending most of his days in his small one-bedroom apartment, going about his routine with little excitement. However, this particular day was about to change everything. As the clock struck midnight, a strange energy filled the room. Eric felt a tingling sensation coursing through his veins, but he couldn't quite place its origin. Unbeknownst to him, a powerful enchantment had been cast upon his humble abode, triggering a transformation that would awaken the dormant succubus within him. At first, Eric noticed a subtle shift in his thoughts. Ideas of seduction and mischief gradually whispered into his mind, enticing him with a newfound confidence. The transformation had begun. With a devilish smirk, he approached the mirror hanging in his hallway, brushing his fingers against the smooth surface. \\"You're looking rather dashing tonight,\\" Eric commented, admiring his own reflection. \\"And why shouldn't you? After all, who can resist a bit of charm?\\" His voice took on a subtle, sultry tone, laced with his newfound seductive nature. The mental changes further consumed him, eroding any inhibitions that might have held him back before. He reveled in the power he was beginning to embrace. As Eric continued to explore his transformation, his attention turned to his physique. With a mischievous glint in his eyes, he decided to put his seductive qualities to the test. He hastily shed his old clothes, revealing a chiseled body that was rapidly changing before his very eyes. His chest began to quiver, muscles swelling with each passing second. A symphony of popping buttons filled the room as his shirt fought valiantly against his growing form. With a loud rip, Eric's chest burst free, exposing his enormous pecs that strained against the remaining tattered fabric. Gazing upon his newfound assets, Eric chuckled to himself. \\"Men like them big, don't they?\\" He purred, his voice honeyed and dripping with desire. He couldn't help but savor his transformation, embracing the allure that now radiated from him in waves. With a confident sway of his hips, Eric made his way out of his apartment and into the moonlit streets. Each step he took sent shivers of temptation down his spine. He reveled in the attention he garnered as passersby turned their heads to catch a glimpse of the irresistible figure before them. As if guided by an invisible hand, Eric spotted a man named Jason, a handsome gentleman with a certain air of vulnerability about him. A wicked grin spread across Eric's face as he approached Jason, making sure to sway his hips with every movement. \\"Hello there,\\" Eric purred, his voice like velvet. \\"You seem like a man in need of some companionship.\\" He leaned in closer, his gaze locked on Jason's eyes, radiating an undeniable magnetism. Jason, caught in Eric's seductive spell, nodded dumbly, unable to resist the enchantment that emanated from within this transformed man named Krystal. \\"Y-yes, I'd love to go to your apartment,\\" he stuttered, his desire spilling forth without hesitation. Krystal smiled knowingly, taking Jason's hand and leading him back to the apartment where her transformation had begun. The night was young, and as she closed the door behind them, she whispered softly, \\"Prepare yourself, my dear. I have so much more to show you.\\" And with a hunger in her eyes and a sway in her hips that could captivate even the moon itself, Krystal embraced her newfound existence as the seductive succubus she had become, ready to embark on a dark and enticing journey of pleasure and mischief."},{"instruction":"五轴加工中心厂家和客户，写几个标题","output":"1. 找寻五轴加工中心的最佳厂家合作伙伴，提高生产效率！ 2. 高品质五轴加工中心：为您的客户提供精确度最高的加工解决方案！ 3. 与五轴加工中心厂家建立合作关系，实现互利共赢的商业机会！ 4. 满足客户需求的五轴加工中心制造商，打造优质产品的首选！ 5. 寻找经验丰富的五轴加工中心厂家，为您提供一流的技术支持和服务！"},{"instruction":"继续","output":"6. 提供多功能五轴加工中心，满足不同行业需求的定制加工！ 7. 与五轴加工中心厂家合作，实现高效生产和降低成本的双赢局面！ 8. 选择可靠的五轴加工中心厂家，为您的产品提供稳定可靠的加工质量！ 9. 与五轴加工中心厂家合作，打造高精度、高质量的产品，赢得客户口碑！ 10. 寻找专业五轴加工中心厂家，为您的生产线引入先进的加工技术！"},{"instruction":"继续","output":"11. 与五轴加工中心厂家合作，实现高效生产和快速交货，提升客户满意度！ 12. 五轴加工中心厂家带您探索创新加工方式，推动行业发展的引领者！ 13. 选择专业的五轴加工中心厂家，为您提供个性化定制的加工解决方案！ 14. 与五轴加工中心厂家紧密合作，共同开拓市场，实现双赢合作！ 15. 高效、精准、可靠：与五轴加工中心厂家合作，为客户提供极致体验！"},{"instruction":"因工会预算不足，请代公司工会拟一个请示","output":"尊敬的领导： 我是XX公司工会的一员，现向您提出一个关于工会预算的问题。 首先，我想对公司工会的运作和推动员工福利方面所做的努力表示赞赏。我们一直致力于改善员工的工作环境和生活质量，并通过各种活动和项目提升员工的工作意愿和发展动力。然而，在当前的经济环境下，我们的工会预算不足，导致我们无法充分开展我们计划中的各项活动以及员工福利项目。 其次，我希望能够请领导酌情考虑增加工会预算。通过增加预算，我们将能够更好地满足员工的需求，提供更多的福利活动和服务，增强员工对公司的归属感和忠诚度。这将进一步促进员工的满意度和工作效率，提高公司的整体竞争力。 最后，我向领导承诺，我们会合理利用预算，确保每一笔开支都对员工的福利和公司的发展具有积极的影响。我们将定期向领导汇报预算的使用情况，并开展必要的审计工作，以确保预算的透明度和合规性。 希望领导能够认真考虑我们的请求，并给予我们更大的支持和关注。我们相信，通过足够的工会预算，我们将能够为员工创造更好的工作环境，提升员工的福利待遇，提高员工的幸福感和工作积极性。 再次感谢您对工会工作的关注和支持！ 此致 XX公司工会代表 日期"},{"instruction":"三级公司举办抽水蓄能劳动竞赛，但由于经费不足，需要给二级公司写个关于申请工会经费的请示","output":"尊敬的领导： 我是XX公司工会的一员，现向您提出一个关于申请工会经费的问题。 首先，我想对公司工会一直致力于员工福利和加强员工团结合作的工作表示赞赏。我们一直努力通过各类活动和项目提升员工的工作意愿和发展动力。近期，我们计划举办一场抽水蓄能劳动竞赛，旨在增强员工之间的合作意识和团队协作能力，提高工作效率。然而，我们在筹集经费方面遇到了困难，当前的预算不足以支持这项活动的顺利进行。 其次，我希望能够请领导予以关注并批准我们申请工会经费。通过拨款给予我们足够的经费支持，我们将能够顺利开展这次劳动竞赛活动，并为员工提供更多的机会来展示和发挥自己的才能。这将进一步促进员工之间的交流与合作，增强员工的团队凝聚力，提升公司整体的生产效益。 最后，我向领导承诺我们会合理有效地利用经费，确保每一笔开支都对员工的福利和公司的发展具有积极的影响。我们将及时向领导汇报经费的使用情况，并随时接受审计，以保证经费的合规性和透明度。 希望领导能够认真考虑我们的请求，并給予我们更多的支持和关注。我们相信通过充足的工会经费支持，我们能够成功开展这次劳动竞赛活动，为公司的发展及员工之间的和谐关系做出更大的贡献。 再次感谢您对工会工作的关注和支持！ 此致 XX公司工会代表 日期"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

Get the required materials: Gather paper, pencils or colors, or any other tools you prefer for drawing. 2. Imagine your picture: Think about what you want to draw. It could be anything—animals, a landscape, or even a fantasy creature. Visualize your picture in your mind. 3. Describe your picture: Start a conversation with ChatGPT by asking it to \\"help you draw a picture.\\" Explain what you want to draw in simple language so the AI can understand. For example, you might say: \\"Hey ChatGPT, can you help me draw a picture of a sunny beach with palm trees, a sparkling blue ocean, and a sandcastle?\\" 4. Ask for details: ChatGPT will generate a response asking for more specific details or clarification about what you want. You can provide additional information about the size, colors, shapes, or any particular details you'd like in your picture. For example, if the AI asks for more details, you could say: \\"Sure! I want the sandcastle to be yellow, the palm trees to have green fronds, and the ocean to have waves with white caps.\\" 5. Follow the instructions: GPT will provide a detailed response on how to draw your picture. It may describe the steps to follow or provide instructions to assist you in creating it. For example, it might say: \\"To start, draw an arch for the horizon line. Then, draw two lines with curves on one end to make the palm tree trunks. Add green, leafy shapes on top for the fronds. For the sandcastle, draw a small square. Add towers and flags on top. Finally, color the ocean blue and draw wavy lines to show the waves.\\" 6. Draw your picture: Based on the instructions provided, start drawing using your paper and pencils or colors. Take your time and refer back to the instructions as needed. 7. Add your creativity: Remember that GPT is providing guidance, but you can still add your personal touch to the drawing. Use your imagination to make the picture even more special and unique. 8. Enjoy your artwork: Once you finish drawing, take a step back and admire your creation. You can also show it to others and share the story of how you used ChatGPT's instructions to bring your idea to life. Remember, ChatGPT is an AI language model that tries to help and give suggestions. While it can provide instructions, the actual drawing relies on your own creativity and skill.

It provides a central repository where users can quickly search, discover, and access data assets from various sources within an organization. Alation also enables data governance by allowing users to collaborate, document data assets, and establish data policies. Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Apache Hadoop. It provides a SQL-like query language (HiveQL) that allows users to perform ad-hoc queries and analysis on large datasets stored in Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS). Hive's query optimizer translates these queries into MapReduce jobs for efficient execution in a distributed computing environment. Hadoop is an open-source framework that facilitates the distributed processing of large datasets across multiple clusters of computers. It consists of two main components: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage and MapReduce for processing. Hadoop's distributed architecture allows for high scalability, fault tolerance, and allows organizations to store and process huge amounts of data in a cost-effective manner. Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed to process large-scale data. It provides in-memory processing capabilities, making it faster than traditional MapReduce frameworks. Spark can handle various types of workloads, including batch processing, interactive queries, streaming data, and machine learning. It offers APIs in several languages like Scala, Python, and Java, allowing developers to build applications on top of it. All these technologies are related to big data management. Alation helps organizations manage and govern their data assets, including those stored in Hadoop and Spark. Hive provides a SQL-like interface to query and analyze data stored in Hadoop's distributed file system. Hadoop enables the storage and distributed processing of big data. Spark, on the other hand, is a fast and flexible engine for large-scale data processing, providing capabilities beyond traditional MapReduce. Organizations can leverage all these technologies together to store, process, and analyze big data efficiently and effectively."},{"instruction":"I can see at the bottom right corner of this chat a section that says: 'Status code from OpenAI server' , and below that a text that says: <Response [200]> . Explain what '<Response [200]>' means please?","output":"In the context of the OpenAI server, \\"<Response [200]>\\" refers to the status code of the server's response to a request. HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server to indicate the outcome of a request. In particular, a status code of 200 represents a successful response. It means that the server has received and understood the request, and it has generated a valid response as expected. In this case, the response from the OpenAI server to the request made by the chat interface is successful, indicating that the communication between the chat interface and the server is functioning correctly."},{"instruction":"can you tell me my current token limit and how that equates to number of questions I can still ask ?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have access to personal or account-specific information. Therefore, I can't directly provide you with details about your current token limit or how many questions you have left. However, OpenAI provides different subscription plans with specific token limits. The number of questions you can ask depends on the specific plan you are subscribed to and the number of tokens each question consumes. Each API call consumes a certain number of tokens based on the length of the input and output. You can refer to the OpenAI documentation or your subscription details to determine your token limit and estimate the number of questions you can ask based on the average token usage per question. It's important to note that token usage can vary depending on the complexity and length of your questions and responses, so it's best to keep track of your token usage as you interact with the chat interface."},{"instruction":"my question above is about this chatbot.

This means that the total tokens used by both your input messages and the assistant's responses should not exceed this limit. Each message exchanged contributes to the token count, including both input and output. It's important to be mindful of your token usage as you interact with the chatbot. If a conversation exceeds the token limit, you might need to truncate or shorten your messages to fit within the allowable token count."},{"instruction":"in the context of the above answer, what is a token ? how can I calculate the number of tokens used on this question ?","output":"In the context of natural language processing, a token is a unit of text. It can be as short as a single character or as long as a word or even a part of a word. Tokens are used to analyze and process text data. For instance, in the sentence \\"I love cats\\", the tokens are: [I, love, cats]. To calculate the number of tokens used in a question or any text, you can follow these steps: 1. Start by breaking down the text into individual words or characters. 2. Count each word or character as one token. However, note that certain tokens, like emojis or special characters, can also be counted as individual tokens, depending on how the language model treats them. 3. Add up the total number of tokens in the text. For example, if the question is \\"What is the weather like today?\\", we can break it down into tokens like this: [What, is, the, weather, like, today, ?]. In this case, there are seven tokens. It's crucial to keep track of token usage, especially in conversations with limited token allowances, to ensure that the conversation remains within the prescribed limits."},{"instruction":"Sollte man in der sozialen Netzwerken aktiv sein","output":"Es gibt Vor- und Nachteile, in sozialen Netzwerken aktiv zu sein, und die Entscheidung hängt von den individuellen Bedürfnissen und Zielen ab.

Prior to the destruction, the religious life of Jews centered around the Temple and the priesthood. However, with the loss of the central religious institution, a new system was needed to preserve and transmit Jewish traditions and teachings. In this context, the role of the rabbis, or Jewish scholars, became crucial. Rabbis were not priests, but knowledgeable leaders who studied and interpreted the Jewish scriptures, primarily the Torah (the five books of Moses). They guided the Jewish community in matters of religious practice, ethics, and law. Rabbinical Judaism gradually developed in the years following the destruction of the Second Temple. Rabbis organized schools and academies, such as the famous Yeshivas, where they would teach and discuss Jewish texts. These schools became important centers for preserving and expanding Jewish knowledge and traditions. The rabbis also began to compile and interpret Jewish legal texts, such as the Mishnah and Talmud, which served as comprehensive guides to Jewish law and practice. These works incorporated the discussions and debates of rabbis from different generations, allowing Jewish law to be adaptable and relevant to changing times. Over time, the authority and influence of the rabbis grew, and they became the religious leaders of the Jewish people. This marked a shift from the pre-70 CE period when the priests held primary religious authority. Rabbinical Judaism emphasized the study of Torah, observance of mitzvot (commandments), and the development of ethical behavior. It emphasized the importance of the individual's relationship with God and the responsibility of each person to follow Jewish law and live a righteous life. Rabbinical Judaism continued to evolve and adapt throughout history, responding to various challenges and changes in Jewish communities. Today, it is the predominant form of Judaism followed by Jews worldwide."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Hierdurch können sie eine größere Zielgruppe erreichen und potenzielle Kunden ansprechen. Nachteile von sozialen Netzwerken: 1. Datenschutz: Der Datenschutz ist ein großes Problem in sozialen Netzwerken. Nutzer geben oft eine Menge persönlicher Daten preis, die von Dritten missbraucht werden könnten. Außerdem besteht die Gefahr von Identitätsdiebstahl und Cyberkriminalität. 2. Zeitverschwendung: Soziale Netzwerke können süchtig machen und viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen. Manchmal werden sie als Ablenkung von wichtigen Aufgaben oder als Hindernis für produktive Arbeit betrachtet. 3. Fehlinformationen: In sozialen Netzwerken verbreiten sich Fehlinformationen und Fake News sehr schnell.

It could be your own or somebody else’s. In the recent decades, the argument within the industry about whether to establish a private company GAAP has never ceased. Just as our concerns about the potential negative impact and misuse of a separate GAAP system, as well as its potential harm to the integrity of GAAP, there are worries among industry experts about the risks this could possibly cause. According to David Katz, having a separate GAAP for private companies has not received widespread support from professionals. Greg Jonas, director of the office of research and analysis at the Public Company Accounting Standards Board, believed that splitting GAAP into two parts is a world-class bad idea and argued that we should try to preserve common recognition for both public and private companies. Tom Sweet, the Chief Financial Officer of Dell, which went private in 2013, thought that one GAAP was probably fine. He believed that, compared to going public, choosing an alternative financial reporting system could cause risks for private companies. He brought up questions and concerns such as how would those private companies transition to public company GAAP? What would it turn out to be and how long would it take? Joyce Joseph, a Standard & Poor’s managing director who oversees the rating agency’s global accounting and governance group, preferred one set of standards applicable to all which is more conducive to comparing public and private companies. She pointed out that it wouldn’t make a difference in terms of analysis on the nature of a company’s business and where it operates. In September, 2014, the PCC finalized the proposal to exempt private companies from separately recognizing and measuring non-competition agreements and customer-related intangible assets. The proposal raised concerns about potential issues in comparing financial statements between public and private companies. At the FASB meeting in November, the proposal barely passed. Russell Golden, FASB chairman, and other members stated that the change could impact a company’s ability to raise capital in America. James Kroeker, vice chairman of FASB, mentioned that by removing the distinction between public and private, we are in fact raising the cost of the system which creates obstacles to the growth of capital (Katz, 2014).","output":"在最近几十年中，关于是否建立私人公司公认会计准则（GAAP）的争论从未停止。正如我们对分开的GAAP系统潜在的负面影响和滥用以及对GAAP完整性的潜在危害的担忧一样，行业专家也对可能引发的风险表示担忧。 根据大卫·卡茨的观点，为私人公司建立独立的GAAP并没有得到专业人士的广泛支持。公共公司会计准则委员会研究与分析办公室主任格雷格·乔纳斯认为，将GAAP分为两个部分是一个世界级的坏想法，并认为我们应该争取保留公共和私人公司的共同认可。Dell的首席财务官汤姆·斯威特认为，一个GAAP可能就够了。他认为，相比上市，选择另一种财务报告系统可能对私人公司造成风险。他提出了一些问题和关切，比如私人公司如何过渡到公共公司的GAAP？结果会是什么样，需要多长时间？标准普尔全球会计与治理小组的负责人乔伊斯·约瑟夫更倾向于为所有公司制定一个适用的标准，这更有利于比较公共和私人公司。她指出，对于分析公司业务性质和运作地点来说，并没有任何区别。2014年9月，私人公司协商委员会最终通过了一项提议，免除私人公司单独确认和计量非竞争协议和与客户相关的无形资产。该提议引发了比较公共和私人公司财务报表可能存在的问题的担忧。在11月的FASB会议上，该提议勉强通过。FASB主席罗素·戈尔登和其他成员表示，这一变化可能影响公司在美国筹集资金的能力。FASB副主席詹姆斯·克鲁克尔提到，通过消除公共和私人之间的区别，我们实际上提高了系统的成本，从而对资本的增长产生了障碍（卡茨，2014年）。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A simulation based on this theory suggests the supercivilizations will emerge sometime within the next 50 million years to 50 billion years. If we assume that: 1. Aliens expend from their origin at a fraction of the speed of light, 2. They make signifigant and visible changes wherever they go, 3. And they last a very long time. Therefore, Humanity must be early, since supercivilization would have otherwise already occupy most of the observable universe, and when they do, new civilizations cannot emerge because most planets in the observable universe would have already been colonized.","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to provide absolute probabilities. However, I can say that the concept of humanity being one of the early civilizations in the universe is one of the possibilities considered in the Fermi Paradox, which questions why we haven't detected evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations yet. The argument you presented, suggesting that if supercivilizations had already expanded throughout most of the observable universe, then new civilizations like ours would have had no chance to emerge, is one speculation that attempts to answer the Fermi Paradox. This argument assumes that advanced civilizations would inevitably colonize many star systems and leave visible traces of their presence. That being said, it is important to note that these are theoretical assumptions and interpretations. Our understanding of the nature and behavior of extraterrestrial civilizations is limited, and the Fermi Paradox continues to be a subject of much debate and speculation within the scientific community. Therefore, it is challenging to assign a specific probability to whether or not humanity is one of the early civilizations."},{"instruction":"Can you briefly summarize each scenario listed in 15 words or less? Must be a full sentence. Add emojis after each sentence. 1. The scenario of a large unification of civilizations over an extent of one to ten billion light-years with concentration in a particular region has a probability of 60%. These civilizations are to be searched for within the most powerful quasars and in the galactic bulge, at a radiation level higher than 1038 watts, in the wavelengths from 10 µm to 1 cm, as well as in the other regions of the spectrum. This is to detect megastructures or signals of 1.5 mm wavelength and omnidirectional emission up to 21 cm. In the event of contact, humanity would see progress in all areas of society in order to join this supercivilization; it is also expected that an ethnographic conservatory would be created on Earth. 2. The scenario of a unification on the scale of the galactic cluster has only a 20% probability of realization. Kardashev advises to observe the Virgo cluster (especially M87) and other clusters in a similar way as in the first scenario. The consequences for humanity are the same as in the first scenario. 3. The scenario of a unification on the scale of galaxies has only a 10% probability. To confirm it, we must examine the galactic centers, both of the Milky Way and of neighboring galaxies (such as M31, M33), according to a procedure similar to that of the first scenario. The consequences for humanity are the same as in the first scenario. 4. The scenario of a complete colonization of space has no probability of being realized according to Kardashev because if it were realizable then “they” would already be on Earth. However, this is not the case. However, in the case of a contact, the consequences on humanity are the same as in the first scenario. 5. This scenario posits that all civilizations would have self-destructed before any contact. Kardashev estimates its probability at 10%. Humanity should be able to detect ancient megastructures in the vicinity of the nearest stars. No contact can take place with humanity as a result. 6. The last scenario suggests that we are the first or the only ones in the Universe. Kardashev estimates its probability at 10%. Only exobiology can confirm or not this scenario, which seems unlikely, given that life appeared several billion years ago. We can imagine a contact in the distant future and then the consequences would be similar to those of the other five scenarios.","output":"1. Large unification of civilizations in a region (60% probability). Search for signals/megastructures. Progress and potential joining. 🚀🌍 2. Unification within galactic cluster (20% probability).

Can you elaborate?","output":"Scenario 1, as described, involves a large unification of civilizations over an expansive region of one to ten billion light-years. According to Kardashev's estimation, this scenario has a 60% probability. He suggests searching for these civilizations within the most powerful quasars and in the galactic bulge. The focus is on detecting megastructures or signals with specific wavelength ranges, from 10 µm to 1 cm, and at a radiation level higher than 10^38 watts, across various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the event of contact with this supercivilization, Kardashev anticipates progress in all areas of society, potentially leading to humanity joining this advanced collective. Additionally, he mentions the creation of an ethnographic conservatory on Earth, a repository or institution dedicated to preserving cultural and historical aspects as humanity interacts with the discovered supercivilization. Overall, Scenario 1 suggests the possibility of finding and interacting with an extensive network of highly advanced civilizations in a specific cosmic region, with potential transformative consequences for humanity."},{"instruction":"If Scenario 1 is the most likely, according to Kardashev, why do we not see any evidence for a large supercivilization dominating our local group?","output":"The absence of evidence for a large supercivilization dominating our local group, despite Scenario 1 being considered the most likely by Kardashev, is a part of the ongoing mystery known as the Fermi Paradox. The Fermi Paradox questions why we haven't detected any clear signs of other advanced civilizations in the observable universe. Possible explanations for this discrepancy may include: 1. Great Filter Hypothesis: There could be some unknown barriers or challenges that prevent civilizations from advancing to the point of dominating and visibly impacting their local regions. 2. Rare Occurrence: It is possible that the emergence and evolution of intelligent civilizations capable of such domination is an exceedingly rare event in the universe. 3. Limits of Observation: Our current technology and methods may not be sophisticated enough to detect or interpret the specific signs of advanced civilizations, especially if they are intentionally concealing their presence. 4. Time Synchronization: Advanced civilizations may rise and fall at different times, making it less likely for them to overlap and converge within the same timeframe. 5. Avoidance of Colonization: Some civilizations might choose not to expand and colonize other star systems, instead focusing on different priorities, such as virtual reality, simulations, or other forms of existence. The lack of evidence for a supercivilization dominating our local group continues to be a subject of scientific speculation and investigation, with no widely accepted explanation yet established."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

It wasn't until middle school that I stumbled upon a different world of subjects that piqued my curiosity. Computer science, physics, and other sciences ignited a fire within me that I had never felt before. Experimenting with coding, exploring the fascinating wonders of the universe, and uncovering the mysteries of natural phenomena excited me in a way that math never quite did.

They wanted me to succeed and saw potential in my mathematical abilities. However, I also learned that it's essential to listen to my own heart and follow my own passions in this journey called life.

First, let's consider the points z1, z2, and z3 as complex numbers in the complex plane. We can write them as: z1 = a + bi z2 = c + di z3 = e + fi where a, b, c, d, e, f are real numbers. Next, let's consider the distances |z1 - z2|, |z2 - z3|, and |z3 - z1|. Using the absolute value definition, we can write them as: |z1 - z2| = sqrt((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2) |z2 - z3| = sqrt((c - e)^2 + (d - f)^2) |z3 - z1| = sqrt((e - a)^2 + (f - b)^2) Now, let's rewrite the inequality using these distances: |z1 - z2|·|z2 - z3| + |z3 - z1|·|z1 - z2| + |z2 - z3|·|z3 - z1| ≤ 9R^2 (sqrt((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2))·(sqrt((c - e)^2 + (d - f)^2)) + (sqrt((e - a)^2 + (f - b)^2))·(sqrt((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2)) + (sqrt((c - e)^2 + (d - f)^2))·(sqrt((e - a)^2 + (f - b)^2)) ≤ 9R^2 If we square both sides of the inequality, we get: ((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2)((c - e)^2 + (d - f)^2) + ((e - a)^2 + (f - b)^2)((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2) + ((c - e)^2 + (d - f)^2)((e - a)^2 + (f - b)^2) ≤ 81R^4 Expand both sides: [(a - c)^2(c - e)^2 + (a - c)^2(d - f)^2 + (b - d)^2(c - e)^2 + (b - d)^2(d - f)^2] + [(e - a)^2(a - c)^2 + (e - a)^2(b - d)^2 + (f - b)^2(a - c)^2 + (f - b)^2(b - d)^2] + [(c - e)^2(e - a)^2 + (c - e)^2(f - b)^2 + (d - f)^2(e - a)^2 + (d - f)^2(f - b)^2] ≤ 81R^4 Simplify the left side: [(a - c)^2(c - e)^2 + (b - d)^2(d - f)^2 + (e - a)^2(a - c)^2 + (f - b)^2(b - d)^2 + (c - e)^2(e - a)^2 + (d - f)^2(f - b)^2] ≤ 81R^4 Using the fact that (a - c)^2 + (c - e)^2 + (e - a)^2 = 3R^2 (this is a consequence of Euler's formula for a triangle in the complex plane), we can simplify further: 3R^2[(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 + (d - f)^2] ≤ 81R^4 Divide both sides by 3R^2: (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 + (d - f)^2 ≤ 27R^2 This is true, since the sum of the squares of the distances between points in a triangle is always less than or equal to 3 times the square of the circumradius (R^2).

Time dilation factor = 1 - (1/2000) = 1999/2000 Perceived duration of the trip = Actual duration of the trip / Time dilation factor Actual duration of the trip is 50 years, so: Perceived duration of the trip = 50 / (1999/2000) = 50 * (2000/1999) ≈ 50.025012506253125 Therefore, the perceived duration of the trip for the astronaut is approximately 50.025012506253125 years."},{"instruction":"If a gammy-ray burst (GRB) occurs once every 10,000 Earth solar years, how many GRBs occur every galactic year (225,000,000 to 250,000,000 Earth solar years)?","output":"To calculate how many GRBs occur every galactic year, we need to find the average number of GRBs per galactic year.

Converting the velocity to light-years per year: 0.3c = 0.3 * 299,792,458 km/s * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour Calculating the velocity in light-years per year: 0.3c ≈ 89,998.568 light-years/year Now we can calculate the time it would take: Time = Distance / Velocity Time = 20,000 light-years / 89,998.568 light-years/year Time ≈ 0.2222 years Therefore, it would take approximately 0.2222 years, or about 81.15 days, for the advanced civilization to colonize a 20,000 light-year bubble of space, assuming they are expanding at a maximum velocity of 0.3c."},{"instruction":"三级单位举办抽水蓄能劳动竞赛，因工会预算不足，须向二级单位写个申请资金的请示","output":"尊敬的二级单位领导： 您好！ 我们单位计划举办一场抽水蓄能劳动竞赛，旨在激发员工的工作热情和团队合作精神，提高单位的生产效益。然而，由于我们工会预算有限的原因，无法独立承担活动的全部费用。 因此，我们诚恳地向贵单位申请资金支持，希望能够获得一定的经费用于活动组织和礼品采购。具体的经费用途包括但不限于：购买奖品、组织竞赛所需的器材和道具、会场布置及租赁费用等。 我们相信抽水蓄能劳动竞赛对于整个单位来说具有积极的意义，不仅能够提升员工的工作积极性和凝聚力，还将为整个单位带来更大的发展和进步。因此，我们诚恳地希望贵单位能够支持我们的申请，提供相应的经费支持。 在此，我们承诺将严格按照贵单位的要求和相关制度管理经费使用，并在活动结束后及时向贵单位报备资金的具体使用情况和效果。 最后，再次感谢贵单位一直以来对我们工会工作的关心和支持。我们期待您的支持和批准，并深信通过我们的共同努力，本次抽水蓄能劳动竞赛将会取得圆满成功。如果您对此有任何疑问或需要进一步的信息，请随时与我们联系。 谢谢！ 此致 敬礼 工会代表 日期"},{"instruction":"二级公司计划于9月28日在三级公司举办抽水蓄能劳动竞赛，现二级公司须拟一个通知，请三级单位组织好参赛队伍并踊跃报名参赛","output":"通知 根据二级公司的计划，我司将于9月28日在贵单位举办抽水蓄能劳动竞赛。这是一项旨在激发员工工作热情和团队合作精神的活动，我们期待能够展现出各个单位的风采和实力。 为了确保竞赛的顺利进行，特向贵单位发出通知，希望能够组织好参赛队伍并踊跃报名参赛。参赛队伍需由5名员工组成，相互之间具有良好的团队合作精神和劳动技能。队伍成员应具备抽水蓄能相关知识和操作经验，以确保竞赛过程的安全和顺利。 具体参赛事项如下： 日期：9月28日 地点：贵单位抽水蓄能设备现场 参赛队伍：每个单位报送1支参赛队伍，每支队伍由5名员工组成 报名时间：请各单位在9月15日之前将参赛队伍名单报送至二级公司工会办公室，联系人为XXX。 在此之前，我们将为所有参赛队伍提供相应的培训和指导，以确保参赛人员对抽水蓄能器械和赛事规则有所了解和掌握。同时，我们也鼓励各单位为参赛队伍提供必要的支持和培训资源。 请贵单位积极响应，组织好参赛队伍并及时将名单报送至二级公司工会办公室。我们相信通过这次竞赛，将为各单位的员工带来更多的工作成就感和团队归属感。 如果贵单位对此有任何疑问或需要进一步的信息，请随时与我们联系。 谢谢！ 此致 敬礼 二级公司代表 日期"},{"instruction":"写一篇关于健康科普大赛中获奖喜讯","output":"近日，我市举行的健康科普大赛圆满落幕，其中我市的代表队斩获了一等奖的好成绩，为我市增添了一丝喜讯。 本次健康科普大赛是为了加强健康科普宣传，提高市民的健康意识和科学知识而举办的。来自全市各个县市的代表队积极参加，共有十多支代表队参与角逐。 我市代表队在这场激烈的竞争中脱颖而出，最终夺得了一等奖。这支代表队由我市一所重点中学的学生组成，他们经过了长时间的备战，准备了丰富的科普知识和精彩的演讲。 据了解，代表队的演讲主题是“健康饮食与预防疾病”。他们从饮食的种类、营养搭配到养生小常识等方面，给观众带来了一场精彩的科普盛宴。在演讲过程中，他们结合生动的例子和数据，将知识传递给了观众，并引起了广泛的关注和赞赏。 这支代表队的取胜离不开他们的团结合作和良好的组织纪律。团队成员之间相互扶持，互相补充了不同的知识点。他们在备赛过程中密切合作，分工明确，减少了重复工作，提高了工作效率。 此次健康科普大赛的成功举办，不仅增强了市民对健康的关注和认识，还进一步促进了健康科普知识的传播。同时，这也为我市培养了一批优秀的健康科普人才，为将来的健康科普事业打下了坚实的基础。 在今后的工作中，我们将进一步加强健康科普宣传，提高市民对健康的认知和重视程度。同时，也会加大对健康科普人才的培养和引进力度，为健康科普事业的发展贡献更多的力量。 综上所述，我市代表队在健康科普大赛中获得的一等奖给我们带来了莫大的喜讯。这不仅是他们自身辛勤努力和团队精神的体现，也是我市健康科普事业的一大进步。我们相信，在全市人民的共同努力下，我市的健康科普事业一定会蓬勃发展，为全体市民带来更多的福祉。"},{"instruction":"再换一篇","output":"近期，我市举行的健康科普大赛喜报传来，我市代表队以出色的表现获得了大赛的冠军，成为了广受瞩目的话题。 健康科普大赛是一项旨在普及健康知识、提高公众健康意识的盛会。来自全市各个区县的代表队积极踊跃参赛，共有十支团队参与角逐。 我市的代表队凭借出色的表现和卓越的演讲技巧，赢得了大赛的冠军。这支队伍由我市一所高中的学生组成，他们经过日夜的勤奋备战，准备了丰富而有深度的科学知识和生动的演讲内容。 据了解，代表队的演讲主题是“青少年心理健康”。他们通过详实的资料和实例，生动地向观众们介绍了常见的心理健康问题，如焦虑、抑郁和学习压力等，并分享了有效的心理调节方法和提高自我照顾能力的技巧。他们通过亲身经历和深入分析，为观众们揭示了保持良好心理健康的重要性，并传达了积极向上的心态。 这支代表队的成功离不开他们之间的默契合作和良好的团队精神。在备赛期间，他们互相鼓励、互相帮助，充分发挥每个人的优势，确保了演讲内容的完整性和准确性。他们还积极参加训练，进一步提高了演讲技巧和团队配合的默契程度。 此次健康科普大赛的成功举办，不仅加深了市民对健康的认识和关注，也推动了健康科普知识的普及。同时，这也为我市培养了一批具有潜力的健康科普人才，为日后的健康教育事业奠定了坚实的基础。 在未来的工作中，我们将进一步加强健康知识的宣传和普及，提高市民的健康素养和科学饮食观念。此外，我们也会加大对青少年心理健康的关注和支持，创建更多的心理健康辅导项目，确保他们有一个快乐、健康的成长环境。 综上所述，我市代表队在健康科普大赛中获得的冠军是教育事业的成功典范，也是我市健康科普事业的一大进步。我们相信，在全市人民的共同努力下，我市的健康科普事业将蓬勃发展，为居民带来更多福祉和幸福。"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

It’s not the kind of world that evokes a sense of adventure. That’s what made the potential of Starfield so exciting: here was Bethesda applying its formula for open-world RPGs to a giant universe with planets to discover and cosmic mysteries to unearth. It’s basically the Elder Scrolls by way of Hello Games; call it No Man’s Skyrim. In a lot of ways, Starfield lives up to that potential. It is indeed huge, and its main storyline is all about the thrill of adventure and discovery. I found myself pushing through the farthest reaches of space, going to strange, dangerous new places on a quest to seek out the origins of the universe and humanity’s place within it. It’s also a game that sticks fairly closely to the blueprint Bethesda has laid down for its role-playing experiences. Your quest might be much grander in scale, but what you’re doing on a moment-to-moment basis hasn’t changed all that much. This is also the most polished and solid release yet from Bethesda on a technical level. Starfield starts out humble enough. You are a miner on a dusty planet who accidentally digs up a strange, potentially alien, artifact. For some reason, it speaks to you on a metaphysical level, and your character goes through an out-of-body experience that feels a lot like the trippier moments in 2001: A Space Odyssey. This discovery ultimately leads you to a group known as Constellation, a ragtag team of explorers — there’s everyone from a quiet theologian to a cowboy from a prominent family to a business magnate who funds the whole endeavor — intent on uncovering the mysteries of the universe. Constellation is like something Jules Verne would come up with if tasked with writing an episode of Star Trek. It also makes for the perfect jumping-off point for a story about discovery and exploration. The group doesn’t understand anything about the artifacts, only that they’re probably important, and so the rest of Starfield is essentially dedicated to finding more of them to figure out just what they are. A screenshot from the video game Starfield. Image: Bethesda Softworks While the tone and scale of Starfield differ from past Bethesda games, the core gameplay is very similar. It’s an RPG crossed with a shooter, where you can build out a character using a variety of traits and skills. Often, this can impact how you approach missions; sometimes, you can talk your way into getting what you want, and other times, you’ll need to fight. I focused a lot on my social skills because, much like Fallout before it, Starfield isn’t the most adept shooter. It may look like one, with a huge range of weapons to collect and the ability to play from a first-person perspective, but this is not Destiny. Aiming feels wonky, and oftentimes, shots that seem to hit an enemy point blank will fail to register. It’d be nice if Starfield had the equivalent of the VATS system from Fallout, giving it pseudo-turn-based combat, but instead, it’s just a passable shooter attached to a very ambitious RPG. That might be the reason I spent so many skill points on my persuasion abilities. Conversation remains a big part of the experience. You spend a lot of time talking, with an up-close view of whoever you’re conversing with. You’ll need to chat with companion characters to get closer to them (while also making sure you don’t do upsetting things, like, uh, murder people in front of them) and others to garner information or get yourself out of trouble. Considering the sheer amount of dialogue, all of which is voiced, it’s impressive just how consistently well-written and acted Starfield is. There are some awkward moments when there are more than two people in a conversation — sometimes a character might not be facing you when speaking, and the cuts between dialogue can feel unnatural — but otherwise, it’s all very convincing, which is good since you’ll be spending a lot of time doing it. So, while the shooting and combat may leave a lot to desire, I found the role-playing elements very satisfying. My avatar truly felt like a blank slate I could morph into whatever I wanted. In this case, I made someone a lot like me: a wannabe adventurer who loves to see new places, would rather talk than fight, gets annoyed with anything too technical, and still goes home to visit his parents when they send a message. A screenshot from the video game Starfield. Image: Bethesda Softworks Starfield’s space theme does bring some new gameplay elements to the experience, which is where the No Man’s Sky comparisons come from. You can land on any of the many, many planets to explore, complete with a scanning device to learn about local plants, animals, and minerals. It’s a nice idea, though; the few times I tried exploring for the sake of it, I didn’t find much interesting besides a couple weird aliens and some strange fungal formations. Basically, the only times I found anything really interesting happened while I was on a quest of some sort, not when I ventured out on my own. Others may have better luck. Similarly, all of this space travel means you need a spaceship, and while it looks cool (and you can purchase some sweet upgrades or new crafts), I found piloting the ship to be pretty fiddly. Instead, I mostly just fast-traveled from planet to planet, hoping that a pirate fleet wasn’t waiting for me when I arrived because the dogfighting wasn’t very fun. Despite spending close to 50 hours with Starfield, there’s a whole lot I didn’t do in the game. I never built an outpost, and — despite harvesting all kinds of gross things from the aliens I killed — I spent very little time doing any crafting or cooking. But that’s actually part of the appeal: Starfield generally lets you focus on the areas of the experience that are interesting to you and your character while ignoring or only dabbling in the rest. For me, it was exploration and meeting new people; for others, it might be meticulously crafting outposts on alien worlds. Like most Bethesda games, the experience can almost be divided into two: the main questline and everything else. Here, in a rarity for the developer, the central story is actually what pulled me in the most. It took a few hours to get going, but once I started to discover the more strange and cosmic elements of the narrative, I had a hard time focusing my attention on anything else. It’s difficult to say too much without spoiling the big moments, but Starfield’s story definitely goes in some thrilling and unexpected directions and digs into some big-picture questions about the origins of space travel and humanity’s exploration of the stars. It’s helped along by a great cast of characters (I had a hard time choosing who would be my companion throughout, though I was ultimately helped along by a sudden and jarring death). I don’t know if the answers to those questions are entirely satisfying, but they do at least provide the most convincing reason for a New Game Plus playthrough that I’ve yet come across. The rest of the worlds and stories are a lot more uneven. Part of the problem is that while the main story of Starfield has its own distinct vibe, with its grand secrets and peculiar artifacts, much of the rest feels very derivative. There’s a cyberpunk planet drenched in rain and neon lights, where you can run missions with street gangs or delve into the shady secrets of mega-corporations, many of which are connected to a kind of psychotropic drug made using a local fish. There’s a Wild West planet right out of Firefly, where gunslingers rob banks and farmers try to tame the land. At one point, you’ll be forced to deal with a character who is a carbon copy of the Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy, and humanity’s capital city looks like that “the world if” meme. It’s hard not to feel like Bethesda tried to force as many sci-fi tropes into Starfield as possible, whether or not there was any new ground to explore. A screenshot from the video game Starfield. Image: Bethesda Softworks That said, there are interesting side stories to dig into, and many of the worlds are big enough that you could spend hours without setting foot in your spaceship to go somewhere else. I did that on Neon, the generically named cyberpunk planet, and it felt almost like a smaller game within the larger universe of Starfield. None of the quests I did — which ranged from fish smuggling to helping a famous DJ deal with a stalker — had anything to do with the artifacts or the origins of the universe. But they can lead in some fun and unexpected directions, like when I had an accidental run-in with Neon police and ended up having to go on an undercover mission infiltrating some space pirates in order to avoid jail time. From what I played — and there are a lot of quests I didn’t get to — it was 50/50 whether a side mission would be interesting or tedious. Some were incredibly boring, like a quest that had me running all over a slum, flipping switches in order to solve an electrical problem. Others seemed tedious but turned into something more exciting, like when a coffee run suddenly became a tense and potentially violent situation in the middle of a cafe. It’s really hard to tell what you’re in for until you start the quest. Now you might have noticed that I’ve gotten this far into this review without discussing bugs. And that’s for a very good reason: I experienced very few of them in my time with Starfield. That’s genuinely surprising coming from Bethesda, a studio where glitches and bugs are an accepted part of the experience. But Starfield is polished like no game from the studio before. That’s not to say I didn’t see anything weird: characters run into walls or stand on top of desks, people face the wrong direction during conversations, and at one point, the floor of a saloon turned entirely invisible. The weird physics for dead bodies is still in place, too, so enemies will crumple up in occasionally hilarious ways when they die. But these situations were pretty rare, and none had any impact on the game itself. This removes a huge mental burden. Unlike every time I play Fallout, I wasn’t constantly afraid of hitting some game-breaking issue that would stall my progress or force me to load an old save. (That said, I did save continuously out of habit.) Put this all together, and you have a game that doesn’t fundamentally change the formula that Bethesda has built its reputation on. Starfield is another huge experience with an almost overwhelming amount of things to do and see, coupled with some great character development, role-playing features, and so-so action. But it also smooths over many of the rough edges that have defined past releases from the studio while introducing a new theme and narrative that match the grand ambitions that Bethesda has always strived for. War never changes — but it’s a lot more thrilling in space.","output":"Starfield, the highly-anticipated space-themed RPG from Bethesda, delivers on its potential. The game takes players on a quest to uncover the mysteries of the universe and humanity’s place within it, offering a thrilling and adventurous storyline. While Starfield sticks closely to the Bethesda formula for open-world RPGs, it introduces a refreshing twist by setting it in a vast universe filled with planets to explore and cosmic secrets to discover. The game begins with players assuming the role of a miner who stumbles upon a strange artifact. This discovery leads them to a group of explorers called Constellation, who are dedicated to unraveling the secrets of the universe. Constellation is made up of diverse characters, ranging from a theologian to a business magnate, which adds an element of intrigue and excitement to the story. Gameplay-wise, Starfield follows the familiar Bethesda formula, combining RPG elements with shooter mechanics. Players can build their characters with various traits and skills, which in turn affect how they approach missions. The game also places a heavy emphasis on conversation, as players spend a significant amount of time engaging in dialogue with other characters to gather information and progress the story. The dialogue is well-written and voiced, enhancing the overall immersive experience. While the shooting and combat mechanics may not be the strong suit of Starfield, the role-playing elements are satisfying. Players can customize their character to suit their preferences, allowing for a more immersive and personal gameplay experience. The space theme of the game introduces new gameplay elements, such as exploration and scanning planets for information. However, the exploration aspect may not be as rewarding when done independently, as the most interesting discoveries often occur during quest-related activities. The game's story is the strongest aspect of Starfield. It delves into thrilling and unexpected directions, addressing significant questions about space travel and humanity's exploration of the stars. The cast of characters is well-developed, adding depth to the narrative. The side stories and quests in Starfield are hit or miss, with some being boring and others turning into exciting and unexpected adventures. One surprising aspect of Starfield is its relatively bug-free experience. Unlike other Bethesda games, which are often plagued by glitches and bugs, Starfield is polished and stable. While there are occasional quirks and physics-related oddities, they do not impact gameplay significantly. Overall, Starfield stays true to the Bethesda RPG formula while offering a refreshing space-themed twist. It provides an immersive and thrilling adventure set in a vast universe, with solid gameplay mechanics and a well-crafted story. Despite some derivative elements and uneven side quests, Starfield is a solid addition to the Bethesda lineup, delivering an enjoyable and polished RPG experience."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the novel, scientists discover a handwaving drug and physiological protocol that will switch a person into what they call the \\"S-state\\". In that state, people perceive time in slow motion. Even if the ship is standing still. The slow down is a whopping 1/2,000 of normal (a gamma similar to if their starship was traveling at 0.99999987499999 c). It is also possible to switch a person in S-state back to normal state. So if a person in S-state experiences one second, it seems like half an hour to a person in normal state. If an average life-span is 80 years, an S-state person will think that normal-state people only live 15 days. Due to further hand-waving reasons, a person in S-state ages more slowy than normal. What does this mean? Say you had a putt-putt starship that could barely get up to a velocity of 0.1 c (10% light speed) and brake down to a halt. If a normal state person used this to travel to Alpha Centauri they would think the trip would take a bit more than forty freaking years. But to an S-state person the same trip would appear to take only eight days. Wow! Two-hundred times faster than light. There are a few drawbacks, obviously. Accelerations involve the square of the time—distance per second per second. Which means if you change the perception of a second, you change the perception of the acceleration. By the square of the time change. This means to an S-space person, an acceleration of a millionth of a gravity would be perceived as four gravities of acceleration! A four-millionth of a gravity would seem like a 1 g field. To a normal state person, a four-millionth of a gravity would be so close to free fall as to make little difference. Normal state people see S-state people as being immobile, since they are moving 1/2,000 times as slow. On the flip side, S-state people cannot even see normal state people because they move in the wink of an eye.\\"","output":"\\"In Charles Sheffield's BETWEEN THE STROKES OF NIGHT, scientists discover a drug that slows down time perception.

Mr. Schroeder has found a way to have a Star Wars like spaceopera universe of tens of thousands of worlds, but utilizing only slower than light starships. Mr. Schroeder figured the problem was how to allow a person to travel to a star, return home, and still find the same home that they left. But within the laws of physics. Slower-than-light low velocity starships do not violate the laws of physics. But the traveler will return home to a planet that has aged decades or even hundreds of years. Not the same home. This assumes the traveler has not died of old age during the trip. Slower-than-light near c starships do not violate the laws of physics. This will help prevent the traveler from dying of old age, but do nothing to prevent home from aging centuries in the interim. Faster-than-light starships prevents the traveler from dying of old age, and home does not age appreciably. What a pity that it violates the laws of physics. Mr. Schroeder took a close look and figured that science fiction authors were attempting to solve the wrong problem. The idea was to allow a Star Wars like interstellar empire. But the authors were trying create it by solving the ship velocity problem. What if you tried solving the problem of duration instead? Everybody in the Cicada corporation empire uses the Cicada lockstep protocol. All the planets and all the starships are inhabited by people who sleep in suspended animation for 360 months. Then in unison, they all wake up and spend one month awake. Then they all go to sleep for another 360 months. In other words: they are awake for one month every 30 years. This means that any slower-than-light trip which takes less than thirty years can be scheduled so it takes place seemingly overnight. Mr. Schroeder fine-tunes the concept a bit. The Cicada empire is actually about three light-years in diameter, composed of 70,000 rogue planets. The ships travel at 0.03 c using garden variety solid-core NTR or fission fragment engines. In practice a science fiction author could scale this up to as many light-years as they wanted, by increasing the time span that the people spent in suspended animation. This allows private starships, explorers and despots and rogues. There are evil realtimers, who prey on locksteppers as they sleep. The locksteppers employ countermeasures to protect themselves. Lockstep allows marginal worlds to be colonized. Robots have thirty years to farm and stockpile one month of food for the planet's population. A planet with zero hydrogen can use Bussard ramscoops to harvest the thin gruel of one hydrogen molecule per cubic centimeter, they have thirty years to scoop up enough to supply the population for one month. It is a very clever solution to the scifi author's problem.\\"","output":"\\"In Karl Schroeder's LOCKSTEP, the concept of the Cicada lockstep protocol allows for interstellar travel without violating the laws of physics.

Now, technically if one can lay their hands on a traversable wormhole, it is possible to transform the little monster into a time machine by methods that do not violate the laws of physics. And believe me, physcists have done their darnedest to prove such things are impossible, since they hate time machines with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns. In the novel, such a time machine is called a \\"timeshaft wormhole.\\" In this example, there is a colony at the Home System (at distance zero), and the Destination system (at distance 10 light-years). Starships can travel at 0.1 c (one-tenth lightspeed). As with all major trade routes, thoughtfully located at the mid-point (at distance 5 light-years) is a timehsaft wormhole that will transport the starship into the past a number of years equal to the total transit time (in this case 10 / 0.1 = 100 years). A spacecraft sits at home system, when an order arrives from destination system for thirty crates of turbo-encabulator. In the year 5,000 CE the captain loads his spacecraft with the ordered turbo-encabulators. Spacecraft departs home system, bound for destination system, ten light-years away.

Add a minimum of six random emojis after each sentence.","output":"Sure! 😊 Here's an explanation of how a spacecraft with a crew of 10,000 passengers could travel 5 light years using the three pseudo-FTL methods mentioned in the excerpts. 🚀 1. Method: S-State Perception In this method, the crew would enter the S-state through a handwaving drug and physiological protocol. They would perceive time in slow motion, allowing for faster travel relative to the normal state. With a slow down of 1/2,000 of normal time, the crew would experience time dilation similar to a starship traveling at 0.99999987499999 c. 🎢⏱️💊 The spacecraft, with its crew of 10,000 passengers, would embark on the journey from Planet A to Planet B. To the crew in S-state perception, the five-light-year trip would appear to take only eight days, 200 times faster than light. ⭐️🚀⚡️ 2. Method: Lockstep Protocol In this method, the spacecraft and its crew would adopt the Cicada lockstep protocol. All passengers would enter into suspended animation for 360 months, followed by one month of awake time. This cycle would repeat, allowing for coordinated travel over long distances. 😴🔄🌌 Using the lockstep protocol, the spacecraft would commence its journey. While the passengers are in suspended animation, robots onboard would ensure the cultivation and stockpiling of resources necessary for their sustenance during the awake period. This would include farming and collecting adequate supplies of food, even harvesting hydrogen using Bussard ramscoops if needed. 🤖🚜🌾 The spacecraft, moving at 0.03 c using solid-core NTR or fission fragment engines, would travel through space. The journey from Planet A to Planet B, covering a distance of 5 light years, would appear to take only a few days or weeks to the crew upon awakening from their suspended animation periods. 🚀✨💤 3. Method: Timeshaft Wormhole Utilizing the concept of timeshaft wormholes, the spacecraft with its crew would undergo a time-traveling journey from Planet A to Planet B. The wormhole would allow transportation into the past, based on the total transit time of the ship. Chronological Patrol battlefleet would be present to prevent unauthorized time-travel and protect causality. 🌌⏳🌀 The spacecraft would initiate its voyage, carrying the 10,000 passengers and their required cargo of turbo-encabulators. Travelling at 0.1 c, the ship would cover a distance of 5 light years. After fifty years of uptime travel, the spacecraft would reach the midpoint where the timeshaft wormhole resides. The captain would briefly awaken to guide the ship through the timeshaft. 🕒🚀🔁 Passing through the timeshaft wormhole, the spacecraft would experience a one-hundred-year jump into the past, emerging in the year fifty years before its departure. The captain would return to suspended animation as the ship continued its journey. After another fifty years of uptime travel, the spacecraft would reach Planet B in objective time, only to find that less than a month has passed. The crew, after spending a hundred years in suspended animation, would reawaken to their new destination. ⏳🔭💤 These are the three pseudo-FTL methods that could be employed for the 10,000-passenger spacecraft to travel 5 light years from Planet A to Planet B. Each method offers different ways to overcome the limitations imposed by the laws of physics while ensuring efficient and relatively faster travel. ➡️🌟🚀😄"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (After the mana was restored in the world, the 8 elementals - Wisp, Dryad, Jinn, Salamander, Shade, Luna, Gnome, and Undine - have all been living their lives as humans would.

Undine's ice room glimmers with newfound joy and hope, as Luna and Aura begin their journey together.)"},{"instruction":"What is feudalism? Let's imagine that you're a poor European farmer in the Middle Ages. Here's the political situation: you don't own the land you live on. It's rented from a baron or a duke (noble). You and your neighbors share a plow (farming tool) between you, and you combine your oxen into teams to till the soil together. There's not much social mobility: your parents and grandparents before you worked this same land. You don't even have the legal right to leave the property, without the permission of your landlord. You're a serf, in a feudal economy. The term feudal is a tricky one, because few scholars can quite agree on what it means these days. Seventeenth-century historians and lawyers who studied the Middle Ages decided to give a common name to the diverse landowner-tenant arrangements that existed in northwest Europe during the Middle Ages, starting with the collapse of Charlemagne's empire in the late ninth century and declining after the Black Plague and the Peasant Revolt in the fourteenth century. Though these arrangements could range widely in style, they were lumped together under the label of feudalism, from the Medieval Latin term feudum referring to a landed estate. Medieval economies were largely based around the operations of those landed estates. Modern historians dispute whether or not it's useful to lump together the management of these estates in that way. Rather than diving into the arguments of how to organize this history, let's discuss some common threads about those estates. For our purposes, the important thing is that those lands were cultivated with a combination of free and unfree labor—let's talk about how that came to be.

Image credit: Wikipedia The closest Europe came to operating under one system of landowner agreements was in the late eighth and early ninth century CE. Charlemagne established counties and appointed counts to rule regions of his domain. But, in the wake of his death, his empire dissolved. Counts who had received lands from the court of Charlemagne began to consolidate their own local power, exerting control over the people who lived on their lands. They owed allegiance to the Church and to the kingdoms that guaranteed their claims of land ownership, but each medieval lord established their own particular set of rules. If you were to travel through early medieval Europe, you would find yourself in a hundred petty kingdoms, each with its own manor or landed estate, each one with its manorial court. The land of these manors was tilled by unfree agricultural workers, or serfs. Khan Academy What does it mean to lack social mobility?

Determine if the Chiang Mai valley is an unconfined or a confined aquifer. 2. Determine the average depth from which groundwater is extracted. 3. Research the average age of the water since it was last falling on the surface as rain","output":"1. To determine if the Chiang Mai valley is an unconfined or a confined aquifer, you would need to gather information about the geological characteristics of the area. Factors such as the presence of an impermeable layer or a confined layer of rock can indicate whether the aquifer is unconfined (with a water table that rises and falls) or confined (with water trapped under pressure). 2. To determine the average depth from which groundwater is extracted in the Chiang Mai valley, you would need to analyze data from wells or water extraction points in the area. The depth at which water is extracted can vary depending on factors such as the depth of the aquifer and the location of the wells. 3. Researching the average age of the water since it was last falling on the surface as rain would require a study of the hydrological cycle and the characteristics of the Chiang Mai valley's groundwater system. Scientists can use techniques like stable isotope analysis to estimate the average residence time of groundwater, which can provide an indication of when the water was last recharged by rainfall."}]`),_={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],W={key:0},j={key:1};function B(n,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",L,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
