They may be confused with other wasps, such as hornets and paper wasps. Polistes dominula, a species of paper wasp, is very frequently misidentified as a yellowjacket. A typical yellowjacket worker is about 12 mm (0.5 in) long, with alternating bands on the abdomen; the queen is larger, about 19 mm (0.75 in) long (the different patterns on their abdomens help separate various species). Workers are sometimes confused with honey bees, especially when flying in and out of their nests.

Originally, there were only red, orange, and yellow loops, but green, purple, and blue were added during the 1990s. Different methods of production are used in the UK where, due to the lack of natural colourings for yellow, red and blue Froot Loops are purple, green and orange, and the loops are also larger in size.

Closer to the coast, this range is much greater. Coastal tidal ranges vary globally and can differ anywhere from near zero to over 11 metres (38 feet). The exact range depends on the volume of water adjacent to the coast, and the geography of the basin the water sits in. Larger bodies of water have higher ranges, and the geography can act as a funnel amplifying or dispersing the tide. The world's largest tidal range of 16.3 metres (53.5 feet) occurs in Bay of Fundy, Canada, and the United Kingdom regularly experiences tidal ranges up to 15 metres between England and Wales in the Severn Estuary.

It is a combination of an exhaust-driven turbocharger and an engine-driven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other. A belt-driven or shaft-driven supercharger offers exceptional response and low-rpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positive-displacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twin-screw and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger -- if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the low-rpm range -- the proper combination of the two can offer a zero-lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for small-displacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range."},{"instruction":"kimi no na wa a real story","output":"Your Name.

The issue is immediately put to the full Senate, which decides by majority vote. The procedure thus allows the Senate to decide any issue by majority vote, regardless of existing procedural rules, such as current Senate rules specifying that ending a filibuster requires the consent of 60 senators (out of 100) for legislation, and 67 for amending a Senate rule. The term \`\`nuclear option'' is an analogy to nuclear weapons being the most extreme option in warfare."},{"instruction":"here going to be season 3 of t@gged","output":"On September 13, 2016, it was officially announced that the series was renewed for a second season, slated for a 2017 premiere.

In Florida, a state law went into effect on 1 July 2010, which allows all municipalities in the state to use red light cameras on all state-owned rights-of-way and fine drivers who run red lights, with the aim of enforcing safe driving, according to then-Governor Charlie Crist. The name given to the state law is the Mark Wandall Traffic Safety Act, named for a man who was killed in 2003 by a motorist who ran a red light. In addition to allowing the use of cameras, the law also standardizes driver fines. Major cities throughout the US that use red light cameras include Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Baton Rouge, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Memphis, New Orleans, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, San Francisco, Seattle, Toledo, and Washington, D.C.

The TV Guide review stated \`\`similarity to Edward James Olmos' American Me, in which a tormented drug dealer travels the same route through prison society as Miklo. The principal difference between the two films is that Bound By Honor is by far the glossier effort, relentlessly picturesque in the seamlessly anesthetized manner of mainstream Hollywood films.''

Bound by Honor covers similar material in a less passionate and finally less meaningful way.'' Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of 4. A critic from Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave Bound By Honor a B-, falling on the high end of the movie spectrum. He states \`\`Bound By Honor comes fully alive when it moves behind bars. There's an exploitative thrill built into the genre...'' This film critic was definitely more interested in the second half of the movie once Miklo was in jail running La Onda.

The Gram-positive and Gram-negative staining response is also not a reliable characteristic as these two kinds of bacteria do not form phylogenetic coherent groups.

It also departs from the slasher genre which the first two installments were part of, instead featuring a \`\`witchcraft'' theme with science fiction aspects and parallels to old Celtic fairy tales. John Carpenter and Debra Hill believed that the Halloween series had the potential to branch into an anthology series of horror films that centered around the night of Halloween, with each sequel containing its own characters, setting, and storyline. Director Wallace stated that there were many ideas for Halloween-themed films, some of which could have potentially created any number of their own sequels, and that Season of the Witch was meant to be the first of the anthology series.

This sort of an arrangement gives the ICC some of the advantages inhering in the organs of the United Nations such as using the enforcement powers of the Security Council, but it also creates a risk of being tainted with the political controversies of the Security Council."},{"instruction":"do toronto blue jays play in a dome","output":"Rogers Centre, originally named SkyDome, is a multi-purpose stadium in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, situated just southwest of the CN Tower near the northern shore of Lake Ontario.

Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. Pine and other coniferous trees may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years. While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the \`\`tall-thin'' position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position. Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn. Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female. Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Since owls are, next to red-tailed hawks, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids."},{"instruction":"does keeping up with the kardashians still air","output":"Keeping Up with the Kardashians (often abbreviated KUWTK) is an American reality television series that airs on the E! cable network.

The term \`\`Means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce'' is extremely broad, and it is virtually impossible to avoid the operation of the statute by attempting to offer or sell a security without using an \`\`instrumentality'' of interstate commerce.

While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true; bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain unpleasantly stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of harming the digestive tract or causing choking. There have been cases of intestinal perforations caused by swallowing bay leaves, so unless the leaves in the recipe have been ground they should be removed from the food before serving; otherwise, the risk of a surgical emergency remains. Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished."},{"instruction":"anyone with 3000 hits not in the hall of fame","output":"Baseball writer Josh Pahigian writes that membership in the club has been \`\`long considered the greatest measure of superior bat handling.''

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen."},{"instruction":"did the movie the patriot win any award","output":"The Patriot was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound Mixing (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P.

The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose."},{"instruction":"here a second book to the 5th wave","output":"The Infinite Sea is a young adult science fiction novel written by American author Rick Yancey.

The refractive index measures the phase velocity of light, which does not carry information. The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1.

Although a ten-year compliance period was proposed for the new edition of the MUTCD, a compliance date for this change was ultimately not adopted with the 2009 edition, meaning that the transition is accomplished through a systematic upgrading of existing signing and there is no specific date by which the change must be implemented. However, the FHWA has required that all federally funded routes with sequential numbering eventually be converted to mileage-based exit numbers. To that end, the FHWA has required each state that currently uses sequential exit numbering to submit a plan to eventually transition to distance-based exit numbers. Some of the states that currently have sequential numbering either have or intend to request a waiver from the Federal Highway Administration to retain their current numbering systems, while others have planned a gradual transition to mileage-based exit numbering over time as existing signage reaches the end of its serviceable life and is replaced."},{"instruction":"an you be allergic to your own perspiratio","output":"A sweat allergy is the exacerbation of atopic dermatitis associated with an elevated body temperature and resulting increases in the production of sweat.

Iceland shares a common cultural heritage with the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden and Denmark with the Faroe Islands. Icelanders, however, unlike other Nordics, have continued to use their traditional name system, which was formerly used by all Nordic countries except partly Finland.

The FIFA Women's World Cup has had only seven editions to date, therefore creating less opportunity for a pattern to form.

After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie \`\`Dishpan Man'' Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of Mission: Impossible, and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. In what was supposed to be the final episode, \`\`The Grey Team'' (although \`\`Without Reservations'' was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, \`\`Fini''."},{"instruction":"hydraulic oil and hydraulic fluid the same thing","output":"Anti-wear (AW) hydraulic oils are made from a petroleum base fluid and commonly contain the anti-wear additive Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP).

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. Creatinine clearance rate (C or CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the GFR. Creatinine clearance exceeds GFR due to creatinine secretion, which can be blocked by cimetidine. In alternative fashion, overestimation by older serum creatinine methods resulted in an underestimation of creatinine clearance, which provided a less biased estimate of GFR. Both GFR and C may be accurately calculated by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine, or estimated by formulas using just a blood test result (eGFR and eC)."},{"instruction":"would an electron be considered a type of atom","output":"Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as atoms. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding. In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms. Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J.J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897. Electrons can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles. Electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign. When an electron collides with a positron, both particles can be totally annihilated, producing gamma ray photons."},{"instruction":"an you be given a police caution without being arrested","output":"In recent years a lower level resolution of offences has often been used by police forces in England and Wales instead of a caution.

This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million.

In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. The most recent ISTAT figures show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total of almost 5.1 million population (nearly 3.5% of the population); Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe.

In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.

It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation. The Church of England also preserves Catholic Order by adhering to episcopal polity, with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church. In sum these express the 'Via Media' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as acceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity, as minimum and sufficient; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines. It is light on details compared to Roman Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran teachings. The Bible, the Creeds, Apostolic Order, and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to establish Catholicity. Indeed, not one major doctrinal development emerged from the English reformation, Diarmid MacCulloch, The Later Reformation in England, 1990, p. 55. The Reformation in England was initially much concerned about doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions. The proponents of further changes, nonetheless, tried to get their way by making changes in Church Order (abolition of bishops), governance (Canon Law) and liturgy ('too Catholic'). They did not succeed because the Monarchy, the Church and resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent. Moreover, \`\`despite all the assumptions of the Reformation founders of that Church, it had retained a catholic character.'' The Elizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest...'' a Protestant theology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that had created it; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology in favor of sacraments, especially the eucharist, ceremonial, and anti-Calvinist doctrine'' (ibid pp. 78--86). The existence of cathedrals \`\`without substantial alteration'' and \`\`where the \`\`old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism,'' p. 79. This is \`\`One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation,'' ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue. The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat from the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past, ibid. p. 142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I."},{"instruction":"hotch's wife killed in criminal mind","output":"Hotch begins the series married to his high school sweetheart Haley (Meredith Monroe).

General relativity predicts the existence of singularities in certain extreme conditions, such as the center of a black hole or the Big Bang. The singularity at the center of a black hole is one of the most striking and mysterious predictions of General relativity, and it is the subject of ongoing research.n"},{"instruction":"w does General relativity impact our understanding of the behavior of the universe on a large scale?","output":"General relativity provides the theoretical framework for our understanding of the behavior of the universe on a large scale. It describes the geometry of spacetime and the dynamics of matter and energy, and it explains the observed properties of the universe, such as its expansion, large-scale structure, and distribution of matter and radiation. General relativity also provides a basis for cosmological models that can be tested using observations from telescopes and other instruments.n"},{"instruction":"w does the theory of General relativity relate to the concept of the frame of reference?","output":"General relativity challenges the classical concept of the frame of reference, which assumes that there is a fixed, absolute space and time against which all motion can be measured. In General relativity, the geometry of spacetime is curved by matter and energy, and the concept of a fixed reference frame loses its meaning. Instead, the motion of objects and the passage of time are relative to the local gravitational field, and observers in different locations may measure different values for these quantities.n"},{"instruction":"w does General relativity impact our understanding of the behavior of time?","output":"General relativity has profound implications for our understanding of the behavior of time. In General relativity, time is not absolute, but is relative to the motion and gravitational field of an observer. Clocks that are located in different gravitational fields or that are moving at different velocities will measure time differently. This effect, known as time dilation, has been confirmed by numerous experiments, and it has been used to test the predictions of General relativity. General relativity also predicts that time can be affected by the curvature of spacetime, such as in the presence of strong gravitational fields, and this effect has been observed in experiments involving atomic clocks. Overall, General relativity has revolutionized our understanding of the nature of time and its relation to space and matter.n"},{"instruction":"Can General relativity be used to explain the behavior of quantum mechanics?","output":"General relativity and quantum mechanics are two of the most successful theories in physics, but they have not yet been successfully merged into a single theory that can explain all phenomena at all scales. While General relativity describes the behavior of gravity and large-scale objects, quantum mechanics describes the behavior of subatomic particles and their interactions. The merging of these two theories, known as quantum gravity, is an active area of research, but there is currently no widely accepted theory that can explain the behavior of both gravity and quantum mechanics.n"},{"instruction":"w does General relativity impact our understanding of the behavior of black holes?","output":"General relativity plays a key role in our understanding of the behavior of black holes, which are objects with such strong gravitational fields that not even light can escape from them. General relativity predicts the existence of black holes, and it provides a framework for studying their properties and behavior. For example, General relativity predicts that black holes have an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing can escape, and that they can merge and form more massive black holes. The study of black holes has been a major focus of research in both astrophysics and General relativity.n"},{"instruction":"w does the theory of General relativity relate to the concept of the fabric of spacetime?","output":"The concept of the fabric of spacetime is a metaphor that is often used to describe the curvature of spacetime predicted by General relativity. According to General relativity, massive objects such as planets and stars curve the fabric of spacetime, and this curvature determines the paths that other objects follow in their vicinity. The concept of the fabric of spacetime is a useful way to visualize the effects of gravity predicted by General relativity, but it should be noted that it is only a metaphor and does not represent a physical substance.n"},{"instruction":"w does General relativity impact our understanding of the behavior of gravitational waves?","output":"General relativity predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that propagate through the universe at the speed of light. Gravitational waves are produced by the motion of massive objects, such as merging black holes or neutron stars, and they can be detected by instruments that are sensitive to extremely small changes in distance. The detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015 was a major breakthrough in physics, and it provided the first direct evidence for the existence of gravitational waves predicted by General relativity.n"},{"instruction":"w does the theory of General relativity relate to the concept of the equivalence principle?","output":"\\"The equivalence principle is a cornerstone of General relativity, and it states that the effects of gravity cannot be distinguished from the effects of acceleration. In other words, an observer in a freely falling elevator cannot distinguish between the sensation of weightlessness caused by gravity and the sensation of weightlessness caused by the elevators acceleration. The equivalence principle has profound implications for our understanding of the nature of gravity and the behavior of objects in a gravitational field, and it has been confirmed by numerous experiments.n\\""},{"instruction":"w does General relativity impact our understanding of the behavior of the early universe?","output":"General relativity plays a crucial role in our understanding of the behavior of the early universe, particularly during the period known as inflation. Inflation is a theory that describes a brief period of exponential expansion of the universe that occurred shortly after the Big Bang. Inflation is believed to have been driven by a form of energy that is similar to the cosmological constant predicted by General relativity. During inflation, the universe expanded so rapidly that quantum fluctuations were amplified to become the large-scale structures we observe today, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The study of inflation and the early universe is an active area of research in cosmology, and General relativity provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of the universe during these early stages.n"},{"instruction":"w does General relativity relate to the concept of spacetime curvature?","output":"General relativity predicts that the presence of matter and energy curves the fabric of spacetime, resulting in the phenomenon of spacetime curvature. The curvature of spacetime determines the motion of objects in the vicinity of massive objects such as planets, stars, and black holes. In the absence of gravity, objects follow straight paths in spacetime, but in the presence of gravity, these paths are curved. The curvature of spacetime predicted by General relativity has been confirmed by numerous experiments, and it is a fundamental concept in our understanding of the behavior of gravity and the universe as a whole.n"},{"instruction":"Can General relativity be used to explain the behavior of the universe as a whole?","output":"General relativity provides a framework for studying the behavior of the universe as a whole, particularly on the largest scales. The theory predicts the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter and dark energy, and the behavior of black holes, among other phenomena. However, General relativity is not sufficient to explain all aspects of the universe, particularly on very small scales, where the effects of quantum mechanics become important. The merging of General relativity and quantum mechanics, known as quantum gravity, is an active area of research, and it is hoped that a complete theory will eventually be developed that can explain all phenomena at all scales.n"},{"instruction":"w does General relativity impact our understanding of the behavior of time?","output":"General relativity predicts that time can be affected by the curvature of spacetime, particularly in the presence of strong gravitational fields. This effect, known as gravitational time dilation, causes time to appear to run slower in regions of stronger gravitational fields. For example, time appears to run slower near a black hole than in regions far away from it. Gravitational time dilation has been observed in experiments involving atomic clocks, and it has important implications for our understanding of the nature of time and its relation to space and matter.n"},{"instruction":"What is the tallest tree in the world?","output":"The tallest tree in the world is the coast redwood, also known as Sequoia sempervirens."},{"instruction":"w do plants get their energy?","output":"Plants get their energy through a process called photosynthesis, where they use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen."},{"instruction":"What is the largest flower in the world?","output":"The largest flower in the world is the Rafflesia arnoldii.

Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gears material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.\\""},{"instruction":"Look up the boiling point of water.?","output":"\\"The boiling point of water is 100°C (212°F), at standard atmospheric pressure.
