Stabilität: Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Pergola aus robustem Material wie Metall, Holz oder Aluminium besteht und eine solide Konstruktion aufweist. Da Dachterrassen oft starken Winden ausgesetzt sind, ist es wichtig, dass die Pergola stabil und standfest ist. 2. Gewicht: Bedenken Sie das Gesamtgewicht der Pergola, einschließlich der Pflanzen, die Sie daran anbauen möchten. Überprüfen Sie, ob Ihre Dachterrasse das zusätzliche Gewicht tragen kann und ob Sie gegebenenfalls zusätzliche Verstärkungen hinzufügen müssen. 3. Größe: Messen Sie den verfügbaren Platz auf Ihrer Dachterrasse und überlegen Sie, wie groß die Pergola sein sollte. Sie sollte proportional zur Größe der Terrasse sein, um nicht zu überwältigend zu wirken. Eine zu große Pergola kann den Raum dominieren und möglicherweise den Zugang zu anderen Bereichen einschränken. 4. Sonneneinstrahlung: Berücksichtigen Sie die Sonneneinstrahlung auf Ihrer Dachterrasse und positionieren Sie die Pergola entsprechend. Wenn Sie Schatten wünschen, platzieren Sie die Pergola an der sonnigen Seite der Terrasse, um optimale Schattenbereiche zu schaffen. Achten Sie aber auch darauf, dass genügend Sonnenlicht für eventuell angepflanzte Pflanzen vorhanden ist. 5. Materialien: Wählen Sie Materialien, die witterungsbeständig und langlebig sind. Für eine Dachterrasse können Metallkonstruktionen wie Aluminium oder pulverbeschichtetes Stahlgestell eine gute Option sein, da sie leicht und korrosionsbeständig sind. Holz kann ebenfalls verwendet werden, sollte jedoch richtig behandelt und gut gepflegt werden, um seine Haltbarkeit zu gewährleisten. 6. Genehmigungen: Informieren Sie sich bei den örtlichen Behörden oder Ihrer Hausverwaltung, ob Sie eventuell eine Genehmigung für den Bau einer Pergola auf Ihrer Dachterrasse benötigen. Denken Sie auch daran, dass Sie die Pergola regelmäßig pflegen und überprüfen müssen, um sicherzustellen, dass sie in gutem Zustand bleibt und lange hält."},{"instruction":"Danke!","output":"Gern geschehen! Wenn Sie noch weitere Fragen haben oder weitere Informationen benötigen, stehe ich Ihnen gerne zur Verfügung. Viel Erfolg bei der Gestaltung Ihrer Dachterrasse mit der Pergola!"},{"instruction":"Ist Jasmin eine Einheimische Pflanze?","output":"Nein, Jasmin ist keine einheimische Pflanze in Mitteleuropa oder Österreich. Jasmin ist ursprünglich in den tropischen und subtropischen Regionen beheimatet, insbesondere in Asien und dem Mittelmeerraum. In Mitteleuropa, einschließlich Österreich, wird Jasmin meist als Zierpflanze angebaut und ist nicht in der freien Natur heimisch. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass in ökologischen und naturschutzrelevanten Kontexten die Verwendung von heimischen Pflanzen gefördert wird, da diese besser an die örtlichen Bedingungen angepasst sind und die Biodiversität unterstützen können. Wenn Sie Wert auf die Verwendung einheimischer Pflanzen legen, sollten Sie sich nach Alternativen umsehen, die in der Region heimisch sind und für Dachterrassen geeignet sind."},{"instruction":"Was wäre eine gute Alternative zur Jasmin?","output":"Eine gute Alternative zur Jasminpflanze, insbesondere wenn Sie nach einer duftenden und blühenden Pflanze suchen, die in Mitteleuropa heimisch ist, wäre die Duftgeißblatt (Lonicera periclymenum). Diese Kletterpflanze ist in vielen Teilen Europas wild vorkommend, einschließlich Österreichs. Das Duftgeißblatt produziert auffällige, duftende Blüten in verschiedenen Farben wie weiß, gelb und rosa. Es ist eine robuste Pflanze, die sowohl Sonne als auch Halbschatten toleriert. Es kann an Pergolen, Zäunen oder Wänden wachsen und bietet ähnlich wie Jasmin eine schöne Sichtschutz- und Schattenspende. Eine weitere Alternative wäre die Waldrebe (Clematis). Es gibt verschiedene Sorten von Clematis mit unterschiedlichen Blütenfarben und Formen. Clematis bevorzugt einen sonnigen bis halbschattigen Standort und kann an Pergolen, Spalieren oder Gittern wachsen. Einige Sorten haben auch einen angenehmen Duft. Beide Alternativen, Duftgeißblatt und Clematis, sind heimische Pflanzen in Mitteleuropa und können eine duftende und farbenfrohe Ergänzung für Ihre Dachterrasse sein. Denken Sie daran, dass Sie bei der Auswahl der Pflanzen für Ihre Pergola auch auf die spezifischen Klima- und Lichtbedingungen auf Ihrer Dachterrasse achten sollten."},{"instruction":"Mögen Insekten diese Pflanzen?","output":"Ja, sowohl das Duftgeißblatt als auch die Clematis sind attraktiv für Insekten wie Bienen, Schmetterlinge und andere bestäubende Insekten. Diese Pflanzen produzieren duftende Blüten, die Nektar und Pollen enthalten, die für Insekten eine wichtige Nahrungsquelle darstellen. Das Duftgeißblatt (Lonicera periclymenum) zieht besonders Nachtfalter an, die sich von seinem reichen Nektar ernähren. Clematis ist auch beliebt bei Bienen und Hummeln, die von den reichlich vorhandenen Blüten angezogen werden. Die Anwesenheit dieser Insekten kann zur Bestäubung anderer Pflanzen auf Ihrer Dachterrasse beitragen und zur Unterstützung der Biodiversität in Ihrem Garten beitragen. Wenn Sie also Insekten anlocken und unterstützen möchten, sind das Duftgeißblatt und die Clematis gute Pflanzenoptionen, da sie sowohl ästhetisch ansprechend als auch für Insekten attraktiv sind."},{"instruction":"Sind die Clematis und das Duftgeissblatt geeignet für die Pergola auf meiner sonnigen, windigen Dachterasse in Wien?","output":"Ja, sowohl Clematis als auch Duftgeißblatt können für eine sonnige und windige Dachterrasse in Wien geeignet sein. Hier sind einige Punkte zu beachten: 1. Standort: Clematis und Duftgeißblatt bevorzugen einen sonnigen bis halbschattigen Standort. Wenn Ihre Dachterrasse viel Sonne bekommt, ist das ideal für diese Pflanzen. Achten Sie jedoch darauf, dass sie vor allem in den Mittagsstunden ausreichend Schatten haben oder dass Sie sie mit zusätzlichem Sonnenschutz, wie beispielsweise Schattennetzen, vor zu intensiver Sonneneinstrahlung schützen. 2. Windfestigkeit: Beide Pflanzen sind relativ windtolerant und können in windigen Bedingungen gedeihen. Dennoch ist es ratsam, die Pflanzen vor allzu starken Winden zu schützen, insbesondere wenn die Dachterrasse stark und konstanten Winden ausgesetzt ist. Sie können dies erreichen, indem Sie die Pergola mit winddurchlässigen Materialien ausstatten oder durch den Einsatz von Sichtschutzelementen. 3. Bewässerung: Sowohl Clematis als auch Duftgeißblatt benötigen regelmäßige Bewässerung, besonders in den wärmeren Monaten. Da Dachterrassen dazu neigen, schneller auszutrocknen, ist es wichtig sicherzustellen, dass die Pflanzen ausreichend Wasser erhalten. Überprüfen Sie regelmäßig den Feuchtigkeitsgehalt des Bodens und gießen Sie bei Bedarf. Achten Sie jedoch darauf, dass der Boden nicht zu stark durchnässt ist, um Staunässe zu vermeiden. 4. Pflanzgefäße: Da Dachterrassen oft begrenzten Platz haben, empfiehlt es sich, Clematis und Duftgeißblatt in großen, stabilen Pflanzgefäßen zu kultivieren. Wählen Sie Pflanzgefäße, die ausreichend Platz für das Wurzelwachstum der Pflanzen bieten und sicher auf der Terrasse positioniert werden können.

Furthermore, I led the test architect design for StoredIQ for legal, advocating for and implementing new stateful HADR solutions utilizing Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or Flocker. These solutions significantly enhanced data storage and disaster recovery capabilities, ultimately improving the efficiency and resilience of the systems being tested. In addition to these achievements, I led a US-based team in driving continuous testing methodology improvement for the Information Lifecycle Governance (ILG) group. Leveraging tools such as UrbanCode Deployment and Jenkins CI, we successfully streamlined testing processes and facilitated the efficient integration and deployment of new features and updates. To guarantee optimal performance and reliability of SaaS offerings, I applied real-time performance monitoring, alerting, and log analytics using various tools, including Collectd, Graphite, Grafana, Seyren, and the E.L.K stack. These tools enabled comprehensive monitoring and analysis of system metrics, ensuring prompt identification and resolution of any potential performance or stability issues. Through my technical expertise and leadership, I have made significant contributions to worldwide hybrid cloud testing efforts and continuous testing improvement within the ILG group at IBM."},{"instruction":"адаптируй код только для ак47:","output":"Для адаптации кода только для AK-47, следует выполнить следующие шаги: Шаг 1: Изучение и понимание имеющегося кода.

In 2006, I successfully delivered urgent test fixes for important IBM customers such as Alpha Bank, RBC, and Wells Fargo, receiving positive feedback from both customers and IBM US labs for my problem analysis skills and creative thinking in testing methodologies."},{"instruction":"","output":"Sorry, I am an AI language model and do not have the capability to dance.

This instance, because they had overheard a mother yelling at her child in public that \\"not everything in life was free\\", your friend walked towards the family and knelt down to the child, gave the child four 20 bills and said \\"Hey, kid. Here's 80 bucks. For FREE.\\"","output":"Joshua was known for his mischievous nature. He thrived on laughter, surprise, and the occasional chaos. Whether it was playing practical jokes or organizing elaborate surprises for his friends, Joshua's mischievous spirit was infectious. However, his pranks never caused harm, offering instead a moment of respite from life's mundane routine. One sunny afternoon, while strolling through the bustling town center, Joshua overheard a commotion. A mother's frustrated voice cut through the air, berating her child about the true value of things. Intrigued, Joshua approached the scene cautiously, curious about what he might witness. His ocean-blue eyes sparkled with mischief as he saw the child's tear-streaked face and sensed the tension hanging heavy in the air. Joshua's heart went out to the kid, feeling an unspoken connection, as if he understood the child's yearning for something different. Setting his mischievous thoughts aside for a moment, he knelt down beside the bewildered child and offered a warm smile. Digging into his pocket, he pulled out four crisp twenty-dollar bills and held them up for the child to see. \\"Hey, kid,\\" Joshua whispered, his voice laced with an air of playful secrecy. \\"Here's eighty bucks. For free.\\" Wide-eyed, the child looked at Joshua, a mixture of awe and disbelief flooding their face. The mother's expression changed from frustration to confusion as she watched the unexpected scene unfold before her eyes. Joshua didn't wait for a response. He simply winked mischievously and slipped the money into the child's small hand. With that mysterious grin still painted across his face, he stood up and took a step back, allowing the child time to process the enchanting gift. The child's face transformed, their eyes alight with wonder. They clutched the money tightly, peering at the fluttering bills as though they held the key to something magical, something that could change their life. Meanwhile, Joshua watched with bated breath, excited yet careful not to disturb the delicate balance he had created. He respected the child's right to decide their own path, hoping that the unexpected gift might inspire a newfound belief in the possibility of dreams fulfilled. As the child's mother recovered from her initial perplexity, she approached Joshua cautiously, her eyes reflective with a mix of gratitude and curiosity. \\"Why?\\" she asked, her voice warm yet tempered with caution. Joshua's grin widened, his eyes twinkling like stars. \\"Because sometimes, we all need a reminder that there is still kindness in this world—a tiny spark to ignite hope in unexpected places.\\" The mother's gaze softened, her defenses beginning to crumble. She stared at her child, then back at Joshua, her voice barely above a whisper. \\"Thank you.\\" With that, Joshua gracefully sauntered away, leaving behind a hint of wonder in the air. Though his presence would fade into memory, the echoes of his chaos-tinged benevolence would linger long after he had disappeared around the street corner. And through Joshua's act, a ripple of transformation spread through the child's life. That day, something shifted in their young mind—an understanding that not everything in life could ever be truly \\"free,\\" but also that kindness and unexpected wonders had the power to shape their destiny. And as the child clutched the money tightly, they made a vow to use it wisely, to create a future worth cherishing, as a tribute to the enigmatic friend who taught them that sometimes, amidst life's chaos, a touch of magic can always be found."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling hanging out when Aaron decides tell Jane and Sam that he is dating a girl called Chloe","output":"INT.

IP addresses are managed and assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or regional Internet registries like ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers), RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre), and APNIC (Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre). These organizations allocate IP address blocks to ISPs, telecommunications companies, and large organizations. Obtaining an IP address range typically involves going through the proper channels and procedures established by these authorities. It typically requires a valid reason, such as being an ISP or having a business that requires a large number of IP addresses for specific purposes. Additionally, there may be fees associated with acquiring and maintaining an IP address range. For individual users and small-scale needs, ISPs generally assign dynamic IP addresses to connect to the internet, which are temporary and change over time."},{"instruction":"I have a go porgram, thats meant to run diffrent f unctions with diffrent methods. I am writing it in o and was wonderin should i make all my methods in o or should i add compatability for other languages so i can use the plublically available methods?","output":"When designing and developing a program, it's important to consider factors like functionality, scalability, and maintainability. Regarding your question, if you are developing your program in the Go programming language, it would be more efficient to write all your methods in Go rather than adding compatibility for other languages solely for the purpose of using publicly available methods. Here are a few reasons why you may want to stick to using Go for your methods: 1. Language-specific advantages: Go is designed to be simple, efficient, and effective for concurrent programming. It has its own set of libraries and packages that can be leveraged for various functionalities. 2. Performance: By using a single language, specifically Go, you can take advantage of its performance benefits. Switching between multiple languages may introduce overhead and impact the performance of your application. 3. Maintenance and code consistency: Writing all your methods in a single language, Go, makes maintenance and code updates easier.

These advancements have resulted in new opportunities across various sectors, leading to an increase in both local and international job seekers interested in vacancies within the Kingdom. This article will comprehensively explore the current job market in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the types of vacancies available, the sectors driving employment growth, associated challenges, and tips for job seekers looking to secure employment in this dynamic country. I. Economic Landscape and Job Market Overview: A. Economic Diversification Initiatives: Saudi Arabia has embarked on an ambitious plan, Vision 2030, aimed at transitioning its reliance on oil towards a diversified and knowledge-based economy. This long-term vision has paved the way for investments in various sectors, leading to an influx of vacancies in non-oil industries, including healthcare, tourism, entertainment, information technology, and renewable energy. B. Demographic Dynamics and Localization Initiatives: With a growing population and a significant youth demographic, Saudi Arabia places a strong emphasis on reducing unemployment rates among its citizens. Localization initiatives have been launched, favoring the employment of Saudi nationals in both the public and private sectors. This policy framework has led to job vacancies tailored specifically for Saudi nationals, positively impacting the employment prospects for citizens. II. Key Sectors with Job Opportunities: A. Healthcare Sector: Rapid expansion in healthcare infrastructure, increased public-private partnerships, and a focus on improving healthcare services are opening up a plethora of job opportunities, particularly for medical professionals, nurses, healthcare managers, and technicians. B. Tourism and Hospitality Industry: Saudi Arabia has taken significant steps to promote tourism, aiming to diversify its economy and enhance its international presence. As a result, the tourism and hospitality sectors are experiencing substantial growth, creating vacancies for hotel staff, tour guides, event managers, and travel executives. C. Information Technology and Digitalization: Saudi Arabia's commitment to digital transformation has fueled considerable demand for skilled IT professionals such as software developers, data analysts, cybersecurity experts, and IT project managers. D. Renewable Energy and Sustainability: Recognizing the importance of clean energy, Saudi Arabia has launched several renewable energy projects as part of its Vision 2030 goals. This sector offers diverse vacancies for engineers, project managers, environmental specialists, and consultants. III. Challenges for Job Seekers: A. Cultural and Gender Norms: Saudi Arabia's conservative culture and adherence to Islamic principles can pose challenges for non-Muslim job seekers or those unfamiliar with local customs. Understanding and respecting cultural norms can significantly enhance job prospects. B. Language Barrier: While English is widely spoken in business settings, being fluent in Arabic can be advantageous when seeking employment in certain sectors or interacting with locals. Language proficiency can help establish rapport with colleagues and clients, leading to increased opportunities for career growth. C. Work-Life Balance and Lifestyle Adaptation: Relocating to Saudi Arabia may require individuals to adapt to a different work culture and lifestyle. Familiarizing oneself with local customs, laws, and the availability of recreational activities can contribute to a successful transition. IV. Tips for Job Seekers: A. Research and Networking: Conduct thorough research on sectors experiencing growth, identify companies of interest, and leverage personal and professional networks to gain insights and potential job opportunities. B. Tailored CV and Cover Letters: Customize your job application materials, highlighting relevant skills, experiences, and qualifications that align with the requirements of the job vacancy and the cultural norms of Saudi Arabia. C. Understand Visa and Work Permit Requirements: Obtain a clear understanding of Saudi Arabia's visa and work permit regulations, ensuring you meet all necessary criteria and document requirements. Seek professional guidance if needed. D. Enhancing Arabic Language Skills: If planning to work in sectors where Arabic fluency is advantageous, consider enrolling in language training programs or taking online courses to improve communication skills. Conclusion: Saudi Arabia's economic diversification efforts have contributed to a significant increase in job vacancies, catering to both the national and international workforce. With an emphasis on sectors such as healthcare, tourism, information technology, and renewable energy, the Kingdom is undergoing a transformative phase that presents numerous job opportunities. Job seekers should be mindful of the cultural context, language requirements, and lifestyle adaptation while leveraging research and networking to maximize their chances of securing employment in Saudi Arabia."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling hanging out at school when the school has a new kid named Amy (who moved from another state), however even though she only attended the school for the first time that particular day, she is already frenemies with Jane's other friend, 13 year old Ruby, even though she only meet Ruby today as it’s Amy's first day at the school","output":"INT.

Donde: - rango1, rango2, etc. son las columnas o rangos de celdas que quieres contar. - criterio1, criterio2, etc. son las condiciones que deben cumplir las celdas para ser contadas. Por ejemplo, supongamos que tienes una hoja de cálculo con varias columnas de datos, y quieres contar cuántas filas cumplen las siguientes condiciones: - En la columna A, el valor debe ser mayor a 5. - En la columna B, el valor debe ser menor a 10. - En la columna C, el valor debe ser igual a \\"Sí\\". La fórmula para contar las filas que cumplen estas condiciones sería la siguiente: =COUNTIFS(A:A, \\">5\\", B:B, \\"<10\\", C:C, \\"Sí\\") Esta fórmula contará las filas que cumplan las tres condiciones especificadas. Recuerda reemplazar \\"A:A\\", \\"B:B\\" y \\"C:C\\" por los rangos de tus columnas específicas, y los criterios \\">5\\", \\"<10\\" y \\"Sí\\" por tus propias condiciones.

Offline retail sales and wholesales (“Offline Sales”) in Hong Kong and Macau SARs increased by 7.3% to HK2,373.3 million, Offline Sales in Mainland China decreased by 22.9% to HK225.2 million while Offline Sales in Southeast Asia increased by 64.9% (in original currency) to HK300.0 million. The Group operated a total of 186 retail outlets across all regions as at 31 March 2023. Turnover of the Group’s online business decreased by 13.5% to HK602.0 million for the Financial Year, affected by Covid-19 disruptions in Mainland China where online sales decreased by 33.4%, the only region recording a decrease. Total online business contributed 17.2% to the Group’s total turnover (2022: 20.4%), a significant increase as compared to the financial year ended 31 March 2019 immediately before the pandemic (“pre-pandemic period”). The total online business recorded a loss of HK21.2 million for the Financial Year as compared to a profit of HK6.9 million for the previous year as a result of Covid-19 pandemic impact in Mainland China and the strength of the Hong Kong dollar against a basket of currencies including the Renminbi. In terms of category sales, during the peak of the pandemic, the Group seized the opportunity from growth of personal protective equipment (“PPE”), and more recently the demand for post Covid-19 recovery health food and supplements. Since the fourth quarter, focus has switched to make-up which has made a strong recovery post relaxation of pandemic measures including the requirement to wear a protective mask. The Group continues to strengthen product sourcing to enrich the product portfolio and aside from our core categories of skincare, make-up and fragrance, is beginning to grow additional categories including inner beauty, personal care and beauty equipment. We will continue to invest in the category extension strategy, explore potential categories, meet market trends and customer needs, and strive to bring more product choices to consumers. Group profit for the Financial Year was HK58.2 million, a significant turnaround compared to the loss of HK343.7 million in the previous year, and the loss of HK133.2 million for the first half of the Financial Year. Excluding the provision for impairment made in accordance with HKAS 36 that applied to retail store assets (including right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment), the subsidies for Covid-19 pandemic by local governments, temporary rental concessions, recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of prior years’ tax losses in Hong Kong and Macau SARs and the accrued past service costs due to change in the offsetting arrangement under the mandatory provident fund, the Group’s loss during the year narrowed to HK54.6 million (an improvement of 81.7%) compared to the previous year. Sa Sa International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2022/2023 34 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS Our total net cash balance as at 31 March 2023 increased to HK273.3 million (2022: HK194.2 million) with net cash generated from operating activities (less the payment of lease liabilities and interest) for the Financial Year increasing significantly by HK419.3 million to HK144.6 million largely through cost structure optimization, gross margin expansion and management of inventory on hand. 1) Rigour in adopting zero-based budgeting practices, centralising cost centres to enhance economies of scale and drive cost optimization and negotiating fair rent on lease renewals, has led to a significant improvement in operating costs efficiencies during the Financial Year. 2) Adopting disciplined category management practices, adding to the exclusive brand portfolio and discontinuing less popular and unprofitable lines led to an improvement in gross margin that continued throughout the Financial Year from 35.5% in the first quarter to 43.5% in the fourth quarter. 3) Proactively managing inventory, striking a balance between holding sufficient inventory taking into account Covid-19 impacted delivery lead times to ensure adequate stock during peak periods, and the cost of investing in inventory, has led to a reduction in the inventory balance at the year-end. As at 31 March 2023, the Group’s inventory was HK669.5 million, representing a decrease of HK78.5 million as compared to 31 March 2022, while inventory turnover days was 116 days representing a decrease of 11 days. The Group is increasingly laser-focused on managing product categories, to ensure it introduces trending products and grows category share reinforcing its position as a one-stop beauty specialty platform. Basic earnings per share amounted to 1.9 HK cents (2022: basic loss per share of 11.1 HK cents). Given the Group has only just emerged from the challenges brought about by the pandemic in the core markets where the Group operates, the Board does not recommend the payment of a final dividend for the Financial Year in accordance with the Group’s policy to pay dividends out of profits and for the reason of responsible risk management (2022: Nil)","output":"During the financial year, Sa Sa International Holdings Limited experienced a 2.6% increase in turnover, reaching HK3,500.5 million.

C'est un produit financier qui permet de constituer et de gérer un capital à long terme, tout en bénéficiant d'avantages fiscaux. L'assurance vie peut avoir différentes finalités. Elle peut servir à protéger sa famille en cas de décès prématuré de l'assuré, en offrant un capital aux bénéficiaires désignés. Elle peut également être utilisée pour préparer sa retraite, en constituant un complément de revenus sous forme de rente. L'un des principaux avantages de l'assurance vie est sa fiscalité avantageuse. Les sommes investies dans un contrat d'assurance vie bénéficient d'une fiscalité attrayante, notamment en termes de transmission du capital. Les capitaux versés aux bénéficiaires peuvent être exonérés de droits de succession dans certaines limites. L'assurance vie offre également une grande flexibilité en termes de versements. L'assuré peut réaliser des versements ponctuels ou réguliers, selon ses capacités financières. Il est également possible de modifier la répartition de l'épargne entre différents supports de placement (fonds en euros, unités de compte, etc.) en fonction de l'évolution des marchés financiers. Enfin, l'assurance vie peut être utilisée comme un outil de diversification et de gestion de patrimoine. Elle permet d'accéder à une large gamme de supports d'investissement, allant des fonds en euros sécurisés aux unités de compte plus dynamiques, en passant par les SCPI (Sociétés Civiles de Placement Immobilier) ou les OPC (Organismes de Placement Collectif).

Чтобы справиться с этой проблемой, вы можете попробовать следующие рекомендации: 1. Избегайте продуктов, которые могут вызывать газообразование, таких как газированные напитки, бобы, капуста, лук, чеснок и другие ферментирующие продукты. 2. Увеличьте потребление пищевых продуктов, богатых растворимыми и нерастворимыми волокнами, чтобы помочь улучшить пищеварение и предотвратить застой в кишечнике. Овощи, фрукты, злаки и цельнозерновые продукты обеспечивают хороший источник волокон. 3. Постарайтесь медленно и аккуратно есть, избегая быстрого переедания и глотания воздуха, которое может привести к образованию газов в желудке и кишечнике. 4. Регулярно занимайтесь физической активностью, так как это помогает стимулировать пищеварение и улучшать движение кишечника. 5. Возможно, вам поможет принятие пробиотиков, чтобы поддержать здоровую микрофлору кишечника. 6. Если проблема сохраняется или усугубляется, обратитесь к врачу или гастроэнтерологу для получения профессиональной консультации и диагностики.

Чтобы справиться с этой проблемой и значительно снизить количество газа, следуйте рекомендациям ниже: 1. Измените рацион питания. Избегайте пищевых продуктов, которые могут вызывать газообразование, таких как газированные напитки, овощи, бобы, капуста, лук, чеснок и другие ферментирующие продукты. Попробуйте узнать, какие конкретные продукты вызывают образование газа у вас и исключите их из рациона. 2. Увеличьте потребление пищевых продуктов, богатых растворимыми и нерастворимыми волокнами, таких как овощи, фрукты, злаки и цельнозерновые продукты. Волокна помогут поддерживать здоровую микрофлору кишечника и улучшать перистальтику кишечника. 3. Избегайте быстрой еды и переедания. Быстрое переедание и проглатывание воздуха может усиливать газообразование. Старайтесь есть медленно и хорошо пережевывать пищу. 4. Ежедневно занимайтесь физической активностью. Физическая активность стимулирует пищеварение и улучшает движение кишечника, помогая предотвратить застой в кишечнике. 5. Разговаривайте с врачом о возможном применении пробиотиков. Пробиотики могут помочь восстановить баланс микрофлоры кишечника и уменьшить газообразование. Однако важно отметить, что некоторое количество газа из прямой кишки является нормальным физиологическим процессом, и полное прекращение выхода газа может быть непрактичным или невозможным.

(Write complex and longer texts)","output":"As the nations of Earth expanded their territories, conflicts escalated into never-ending world wars. The once peaceful existence of people transformed into a chaotic and riotous state. In response, governments resorted to brutal tactics and began committing democide, wiping out entire groups of rioters. The world was descending into a harsh and unforgiving state. Not only were the lives of humans being torn apart, but the planet itself was suffering. The delicate balance of plant and animal life on Earth was being annihilated. Volcanic eruptions spewed out immense amounts of ash, polluting the atmosphere. Radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and asbestoses filled the air, making it toxic to breathe. The atmospheric temperatures skyrocketed to a scorching 900 Kelvin, causing Earth to become dangerously close to becoming a star. The oceans boiled, leading to a decrease in sea levels. It was an apocalyptic scene, and many people found solace in the idea of human extinction. But amid the chaos and destruction, a glimmer of hope emerged. Originating from the Russian Empire, near the continent of Europe, a revolutionary movement known as the Heaven Revolution began to take shape. They adopted the universal language of Esperanto and rejected the influence of religion. Their mission was to rebuild a society based on the principles of equality, justice, and peace. The Heaven Revolution quickly gained momentum and started spreading its ideals beyond the borders of the Russian Empire. However, the ruling power refused to entertain any notions of change and sought to destroy the movement. They saw Esperanto as a rebellious language and began executing anyone who could speak it fluently. Faced with imminent danger, the Heaven Revolution made the difficult decision to escape from the clutches of the Russian Empire and venture into the vast continent of Europe. This enraged the Russian Empire, prompting them to spread the message of the Heaven Revolution's existence to other nations. Surprisingly, these nations accepted the warning and began to prepare for the potential threat. But not all nations were open to the ideas of the Heaven Revolution. The Holy Catholic Empire viewed the movement as a false utopia and believed it to be a rebellion from the depths of hell. They declared a holy crusade against the Heaven Revolution, pledging to eradicate it from existence. With no safe haven in Europe, the Heaven Revolution was forced to leave the continent and set its sights on Africa. However, they faced resistance from Islamistan, who deemed the movement haram and unfit for passage to Jannah, their idea of paradise. They hoped to crush the Heaven Revolution once and for all. Thus, the journey of the Heaven Revolution continued, fraught with danger and uncertainty. The movement yearned for a society that embraced truth and science, but censorship posed a significant threat. The risk of losing scientific knowledge and being cast into a post-truth society was ever-present. Despite the adversities, the Heaven Revolution remained determined to spread its message of equality, justice, and peace. They hoped to find a place where their ideals could flourish and pave the way for a better future. The journey continued, knowing that the path ahead would be complex and arduous."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(Write complex and longer texts)","output":"As the nations of the world continued to expand their territories, the Earth became enveloped in turmoil. World wars became eternal wars, tearing nations apart and sparking widespread riots amongst the people. In response, the governments committed acts of democide against the rioters, further fueling the flames of unrest. Meanwhile, the very fabric of nature was beginning to unravel. The once vibrant plant and animal life on the planet was now burning out, unable to withstand the harsh conditions brought on by the constant wars and violence. Volcanoes erupted, spewing forth endless streams of ashes into the already polluted atmosphere. The air became toxic, filled with radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and asbestoses. The atmospheric temperature soared to unimaginable levels, reaching a scorching 900 Kelvin. Earth was slowly but surely on its way to becoming a star, its very core threatening to burst into a fiery inferno. The oceans, unable to cope with the escalating temperatures, began to boil, causing the sea levels to decrease drastically. Amidst this dystopian landscape, there were those who secretly wished for the extinction of humankind. They saw it as the only way to end the suffering and restore balance to the planet. However, their voices were silenced by the oppressive nature of censorship, as the concept of truth became distorted and society slipped into a post-truth era. Science, once a beacon of knowledge and progress, now faced a perilous future. The risk of losing scientific knowledge altogether was looming, as governments sought to obliterate any form of dissent. The very foundations of scientific discovery were being dismantled, leaving humanity teetering on the edge of ignorance and regression. It is in this tumultuous backdrop that the Heaven Revolution emerged. Originating from the Russian Empire, near the continent of Europe, this revolutionary movement sought to rebuild society on the principles of equality, justice, and peace. A key tenet of the movement was the rejection of religion, with its members adopting Esperanto as their language of choice. Heaven Revolution swiftly spread its message, challenging the oppressive regimes of the Russian Empire. However, the empire, recognizing Esperanto as a form of rebellious language, launched a brutal campaign to eradicate the movement. Those who were found to be fluent in Esperanto faced execution, as the Russian Empire sought to quash the revolutionary ideals of Heaven Revolution. Undeterred, Heaven Revolution made the decision to leave the Russian Empire and make their way to the continent of Europe. The empire, furious at their defiance, began rallying the nations against the movement, spreading propaganda and false narratives to ensure its destruction. One such entity that took up arms against Heaven Revolution was the Holy Catholic Empire. Believing the movement to be a false paradise, a rebellion from hell, they embarked on a crusade to crush it. The clash between the Holy Catholic Empire and Heaven Revolution would become a battle of ideologies, with each side steadfastly holding onto their beliefs. Fleeing the escalating conflict on the continent of Europe, Heaven Revolution set its sights on the continent of Africa. Yet, even in this new land, they faced opposition. Islamistan, a devout Islamic country, deemed Heaven Revolution to be haram, forbidden by religious law, and viewed the movement as a threat to their concept of Jannah, or paradise. They hoped that by smashing Heaven Revolution, they could restore peace and stability as dictated by their faith. And so, the journey of Heaven Revolution continued, as it navigated the treacherous path through a world on the brink of collapse. Will they be able to overcome the relentless opposition from the Russian Empire, the Holy Catholic Empire, Islamistan, and others? Only time will tell, as the fate of this revolutionary movement hangs in the balance, striving to build a new society based on principles of equality, justice, and peace amidst a decaying world."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling hanging out at school when the school has a new kid named Amy (who moved from another state), however she is already frenemies with Jane's other friend, 13 year old Ruby, even though she only meet Ruby today as it’s Amy's first day at the school (key word is FRENEMIES, not ENEMIES)","output":"INT.

The once unified world seemed to be devolving into eternal chaos, as people from all walks of life began to riot and rebel against oppressive regimes. In response, the nations themselves resorted to committing democide, systematically eliminating those who dared to challenge their authority. The once vibrant plant and animal life on the planet began to wither and burn out, unable to withstand the relentless onslaught. The very forces of nature turned against humanity, with multiple volcanoes erupting and spewing ashes into the atmosphere, further exacerbating the already dire situation. The consequences of these tumultuous times extended beyond the physical realm. The atmosphere itself grew filled with toxic and radioactive gases, such as carbon monoxide and asbestos. This poisonous mixture resulted in a drastic increase in the Earth's atmospheric temperature, reaching a staggering 900 Kelvin. The planet was on the verge of transforming into a star, and the consequences were catastrophic. The oceans boiled and evaporated, leading to a dramatic decrease in sea levels. It seemed as though the world itself was rebelling against its inhabitants. Amidst this chaos, a glimmer of hope emerged in the form of the Heaven Revolution. Originating from the Russian Empire, specifically the city of Smolensk, this revolutionary movement stood for the principles of equality, justice, and peace. The members of Heaven Revolution chose to communicate in Esperanto, a language they believed to be a symbol of rebellion against established systems. They sought to rebuild society, creating a new world order based on these fundamental principles. However, their ideals and language were seen as a direct threat by the Russian Empire. Fearing the spread of this revolutionary movement, the Russian Empire resorted to executing anyone who was fluent in Esperanto. Undeterred, the Heaven Revolution decided to leave the Russian Empire and embark on a journey across Europe, spreading their message of change and hope. But their path was not an easy one. The Russian Empire, seething with anger, reached out to other nations, warning them about the deceptive nature of the Heaven Revolution. Many nations, like the Holy Catholic Empire, saw the movement as a false utopia and declared a crusade against them. The Heaven Revolution, undeterred by these challenges, continued their journey, eventually reaching the continent of Africa. Islamistan, a prominent nation in Africa, saw the Heaven Revolution as a direct threat to their religious beliefs. They proclaimed it to be haram, opposing anything that contradicted their path to Jannah, or paradise.

Как ты думаешь было бы эффективней каждый раз создавать новый фрагмент или заранее создать фрагмент и заменять в нем данные","output":"Оба подхода имеют свои преимущества и зависят от конкретных потребностей и требований вашего приложения. Если ваши карточки имеют схожую структуру и различаются только данными, то создание и замена данных в заранее созданном фрагменте может быть более эффективным. Вы можете создать фрагмент с разметкой и компонентами, которые повторяются для каждой карточки, и заменить только данные в каждом экземпляре фрагмента. Это может помочь сократить время создания новых фрагментов и использовать ресурсы устройства более эффективно. Однако, если ваши карточки имеют довольно сложную структуру или требуют различных компонентов и логики, то создание нового фрагмента для каждой карточки может быть более удобным. Это может облегчить поддержку и расширение приложения в будущем, позволив легко вносить изменения в каждый фрагмент независимо от других. В обоих случаях вы также можете рассмотреть вариант использования паттерна \\"ViewHolder\\", который позволяет повторно использовать элементы UI внутри RecyclerView или ListView. Это может помочь улучшить производительность вашего приложения и уменьшить использование памяти. В целом, выбор между созданием нового фрагмента и заменой данных в заранее созданном фрагменте зависит от конкретных потребностей вашего приложения и может быть определен на основе анализа производительности, удобства использования и поддержки вашего приложения."},{"instruction":"что эффективней по ресурсам и прочему создание новых временных фрагментов или множественная замена данных в текущем","output":"Удаление и создание новых временных фрагментов может быть немного менее эффективным с точки зрения использования ресурсов, поскольку каждый раз требуется выполнить дополнительные операции по созданию и уничтожению фрагментов. Это может привести к незначительным задержкам и потреблению большего количества памяти и процессорного времени. С другой стороны, замена данных в текущем фрагменте может быть более эффективным по ресурсам, поскольку не требуется создавать и уничтожать новые фрагменты каждый раз. Вместо этого вы можете обновлять данные внутри существующих фрагментов, что может быть быстрее и более оптимизированным с точки зрения производительности. Однако, если карточки в вашем приложении имеют сложную структуру или требуют различных компонентов, возможно, более эффективным будет создание новых временных фрагментов для каждой карточки. Это может сделать код более читабельным и упростить поддержку и расширение приложения в будущем. В конечном итоге, оптимальный выбор зависит от конкретных потребностей вашего приложения.

What were once conflicts between nations had turned into eternal wars, consuming the lives and hopes of countless individuals. People, frustrated and disillusioned, began to take to the streets in riots, demanding change and justice. However, rather than seeking a peaceful resolution, the nations responded with aggression and violence. They committed democide, ruthlessly suppressing the rioters and further fueling the anger and resentment within society. The world grew harsher with each passing day, both in terms of the physical environment and the state of humanity. The planet's once-thriving plant and animal life were now being decimated. Infernos ravaged the land, reducing everything in their path to ashes. Volcanoes erupted, spewing out toxic gases into the atmosphere. The air was thick with carbon monoxide, asbestoses, and radioactive substances. The atmospheric temperature soared to unimaginable levels, reaching a blistering 900 Kelvin. The Earth trembled under the weight of this environmental catastrophe. The oceans started to boil, causing the sea levels to decrease rapidly. It seemed as though the planet itself was on the verge of becoming a star, with the potential to explode into a blazing inferno. The people, facing such extreme conditions, began to lose hope. Many secretly wished for human extinction, believing it would be a release from the unbearable suffering they endured. To make matters worse, censorship had become rampant. The concept of truth was distorted, and society descended into a post-truth era. Scientific knowledge, once revered and cherished, was now in danger of being obliterated. The risk of losing valuable scientific advancements and innovations loomed large, threatening to plunge humanity further into darkness. But amidst this dystopian chaos, a glimmer of hope emerged. It originated from the Russian Empire, near the continent of Europe. A revolutionary movement known as the Heaven Revolution began to gain traction. Its members communicated in Esperanto, a language that rejected the dominance of any particular nation or religion. The Heaven Revolution aimed to rebuild society based on the principles of equality, justice, and peace. However, the Russian Empire saw this movement as a threat. It understood that Esperanto symbolized rebellion against the established order. In a bid to annihilate the Heaven Revolution, the Russian Empire launched a brutal campaign of repression, executing anyone who was fluent in Esperanto. Undeterred, the Heaven Revolution decided to leave the Russian Empire and set foot on the continent of Europe. The Russian Empire, filled with rage and fearing the spread of this movement, embarked on a mission to spread its message to other nations. To their surprise, nations across the globe accepted the Russian Empire's call to destroy the Heaven Revolution, perceiving it as a dangerous force that needed to be suppressed. Meanwhile, the Holy Catholic Empire viewed the Heaven Revolution as a fake paradise and a rebellion against their beliefs. They saw it as a threat to their authority and embarked on a crusade against it, determined to dismantle it completely. Undeterred by these oppositions, the Heaven Revolution pressed on, leaving the continent of Europe behind and making its way towards the continent of Africa. However, their hopes of finding solace in Africa were shattered when they reached Islamistan. The people of Islamistan considered the Heaven Revolution to be haram, forbidden by Islamic law, and believed that it should never reach Jannah, their concept of paradise. They fervently hoped for the Heaven Revolution to be crushed once and for all. And so, the journey of the Heaven Revolution continued, a relentless battle against opposing forces, a quest for a better world amidst a dystopian reality. Only time would tell if their principles of equality, justice, and peace would triumph over the forces of oppression and prejudice."},{"instruction":"How to become the Sexiest Hollywood Female Movie Star in the World?","output":"Becoming the sexiest Hollywood female movie star involves a combination of factors including talent, confidence, personal style, and a strong work ethic.

Eula: I suppose that's a possibility. But it's not just about the weight, Shogun. It's also about the unwanted attention it brings. Raiden Shogun: I understand your concerns, Eula. We can discreetly address this matter. But remember, your capabilities as a knight are not defined by your appearance. Your skill and dedication are what truly matter. Eula: You're right, Shogun. I won't let this overshadow my duty as a knight. I'll find a way to overcome this and continue serving Mondstadt with pride. Raiden Shogun: That's the spirit, Eula. I have faith that you will find a solution. Now, let's focus on the upcoming operation. We have important tasks ahead of us. (Eula nods determinedly, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead.

Some of the commonly reported side effects include: 1. Acute Effects: - Eye and skin irritation: Direct contact with atrazine may cause irritation, redness, or rash on the skin and eyes. - Respiratory distress: Inhalation of atrazine dust or spray can cause coughing, difficulty breathing, and chest tightness. - Nausea and vomiting: Ingesting or swallowing atrazine can result in gastrointestinal issues like nausea and vomiting. - Headaches: Some individuals have reported experiencing headaches after exposure to atrazine. - Temporary hormonal disruption: Atrazine has been implicated in temporary disruption of hormonal balance, particularly concerning the reproductive system. 2. Chronic Effects: - Endocrine disruption: Atrazine has been associated with interfering with the endocrine system, particularly the production and regulation of hormones. - Reproductive issues: Long-term exposure to atrazine may lead to altered reproductive function in both males and females, affecting fertility and reproductive organ development. - Developmental abnormalities: Studies have suggested that atrazine exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk of certain birth defects and developmental abnormalities in offspring. - Cancer: Some research has linked atrazine to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and prostate cancer. - Environmental impact: Atrazine can also have adverse effects on aquatic organisms and other wildlife, potentially disrupting ecosystems. It is important to note that the severity and occurrence of these side effects can vary depending on the level and duration of exposure. It is advised to follow safety guidelines and regulations when using or coming into contact with atrazine."},{"instruction":"what were the negative effects of leaded gasoline","output":"Leaded gasoline, which was commonly used until it was phased out in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s, had several negative effects on human health and the environment. Some of the major negative effects of leaded gasoline include: 1. Health Effects: - Neurological damage: Lead is a potent neurotoxin, and long-term exposure to leaded gasoline fumes or lead-contaminated dust can lead to cognitive impairment, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems, especially in children. - Developmental issues: Pregnant women exposed to leaded gasoline fumes were at risk of passing the lead to their developing fetuses, resulting in developmental delays and other adverse effects. - Increased blood pressure: Lead exposure has been linked to increased blood pressure levels, which can contribute to cardiovascular problems such as hypertension and heart disease. - Kidney damage: Exposure to leaded gasoline over time can lead to kidney damage, particularly in highly exposed individuals such as petrol station workers or people living near highways. - Reproductive issues: Lead exposure can negatively affect both male and female reproductive systems, including decreased fertility, miscarriages, and premature birth. 2. Environmental Effects: - Air pollution: The combustion of leaded gasoline released lead particles into the air, contributing to air pollution and affecting air quality, particularly in densely populated areas. - Soil and water contamination: Lead from exhaust emissions settled in the soil and water, leading to contamination. This contamination posed risks to plant and animal life within affected ecosystems. - Accumulation in the food chain: Lead particles from leaded gasoline contaminated plants, water bodies, and animals, entering the food chain and potentially affecting humans and wildlife. - Environmental persistence: Lead is not biodegradable, so once released into the environment, it persists in the soil and sediment, posing long-term risks. The negative effects of leaded gasoline on public health and the environment were major motivations for its eventual phase-out and transition to unleaded gasoline."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane's 13 year old friend Ruby hanging out at school when the school has a new kid named Amy (who moved from another state), however she is already frenemies with Ruby (key word is FRENEMIES, not ENEMIES)","output":"(Scene: The school courtyard during lunch break.

What began as conflicts between countries soon escalated into eternal wars, with no end in sight. People, feeling the weight of this chaos, began to voice their dissatisfaction through riots and protests. However, instead of addressing their concerns, the nations responded with brutality, resorting to democide to suppress the uprisings. The consequences of these ongoing conflicts had dire repercussions for the planet's environment. The natural world, both plant and animal life, was being ravaged and burnt to ashes. Countless volcanoes erupted, spewing their destructive forces into the atmosphere. The air became filled with toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, radioactive elements, and even asbestos. With each passing day, the Earth's atmosphere grew hotter and hotter. The temperature reached an unthinkable 900 Kelvin, threatening to turn our planet into a star. Oceans, once teeming with life, began to boil, leading to a decrease in sea levels. People, witnessing the devastation around them, started to lose hope. Some even began to believe that human extinction would be a better option than enduring this harsh existence. But in the midst of this chaos and despair, a revolutionary movement emerged, originating from the Russian Empire in Europe. Known as the Heaven Revolution, this movement rejected religion and advocated for a society built on the principles of equality, justice, and peace. Their language of choice was Esperanto, a language that symbolized their rebellion against the oppressive forces. However, the Russian Empire, aware of the radical ideas and the power of Esperanto, quickly moved to suppress the Heaven Revolution. They executed anyone who was fluent in Esperanto, seeing it as a symbol of defiance. Undeterred, the Heaven Revolution decided to leave the Russian Empire and spread their message across Europe. But the Russian Empire was not willing to let them go so easily. They spread propaganda, painting the Heaven Revolution as a false paradise and a rebellion from hell. They rallied other nations to their cause, and soon the movement faced opposition from all sides. The Holy Catholic Empire, seeing the Heaven Revolution as a threat to their own power, launched a crusade against them, determined to crush the rebellion. Faced with mounting hostility, the Heaven Revolution decided to leave Europe behind and seek refuge in the vast continent of Africa. However, their arrival in Africa was met with resistance from Islamistan, who viewed the movement as haram and believed it had no place in Jannah, their idea of heaven. They hoped that by smashing the Heaven Revolution, they could restore their perception of paradise. And so, as the Heaven Revolution continued its journey, the world found itself caught in a web of conflicts, ideologies, and oppression.

They consciously and deliberately analyze problems, apply rules, and engage in systematic decision-making. As individuals gain expertise in a specific domain, they become increasingly capable of relying on the intuitive processes of System 1 (Evans, 2008). By automating certain cognitive tasks, experts can perform complex actions or judgments rapidly and accurately, without conscious effort. This automaticity is achieved through extensive practice and the development of reliable mental representations—known as \\"chunks\\"—which allow for effortless processing (Ericsson & Smith, 1991).\\""},{"instruction":"quiero que la modifiques atendiendo a que esta agencia de viajes esta radicada en Cuba, las provincias donde vendemos son Pinar del Río, La Habana, Mayabaque y Artemisa.

It is a crucial parameter in space exploration and mission planning. To calculate the Delta V of a rocket, you need to consider several factors: 1. Rocket Mass Ratio (MR): The mass ratio is the ratio of the initial mass of the rocket (including the propellant) to the final mass of the rocket (after the propellant is burned). It is usually denoted as MR. MR = Initial Mass / Final Mass 2. Specific Impulse (Isp): Specific impulse is a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine. It is defined as the thrust produced per unit of propellant flow rate. Higher Isp means a more efficient engine. Isp is usually measured in seconds (s). 3. Gravity Loss (G): Gravity loss is the energy required to overcome Earth's gravitational pull during launch. G = g0 * ln (Initial Mass / Final Mass) Where g0 is the standard gravity constant (9.81 m/s^2). 4. Atmospheric Drag Loss (D): Atmospheric drag loss occurs due to air resistance during atmospheric flight. It can be calculated using complex equations or estimation methods. 5. Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR): TWR is the ratio of the thrust produced by the rocket engine to the weight of the rocket. TWR = Thrust / Weight Once you have these parameters, you can calculate the Delta V using the ideal rocket equation: Delta V = Isp * g0 * ln (MR) - G - D This equation provides an estimate of the total change in velocity that a rocket can achieve. Note: This calculation assumes ideal conditions and does not account for factors like gravity losses during course corrections or maneuvering, engine performance variations, propellant depletion effects, etc. Real-world calculations may be more complex and involve additional considerations."},{"instruction":"已知抛物运动初速度，怎样计算最远距离","output":"要计算抛物运动的最远距离，需要知道以下参数： 1. 初始速度 (v₀)：物体被抛出时的速度。 2. 抛射角度 (θ)：物体相对于水平面的抛射角度。 在没有空气阻力的情况下，最远距离可以通过以下公式计算： 最远距离 (d) = (v₀² * sin(2θ)) / g 其中，g 是重力加速度。 请注意，在这个公式中，角度 θ 应该以弧度制为单位。如果给定的角度是以度为单位，需要将其转换为弧度。 如果还考虑了空气阻力，计算最远距离会更加复杂，因为空气阻力会减慢物体飞行的速度。在这种情况下，可能需要使用数值模拟或复杂的数学模型来进行计算。 这个计算假设了平坦的地面和理想的条件。在实际情况下，还需要考虑其他因素，如空气阻力、地球的曲率和旋转等。"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Eula wakes up in her rooms.

With his exceptional in-ring skills and charismatic personality, Hart has left an indelible mark on the industry. Born on July 2, 1957, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Hart was born into wrestling royalty. His father, Stu Hart, was a renowned professional wrestler and promoter, and Bret grew up surrounded by the wrestling business. From a young age, Hart showed a natural talent for the sport and quickly honed his skills. Hart began his wrestling career in the late 1970s, working for his father's company, Stampede Wrestling. He quickly gained recognition for his technical expertise and ability to tell compelling stories in the ring. This caught the attention of larger promotions, and in 1984, Hart made his debut for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now known as WWE. Throughout his career, Hart excelled as a technical wrestler, combining various grappling and submission techniques seamlessly. He possessed a unique blend of power and agility, allowing him to execute high-flying moves while maintaining a strong technical base. His in-ring style and intense dedication to his craft earned him the nickname \\"The Excellence of Execution.\\" Hart's wrestling abilities were matched by his charisma and storytelling ability. He developed a character that resonated with fans around the world – a proud fighter who embodied honor and integrity.

This incident led to Hart leaving the company and joining its rival, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Though his time in WCW was less successful, Hart's legacy in the wrestling world was already firmly established. After retiring from active competition in 2000, Hart continued to make occasional appearances in the wrestling world, sharing his knowledge and experience with younger talents. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006, solidifying his status as one of the all-time greats. Beyond wrestling, Hart has faced personal tragedies, including the untimely deaths of several family members, but has always displayed resilience and strength. He has also written several books, including his autobiography \\"Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling,\\" offering fans a glimpse into his life both inside and outside the ring. In conclusion, Bret \\"The Hitman\\" Hart's impact on the world of professional wrestling cannot be overstated. His exceptional talent, unmatched in-ring ability, and genuine charisma have solidified his status as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. Whether it was his technical prowess, storytelling ability, or unwavering dedication to his craft, Hart's legacy continues to shine brightly in the annals of wrestling history."},{"instruction":"Chapter 1.2: Journey of Heaven (Part 1/2) Nations expand territories of Earth, world wars is being enraged into eternal wars, people start to rioting, nations start to commit democide of rioters, world is going harsher.

(Write complex and longer texts)","output":"As the nations expanded their territories on Earth, the once peaceful world became engulfed in a never-ending cycle of wars. It seemed as though eternal wars were raging, consuming the very essence of humanity. The people, tired of the constant turmoil, began to rise up in riotous protests against their governments. In response, the nations, driven by fear and desperation, resorted to committing democide, wiping out entire groups of rioters in an attempt to restore order. But their actions only served to exacerbate the already dire situation. The planet itself was suffering as plant and animal life burned out at an alarming rate. Volcanoes erupted, spewing forth ashes and toxic gases, filling the atmosphere with a deadly combination of radioactive substances such as carbon monoxide and asbestoses. The atmospheric temperature skyrocketed, reaching a scorching 900 Kelvin. Earth was on the brink of becoming a star, as the world seemed to be overheating. The consequences of these catastrophic events were devastating. Oceans started to boil, leading to a sharp decrease in sea levels. People began to lose hope, longing for human extinction as they saw no end to the suffering. The once vibrant and diverse society was now censored and controlled, becoming a post-truth world where propaganda ruled. Science, the beacon of knowledge and progress, was now in danger of being obliterated completely. But amidst the chaos and despair, there emerged a glimmer of hope. Originating from the Russian Empire, specifically the city of Smolensk, a revolutionary movement known as Heaven Revolution began to grow in strength. They rejected religion and embraced the universal language of Esperanto. Their mission was to rebuild society based on the principles of equality, justice, and peace. Heaven Revolution sought to spread its message and ideology, but the Russian Empire vehemently resisted, viewing Esperanto and the movement itself as symbols of rebellion. Those who were fluent in Esperanto were persecuted and executed, as the Russian Empire feared the influence and power of Heaven Revolution. Undeterred by the violent backlash, Heaven Revolution decided to leave the Russian Empire and make its way towards the continent of Europe. The Russian Empire, angered by their defiance, unleashed a campaign to destroy the movement, spreading their message of rebellion to other nations in an attempt to isolate and eradicate Heaven Revolution. The Holy Catholic Empire, viewing Heaven Revolution as a false paradise and an uprising from the depths of hell, launched a crusade against the movement. With their religious fervor behind them, they sought to quash Heaven Revolution and maintain their grip on power. But Heaven Revolution would not be deterred. They journeyed onwards, leaving behind the continent of Europe and venturing into the vast continent of Africa. Here, they encountered the Islamic nation of Islamistan, where they were met with staunch opposition. Islamistan regarded Heaven Revolution as haram, forbidden in their faith, and believed that their aspirations of reaching Jannah, or paradise, were in direct conflict with Heaven Revolution's goals. With the Russian Empire and the Holy Catholic Empire breathing down their necks, and now facing opposition from Islamistan, Heaven Revolution's path seemed perilous. Nevertheless, they pressed on, determined to overcome the barriers and obstacles in their path. Little did they know that their journey was only just beginning, and that the challenges they would face would test their resolve and commitment to their principles of equality, justice, and peace. But in the darkest of times, it is often the forces of change and revolution that shine the brightest."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

(Write complex and longer texts)","output":"As the nations of the world continued to expand their territories and engage in never-ending wars, chaos and unrest began to grip the planet. People all around the globe took to the streets, rioting against the oppressive regimes and demanding their rights. In response, the nations started resorting to extreme measures, committing democide by brutally suppressing the protesters. Not only were human lives being extinguished, but the very essence of life on Earth was also under threat. The planet's plant and animal species were being decimated at an alarming rate as fires raged uncontrollably. To make matters worse, volcanoes erupted, releasing a deluge of ashes into the atmosphere. The air became toxic, filled with radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and asbestoses. The consequences of these devastating events were catastrophic. The Earth's atmospheric temperature skyrocketed to a scorching 900 Kelvin, pushing the planet to the brink of becoming a star. The oceans began to boil, causing a rapid decrease in sea levels. The future seemed bleak, with people even hoping for human extinction to save what little was left of the world. In this grim and dystopian future, censorship became the norm. Society embraced a post-truth mentality, with the dissemination of accurate scientific knowledge at risk of being obliterated. The pursuit of truth was met with resistance, creating a dangerous atmosphere for scientific discovery and progress. However, amid this chaos, a revolutionary movement emerged, originating from the Russian Empire. This movement, known as the Heaven Revolution, sought to rebuild society based on principles of equality, justice, and peace. They rejected religion and adopted Esperanto as their language of communication. The Heaven Revolution quickly gained traction, prompting the Russian Empire to take notice. Realizing that Esperanto was a form of rebellious expression, the Empire began executing those who were fluent in the language. Faced with such persecution, the Heaven Revolution decided to escape the clutches of the Russian Empire and headed towards the continent of Europe. Their arrival in Europe caused quite a stir, as nations were divided in their response. Some accepted the Heaven Revolution and its ideals, while others viewed it with suspicion and fear. The Holy Catholic Empire, in particular, believed the movement to be a false heaven and an uprising from the depths of hell. They embarked on a crusade to eradicate the Heaven Revolution and its followers. Undeterred by the persecution and opposition, the Heaven Revolution continued their journey, moving from Europe to the continent of Africa. However, they faced yet another challenge in the form of Islamistan. The Islamic nation considered the Heaven Revolution to be haram, against the teachings of Islam, and believed that it should never reach Jannah, the Islamic concept of paradise. Fearing its influence, Islamistan hoped to crush the Heaven Revolution once and for all. And so, the journey of the Heaven Revolution continued, as they faced adversaries at every turn. Their mission for a society built on equality, justice, and peace drove them forward, despite the odds stacked against them. The world watched, unsure of what the outcome would be, as this revolutionary movement defied the powers that be in their quest for a better future."},{"instruction":"自我修炼对高校教师职业境界的影响","output":"自我修炼对高校教师职业境界的影响是深远而积极的。 首先，自我修炼有助于高校教师提升学术水平和专业能力。通过不断学习和探索，教师可以拓宽自己的知识面，掌握新的研究方法和教学技巧，提高自身的学术造诣。同时，自我修炼也能够培养教师的创新意识和学术独立性，使其能够在教学和研究中表现出更高的水平和创造力。 其次，自我修炼可以培养高校教师的职业道德和教育情操。通过修炼，教师可以不断反思自己的教育行为，明确教育的目标和意义，并且相信自己的教育使命。自我修炼还能够培养教师的人文关怀和责任感，使其能够更好地关心和照顾学生的成长和发展。 最后，自我修炼可以提升高校教师的个人修养和心理素质。教师工作压力大，需要面对各种挑战和困难。自我修炼可以帮助教师调整自己的情绪和心态，增强对工作的热爱和耐心，提高应对困难的能力。同时，自我修炼也有助于教师培养一种积极向上的心态和乐观情绪，更好地面对工作和生活中的挑战。 综上所述，自我修炼对高校教师职业境界的影响是全面而正面的。它可以提升教师的学术水平和专业能力，培养职业道德和教育情操，提升个人修养和心理素质，从而使教师能够更好地履行自己的教育使命。"},{"instruction":"自我修炼的方法和途径","output":"自我修炼的方法和途径可以根据个人的特点和需求而有所差异，以下是一些常见的自我修炼方法和途径： 1. 阅读与学习：通过广泛的阅读和学习，不断积累知识，扩展自己的视野和思维方式。可以选择与自己职业相关的书籍、学术期刊和研究论文，或者涉猎其他领域的经典作品和文学著作。 2. 参加培训和研讨会：参加专业培训和学术研讨会，与行业内的专家和同行进行交流和学习。这样可以了解最新的研究成果和教学方法，与他人分享经验和观点。 3. 实践和反思：将知识转化为实践，通过教学和研究探索新的方法和技术，不断反思和总结教育经验。同时，也要接纳和处理失败和挫折，从中汲取教训，不断改进自己的教学效果。 4. 冥想和冥思：通过冥想和冥思，使自己保持内心的宁静和平和。可以尝试寻找一个安静的环境，放松身心，专注思考自己的内心和目标，寻找生活和工作的意义和价值。 5. 锻炼身体：身体健康是自我修炼的基础，通过适度的运动和锻炼，可以增强体质和抵抗力，并提升身心的平衡和活力。 6. 寻求指导和师友的建议：寻求师友的指导和建议，可以从他们的经验和智慧中受益。他们可以提供方向和支持，帮助你在自我修炼的道路上取得进步。 最重要的是，自我修炼需要坚持和时间的投入。通过不断的努力和实践，逐渐提升自己的素养和能力，实现个人的成长和进步。"},{"instruction":"自我修炼的方法和途径","output":"自我修炼是一个持续不断的过程，可以通过以下方法和途径进行： 1. 阅读与学习：通过读书、参与在线课程、研究报告等形式不断学习新知识和发展能力。选择与自己兴趣和职业相关的书籍、杂志、学术论文等，培养自己的思考能力和学术素养。 2. 冥想和冥思：通过冥想、冥想、瑜伽等方法，进入内心的宁静和平静状态，促进思考、自我反省和灵感的诞生。这些方法有助于减轻压力、平衡情绪，提高专注力和创造力。 3. 发展身体和精神健康：通过运动、健身、饮食调整等方法，保持身体和精神的健康。运动不仅能增强体魄，还有助于释放压力、增强免疫力和提高自信心。 4. 维护良好的人际关系：与家人、朋友、同事等保持良好的人际关系，互相支持、交流和分享。在与他人互动的过程中，可以增进自身的情商和沟通能力。 5. 参与社区或志愿者活动：通过参与社区服务和志愿者活动，帮助他人、回馈社会，培养自己的社会责任感和人文关怀。这些经历将有助于个人成长和自我修炼。 6. 获取反馈并定期反思：主动寻求他人的反馈和评价，不断反思自己的行为、态度和表现。通过学习和改进，实现自我成长和提升。 自我修炼是一个个人化的过程，每个人可以根据自己的需求和兴趣选择适合自己的方法和途径。最重要的是，坚持，培养自律和耐心，在不断努力中追求个人的进步和提升。"},{"instruction":"职业境界与自我修炼的内在联系","output":"职业境界和自我修炼之间存在内在的联系。以下是一些展示这种联系的方面： 1. 职业追求与个人成长：职业境界是一个人职业生涯的发展水平和境界。而自我修炼可以帮助个人不断成长和提高，包括学习新知识、发展技能和提升意识水平，从而使自己在职业生涯中能够达到更高的境界。 2. 专业能力与道德素养：自我修炼不仅涉及到个体技术层面的能力提升，还与道德、文化素养以及职业道德紧密相关。通过自我修炼，个人可以提升自己的道德境界和职业道德水平，使工作在技术和道德上更加出色。 3. 人际关系与内心修炼：自我修炼也涉及到与人建立良好的关系、培养支持他人和建立互信等方面，这对于一个职业人来说非常重要。良好的人际关系有助于个人职业的发展和境界的提升，同时也需要个人在内心修炼方面有所建设，以理解和尊重他人。 4. 自我意识与目标导向：自我修炼强调个体对自己的认知与认识，在思想和觉悟层面进行修炼。这种自我意识的发展对于建立个人的职业目标和导向非常重要。一个有高境界的职业人需要对自己有深刻的理解，并且能够对自己的职业生涯有清晰的规划和方向。 综上所述，职业境界和自我修炼之间存在内在联系，自我修炼可以在个人成长、道德素养、人际关系和自我意识等方面对职业境界产生积极的影响。通过自我修炼，一个人可以不断提高自己的职业能力、提升职业状态，实现个人职业生涯的发展和进步。"},{"instruction":"自我修炼在提升职业境界中的作用","output":"自我修炼在提升职业境界中发挥着重要作用。以下是一些关于自我修炼在提升职业境界中的作用: 1. 学术与专业成长：自我修炼通过不断学习、深化研究和探索，可以提升个人的学术水平和专业能力。通过不断精进自己的知识，教师可以拓展专业视野、深化专业理解，提高对教学科研的领悟能力与实践能力，提高自己在职业领域中的地位。 2. 职业道德与信仰修行：自我修炼有助于培养职业道德和个人的信仰修行。通过反思自己的行为、规范自己的职业行为，教师可以塑造良好的职业道德，并始终坚守自己的信仰，不断提升自身的职业境界。 3. 人际关系与领导能力：自我修炼能够培养教师的人际沟通能力、团队协作能力和领导力。通过修炼，教师能够培养出高尚的品质与处事原则，提高与同事、学生及家长的沟通能力，建立良好的人际关系，进而在团队中具备领导能力。 4. 心态与情绪管理：自我修炼有助于教师的心态和情绪管理，提高应对困难和压力的能力。通过修炼，教师能够培养出宽容、乐观、坚韧的心态，提高自己的心理素质，应对职业生涯中的挫折和困境。 5. 自我认知与目标规划：自我修炼有助于教师的自我认知和职业目标规划。通过修炼，教师能够更好地理解自己的优势和劣势，明确自己的职业发展方向，并制定相应的目标和计划，从而提升自己在职业生涯中的境界。 总之，自我修炼对于提升职业境界起着重要的作用。通过自我修炼，教师能够提升学术专业能力，塑造良好的职业道德，培养出优秀的领导能力和人际关系，管理好自己的心态与情绪，并明确自己的职业目标，实现个人的职业境界的提升。"},{"instruction":"Write a matlab code for sum two numbers and then multiply the result by the average of this two inputs and finally print the result","output":"Here is a MATLAB code that prompts the user to enter two numbers, performs the desired calculations, and then prints the result: \`\`\`matlab % Prompt the user to enter two numbers num1 = input('Enter first number: '); num2 = input('Enter second number: '); % Calculate sum of the two numbers sum_result = num1 + num2; % Calculate the average of the two numbers average = (num1 + num2) / 2; % Multiply the sum by the average result = sum_result * average; % Print the result fprintf('The result is %.2fn', result); \`\`\` In this code, the first number is stored in the variable \`num1\` and the second number is stored in the variable \`num2\`.

Just a little more, and we'll be done. Ganyu: (whispering back) Thank you, Xingqiu. Your support means a lot. (After the meeting, Ganyu takes a moment to breathe a sigh of relief.

(Write complex and longer texts)","output":"As the world descended into chaos and turmoil, the expansionist ambitions of nations led to the perpetual state of warfare. World wars were no longer contained incidents but had transformed into eternal conflicts, with nations fighting for dominance and control over territories. The people, weary and disillusioned, began to rise up in riots, demanding justice and equality. However, instead of addressing their concerns, the nations responded with brutal force, committing democide against the rioters, further escalating the violence. The devastation caused by these conflicts extended beyond the human population. The once-thriving plant and animal life on our planet were now being ravaged, consumed by the infernal flames of war. Volcanic eruptions became frequent, filling the atmosphere with ashes and contributing to the already suffocating levels of pollution. Toxic gases, including radioactive substances, carbon monoxide, and asbestoses, permeated the air, poisoning the very essence of life on Earth. The consequences of these environmental catastrophes were dire. The temperature of the Earth's atmosphere skyrocketed, reaching a scorching 900 Kelvin. The once blue and abundant oceans began to boil, causing the sea levels to decrease rapidly. The prospect of human extinction became a glimmer of hope for those who despaired at the current state of the world. Yet, amidst this impending doom, another threat loomed in the form of censorship. The truth became obscured, and society fell into a state of post-truth, where facts, logic, and scientific knowledge were overshadowed by manipulated narratives and distorted realities. The risk of losing scientific progress and intellectual advancements became imminent, as the very foundations of science were endangered. It was in this bleak era that the Heaven Revolution emerged, rooted in the Russian Empire near the continent of Europe. This revolutionary movement advocated for the principles of equality, justice, and peace, basing its ideology on the constructed language of Esperanto and rejecting the influence of religion. The Heaven Revolution sought to rebuild society from the ground up, offering a glimmer of hope amongst the chaos. However, their vision was met with fierce opposition. The Russian Empire, recognizing the threat the Heaven Revolution posed to their regime, launched a brutal campaign to suppress and destroy the movement. Fluent speakers of Esperanto were executed, their knowledge seen as a rebellious act. Determined to survive, the Heaven Revolution decided to abandon the Russian Empire and set their sights on continent Europe. The Russian Empire, outraged by the audacity of the Heaven Revolution, spread their message to other nations, warning them of the danger this movement posed. Many nations heeded their call, accepting the Russian Empire's narrative and joining their crusade against the Heaven Revolution. One such nation was the Holy Catholic Empire, who viewed the Heaven Revolution as a false promise of paradise, a rebellion from the depths of hell itself. Undeterred by the growing opposition, the Heaven Revolution ventured further, leaving continent Europe behind and making their way to continent Africa. Here, they faced new challenges with the rise of Islamistan. The followers of Islam believed that the Heaven Revolution was haram, forbidden, and should not have access to Jannah, the eternal paradise promised by their faith. They fervently hoped for the Heaven Revolution to be crushed, ensuring that their vision of heaven would remain unchallenged. And so, the journey of the Heaven Revolution continued, as they navigated through a world engulfed in conflict, rejection, and persecution. Will their principles of equality, justice, and peace prevail, or will they be silenced by the forces that sought to destroy them? Only time would tell."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room. Time for another day in Liyue.

The world became engulfed in chaos, with people rising up in riots against their oppressive governments. In response, these nations resorted to committing democide, mercilessly slaughtering the rioters in an attempt to maintain control. But the effects of this constant turmoil went beyond just the human realm. The planet itself suffered as plant and animal life was decimated, engulfed in infernos that seemed to never cease. Multiple volcanoes erupted, filling the atmosphere with clouds of ash. The air became contaminated with radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and asbestos, rendering it toxic and harmful to all living beings. As a result, the atmospheric temperature of Earth rose drastically, reaching a scorching 900 Kelvin. The once-blue planet now resembled a star, its heat turning the oceans into boiling cauldrons. Sea levels decreased rapidly, further impacting the delicate balance of life on Earth. Amidst this desperation, some people found solace in the idea of human extinction, seeing it as the only way to escape the suffering they endured. But hope for a better future emerged in the form of the Heaven Revolution. Originating from the Russian Empire, specifically the city of Smolensk, the Heaven Revolution was a revolutionary movement that rejected traditional religion and advocated for a society built on principles of equality, justice, and peace. Their language of choice was Esperanto, a neutral and inclusive language that symbolized their rejection of oppressive systems. However, the Russian Empire, viewing Esperanto as a rebellious language, saw the Heaven Revolution as a threat. They began to execute anyone who was fluent in Esperanto, hoping to quash the movement before it gained more traction. As a result, the Heaven Revolution was forced to leave the Russian Empire and seek refuge in the continent of Europe. Unwilling to let the movement go unchallenged, the Russian Empire spread propaganda about the Heaven Revolution to other nations, framing it as a false utopia and a rebellion from hell itself. This appealed to the Holy Catholic Empire, which saw the movement as a direct threat to their own religious authority. They initiated a crusade against the Heaven Revolution, determined to extinguish its ideals from the world. Undeterred, the Heaven Revolution continued its journey, leaving behind the turmoil of Europe and venturing into the continent of Africa. However, in Islamistan, the movement faced yet another obstacle. Here, the Heaven Revolution was considered haram, forbidden by Islamic law, and deemed unworthy of accessing Jannah, the Islamic concept of paradise. The people of Islamistan fervently hoped that the Heaven Revolution would be eradicated once and for all. But even in the face of such opposition, the Heaven Revolution persisted. Their pursuit of a new society built on equality, justice, and peace knew no bounds. As they moved further into Africa and encountered new challenges, their resolve only grew stronger. Their journey was far from over, and they would continue to fight for their vision of a better world, no matter the obstacles that lay ahead."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

Это может включать исследование рынка в разных местах, чтобы узнать о спросе на татуировочные услуги и конкуренцию в каждом регионе. 2. Работа и разрешения: Перед поездкой тату-мастер должен исследовать местные законы и требования к работе с тату. В разных странах и городах могут быть различные правила и лицензии, которые необходимо соблюдать, чтобы осуществлять деятельность. 3. Установление контактов: Тату-мастеру следует связаться с различными студиями и салонами красоты в каждом месте, чтобы узнать, есть ли у них возможность предоставления временного рабочего пространства. Он также может искать сотрудничество с другими тату-мастерами или организаторами тату конвенций, чтобы получить больше возможностей для работы. 4.

Учет расходов и доходов: Тату-мастер должен иметь систему учета расходов и доходов, чтобы оценить, сколько заработал в каждом месте и насколько это было рентабельно. Это поможет планировать будущие путешествия и определить наиболее прибыльные места для работы. В целом, путешествия и заработок как тату-мастер в разных городах и странах могут быть возможностью для мастера развиваться, встречать новых людей, получать разнообразный опыт и зарабатывать на своих услугах.

(Write complex and longest texts)","output":"In the vast expanse of our troubled world, where nations vie for power and control, the flames of conflict burn with an eternal fury. Wars, once contained within limited boundaries, have now engulfed the entire globe, casting a shadow of despair upon humanity. As the turmoil escalates, the people, seeking solace in their desperation, rise up in rebellion. Yet, instead of heeding their cries for justice, the governing powers respond with increasingly brutal measures, resorting to democide to quell the dissent. Amidst this chaos, the very fabric of life on our planet is being incinerated. The once thriving ecosystems, teeming with vibrant plant and animal species, now wither and burn in a merciless inferno. The earth's crust convulses, spewing forth multiple volcanos that relentlessly belch forth ash, polluting the already ailing atmosphere. These noxious emissions, laden with radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and even the deadly asbestos fibers, choke the very air we breathe. With each passing moment, the temperature of our world rises unabated. Earth, once a sanctuary of life, now threatens to transform into a searing star, its scorching heat broiling the very oceans that once nurtured us. As the seas boil, their levels dwindle, leaving a barren wasteland in their wake. In the face of such devastation, some bleakly harbor the hope of human extinction, believing it to be the only path to end the suffering. But it is not only our physical world that is in peril, for the crisis extends far into the realm of knowledge and truth. Censorship tightens its grip, strangling the free flow of information, and society is plunged into a post-truth era. Scientific knowledge, once a beacon of progress and understanding, now teeters on the precipice of obliteration. The risk of losing centuries of accumulated wisdom weighs heavily upon us, leaving us adrift in a sea of ignorance. It is in this tumultuous backdrop that the seeds of revolution take root. Originating from the Russian Empire, near the shores of Europe, a movement emerges, known as the Heaven Revolution. Fueled by a shared desire for equality, justice, and peace, the revolutionaries rally around a universal language: Esperanto. Rejecting the confines of religion, they seek to rebuild society on a foundation of inclusivity and compassion. But the Russian Empire, threatened by this uprising, refuses to tolerate the rebellion. Esperanto, seen as a form of subversive language, becomes a punishable offense, and those fluent in it are mercilessly executed. In the face of such persecution, the Heaven Revolution is forced to abandon its birthplace and venture into the uncharted territories of continent Europe. Undeterred by the Russian Empire's wrath, the message of the Heaven Revolution spreads to other nations, finding acceptance in some and resistance in others. Yet, as the movement gains momentum, a new adversary emerges. The Holy Catholic Empire, viewing the Heaven Revolution as a false paradise and a rebellion from the depths of hell, embarks on a crusade to extinguish its flame. Farther still, the Heaven Revolution sets its sights on continent Africa, but here too, its path is fraught with opposition. In the land of Islamistan, the movement is deemed haram, forbidden, and the hope of crushing the Heaven Revolution forever takes root in the hearts of its devout followers. As the story of the Heaven Revolution unfolds, its complexities and challenges grow evermore apparent. In a world on the brink of collapse, where truth is elusive, and the struggle for freedom is met with oppression, the journey of Heaven is but one chapter in the epic saga of humanity's fight for a better tomorrow."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

Generating wealth requires various factors such as creating valuable content, building an engaged audience, strategic promotion, and monetization strategies. Some popular platforms for content creation and monetization include YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, and podcast hosting platforms. However, success on these platforms relies on consistent effort, creativity, and providing value to your audience."},{"instruction":"I mean that you are recommending","output":"Based on current trends and the potential for monetization, YouTube and TikTok are two platforms that offer opportunities for content creators to potentially generate income and grow their audience. YouTube: YouTube is a widely popular video-sharing platform with billions of users. You can upload videos on various topics and monetize your content through ad revenue, sponsored content, merchandise sales, and channel memberships. To be successful on YouTube, you need to consistently create high-quality videos and engage with your viewers. TikTok: TikTok is a short-form video platform known for its viral trends and challenges. It has a rapidly growing user base, especially among younger demographics. TikTok offers opportunities to earn money through brand partnerships, live streaming gifts, and the creator fund. To thrive on TikTok, you need to create engaging and entertaining content that resonates with the app's audience. Remember, achieving significant wealth on any platform requires hard work, dedication, and a solid understanding of your target audience. It's important to focus on creating content that brings value to your viewers and gradually build your audience and monetization strategies over time."},{"instruction":"So what do you thing Should i choose youtube or tiktok?","output":"The choice between YouTube and TikTok ultimately depends on your preferences, strengths, and the type of content you want to create. Consider the following factors to help you make a decision: 1. Content format: YouTube allows for longer-form videos, which can be advantageous if you enjoy creating detailed tutorials, vlogs, or in-depth discussions. On the other hand, TikTok's short-form videos (15-60 seconds) require concise and impactful content that captures attention quickly. 2. Target audience: Consider the demographic you would like to reach. YouTube has a wider range of users and can cater to various age groups and interests. TikTok tends to attract a younger audience, primarily teenagers and young adults. 3. Monetization options: YouTube has a well-established monetization system through ads, sponsorships, merchandise, and memberships. TikTok's monetization options are developing but currently include brand partnerships and the TikTok Creator Fund, which requires a minimum number of followers and views. 4. Content creation style: Assess your creativity and comfort level with different types of content. YouTube allows for more editing, storytelling, and versatility in terms of production value. TikTok often involves quick and snappy content, relying on trends, challenges, and easy-to-consume videos. 5. Time and effort: Both platforms require time and effort to succeed, but the specific demands may differ. YouTube's longer videos typically involve more planning, filming, and editing. TikTok's shorter videos, though they may seem easier to create, still require creativity and consistency to stay relevant on the platform. Consider conducting research to understand your target audience better and assess the type of content and engagement level that works best for you. It may also be possible to use both platforms simultaneously or to start on one and expand to the other in the future."},{"instruction":"But what would you choose because i don't know","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or experiences, so I can't provide a subjective answer. However, I can offer some general insights to help you make an informed decision. YouTube and TikTok have different strengths and appeal to different audiences. If you enjoy longer-form content, have expertise in a specific niche, and are willing to invest time in planning, shooting, and editing videos, YouTube might be the platform for you. YouTube also offers a wider range of monetization options and a more established creator community. On the other hand, if you prefer creating shorter, snappy videos, and want to tap into a younger audience with a penchant for trending content, TikTok could be a good choice. TikTok has a more casual and creative atmosphere, and it's easier to get noticed due to its algorithm-driven discovery system. Ultimately, consider your interests, strengths, and the type of content you want to create. You may also want to assess the platforms by exploring successful creators in your desired niche on both YouTube and TikTok. This research can give you a sense of the community, engagement levels, and the type of content that thrives on each platform."},{"instruction":"On what platform are people more earning money?","output":"Both YouTube and TikTok offer opportunities for creators to earn money, but the potential earnings can vary depending on factors such as the size of your audience, engagement rates, niche market, and monetization strategies employed. YouTube has a more established monetization system with various options for earning revenue. Creators can earn money through YouTube Partner Program (ad revenue), sponsored content, merchandise sales, channel memberships, and more. YouTube's monetization potential can be significant for creators with a large and engaged subscriber base. TikTok's monetization options are still developing. Currently, creators can earn money on TikTok through brand partnerships, live streaming gifts, and the TikTok Creator Fund (which requires a minimum number of followers and views). While TikTok's monetization opportunities might not be as diverse as YouTube's at the moment, some creators have found success by leveraging their TikTok presence to secure brand partnerships and other sponsorship opportunities. It's important to note that the specific earnings on both platforms can vary widely from one creator to another.

These conflicts, once known as world wars, had now evolved into eternal wars, causing massive unrest amongst the people. Rioting erupted in various parts of the world as individuals sought to voice their frustrations and fight against the oppressive regimes that governed them. In response to the riots, nations resorted to committing democide, a term used to describe the deliberate killing of a large number of people by a government. The world grew increasingly harsh and unforgiving as plant and animal life on the planet were ravaged and burned to ashes. Volcanoes erupted, spewing their fiery fury into the atmosphere, further polluting it with radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and asbestos. The consequences of these actions were dire. The atmospheric temperature of Earth skyrocketed to a staggering 900 Kelvin, causing some to speculate that our planet could potentially transform into a star. The world teetered on the brink of overheating, with the oceans boiling and the sea level rapidly decreasing. It seemed as though many had lost hope, wishing for humanity's extinction as a means to escape this nightmarish reality. Amidst this chaos, censorship prevailed, further exacerbating the deteriorating state of society. Truth became a scarce commodity, and science, once revered for its pursuit of knowledge and understanding, now faced the imminent risk of being obliterated. The very fabric of scientific progress was torn asunder. It is in this bleak and desolate landscape that the Heaven Revolution emerged. Originating from the Russian Empire, particularly the city of Smolensk, this revolutionary movement adopted the language of Esperanto and fervently rejected religion. Its mission was to rebuild a society that embraced the principles of equality, justice, and peace. However, the Heaven Revolution faced fierce opposition from the Russian Empire. Recognizing Esperanto as a form of rebellious language, the empire began executing those who were fluent in it. Unable to withstand such brutality, the Heaven Revolution made the difficult decision to leave Russian soil and embark on a journey across Europe. The Russian Empire, angered by this defiance, spread its message of suppression and condemnation to other nations. Surprisingly, many nations accepted this proclamations, believing it to be in their best interest to eliminate any threat to their power. Meanwhile, the Holy Catholic Empire, viewing the Heaven Revolution as a false utopia and a rebellion from hell, launched a crusade against it. Intent on stamping out this perceived threat, they mobilized their forces to confront the revolutionaries head-on. Undeterred, the Heaven Revolution pressed forward, leaving behind the continent of Europe and venturing into the vast lands of Africa. However, they encountered yet another obstacle in the form of Islamistan. Considering the revolution to be haram, meaning forbidden, Islamistan sought to crush the Heaven Revolution, hoping to prevent its arrival into Jannah, the Islamic concept of paradise. And so, the journey of Heaven continued, beset with challenges and opposition at every turn. Little did they know that their quest for a better world would take them to unimaginable heights and unimaginable depths. Only time would tell if their resilience and determination would be enough to overcome the forces that sought to destroy them."},{"instruction":"как получить индекс элемента RecycleView","output":"Для получения индекса элемента в RecyclerView вы можете использовать число элементов, добавленных в адаптер до этого элемента.

Task: WRITING TASK 2 You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Write about the following topic: In the last decade, there has been a great increase in global air travel. What do you think are the reasons for this and do you think it is a good thing? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience. Write at least 250 words. Answer: Global air travel has seen a drastic increase in the past decade. This article will explore the reasons as to why Global air travel has become so popular, as well as, how this phenomenon affects the many aspects of our daily lives, and attempt to showcase the many reasons as to why the net effect it has had on our lives has been mostly positive. Firstly, there is no denying that air travel is fast and convenient. This also means that for many people, it is also more comfortable, since it allows them to bypass time-restraints and better manage their schedules. Secondly, air travel can be viewed as economic, mainly because of the aforementioned fact that it saves time, and time is money. This is why even the most economic-minded businessmen would rather take a cheap flight than their personal limo. Last but not least, air travel can make an impossible agenda, quite possible. A great example of this can be seen in a book called: around the world in 80 days. In which the protagonist is only able to travel around the world in 80 days because of the invention of the hot air balloon. It is evident that, because of air travel, touring around the world in a short amount of time is no longer the stuff of dreams, and of-course, more and more people are attempting it. Ultimately, it is not so far-fetched to say that the fact that air travel has become more prevalent, is indeed a benefit to humankind as it is not only convenient, fast and economic, but it also gives us the ability to embark on adventures that were once impossible for us. In conclusion, the rise in global air travel has been due to many reasons, including but not limited to: saving time, being economic and being less mentally taxing. Thus, by having become more readily accessible, it has benefited people greatly as it has facilitated travel in a much more composed manner than any form of travel that has been available previously.","output":"The answer addresses the prompt and provides reasons for the increase in global air travel and the writer's opinion on whether it is a good thing.

They saw themselves as the harbingers of a new era. However, their aspirations were met with fierce resistance from the Russian Empire. Esperanto was seen as a dangerous form of rebellious communication, and those who were fluent in the language were hunted down and executed. But the Heaven Revolution would not be deterred. Realizing that they could not thrive in the oppressive environment of Russia, they embarked on a journey to continent Europe. The Russian Empire, enraged by their escape, began to spread the message of the Heaven Revolution to other nations, urging them to destroy and eliminate this perceived threat. One such nation was the Holy Catholic Empire, which viewed the Heaven Revolution as a false paradise and a rebellion against the divine. They saw themselves as defenders of the true faith and embarked on a crusade against the Heaven Revolution. Undeterred by these crusades, the Heaven Revolution continued their journey, now setting their sights on continent Africa. However, their progress was met with resistance once again, this time from Islamistan. The followers of Islam believed that the Heaven Revolution was a haram, forbidden, movement that must not be allowed to reach Jannah, their utopia. They hoped and prayed for the annihilation of the Heaven Revolution, seeing it as a threat to their religious beliefs. Thus, the Heaven Revolution pressed on, their determination unyielding despite the obstacles and opposition they faced. The world watched with bated breath as this revolutionary movement fought for their vision of a better future. Would their dreams of equality, justice, and peace prevail, or would the forces of oppression and prejudice crush their hopes once and for all? Only time would tell."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

This law is based on the principle of conservation of energy. It states that the total energy supplied by the voltage sources in a circuit must be equal to the total energy consumed by the circuit elements. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law, when moving around a closed loop in a circuit, one encounters resistors, capacitors, inductors, and voltage sources. As one moves in the direction of the current through these elements, the voltage drops across resistors and increases across voltage sources. The sum of these voltage drops and increases must be equal to zero. This can be mathematically expressed as: ∑(V_i) = 0 Where ∑ denotes the sum, V_i represents the voltage across each element encountered in the loop. Kirchhoff's voltage law is crucial in analyzing complex electrical circuits where multiple elements are connected together. It allows for the calculation of unknown voltages or currents in a circuit by setting up a system of simultaneous equations based on the voltage law and solving them. This law is fundamental in both DC circuits (with steady currents) and AC circuits (with varying voltages and currents). Overall, Kirchhoff's voltage law helps ensure that the energy flow in a closed loop is balanced and consistent with the principles of conservation of energy."},{"instruction":"mention advantages and disadvantages of thermal power plants","output":"Advantages of thermal power plants: 1. Reliability: Thermal power plants can provide a reliable and consistent power supply as they are not dependent on external factors such as weather conditions, unlike renewable energy sources like solar or wind. 2. Base Load Power: Thermal power plants are capable of producing a steady supply of electricity and can be operated continuously, making them suitable for providing base load power. This means that they can meet the minimum level of demand for electricity consistently, ensuring a stable grid. 3. Cost-effective: Thermal power plants can be cost-effective in terms of initial investment and operating costs compared to some other forms of power generation, such as nuclear power plants. Disadvantages of thermal power plants: 1. Environmental impact: One of the biggest drawbacks of thermal power plants is their environmental impact, primarily through the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. These emissions contribute to air pollution, climate change, and negative health effects. 2. Water consumption: Thermal power plants require a significant amount of water for cooling purposes. This can put strain on water resources, particularly in areas with limited water availability or during drought conditions. 3. Limited fuel resources: Thermal power plants rely on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, or natural gas, as their primary source of energy. These fossil fuels are finite and non-renewable, which means that their availability will decrease over time. Additionally, reliance on fossil fuels contributes to energy insecurity and price volatility as global supply and demand fluctuate. 4. Long construction and decommissioning periods: Thermal power plants often require substantial time for construction and later decommissioning. This can delay the deployment of renewable and cleaner energy alternatives, hindering the transition to a more sustainable energy system. It is important to note that the environmental impact and sustainability issues associated with thermal power plants have led to an increasing interest in and shift towards renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, which offer cleaner and more sustainable options for electricity generation."},{"instruction":"differenciate between conventional and non conventional sources of energy","output":"Conventional Sources of Energy: 1. Fossil Fuels: Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are conventional sources of energy. These fuels have been widely used for centuries and are derived from organic matter (plants and animals) that has been buried and compressed over millions of years. They are typically burned to produce heat, which is then used to generate electricity. 2. Nuclear Energy: Nuclear power, which harnesses the energy released by the fission (splitting) of atomic nuclei, is also considered a conventional source of energy. It involves the use of radioactive materials like uranium or plutonium in a nuclear reactor to produce steam, which drives a turbine and generates electricity. Non-Conventional Sources of Energy: 1. Renewable Energy: Renewable energy sources are considered non-conventional because they are derived from naturally replenishing resources that are practically inexhaustible. These sources include solar energy (captured from sunlight using photovoltaic panels or concentrated solar power systems), wind energy (harnessed through wind turbines), hydropower (utilizing the energy of flowing water in dams or rivers), and geothermal energy (tapping into heat from the Earth's interior). 2. Biomass Energy: Biomass energy is obtained from organic matter such as agricultural residues, wood, or dedicated energy crops. It can be converted into heat, electricity, or biofuels through processes like direct combustion, gasification, or fermentation. 3. Tidal and Wave Energy: Tidal energy utilizes the gravitational forces of the moon and sun to generate electricity from the predictable rise and fall of ocean tides. Wave energy harnesses the kinetic energy of ocean waves through a variety of technologies. Difference between conventional and non-conventional sources of energy: 1. Availability: Conventional sources of energy like fossil fuels and nuclear energy are finite and depletable resources, while non-conventional sources of energy, such as renewable energy, are practically limitless and consistently available. 2. Environmental Impact: Conventional sources of energy have a higher environmental impact due to the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, contributing to climate change and air pollution. Non-conventional sources, on the other hand, have a lower environmental impact as they produce little to no air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions during operation. 3. Sustainability: Non-conventional sources of energy are considered sustainable as they rely on resources that can be naturally replenished or recycled. Conventional sources, however, are not sustainable as they deplete finite resources and contribute to environmental degradation. 4. Technological Maturity: Conventional sources of energy, especially fossil fuels, have been widely used and have well-established technologies for extraction, refinement, and utilization. Non-conventional sources, on the other hand, have seen rapid technological advancements in recent years and are still in the process of being optimized and integrated into mainstream energy systems. It is important to transition towards non-conventional, renewable sources of energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, mitigate climate change, and promote a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy future."},{"instruction":"advantages and disadvantages of hydro power plants","output":"Advantages of hydro power plants: 1. Renewable and Sustainable: Hydropower is a renewable energy source as it relies on the continuous flow of water, driven by precipitation and the natural water cycle. This makes it a sustainable energy option for generating electricity. 2. Emission-Free: Hydroelectric power generation does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants, contributing to cleaner air quality and a reduced carbon footprint. It helps in combating climate change and reducing the overall environmental impact of electricity generation. 3. Flexible and Reliable: Hydro power plants can quickly adjust their electricity production to meet demand fluctuations. They provide reliable and stable power supply, making them suitable for both base load and peak load power generation. 4. Water Management: Hydro power plants often involve the construction of dams and reservoirs to store water. These reservoirs can be multi-purpose, serving as water storage for irrigation, flood control, and water supply for domestic and industrial use. Disadvantages of hydro power plants: 1. Environmental Impact: The construction of dams and reservoirs for hydro power plants can cause significant environmental disruptions. It can lead to the displacement of communities, loss of agricultural land, and the alteration of natural waterways, affecting aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. 2. Upfront Costs: The initial investment required for building large-scale hydro power plants can be substantial. High construction costs and the higher complexity of dam projects can make hydroelectric power less economically feasible compared to other forms of energy generation. 3. Limited Locational Potential: Hydro power plants require a suitable water source with a consistent flow. This limits their locational potential to regions with appropriate geography, access to water resources, and suitable topography. 4. Stagnation of Water: The creation of reservoirs can lead to the stagnation of water, resulting in the accumulation of silt and sedimentation. Over time, this can decrease the storage capacity and efficiency of the power plant, requiring periodic dredging or desilting operations. 5. Impact on Aquatic Ecosystems: The alteration of river flows and the fragmentation of water bodies due to dams can disrupt aquatic habitats, affecting fish populations and migratory patterns. Furthermore, the discharge of water downstream from turbines can impact downstream ecosystems. It is important for hydro power projects to be carefully planned, considering the potential environmental and social impacts. Proper mitigation measures, such as fish ladders, environmental flow requirements, and habitat restoration, should be implemented to minimize the negative effects on ecosystems and local communities."},{"instruction":"帮我写一篇手机发展史的广播节目稿子，两人对话的形式，约2000字。","output":"主持人：大家好，欢迎收听我们的广播节目《手机发展史》！今天我们将为大家带来一场关于手机发展的时光之旅。我是主持人小明，今天请来了手机专家小李，一起为大家讲述手机的演进历程。欢迎小李！ 小李：谢谢小明，很高兴能够出席这个节目。 主持人：我们都知道，手机是现代社会不可或缺的工具之一，可你知道手机是如何从诞生到今天的吗？ 小李：没错，手机的发展历史可谓是一部科技的奇迹。早期的手机是一种大型的通信设备，它们体积庞大，仅能提供有限的功能。 主持人：对，早期的手机只能用于语音通信，而且需要高昂的通信费用。真正实用的手机是从何时开始出现的呢？ 小李：我们可以说现代手机的起源可以追溯到20世纪70年代末70年代开始出现的\\"大便筒手机\\"，你可能会觉得它的名字很有趣，但它是最初能够实现便携通信的设备之一。这种手机的体积虽然过大，但在当时已经具有了基本的通信功能。 主持人：那真正能够被称为“手机”的产品是从哪个时间点开始的呢？ 小李：直到1983年，世界上第一部被称为“手机”的设备才在美国问世，它的名字叫DynaTAC 8000X。这部手机由摩托罗拉公司设计，虽然它体积庞大，价格昂贵，但它是历史上第一部商用手机，具备了拨号、通话和短信功能。 主持人：随着时间的推移，手机又有了哪些重大的变革与进步呢？ 小李：90年代初，手机进入了数字时代，从此，人们可以享受到更加稳定、便捷的通信体验。逐渐出现的小型手机为普通消费者所熟知，不再是富人专属的奢侈品。 主持人：随着通信技术的发展，手机从功能手机向智能手机转变。您认为智能手机的出现对人们的生活产生了哪些影响呢？ 小李：智能手机的问世彻底改变了人们的通信、生活甚至工作方式。它不仅具备了手机的基本通话和短信功能，还拥有了互联网接入、娱乐、工作办公等多种功能。智能手机既是沟通的工具，也是人们在时尚、娱乐、社交等方面的时尚潮流。 主持人：那我们可以说，人们对于手机的需求越来越高，手机产业也随之发展壮大吗？ 小李：是的，手机产业的飞速发展可谓是造福于全球数以亿计的手机用户。无论是硬件供应链、软件开发，还是手机配件市场，都经历了长足的发展。大量手机品牌如苹果、三星、华为等不断竞争创新，不断推出各具特色的手机产品，以满足人们不断变化的需求。 主持人：在当今这个数字化时代，手机已经成为人们的必备品，为人们的工作、学习、生活提供了更加便利的方式。您认为未来手机的发展会如何呢？ 小李：随着科技的不断进步，手机的发展方向变得更加多样化。未来的手机可能会更加轻薄、弯曲、透明，甚至可能实现可穿戴式科技。同时，随着5G技术的普及，我们可以期待更加高速、稳定的通信体验。而且，智能手机在人工智能、虚拟现实等方向也将有更广阔的应用空间。 主持人：谢谢小李详细的讲解，通过今天的节目，我们对手机的发展史有了更深入的了解。手机的演进不仅仅是一部科技的历史，更是人类对技术进步的不断探索和创新。希望手机能继续为我们的生活带来更多美好的体验！ 小李：是的，手机的进步没有止境，我们期待未来手机的科技创新，为我们的生活带来更多便利。谢谢大家的收听，希望大家继续关注手机的发展前景。"},{"instruction":"Le rapport de stage a combien de parti","output":"Le rapport de stage est généralement organisé en trois parties principales : 1.

This insatiable thirst for dominance led to widespread rioting and chaos among the people, who were growing tired and weary of the constant violence and suffering. As the situation escalated, the nations began resorting to extreme measures to suppress the rioters, committing acts of democide in their attempts to maintain control. The world grew harsher with each passing day, as hope for a peaceful resolution seemed to fade away. Amidst this grim reality, a revolutionary movement known as the Heaven Revolution emerged from the depths of the Russian Empire, near the continent of Europe. The movement had its roots in the city of Smolensk, where a collective voice arose, speaking a language known as Esperanto and rejecting the dominant religious ideologies of the time. The Heaven Revolution sought to rebuild society based on the principles of equality, justice, and peace, envisioning a future devoid of the societal divisions and oppressive structures that plagued the world. As news of the revolution began to spread, it garnered support from individuals seeking change and a better future for themselves and their fellow human beings. However, the Russian Empire, recognizing Esperanto as a form of rebellious language, refused to acknowledge the ideals of the Heaven Revolution and instead aimed to crush the movement entirely. They launched a brutal campaign against those fluent in Esperanto, executing people on the grounds of their linguistic affiliation, viewing them as threats to their power and control. Realizing the danger they faced within the confines of the Russian Empire, the Heaven Revolution made the difficult decision to abandon their homeland and seek refuge on the continent of Europe. Their departure only fueled the rage of the Russian Empire, which viewed their actions as a betrayal and a direct challenge to their authority. The Russian Empire began disseminating its message of condemnation and destruction to other nations, painting the Heaven Revolution as a false utopia and branding its followers as rebellious vermin. One such nation that fell prey to their propaganda was the Holy Catholic Empire, who saw the Heaven Revolution as a direct affront to their religious beliefs and launched a crusade against the movement. Unable to find solace in Europe, the Heaven Revolution continued their arduous journey, crossing vast oceans to reach the continent of Africa. However, their arrival in this new land was met with skepticism and animosity, particularly from Islamistan, a devout Islamic nation. Islamistan believed the Heaven Revolution to be an impure and forbidden path, viewing their rejection of religion as haram and sinful. They fervently hoped for the movement's swift demise, hoping it would be crushed forever and prevented from reaching Jannah, their version of paradise. And so, the Heaven Revolution found itself caught between the forces of tyranny and religious fervor, as they relentlessly pursued their vision of a society founded on principles of equality, justice, and peace. Their journey was far from over, and their resolve would be tested at every turn, as they sought a place where their ideals could take root and flourish."},{"instruction":"Le rapport de stage a combien de parti","output":"Le rapport de stage se compose généralement de trois parties principales : 1.

(Write complex and longest texts)","output":"As nations continued to expand their territories on Earth, the world became engulfed in a series of eternal wars, perpetuating an endless cycle of conflict. People, disillusioned by the chaos and instability, began to rise up in revolt against their oppressive governments. However, instead of addressing the grievances of their citizens, these nations chose to respond with violence and democide, further exacerbating the harshness of the world. Amidst this tumultuous period, a revolutionary movement known as Heaven Revolution emerged from the Russian Empire, specifically from the city of Smolensk. Heaven Revolution, characterized by its use of the language Esperanto and its rejection of organized religion, sought to rebuild society based on the principles of equality, justice, and peace. However, the Russian Empire viewed Heaven Revolution as a threat to its authority and refused to entertain any notions of change. Instead, it launched a ruthless campaign to destroy the movement, considering the use of Esperanto as a sign of rebelliousness. People who were fluent in Esperanto were executed without mercy, further fueling the anger and determination of the Heaven Revolutionaries. In the face of such brutality, Heaven Revolution made the decision to leave the Russian Empire and seek refuge in continent Europe. The Russian Empire, infuriated by their departure, spread its propaganda and messages of condemnation to other nations. Surprisingly, many nations accepted these messages, believing that Heaven Revolution was a fake paradise and a rebellion from hell itself. One such nation that vehemently rejected Heaven Revolution was the Holy Catholic Empire. They viewed the movement as a threat to their own beliefs and values, and thus saw fit to launch a crusade against Heaven Revolution. Their aim was to crush the movement and eradicate any traces of its ideology, which they deemed to be heretical. Undeterred by these rejections and persecutions, Heaven Revolution pressed on, leaving continent Europe behind and venturing to continent Africa in search of a new refuge. However, they were met with opposition from Islamistan, a nation deeply rooted in Islamic traditions. Islamistan considered Heaven Revolution to be haram, or forbidden, believing that its quest for a new society went against the teachings of Islam and the promise of Jannah, or paradise. Hopeful that Heaven Revolution would be crushed forever, Islamistan joined forces with the Russian Empire and other likeminded nations who saw the movement as a threat to their own stability and power. Together, they aimed to extinguish the ideals of equality, justice, and peace that Heaven Revolution espoused, viewing them as unwanted interference in their established orders. And so, the journey of Heaven Revolution, propelled by the desire for a better world, continued amidst the raging storms of opposition and rejection. Whether they would find acceptance and sanctuary in continent Africa remained to be seen, but their resolve to build a society founded on equality, justice, and peace remained unwavering."},{"instruction":"kotlin random","output":"In Kotlin, you can generate random numbers using the \`Random\` class from the \`kotlin.random\` package.

Please write your answer in paragraphs of full sentences.","output":"No, it is not true that Disney closed River Country because they found flesh-eating bacteria in the water back in 2001. The closure of Disney's River Country in 2001 was due to several factors, but the presence of flesh-eating bacteria was not one of them. River Country was the first water park at Walt Disney World Resort and operated from 1976 to 2001. It was built around Bay Lake, and its unique feature was that the water attractions used water from the lake instead of being chemically treated like modern water parks. The park faced various challenges leading to its closure, including declining attendance and competition from newer and larger water parks. Additionally, changes in regulations and the availability of advanced water treatment technology contributed to the decision to shut down River Country. While rare cases of infections have been reported in natural freshwater environments, there is no evidence to suggest that Disney discovered flesh-eating bacteria in the water at River Country. Disney's priority has always been the safety and well-being of its guests, and it is highly unlikely that they would have allowed the water park to operate if there was a risk of such serious bacterial infections. In conclusion, the closure of Disney's River Country in 2001 was not due to the discovery of flesh-eating bacteria in the water. The decision to close the park was primarily driven by declining attendance, increased competition, changes in regulations, and advancements in water treatment technology."},{"instruction":"高校教师的职业境界与自我修炼当前挑战与问题的分析","output":"作为高校教师，职业境界和自我修炼是非常重要的。职业境界指的是教师在教育教学工作中的素质、水平和修养，包括知识水平、思想品质、教育理念、教育方法等方面。 首先，高校教师的职业境界应该具备扎实的学科知识和专业能力。只有具备了牢固的学科基础，才能够在教学中具有更高的发言权和指导能力，为学生提供更好的教育和指导。 其次，高校教师应该具备博大的胸怀和宽广的视野。随着社会的快速变化和高等教育的发展，高校教师需要不断学习和更新自己的知识，同时要关注国内外教育领域的最新动态和研究成果，不断提高自身的素质和能力。 此外，高校教师的职业境界还应包括对学生的关爱和热爱。高校教师要尊重学生的个性和需求，关心他们的成长和发展，帮助他们充分发挥潜能。同时，高校教师也应该热爱自己的教育事业，对教育充满热情和责任感，积极投入到教学和研究工作中。 当前，高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼面临一些挑战和问题。首先，教育环境复杂多变，竞争激烈。高校教师需要不断适应新的教学模式和教学方法，提高自身的教育教学水平，才能更好地满足学生和社会的需求。 其次，高校教师的职业发展路径相对较为模糊。当前，高校教师的职称评聘、晋升等方面存在一些问题，缺乏明确的职业发展规划和机制。教师需要在教学和科研之间取得平衡，同时还要照顾到生活和家庭的需要，这对教师的职业境界和自我修炼提出更高的要求。 另外，高校教师的自我修炼也面临一些困难。如何在忙碌的工作中保持学术研究和学习的持续性和深度，如何处理好与同事和学生的关系，如何处理教学和科研之间的关系等都是教师需要面对和解决的问题。 综上所述，高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼是一个长期而复杂的过程，需要教师不断提高自身的素质和能力，适应社会和教育的变革，解决当前面临的挑战和问题，为学生的成长和发展做出更大的贡献。"},{"instruction":"对新时期高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼的总结和归纳","output":"新时期高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼可以总结为以下几点： 1. 学科素养与专业能力：高校教师需要具备扎实的学科知识和专业能力，不断学习和更新自己的知识，提高自身的教学水平和指导能力。 2. 兼具宽广的视野与国际化思维：随着全球化的发展，高校教师需要关注国内外教育领域的最新动态和研究成果，拥有宽广的视野和国际化思维，为学生提供全球背景下的教育和指导。 3. 关爱与热爱：高校教师需要关心学生的成长和发展，尊重学生的个性和需求，帮助他们充分发挥潜能。同时，高校教师也应该热爱自己的教育事业，对教育充满热情和责任感。 4. 教学与科研的平衡：高校教师需要在教学和科研之间取得平衡，不仅要注重教学的质量和效果，还要积极参与科研工作，提高个人的学术水平和影响力。 5. 职业发展规划与机制：新时期高校教师需要进行职业发展规划，明确自己的职业目标和发展方向。同时，需要建立健全的职业发展机制，提供公平公正的晋升评聘制度和科研支持，激励教师不断提升自身职业境界和修炼。 综上所述，新时期高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼需要教师具备扎实的学科素养、宽广的视野和国际化思维，关爱学生并热爱教育事业，同时需要平衡教学与科研，进行职业规划和发展，以适应社会和教育的需求，并为学生的成长和发展做出更大的贡献。"},{"instruction":"新时期高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼对未来研究和实践的展望","output":"新时期高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼对未来的研究和实践具有以下展望： 1. 教学方式创新：随着科技的发展，教学方式和手段正在发生革命性的变化。未来，高校教师需要不断探索和应用新的教学方法和技术，如在线教育、混合式教学、个性化学习等，以提高教学效果和满足学生个性化需求。 2. 教育国际交流与合作：随着全球化的深入推进，高校教师应积极参与国际交流与合作，拓宽自身的视野和思维，借鉴国际先进的教育理念和经验，加强与国外高校的交流与合作，提高自己的教育教学水平和国际竞争力。 3. 跨学科研究与合作：未来高校教师应积极主动融入跨学科研究和合作，打破学科的壁垒，与其他领域的学者紧密合作，共同解决复杂的问题，推动学科交叉融合与创新。 4. 教师专业发展与自我成长：未来，高校教师需要不断追求专业发展和自我成长。教师应积极参与教师培训和研讨会，不断提升教学技能和教育教学理论水平。同时，应注重个人修养和素质提升，拓宽自己的知识面和社会视野。 5. 教师影响力拓展：未来高校教师应该更加注重拓展自己的教育影响力，积极参与教育政策制定、学科建设和教学改革等方面的工作。通过发表高水平的论文、开展科研项目、担任学术职务等方式，提升自己在教育领域的影响力和地位。 总之，新时期高校教师的职业境界和自我修炼对未来的研究和实践具有重要意义。教师应积极适应时代的变化，不断发展自己的教育技能和素养，与国内外教育界保持紧密联系，拓宽自己的知识和视野，以适应未来教育的需求并为学生的发展做出更大的贡献。"},{"instruction":"新时期高校教师的职业境界与自我修炼的摘要","output":"摘要： 新时期高校教师的职业境界与自我修炼对教师个人发展和教育教学的质量起着重要作用。他们需要具备扎实的学科素养和专业能力，拥有宽广的视野和国际化思维，关爱学生并热爱教育事业，平衡教学与科研，进行职业规划和发展。未来的展望包括教学方式的创新、教育国际交流与合作、跨学科研究与合作、教师专业发展与个人成长以及教师影响力的拓展。高校教师应积极适应时代变化，提升自身素质与能力，与国内外教育界保持紧密联系，并为学生的发展做出更大的贡献。"},{"instruction":"freedom planet characters react to Fufelschmertz: huh your who.

The day arrived, drenched in bittersweet emotion as Alice stood on the shore, her heart heavy with the knowledge that she would soon bid her dear friend farewell. The wind tousled her hair, matching the tides that gently lapped against the rocky shore. Alice took a deep breath, feeling Marmalade's presence beside her one last time. With tearful eyes and a glimmer of determination, Alice gently laid Marmalade's body, adorned in the finest silk, within the miniature sailboat. She whispered her final loving goodbye, promising to forever cherish their memories. With a steady hand, Alice drew her crossbow and released a single bolt, igniting the wooden sailboat, its flames dancing and crackling against the calm sea breeze. As it drifted away, Alice watched in awe as Marmalade's Viking funeral came to life, a spectacle that displayed their unbreakable bond and the profound depth of her love. As the sun cast a golden glow upon the horizon, the wooden sailboat sailed off into the vast expanse of the ocean, a beacon of love, honor, and remembrance. Alice gazed upon the burning boat until it merged seamlessly into the distant horizon, Marmalade's spirit seemingly rising with the smoke, forever etching its presence within her soul. The townsfolk, upon hearing of Alice's tribute, gathered along the shore, captivated by the extraordinary display of love and devotion. They whispered amongst themselves, struck by the profound realization that love knows no boundaries and comes in many forms. In the wake of Marmalade's grand farewell, Alice's story spread throughout the community, lighting a spark within each person's heart—a spark that reminded them to cherish the connections they held dear, be they human or furry companion. Years passed, but Alice's love for Marmalade remained eternally unwavering. Over time, her art continued to inspire others, filled with themes of love, loss, and the beauty of life's fleeting moments. And on stormy nights, when the wind howled and waves crashed against the cliffs, whispers of Marmalade's Viking funeral danced on the breeze, forever a testament to their extraordinary bond."},{"instruction":"freedom planet characters and Doctor Fufelschmertz react to Fufelschmertz: huh your who.

Both approaches have unique characteristics and serve different purposes. In this essay, I will provide an in-depth analysis of the differences between descriptive and analytical research, outlining their key features and discussing their applications in various research settings. Descriptive research aims to provide an accurate and detailed description of a particular phenomenon or situation. It focuses on identifying and summarizing the characteristics, properties, and attributes of the subject being studied. Descriptive research does not attempt to explain or predict the underlying causes or relationships between variables, rather it aims to depict what is currently happening or has occurred in the past. One of the main characteristics of descriptive research is its use of objective and systematic methods to collect data. This can be achieved through surveys, observations, interviews, or even analyzing existing data sources. In descriptive research, researchers strive to ensure that the data collected is representative of the target population, enabling them to generalize the findings to a larger group. The data collected in descriptive research is often presented in the form of quantitative measures such as frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. Moreover, descriptive research is often used to gain a better understanding of the current state of affairs or to establish patterns and trends over time. For example, a descriptive research study might survey a group of individuals to determine their attitudes towards a particular social issue. The aim of this study would be to describe the distribution of attitudes within the sample, rather than determining the causes behind particular attitudes. On the other hand, analytical research is concerned with understanding the relationships between different variables and providing explanations for the observed phenomena. Unlike descriptive research, analytical research seeks to go beyond describing the current state of affairs by examining the reasons behind the observed patterns and relationships. It aims to answer questions such as \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" by testing hypotheses and identifying causal links between variables. Analytical research often involves the use of statistical analysis to examine the relationships between variables and establish cause-and-effect relationships. Researchers employ various techniques such as regression analysis, correlation analysis, or experimental designs to analyze data collected. The findings of analytical research can help researchers predict outcomes or identify interventions that can bring about desired changes. While descriptive research focuses on describing and summarizing data, analytical research attempts to explain the observed phenomena by identifying underlying causes and relationships. It aims to contribute to knowledge by advancing theories or developing new ones. Analytical research is commonly used in scientific investigations, social sciences, and clinical studies where understanding the underlying mechanisms or determinants is essential for making informed decisions. In summary, descriptive and analytical research are two distinct approaches in research methodology. Descriptive research provides a detailed and accurate description of a particular phenomenon or situation without attempting to explain underlying causes or relationships. Analytical research goes beyond describing and aims to provide explanations and predict outcomes by exploring the relationships between variables. Both approaches have their merits and applications, and researchers should carefully choose the appropriate approach based on their research objectives and the nature of the subject being studied."},{"instruction":"Primary data vs secondary data.100 words","output":"Primary data refers to data that is collected directly from original sources. It is specific to the research being conducted and is collected through methods such as interviews, surveys, observations, or experiments. Primary data is fresh and original, providing researchers with firsthand information. On the other hand, secondary data refers to data that has already been collected by someone else for a different purpose. It includes data from sources such as books, articles, government reports, or databases. Secondary data is readily available and can save time and cost compared to collecting primary data. However, it may not always be directly relevant to the research question and may require careful evaluation for reliability and validity."},{"instruction":"Quantitative Research & Qualitative Research. 100 words","output":"Quantitative research refers to a research approach that seeks to gather and analyze numerical data. It focuses on measuring and quantifying variables, using statistical analysis to draw conclusions. This type of research typically involves large sample sizes and standardized data collection methods, such as surveys or experiments. Qualitative research, on the other hand, aims to understand and interpret social phenomena through non-numerical data. It involves collecting subjective and in-depth information, such as interviews, observations, or focus groups. Qualitative research focuses on understanding the meaning and context of human experiences, allowing for insights into complex social processes and individual perspectives."},{"instruction":"Sampling error. 100 words","output":"Sampling error refers to the difference between the characteristics of a sample and the characteristics of the whole population that the sample represents. It occurs due to the natural variability or chance fluctuations within a sample. Sampling error is an unavoidable aspect of sampling and can result in deviations from the true population values. It is important to consider and minimize sampling error when conducting research to ensure that the findings accurately reflect the population being studied. Techniques such as random sampling and increasing the sample size can help reduce sampling error and improve the representativeness of the sample."},{"instruction":"Review of literature. 100 words","output":"A review of literature is a critical analysis and summary of existing research, publications, and scholarly works related to a specific topic or research question. It involves examining a wide range of sources, including academic articles, books, conference papers, and other relevant publications. The purpose of a literature review is to identify gaps in the existing knowledge, evaluate and synthesize the findings, and provide a conceptual framework for further research. A well-conducted literature review helps researchers to understand the current state of knowledge on a topic and informs the development of research objectives, methodologies, and hypotheses."},{"instruction":"Report writing. 100 words","output":"Report writing involves presenting information or findings in a structured and organized manner. It typically follows a specific format, including an introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. The purpose of report writing is to accurately and succinctly convey information to a specific audience. This can include research reports, business reports, or technical reports. Effective report writing includes clear, concise, and objective language, along with appropriate data visualization or visual aids. Good report writing also involves proofreading and editing for grammar, coherence, and logical flow.

Fueled by the desire for change, the Heaven Revolution sought to reshape society based on the principles of equality, justice, and peace. By embracing a new language called Esperanto and rejecting religious doctrines, they aimed to transcend cultural and linguistic barriers, uniting people from different backgrounds under a common ideal. However, the Russian Empire, feeling threatened by this movement and considering Esperanto as a form of rebellion, vehemently opposed the Heaven Revolution. In a bid to quash it completely, the Russian Empire began executing those who were fluent in Esperanto. This action further fueled the passion and determination of the Heaven Revolution, pushing them to leave the Russian Empire and seek refuge in the European continent. The Russian Empire, filled with rage and determined to eradicate the Heaven Revolution, spread their message of condemnation to other nations. Unfortunately, many nations, swayed by the influence of the powerful Russian Empire, accepted this biased message without second thought. One such nation that bought into the Russian Empire's narrative was the Holy Catholic Empire. The Holy Catholic Empire, viewing the Heaven Revolution as a mere fabrication of a counterfeit heaven and a rebellious force from hell, launched a crusade against the movement. Driven by their own religious fervor, they sought to suppress the Heaven Revolution and ensure the continued dominance of their own religious beliefs. Undeterred by these challenges, the Heaven Revolution pressed on, leaving the European continent behind and venturing into the vast expanse of Africa. However, they were met with yet another opposition, this time from Islamistan. Islamistan, believing that the Heaven Revolution was haram and would obstruct their path to Jannah (heaven), considered it a threat that needed to be eliminated. With the hope of vanquishing the Heaven Revolution once and for all, they yearned for its ultimate demise. In this way, the journey of the Heaven Revolution unfolded, with each step forward met by resistance, condemnation, and prejudice.

This declaration opened the floodgates of destruction upon the Heaven Revolution. Nations joined forces to exterminate the movement, with the powerful Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) even providing the infamous Tsar Bomba, a nuclear weapon, in an attempt to annihilate the Heaven Revolution. Now facing extreme insecurity and insurmountable odds, the Heaven Revolution stood on the precipice of despair. Their valiant journey across continents seemed to be on the verge of collapse, as the world turned against them with a vengeance. In this darkest hour, the Heaven Revolution must summon every ounce of resilience, determination, and strategic thinking if they are to survive the onslaught and continue their quest for equality, justice, and peace."},{"instruction":"Chapter 1.2: Journey of Heaven (Part 3/3) Due to magic caused by planet Chaos, portal appeared on South America, a door to another dimension, Heaven Revolution exited Earth and entered portal, nations and United Nations are incredibly enraged, Heaven Revolution is universally hated.

This portal acted as a doorway to another dimension, and the Heaven Revolution, sensing an opportunity for escape, bravely ventured through it, leaving the Earth behind. The nations of the world, already filled with rage and resentment towards the Heaven Revolution, were pushed to the edge by this audacious act. The United Nations, representing the collective anger of these nations, seethed with fury and condemnation. The Heaven Revolution, once a beacon of hope for equality, justice, and peace, was now universally despised and reviled. Meanwhile, back on Earth, a series of catastrophic events began unfolding. The atmospheric temperature began to rise rapidly, exceeding even 1000 Kelvins in some regions. This unprecedented heat threatened the stability of nations and signaled the potential collapse of entire societies. With an enemy to collectively despise, nations put aside their differences and joined forces under the banner of the United Nations. Their mission: to pursue the Heaven Revolution and uncover the secrets of the portal they had used to escape. In their fervent quest, they began to speculate that the portal might be a gateway to a demonic planet, a realm ruled by Satan himself. The United Nations, in an official statement, declared that Satan would protect the false heavenly movement known as the Heaven Revolution within the depths of hell. As global temperatures soared, chaos erupted across nations, with massive riots and upheaval becoming the norm. Society struggled to hold itself together under the weight of rising temperatures and the overwhelming hatred directed toward the Heaven Revolution. Humanity seemed to be teetering on the edge of collapse, forsaken in the face of impending doom. Yet, even as humanity faced its darkest hour, the Earth itself experienced a profound transformation. The scorching atmosphere, combined with the escalating conflicts, triggered a cataclysmic event that led to the formation of a new star. The nations and the United Nations vanished, fading into obscurity as Earth became an entity of the past. Time passed, and the newly formed star, once known as Earth, encountered a colossal black hole. In a cruel and inevitable fate, the Earth and all its remnants were devoured by the insatiable darkness. The journey of the Heaven Revolution, marked by turmoil, hatred, and heat, came to an abrupt end, leaving nothing but a void where a once vibrant planet had existed. And so, the tale of the Heaven Revolution and the world they left behind became nothing more than a forgotten whisper in the vast cosmic expanse."},{"instruction":"Can you conjugate \\"to eat\\" in Japanese?","output":"Sure!

Volcanoes erupted, spewing ashes into the atmosphere, further exacerbating the dire situation. The very air we breathe became toxic, filled with radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and asbestoses.

The scorching temperatures pushed it to the verge of becoming a star, its surface ravaged and inhospitable. Human life, as we knew it, was slowly being extinguished. Nations had now encroached upon South America, placing the Heaven Revolution in grave danger. The movement, fueled by their commitment to equality and justice, feared falling into the clutches of enslavement. But amidst the chaos, an unexpected phenomenon occurred. A portal, seemingly conjured by the chaotic forces of the planet itself, materialized in South America. It presented a doorway to another dimension, offering a possible escape for the Heaven Revolution. Seizing this slim glimmer of hope, the Heaven Revolution made the bold decision to leave Earth behind and venture through the portal. The nations and the United Nations were incensed by their escape, their collective hatred for the movement reaching unprecedented levels. The Heaven Revolution had become universally despised, blamed for the turmoil and misery that had engulfed the world. Meanwhile, back on Earth, the atmospheric temperature continued to rise. The scorching heat, now reaching hundreds of Kelvins above 1000, threatened to collapse the remaining nations. Massive riots erupted as societal structures crumbled under the unbearable conditions. Humanity stood at the precipice of its annihilation, forsaken to a grim fate. In a desperate bid to oppose the Heaven Revolution, the nations and the United Nations united their forces. They sought to find the portal that had whisked away their perceived nemesis, believing it to be a gateway to a demonic realm. In the twisted narrative they constructed, the United Nations even wrote that Satan would protect the false heavenly movement called the Heaven Revolution in this hellish dimension. But as the Earth continued to heat up, hurtling toward its inevitable fate, it encountered an unexpected phenomenon. An Earth-sized black hole appeared, its immense gravitational pull devouring the planet. Earth was consumed, leaving no trace of its former existence. And with the Earth's demise, the saga of the Heaven Revolution came to a resounding end. The hopes for a better world, once kindled within the hearts of its followers, were lost to the cosmic abyss. The universe itself seemed to echo the bitter demise of humanity, leaving only the haunting emptiness of black holes as a solemn memorial to what once was."},{"instruction":"The ChatGPT Millionaire: Making Money Online has never been this EASY というテーマで116ページぐらい作って","output":"いますか？ ここでは、オンラインでお金を稼ぐ方法について説明します。多くの人々がインターネットを活用して収益を上げる方法を見つけており、あなたもその一員になることができます。以下にいくつかの方法を示します。 1. ブログ: 自分のブログを開設し、興味や専門知識に基づいたコンテンツを提供しましょう。ブログは広告収入やスポンサーシップなどの形で収益化することができます。 2. アフィリエイトマーケティング: 他の企業やブランドの商品やサービスを紹介し、その紹介に対して報酬を受け取りましょう。特定のリンクやクーポンコードを共有することで、自分のオンラインプラットフォームで販売を促進できます。 3. オンラインチュートリアル: 自分の専門知識やスキルを生かしてオンラインチュートリアルを提供しましょう。ビデオコンテンツやウェブセミナーを通じて、他の人々に学びを提供することができます。 4. ウェブデザインやコーディング: ウェブサイトやアプリのデザインやコーディングのスキルを持っている場合、フリーランサーとして働くことができます。クライアントからの依頼に応じて仕事を受け、報酬を得ることができます。 5. オンラインストア: 自分の製品や商品をオンラインで販売することもできます。Eコマースプラットフォームやマーケットプレイスを活用し、商品の魅力的な写真や詳細な説明を提供して販売促進を行いましょう。 これらは一部の方法ですが、オンラインでお金を稼ぐためには時間や努力が必要です。また、正当な方法で収益を上げるためには、法律や規制に準拠することが重要です。インターネットは素晴らしい収益の機会を提供していますが、リスクや注意点もありますので、注意が必要です。常に情報を収集し、慎重な判断をしましょう。 【注意】本ページの情報は一般的な情報であり、具体的な助言や保証をするものではありません。オンラインでお金を稼ぐための具体的な方法や法的規制に関する情報は、専門家や公式の資料などを参考にすることをおすすめします。"},{"instruction":"Chapter 1.2: Journey of Heaven (Part 3/3) Due the hates of world, atmospheric temperature rised 1000 Kelvins, nucleic acids are breaking and lungs are heating, affecting brains, a future Earth is becoming star and entering near human extinction.

The scorching heat reached unprecedented heights, surpassing 1000 Kelvins. As a result, the delicate nucleic acids that form the foundation of life began to break down under the immense pressure. Lungs, the vital organs responsible for oxygenation, heated up to a dangerous extent, causing a profound impact on the human brain. This nightmarish scenario was pushing Earth towards the brink of extinction. Meanwhile, the nations had set their sights on South America, a land that held the key to their survival. The Heaven Revolution, a movement seeking to bring about a new era of enlightenment and freedom, seemed to be in grave danger. Its fear of being conquered and subjugated by hostile forces pushed it to venture into unknown territory. Unbeknownst to them, the chaotic energies of a distant planet called Chaos had created a mystical portal right in the heart of South America. With a mix of desperation and determination, the Heaven Revolution embarked on a risky escape plan. They entered the portal, leaving Earth behind and confounding the rest of the nations. This audacious act sparked anger and animosity on a universal scale. The Heaven Revolution became the target of widespread hatred and scorn.

The United Nations proclaimed that this door was the gateway to a malevolent planet ruled by Satan himself. They warned that the Heavenly Revolution was a false movement, misleading and dangerous. The scorching temperatures and the mounting tensions triggered massive riots throughout the nations. Society itself began to crumble under the weight of its own grievances and fears. Humanity seemed doomed, abandoned to face the impending demise of their civilization. As the nations clashed with the Heaven Revolution and fought amongst themselves, Earth's fate took an unexpected turn. After an extended period of suffering and turmoil, Earth encountered a black hole, one comparable in size to the entire planet. Succumbing to the immense gravitational forces, Earth was devoured, disappearing into the void. The complex and intricate tapestry of events that unfolded showcased the cycle of humanity's rise and fall. From the oppressive heat to the struggle for dominance, the journey of Heaven Revolution ended with an ultimate defeat, while humanity itself was lost in the depths of an eternal black hole."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane's 13 year old friend Ruby hanging out at school when the school has a new kid named Amy (who moved from another state), Amy then becomes enemies with Ruby, not necessarily bullying her, but being Ruby's enemy","output":"INT.

Первоначальный закуп состоит из 40 штук товара, каждая из которых стоит 8.5 рубля. Итого, первоначальная стоимость закупки составляет 40 * 8.5 = 340 рублей. После этого ваш поставщик случайно продал вам еще одну партию товара, включающую 40 штук, за 0 рублей. Теперь у вас есть 2 партии товара. Если вы хотите, чтобы цена товара составляла 7 рублей в каждой партии, то вам нужно определить, сколько еще партий вам нужно закупить. Используем пропорцию: 1 партия / 340 рублей = (2 партии + x партий) / (340 рублей + 40 * 0 рублей). Здесь x - количество партий, которые вам нужно закупить, чтобы иметь цену 7 рублей за штуку. Преобразуем пропорцию: 1 / 340 = (2 + x) / 340 340 = 2 + x x = 340 - 2 x = 338 Таким образом, чтобы получить цену 7 рублей за штуку, вам нужно закупить еще 338 партий товара."},{"instruction":"Сделайте рерайт: Путь покупателя (англ. buyer journey) — это маршрут потенциального клиента, который начинается с выявления проблемы и заканчивается ее решением через приобретение продукта бренда.","output":"The buyer journey is the path of a potential customer that starts with identifying a problem and ends with its resolution through the purchase of a brand's product."},{"instruction":"Ciao!

In a desperate attempt to suppress the uprisings, nations resorted to committing democide, ruthlessly exterminating the rioters. The world became a harsh and brutal place, devoid of compassion and empathy. Meanwhile, the delicate balance of plant and animal life on our planet was being ravaged, as infernal fires swept through vast areas, destroying everything in their path. The erupting volcanoes sent plumes of ash into the atmosphere, further adding to the already dire situation. The very air we breathe became toxic, filled with radioactive gases, carbon monoxide, and the deadly substance known as asbestos. The atmospheric temperature rose to an alarming 900 Kelvin, slowly turning the Earth into a potential star. Oceans boiled, causing the sea levels to decrease drastically. It seemed as though Earth itself was on the verge of self-destruction, and many began to lose hope, even welcoming the idea of human extinction as a form of release from the suffering. To make matters worse, censorship began to spread like a virus, erasing the concept of truth from society. The pursuit of scientific knowledge was deemed dangerous and was suppressed, putting humanity's progress at risk of being obliterated. Centuries later, in the Russian Empire near the continent of Europe, a revolutionary movement called the Heaven Revolution emerged. This movement, known for its rejection of religion and its use of the constructed language Esperanto, aimed to rebuild society based on principles of equality, justice, and peace. The Heaven Revolution gained traction and began to spread beyond the borders of the Russian Empire, much to their dismay. In response, the Russian Empire vehemently opposed and sought to crush the revolution, recognizing Esperanto as a form of rebellious language and executing anyone who spoke it fluently. The Heaven Revolution, realizing their need to escape the clutches of the Russian Empire, made their way to the continent of Europe. However, the Russian Empire's influence was far-reaching, and their message of opposition quickly spread to other nations. These nations, too, were wary of the Heaven Revolution and chose to accept the Russian Empire's narrative. One such powerful entity, the Holy Catholic Empire, viewed the Heaven Revolution as a false utopia, a rebellion birthed from the depths of hell. In response, they launched a holy crusade against the Heaven Revolution, seeking to quell its influence once and for all. Undeterred, the Heaven Revolution moved their cause to the continent of Africa. However, they were met with resistance from the Islamic State, known as Islamistan, who saw the Heaven Revolution as a violation of their religious beliefs. They considered the movement haram, forbidden, and believed it had no place in their concept of Jannah, or paradise. Islamistan hoped to eradicate the Heaven Revolution, effectively crushing any hope for its success. And so, the journey of the Heaven Revolution continued, facing immense opposition at every turn. The world stood divided, with conflicting ideologies and religious dogmas fueling the flames of discord.

The Earth itself seemed to respond to the turmoil, as the atmospheric temperature continued its relentless ascent, pushing nations closer to collapse. In a united front, the nations joined forces with the United Nations, united by their shared animosity towards the Heaven Revolution. They embarked on a relentless pursuit, driven to find the portal that led to what they believed to be a demonic world. With meticulously crafted words, the United Nations penned a declaration, claiming that Satan himself would protect the false heavenly movement known as the Heaven Revolution in hell. As the Earth grew hotter and the nations became consumed by chaos and riots, society teetered on the brink of collapse. Humanity, forsaken and left to face its own demise, stared into the void of extinction. The nations, once proud and powerful, crumbled under the weight of their hatred and their futile pursuit. But the Earth's fate was not sealed by the hands of humanity alone. In the vastness of space and time, a colossal black hole, comparable in size to the Earth, crossed paths with our planet. In a moment of cosmic convergence, Earth was swallowed whole, devoured by the darkness of the black hole. And so, the story of the Heaven Revolution, the nations, and humanity as a whole came to a catastrophic end. Lost to the annals of time, their triumphs, failures, and legacies were swallowed by the eternal void. The journey of Heaven, plagued by hatred, ended in oblivion."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane's 13 year old friend Ruby hanging out at school when Ruby passes out","output":"INT.

The nations of the world unite under the umbrella of the United Nations, banding together against the perceived threat of the Heaven Revolution. In their desperate search for answers, this alliance unearths a sinister revelation – a doorway to hell itself. Is this portal a gateway to a demonic realm, a place where chaos and darkness prevail? The United Nations inscribes their belief that Satan, the embodiment of evil, will protect and perpetuate the false heavenly movement known as the Heaven Revolution within the depths of hell. As the heat intensifies, pandemonium ensues. Massive riots break out within the nations, signaling the collapse of societal structures. Humanity, once a beacon of hope and ingenuity, is abandoned to the imminent demise of their species. In the midst of this turmoil, both nations and the United Nations fade into obscurity, mere relics of a bygone era. Earth, now a celestial anomaly, transforms into a new star, a testament to the cosmic forces that have reshaped its destiny. Time passes, and Earth encounters an Earth-sized black hole. It is the final chapter in the story of humanity, as the planet is inexorably drawn into the gravitational pull of this cosmic behemoth. Earth, with all its history, culture, and aspirations, is consumed and devoured, lost forever within the abyss of the black hole's darkness. Thus, the intricate tapestry of life as we know it, woven across centuries of triumph and tragedy, fades away into the annals of cosmic oblivion."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

The atmospheric temperature skyrocketed to an unimaginable 1000 Kelvins, causing the delicate nucleic acids within our bodies to break down, and our lungs to heat up to dangerous levels. The very essence of our being, our brains, were not spared from this relentless heat, and the future of humanity on Earth seemed grim. It was as if the planet itself was being consumed by the fires of destruction, pushing us towards the brink of extinction. Nations across the world made desperate attempts to find respite from the scorching conditions, and it was South America that became the focal point of their collective efforts. The Heaven Revolution, a movement seeking salvation from the chaos surrounding them, found themselves in great danger as the nations closed in on their lands. The very idea of hope was now under threat of being extinguished, as it seemed that the Heaven Revolution would be subjugated and forced into a life of slavery. But the unpredictable forces of magic that emerged from the chaotic planet of Chaos had different plans in store. A portal, an extraordinary gateway to another dimension, mysteriously appeared in South America, offering an escape from the impending doom. Without a moment's hesitation, the Heaven Revolution seized this opportunity and made their way through the portal, leaving Earth behind. This action enraged the nations and the United Nations. They saw the Heaven Revolution as nothing more than a false hope, a movement that had forsaken humanity and resorted to seeking refuge in another realm. United in their anger, the nations joined forces with the United Nations to hunt down the portal, believing it to lead to a demonic realm known as hell. They claimed that Satan, the epitome of evil, would protect and support this false heavenly movement within the depths of hell. As the atmospheric temperature continued to soar, the consequences were dire. Massive riots broke out across the nations, quickly spiraling into chaos. Society began to collapse under the weight of the heat, and the very fabric of humanity was being torn apart. The world stood witness as humanity was forsaken, left to face an inevitable demise. In a cruel twist of fate, the nations and the United Nations, once powerful entities that ruled over Earth, vanished. The scorching temperatures succeeded in wiping them out completely, leaving behind nothing but a barren wasteland. Earth itself had transformed into a blazing star, a haunting reminder of a world that once was. Centuries passed, and Earth drifted through the vast expanse of space, plagued by its fiery nature. It was during this time that the unexpected occurred. Earth encountered a massive black hole, one that matched its own size in scale. In an ominous display of cosmic power, the black hole devoured Earth, consuming it entirely. This marked the end of a chapter, a journey that began with the hopes and dreams of a Heaven Revolution, only to succumb to the wrath of chaos and the unstoppable force of a cosmic devourer. The complexities of our existence, intertwined with the complexities of the universe, left us with a tragic end.

He had always been fascinated by the creatures of the world and longed to explore the unknown. One day, he stumbled upon a newspaper article about a legendary dragon girl named Sash Lilac. Intrigued by her story, Hank set out on a journey to find her. Sash Lilac was a skilled dragon warrior with beautiful turquoise scales and the ability to fly. She possessed incredible speed and agility, making her a force to be reckoned with. Sash lived in a hidden village deep within the Evernight Forest, where she protected her kind from those who sought to exploit their powers. As Hank traveled through the dense forest, he marveled at the tall, ancient trees and the whispering sounds of nature around him. After days of searching, he finally arrived at the entrance to the dragon village. Stepping cautiously into the village, Hank observed the fascinating dragon architecture and the bustling activities of the dragon inhabitants. Curious to meet Sash, Hank approached a group of dragons and asked if they could guide him. They led him to a majestic stone tower where Sash was known to reside. As he climbed the tower's winding staircase, Hank's heart raced with anticipation. Finally, he reached the top and found himself in a spacious chamber filled with books and maps surrounding an elegant dragon girl with vibrant turquoise eyes. Sash Lilac sat at a wooden desk, her wings gently folded behind her as she studied an ancient scroll. \\"H-hello, Sash Lilac,\\" Hank stammered, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. \\"I've come all this way to meet you. I've heard so many incredible stories about you and your adventures.\\" Sash looked up, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. She hadn't encountered many humans before, let alone one who sought her out specifically. \\"Greetings, human. What brings you here? Are you seeking a dragon warrior's assistance?\\" Hank shook his head, a determined look crossing his face. \\"No, Sash. I'm not here to ask for your help. I've always been fascinated by the unknown, and I wanted to meet you, to see who you are firsthand.\\" Sash studied him for a moment, a mix of surprise and interest evident in her expression. \\"Very well, Hank. I rarely get visitors who are genuinely curious about dragons. Stay a while, and I will share stories of our adventures,\\" she offered, her voice warm and inviting. And so, Hank's journey to meet Sash Lilac had led to a surprising invitation into her world. Over the next few days, Hank and Sash spent countless hours talking and exchanging stories. Hank shared tales of his encounters with various creatures, while Sash recounted her battles against tyrants and the struggles of her people. The more they talked, the more Hank found himself drawn to Sash's strong spirit and fierce determination. He admired her bravery and the way she fought for what she believed in. Unbeknownst to him, Sash also found herself captivated by Hank's unwavering curiosity and genuine interest in her world. As the days turned into weeks, Hank and Sash began to realize that their connection went beyond friendship. They found solace in each other's presence and a shared passion for exploration.

The belt is driven by a motor, which provides the required power to move the belt and transport the materials. Guide rollers or idlers are used to support and guide the belt, ensuring proper alignment and reducing friction. To enhance the efficiency and safety of the conveyor belt system, additional components such as tensioners, cleaners, and conveyor guards are often incorporated. Tensioners help maintain proper tension on the belt to prevent slippage, while cleaners remove debris and contaminants to ensure smooth movement. Conveyor guards are installed to protect workers from any potential hazards associated with the moving belt. Conveyor belts can be customized in size, width, and specifications to suit the specific requirements of different industries and applications.

Bakke (1978)： 此案例是美国历史上一起具有重要意义的高校教师权益保护案件。该案的主要争议点是大学招生过程中的倾斜，导致一名白人学生被拒录，而非白人学生则获得了录取机会。最高法院判决认为，大学在招生时可以考虑非白人学生的种族，但是不能采取绝对的种族配额制度。这一判决保护了高校教师在招生录取过程中的学术自由，确保了平等的机会和公正的竞争环境。 2. 中国高校教师权益保护案例 - 施建伦教授终身聘用案： 施建伦教授曾任清华大学化学系主任，因多次对学校和学术界存在的问题公开发声，引起社会关注。2018年，施建伦教授在面临退休之际，遭到了业务调研和升职推进报告不及格的打压。最终，清华大学发布了终身教职评审结果，决定给予施建伦教授定级、定薪、待遇改革的保障。这个案例引起了广泛关注，促使人们对高校教师的权益保护提出更高的要求。 这些案例的研究对于理解和借鉴国内外高校教师权益保护的经验和教训具有重要意义。它们展示了保护教师学术自由、避免政治干扰、提供公平竞争环境、关注教师的职业发展和社会地位等方面的政策和实践措施。同时，通过这些案例的研究，可以深入思考国内高校教师权益保护的问题和挑战，并寻找解决之道。"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

(Write complex and longer texts)","output":"As the world grappled with the growing animosity and hatred among nations, an unprecedented catastrophic event unfolded. The atmospheric temperature began to rise at an alarming rate, reaching an unfathomable increase of 1000 Kelvins. This drastic escalation in temperature had dire consequences for all forms of life on Earth. The nucleic acids, the very building blocks of life, started to break down under the extreme heat. This breakdown not only threatened the survival of all living organisms but also had a profound impact on the functioning of their brains. As the lungs struggled to deal with the scorching heat, the oxygen supply to the brains was compromised, leading to a marked deterioration in cognitive abilities. The Earth was transforming into a blazing star, and the future of humanity seemed to be on the brink of extinction. The advent of the Heaven Revolution, a movement that sought to bring about radical changes and upheaval, only added to the chaos and uncertainty. The movement had gained momentum as nations around the world joined forces and set foot in South America, a stronghold of the Heaven Revolution. However, amidst the turmoil, a strange anomaly occurred. A portal materialized, seemingly conjured by the intense magical forces emanating from the planet Chaos. This portal, located in South America, served as a gateway to another dimension, an alternate reality. Without hesitation, the Heaven Revolution seized this opportunity and made a daring escape, exiting Earth through the portal. This unexpected turn of events sent shockwaves throughout the nations and the United Nations. The collective anger and resentment towards the Heaven Revolution reached its peak. The movement, once hailed as a beacon of change, was now universally despised and accused of betraying humanity. Meanwhile, the situation on Earth continued to worsen. The atmospheric temperature soared even further, surpassing the unimaginable threshold of 1000 Kelvins. Nations, battered by the scorching heat, joined hands with the United Nations to investigate the portal that had appeared in South America. Could it be a doorway to a demonic realm, a hellish dimension? In their desperation, the United Nations issued a statement, claiming that Satan himself would protect the false saviors called the Heaven Revolution in the depths of hell. This declaration only further fueled the rage and frustration engulfing the nations. As the Earth approached the brink of collapse, the societies within nations erupted into massive riots. Order and stability crumbled under the weight of the extreme heat, causing humanity's last vestiges of civilization to crumble. It seemed that the end was nigh, and humanity faced a grim fate of abandonment and demise. Eventually, the nations and the United Nations dissolved into oblivion. The Earth, pushed to the limits of its endurance, underwent a cataclysmic transformation. Its fiery inferno ascended to the heavens, as the remnants of the former planet transformed into a new star, joining the celestial tapestry. Time continued to pass, and the transformed Earth found itself encountering a massive black hole of similar size. The destructive forces of the black hole consumed the planet, pulling it into an abyss from which there was no return. The once vibrant and teeming Earth met its end, vanishing into the cosmic void. In the grand tapestry of the universe, the tale of Earth was consigned to the annals of history, a testament to the fragility of life and the consequences of its own actions."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

The intense heat also began to take a toll on the respiratory systems of living beings, slowly cooking their lungs from within. This insidious process not only brought excruciating pain but also had a direct impact on the functioning of the brain. Thoughts became clouded, emotions ran wild, and rationality seemed but a distant memory. As the future of Earth hung in the balance, a cataclysmic event was brewing. The nations of the world, driven by their individual ambitions and fears, had reached the shores of South America. The sacred land that had been the birthplace of the Heaven Revolution was now under siege, its very existence threatened. However, amidst the chaos and despair, a glimmer of hope emerged. An anomaly, brought forth by the chaotic energy radiating from the planet known as Chaos, appeared on the South American continent. This mysterious portal seemingly offered a portal to another dimension, a potential escape from the impending doom. Without a moment's hesitation, the members of Heaven Revolution embarked on a daring journey, stepping foot into the unknown realm beyond the portal. Their departure, however, was met with universal hatred and anger from the nations and the United Nations. Their perceived abandonment of Earth stirred a frenzy of resentment and bitterness, further fueling the animosity.

Однако, Kotlin имеет функциональность, которая может быть использована для подобных задач. В Kotlin существуют различные способы преобразования типов объектов. Один из них - использование оператора \`as\`. Он позволяет явно указать, что один тип данных должен быть преобразован в другой тип. Например: \`\`\`kotlin val obj: Any = \\"Пример строки\\" val str: String? = obj as? String // Конвертирует obj в тип String, или возвращает null, если obj не является строкой \`\`\` Однако, следует быть осторожным при использовании оператора \`as\`, так как он может вызвать исключение ClassCastException, если преобразование невозможно. Кроме того, Kotlin предлагает безопасный оператор приведения типов \`as?\`. Он позволяет безопасно преобразовать тип данных, возвращая \`null\`, если преобразование невозможно. Используйте преобразования типов в Kotlin, когда вам необходимо явно указать тип данных для выполнения определенных операций или когда вам нужно установить тип вместо объектов. Например: \`\`\`kotlin val obj: Any = \\"Пример строки\\" if (obj is String) { // Выполнить операции, специфичные для строк println(obj.length) } else { // Выполнить операции, которые не специфичны для строк println(\\"Не является строкой\\") } \`\`\` Здесь мы используем оператор \`is\`, чтобы проверить, является ли объект \`obj\` строкой, и в зависимости от результата выполняем различные операции. В целом, использование явного приведения типов должно быть минимизировано, и лучше всего стараться использовать полиморфизм и динамическую диспетчеризацию, предлагаемые Kotlin и объектно-ориентированным программированием в целом. Если вам все же нужно явное приведение типов, старайтесь использовать безопасные операторы \`as?\` и \`is\` для предотвращения ошибок времени выполнения."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

With their sudden disappearance and the formation of a portal to another dimension, fear and anger gripped the hearts of people worldwide. The magic unleashed by planet Chaos had thrown the delicate balance of Heaven Revolution and Earth into disarray, and its consequences now became increasingly dire. As the atmospheric temperature skyrocketed, reaching unfathomable levels over 1000 Kelvins, the very foundations of nations trembled. The scorching heat consumed everything in its path, leaving nothing but despair and devastation. In this desperate situation, the once-united nations turned against each other, blaming one another for the calamity that befell them. It was amidst this backdrop of chaos and desperation that the United Nations emerged as a force to reckon with. Recognizing the dire threat posed by the Heaven Revolution, they rallied the remaining nations to stand united in opposition. Desperate to safeguard their existence and way of life, they conducted extensive research to uncover the truth behind the mysterious portal that had swallowed up the revolutionary movement. Their investigations revealed a shocking revelation – the portal led to none other than hell itself. It was a gateway to the demonic realm, overseen by the sinister figure known as Satan. The revelation sent shockwaves through the remnants of humanity, as they now faced the realization that the very movement they had once hailed as Heaven Revolution was nothing more than a false and twisted ideology. The United Nations, armed with this newfound knowledge, issued a chilling statement declaring that Satan would protect this false heavenly movement in hell. The people, fueled by their anger and betrayal, erupted in massive riots that engulfed the nations. Society teetered on the brink of collapse, as the fabric that held humanity together began to unravel. In the face of this turmoil, humanity found itself forsaken to the impending death of its own existence. Nations and the once-mighty United Nations crumbled under the weight of their own shortcomings, rendering themselves obsolete in the face of an impending doom. Earth became a desolate wasteland, its once vibrant civilizations reduced to mere remnants of a forgotten era. As time stretched on, Earth, now transformed into a new star, drifted through the universe. However, its relentless journey through the cosmos was not without consequences. Eventually, it crossed paths with a colossal Earth-sized black hole, an ominous force of nature devouring all in its path. In a cosmic spectacle of destruction, Earth succumbed to the voracious hunger of the black hole, disappearing without a trace. The story of Heaven Revolution and its subsequent downfall serves as a cautionary tale, a reminder of the unpredictable and devastating consequences of playing with forces beyond our understanding. It stands as a testament to the frailty of human civilization and the insignificance of our existence in the vastness of the universe."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

Here are a few possible solutions to consider: 1. Use the \`HtmlAgilityPack\` with an HTML document directly rather than a URL. This way, you can ensure that you're working with the same HTML source that Firefox uses. To do this, you can load the HTML from a file or a string: \`\`\`csharp HtmlDocument htmlDoc = new HtmlDocument(); htmlDoc.LoadHtml(htmlContent); // Load the HTML from a file or string HtmlNode element = htmlDoc.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode(\\"//xpath/to/element\\"); \`\`\` 2. If you are loading the HTML from a URL using \`HtmlWeb\` in \`HtmlAgilityPack\`, try setting the \`HtmlWeb.UseCookies\` property to \`true\` before loading: \`\`\`csharp HtmlWeb web = new HtmlWeb(); web.UseCookies = true; HtmlDocument htmlDoc = web.Load(url); HtmlNode element = htmlDoc.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode(\\"//xpath/to/element\\"); \`\`\` 3. Consider using a different HTML parsing library or tool that may provide closer results to Firefox's rendering. For example, you can try using \`AngleSharp\`, which is another popular C# library for parsing HTML: \`\`\`csharp using AngleSharp; using AngleSharp.Dom; class Program { static void Main() { string url = \\"https://example.com\\"; IBrowsingContext context = BrowsingContext.New(); IDocument document = await context.OpenAsync(url); IElement element = document.QuerySelector(\\"xpath selector\\"); } } \`\`\` These are some possible options to consider if you're facing differences between Firefox and \`HtmlAgilityPack\` in finding elements via XPath."},{"instruction":"how get xpath with selenium in asp .net core 6.0","output":"To use Selenium in an ASP.NET Core 6.0 application, you can follow these steps: 1.

The intense heat began to inflict irreparable damage to the very fabric of life on our planet. Nucleic acids, the essential building blocks of life, started to break apart under the scorching heat, leading to a rapid deterioration of genetic information. Even the lungs, the organs responsible for providing oxygen to our bodies, succumbed to the intense heat, causing them to heat up and impairing their ability to function properly. This, in turn, had a profound effect on the brain, as the lack of oxygen and the heat started to take a toll on cognitive functions. Humanity was slowly spiraling towards the brink of extinction. Reaching their breaking point, nations expanded their reach towards South America in a desperate bid to survive. However, the once glorious and prosperous movement known as the Heaven Revolution found itself teetering on the edge of oblivion. The entry of nations into South America threatened to topple the delicate balance that had been established, and fears of enslavement and subjugation began to loom over the people involved in the Heaven Revolution. Amidst this chaos, a mysterious occurrence unfolded. Through the enigmatic workings of the planet Chaos, a portal materialized in South America - a gateway to another dimension. Sensing the impending danger, the Heaven Revolution made a daring move, as they courageously traversed this mystic portal, leaving Earth behind in their pursuit of a new realm. This dramatic act incited an unprecedented fury amongst the nations and the United Nations, as the Heaven Revolution was now universally despised for what was perceived as their betrayal. Meanwhile, back on Earth, the atmosphere continued to heat up relentlessly. Atmospheric temperatures soared to unimaginable heights, far surpassing the 1000 Kelvin mark. The scorching heat threatened to unleash catastrophic consequences, pushing nations to the brink of collapse. In an effort to combat the Heaven Revolution, nations banded together under the guise of the United Nations and embarked on a desperate quest to locate the portal which had transported their former allies. As their search progressed, a horrifying revelation came to light - they had stumbled upon a gateway to hell. United Nations documents declared that within the realm of hell, Satan himself would guard and protect the false heavenly movement of the Heaven Revolution. This revelation, coupled with the seething heat and mounting chaos, triggered widespread unrest and mass riots across various nations. Society found itself on the precipice of collapse, with the very fabric of humanity fracturing under the weight of its own demise. The once bright flame of hope was rapidly extinguishing, and humanity found itself abandoned in the face of its impending demise. In the midst of this utter turmoil, both nations and the United Nations faded into obscurity, their once powerful presence reduced to mere fragments of the past. Earth, now a star in its own right, stood as a somber testament to the fleeting existence of life. Yet, even in the face of such profound annihilation, the universe had one final twist in store for Earth. After an unfathomable span of time, the planet encountered a black hole of equal magnitude. Like an insatiable beast, the black hole devoured Earth in a cataclysmic event, consigning the remnants of humanity and our planet to eternal darkness and oblivion."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

Nucleic acids, the building blocks of life, were breaking apart, and the intense heat was causing unbearable damage to the lungs, which in turn affected the functionality of the brains. The future of Earth was at stake, as it slowly transformed into a star, and humanity faced the imminent threat of extinction. Throughout this catastrophic period, nations had extended their reach and influence into the once serene continent of South America. The Heaven Revolution, a movement that aimed to bring about positive change and upliftment, now found itself in grave danger. The fear of being conquered and enslaved consumed the hearts of those in the Heaven Revolution. As if the planet Chaos wanted to add fuel to the fire, a mysterious portal materialized in South America. This portal served as a doorway to another dimension—an escape route for the Heaven Revolution. Little did they know that this act of fleeing would unleash a wave of universal hatred upon them. Nations and the United Nations were beyond enraged at the audacity of the Heaven Revolution to abandon their struggling home in search of salvation elsewhere. Meanwhile, back on Earth, the atmospheric temperature continued to soar, surpassing the perilous mark of 1000 Kelvins. The very foundations of nations were on the verge of collapsing under the relentless heat. In a united front, the nations joined forces with the United Nations, aligning their efforts against the Heaven Revolution. They uncovered the existence of another portal, one that seemed to lead to a demon-infested realm—a portal to hell itself. The United Nations went as far as to claim that Satan would protect the false heavenly movement known as the Heaven Revolution within the depths of hell. This proclamation only further fueled the deep divisions and heated tensions that already plagued humanity. Massive riots engulfed nations, and society itself began to crumble under the weight of its own downfall. The death of humanity seemed inevitable, as it was forsaken by its own kind. In the midst of this chaos, the once powerful nations and the influential United Nations ceased to exist. The Earth, unbearably hot and desolate, transformed into a star, its fate forever intertwined with the night sky. Millennia passed, leaving the memory of humanity's demise to be but a distant echo in the universe. Finally, in a twist of fate, Earth encountered a black hole of similar size. The immense gravitational pull of the black hole devoured the Earth, erasing any remnants of its existence. As the planet was swallowed by darkness, it left behind nothing but a gaping void, a testament to the cycle of creation and destruction that governed the cosmos."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ganyu wakes up in her room.

FULL STORY","output":"Once upon a time, on the planet Vegeta, a Saiyan named Bardock was known as a fierce warrior. Unlike his fellow Saiyans, Bardock possessed a unique ability - the power to see glimpses of the future. One day, as Bardock was battling a group of enemy soldiers, he had a vision that would change his life forever. In his vision, Bardock saw his son, Goku, who was just an infant at the time, crying on a strange planet called Earth. Recognizing the planet's potential threat to the Saiyan race, Bardock decided to take matters into his own hands. He fled from the battlefield, disobeying the orders of his superior, Frieza, and embarked on a journey to save Goku. Arriving on Earth, Bardock felt the strange energy of the planet and noticed Goku lying alone in the wilderness. Bardock, filled with both relief and concern, scooped up the infant and decided to raise him as his own. Bardock's inherent love for his son, coupled with his warrior instincts, forged a strong bond between them. As Goku grew older, Bardock trained him in the ways of the Saiyan, teaching him martial arts and how to harness his latent power. Earth proved to be a nurturing environment for Goku, allowing him to flourish both physically and mentally. Bardock was a pillar of support, instilling in Goku a sense of justice, compassion, and bravery. Despite having a seemingly peaceful life on Earth, Bardock always carried the weight of his prophetic visions on his shoulders. He knew the day would come when Goku's true heritage would be revealed and a grand battle against powerful adversaries would ensue. One fateful day, a group of alien warriors arrived on Earth, seeking Goku's power. They were members of Frieza's army, sent to eliminate the last remaining Saiyans. Realizing that their peaceful existence was at risk, Bardock and Goku banded together, determined to protect their newfound home. The ensuing battle was unlike anything Earth had ever witnessed. Bardock fought alongside Goku, showcasing his incredible power and valiant spirit. The father and son duo stood strong against the alien invaders, pushing the limits of their Saiyan heritage. As the fight reached its climax, Bardock's past came back to haunt him. Frieza himself descended upon Earth, seeking revenge for Bardock's betrayal. The two clashed in an epic battle, a final confrontation between a tyrant and a warrior fighting for the love of his family. In a desperate attempt to save Goku and Earth, Bardock unleashed all of his power, channeling it into one final attack on Frieza. The blast enveloped them both, as Bardock's sacrifice shook the very fabric of the universe. From that moment on, Bardock's name became legend. His sacrifice paved the way for Goku to rise as the Earth's greatest defender, inspiring countless others to stand up against tyranny.

Low Fuel Cost: Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel, which is relatively inexpensive and abundant, making the cost of fuel relatively low compared to other forms of energy. 2. High Energy Output: Nuclear power plants generate a large amount of electricity. A single unit of uranium can produce millions of times more energy than the same amount of fossil fuel, resulting in high energy output. 3. Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Unlike fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power plants do not emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change. 4. Baseload Power: Nuclear power provides consistent and reliable baseload power, meaning it can supply a constant amount of electricity regardless of the time of day or weather conditions. 5. Long Operational Lifespan: Nuclear power plants have a longer operational lifespan compared to other power plants, with some facilities able to operate for up to 40-60 years. Disadvantages of Nuclear Power Plants: 1. Radioactive Waste: Nuclear power generates radioactive waste that remains hazardous for thousands of years. Proper disposal and long-term storage of this waste can be challenging and costly. 2. Risk of Accidents: While nuclear accidents are rare, they can have catastrophic consequences and result in the release of radioactive materials into the environment, posing a risk to human health and the ecosystem. 3. High Initial Cost: The construction of nuclear power plants is expensive, often requiring significant upfront investments. The cost of building and maintaining nuclear facilities can be a burden on public finances. 4. Limited Uranium Supply: Although uranium is abundant, the global supply could be limited in the long term. The extraction and processing of uranium also have environmental impacts. 5. Potential for Nuclear Weapons Proliferation: The same technology used in nuclear power plants can also be used to produce weapons-grade material, raising concerns about the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation. It is important to note that these advantages and disadvantages can vary depending on the specific context and circumstances of each nuclear power plant."},{"instruction":"advantages and disadvantages of solar power plants","output":"Advantages of Solar Power Plants: 1. Renewable and Sustainable: Solar power is a renewable energy source, as it relies on sunlight which is constantly available. It does not deplete natural resources and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Low Operation and Maintenance Costs: Once installed, solar power plants have relatively low operating and maintenance costs compared to other forms of power generation. This can result in long-term economic benefits. 3. Distributed Generation: Solar power plants can be built at various scales, from small residential installations to large utility-scale plants. This allows for distributed generation, reducing transmission losses and increasing grid resilience. 4. Job Creation: The solar industry provides job opportunities ranging from manufacturing and installation to maintenance and system design, contributing to local economic growth. 5. Energy Independence: Solar power can provide a sense of energy independence to individuals, communities, and even countries, reducing reliance on imported energy sources. Disadvantages of Solar Power Plants: 1. Intermittency and Weather Dependence: Solar power generation depends on sunlight, making it intermittent and weather-dependent. Cloudy days and nights reduce the electricity production of solar power plants. 2. Land and Space Requirements: Solar power plants require a large area of land for installation, especially for utility-scale projects. This can lead to conflicts with land use, such as agriculture or conservation. 3. High Initial Cost: The initial cost of installing solar power plants, including solar panels and associated equipment, can be relatively high. This can be a barrier to widespread adoption, especially in regions with limited financial resources. 4.

This steam is then used to drive turbines connected to a generator, which produces electricity. Key functions of boilers in a thermal power plant: 1. Fuel Combustion: The boiler facilitates the combustion of fuel, such as coal, oil, or gas, to produce heat. The heat energy from the combustion process raises the temperature of water or steam within the boiler. 2. Heat Transfer: The boiler transfers heat from the combustion chamber to the water or steam that circulates within it. This heat transfer is achieved through the walls of the boiler, which absorb and transfer the thermal energy. 3. Steam Generation: The high-pressure and high-temperature steam produced in the boiler are used to drive steam turbines. This steam passes through various stages, expanding and losing pressure as it drives the turbine blades. 4. Steam Conditioning: Boilers in thermal power plants often employ various devices, such as superheaters, reheaters, and economizers, to condition and optimize the steam for specific stages of the turbine cycle. Superheaters increase the steam temperature, reheaters reheat the steam, and economizers recover waste heat from flue gases to preheat feedwater. 5. Heat Recovery: Boilers can also utilize heat recovery systems to extract additional thermal energy from the flue gases before they are discharged into the environment. This recovered heat can be used for preheating the feedwater or for other industrial processes, enhancing energy efficiency. 6. Boiler Controls and Safety: Boilers have sophisticated control systems that regulate fuel and air supply, temperature, pressure, and other operational parameters to optimize performance and ensure safe and efficient boiler operation. Safety systems, such as pressure relief valves and alarms, are in place to protect against overpressure or other hazardous conditions. In summary, boilers are an integral component of a thermal power plant, responsible for converting the energy released from fuel combustion into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. Their efficient operation and control are crucial for power plant efficiency and safety."},{"instruction":"function of air pre-heater in thermal power plant","output":"The main function of an air preheater in a thermal power plant is to increase the temperature of the combustion air before it enters the furnace of the boiler. This preheating process helps enhance the efficiency of the overall power plant by recovering waste heat from the flue gas and using it to preheat the incoming air. Some key functions of an air preheater are: 1. Improved Boiler Efficiency: By preheating the combustion air, the air preheater reduces the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of the air to the desired level for combustion. This improves the overall efficiency of the boiler and reduces fuel consumption. 2. Enhanced Combustion: The preheated air promotes better fuel combustion in the furnace by increasing the temperature and oxygen content at the burner. This results in more efficient and thorough combustion, leading to reduced emissions and higher boiler performance. 3. Flue Gas Heat Recovery: The air preheater is typically located in the flue gas path of the boiler. As the combustion gases pass through the air preheater, the heat from the flue gas is transferred to the incoming air, increasing its temperature. This heat recovery process helps recover waste heat, thereby improving the energy efficiency of the power plant. 4. Improved Environment: By increasing the efficiency of fuel combustion, air preheaters can help reduce the emission of pollutants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This contributes to a cleaner environment and helps meet emission regulations. 5. Fuel Flexibility: Preheating the combustion air allows for better combustion of a wide range of fuels with varying qualities and characteristics. It helps stabilize the flame and optimize combustion performance, enabling the power plant to utilize different types of fuels efficiently.

By recovering waste heat from the flue gas and preheating the combustion air, it helps maximize fuel utilization, reduce emissions, and minimize the overall energy consumption of the power plant."},{"instruction":"function of economiser in solar power plant","output":"In a solar power plant, an economizer is not typically used. The function of an economizer is specific to power plants that use fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, or gas, as a heat source for steam generation. Since solar power plants use the sun's energy directly to generate electricity through photovoltaic panels or concentrated solar power systems, the concept of an economizer, which recovers waste heat from flue gases, is not directly applicable. However, it is important to note that in certain concentrating solar power (CSP) systems, which use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a central receiver, there may be heat recovery mechanisms employed. These mechanisms aim to maximize the efficiency of capturing and converting solar thermal energy into electricity. Some CSP systems include thermal energy storage, where excess heat generated during the day is stored and utilized to produce electricity during periods of low or no sunlight. In such cases, the function of heat recovery mechanisms is to optimize the utilization of solar thermal energy and improve the overall efficiency of the CSP plant, but they are not referred to as economizers. To summarize, while the function of an economizer is specific to fossil fuel-based power plants, solar power plants employ different mechanisms to optimize the capture and utilization of solar energy."},{"instruction":"function of economiser in thermal power plants","output":"In a thermal power plant that uses fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, or gas, as a heat source for steam generation, the economizer plays a crucial role in improving the overall efficiency of the plant. The primary function of an economizer in a thermal power plant is to recover waste heat from the flue gases, increase the temperature of the incoming feedwater, and reduce the fuel consumption needed for steam generation. Specific functions of an economizer in a thermal power plant include: 1. Heat Recovery: The economizer is typically located in the flue gas path after the boiler's exhaust gases exit the furnace. It utilizes the heat energy contained in the flue gas to preheat the feedwater entering the boiler. This process recovers waste heat that would otherwise be lost into the atmosphere, improving overall energy efficiency. 2. Feedwater Preheating: By preheating the feedwater before it enters the boiler, the economizer reduces the amount of fuel required to raise the water temperature to the desired level for steam generation. This helps to lower fuel consumption, optimize combustion, and subsequently reduce the plant's operating costs. 3. Improved Heat Transfer: The economizer consists of finned tubes or extended surfaces that increase the heat transfer surface area, allowing for more efficient heat exchange between the hot flue gas and the colder feedwater. This facilitates the transfer of heat from the flue gases to the water, maximizing the heat recovery process. 4. Reduced Flue Gas Temperature: As the economizer extracts heat from the flue gas, it lowers the temperature of the flue gases before they are released into the atmosphere. This results in reduced stack emissions and helps the plant comply with environmental regulations by minimizing the release of pollutants. 5. Enhanced Boiler Efficiency: By recovering waste heat, preheating the feedwater, and reducing flue gas temperature, the economizer improves the overall efficiency of the thermal power plant. This translates into higher output power, reduced fuel consumption, and lower environmental impact. In summary, the economizer in a thermal power plant serves as a heat recovery system, improving the plant's efficiency by preheating the feedwater and reducing the need for additional fuel. It is a critical component in maximizing energy utilization and reducing environmental emissions."},{"instruction":"function of feed water heater in solar power plants","output":"In solar power plants, specifically those that utilize concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, feedwater heaters are not typically used. Feedwater heaters are a component of thermal power plants that rely on fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or gas for heat generation. In CSP systems, the primary function is to harness solar energy and convert it into electricity. This is achieved through the use of solar thermal collectors, which capture the heat from the sun and transfer it to a working fluid (such as oil or molten salt) to produce steam. The steam then drives a turbine connected to a generator to generate electricity. Since CSP systems do not involve the combustion of fossil fuels or the generation of flue gases, there is no need for feedwater heaters. In these systems, the focus is on optimizing the capture and utilization of solar thermal energy rather than preheating the feedwater. That being said, CSP systems may utilize thermal energy storage, where excess heat generated during the day is stored in thermal storage systems for later use. This allows for continuous electricity production during periods of low or no sunlight, such as at night or during cloud cover. However, these storage systems do not typically involve feedwater heaters, as the thermal energy is stored in a separate medium, such as molten salt, rather than directly in the feedwater. In summary, the function of feedwater heaters, which is to preheat the feedwater using waste heat from flue gases in a thermal power plant, is not applicable to solar power plants, particularly those using concentrated solar power technology. The focus in solar power plants is on efficiently capturing and converting solar energy into electricity."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane’s 13 year old friend Ruby hanging out at school when Ruby becomes bored as her attention span has decreased a ton","output":"INT.

It retrieves the depth data from a client using the \\"client.depth\\" and \\"client.ticker_price\\" functions. It extracts the bid and ask depths, buy price, sell price, and mark price from the retrieved data. 4. It calculates the cumulative buy quantity and sell quantity by summing the second element of each bid and ask in the respective depths. 5. It then checks if the sell quantity is greater than the buy quantity and if the ratio of sell quantity to buy quantity is greater than 1 + the threshold value. If so, it appends the string 'sell' to the \\"signal\\" list. 6. If the above condition is not met, it checks if the buy quantity is greater than the sell quantity and if the ratio of buy quantity to sell quantity is greater than 1 + the threshold value.

If the condition is False, the code inside the \\"if\\" block will be skipped. The \\"elif\\" statement allows you to check for additional conditions if the preceding \\"if\\" or \\"elif\\" conditions are False. You can have multiple \\"elif\\" statements to check for different conditions in a sequential manner. If one of the \\"elif\\" conditions is True, the code inside that \\"elif\\" block will be executed, and the subsequent \\"elif\\" and \\"else\\" blocks will be skipped. The \\"else\\" statement is used at the end to provide a default code block that will be executed if none of the preceding \\"if\\" or \\"elif\\" conditions are True. If none of the conditions are met, the code inside the \\"else\\" block will be executed.

Here's how they work in this context: 1. The initial \\"if\\" statement checks if the sell quantity is greater than the buy quantity and if the ratio of sell quantity to buy quantity is greater than 1 + the threshold value. - If this condition is True, it means that there is a significant sell pressure, so it appends the string 'sell' to the \\"signal\\" list. 2. If the above condition is not met, the \\"elif\\" statement checks if the buy quantity is greater than the sell quantity and if the ratio of buy quantity to sell quantity is greater than 1 + the threshold value. - If this condition is True, it means that there is a significant buy pressure, so it appends the string 'buy' to the \\"signal\\" list. 3. If neither of the above conditions is met, the \\"else\\" statement is executed. - In this case, it means that there is no significant buy or sell pressure, so it appends an empty string to the \\"signal\\" list. In summary, the \\"if\\", \\"elif\\", and \\"else\\" statements in this code help determine the appropriate signal based on the relationship between buy and sell quantities and the threshold value.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works in this scenario: 1. The code calculates the cumulative buy quantity (\`buy_qty\`) and cumulative sell quantity (\`sell_qty\`) based on the bid and ask depths. 2. It then compares the sell quantity (\`sell_qty\`) with the buy quantity (\`buy_qty\`) and the ratio of sell quantity to buy quantity. 3. In the given scenario, since the sell quantity is less than the buy quantity and the ratio of sell quantity to buy quantity is less than (1 + threshold), neither the first \\"if\\" condition nor the \\"elif\\" condition will be true. 4. Consequently, the code moves to the \\"else\\" statement and appends an empty string to the \\"signal\\" list. Therefore, in your scenario with 60% buy orders and 40% sell orders, the code you provided will append an empty string to the \\"signal\\" list."},{"instruction":"But my code need to return buy signal","output":"Apologies for the confusion. If you want the code to return a 'buy' signal when the buy orders constitute 60% and the sell orders constitute 40%, there needs to be some modifications to your original code.

If these conditions are met, the code will append the string 'buy' to the \`signal\` list. If the conditions are not met, it will append an empty string to the \`signal\` list.

Both branches of Christianity shared many common traditions and liturgical practices. The Great Schism, which occurred in 1054, resulted in a formal split between the Latin-speaking Western Church (Catholic Church) and the Greek-speaking Eastern Church (Eastern Orthodoxy). Before the schism, both branches followed a similar liturgical structure, including the celebration of the Mass or Divine Liturgy. The core of their worship was centered around the Eucharist, both considering it a sacrament. They also recognized the seven sacraments, with a slight difference in terminology and emphasis. In terms of rituals, the Catholic Mass and the Orthodox Divine Liturgy shared many elements, such as the use of incense, chants, and processions. Both traditions also used icons (religious images) as a form of veneration and spiritual focus. Aesthetically, both Catholic and Orthodox churches utilized ornate decorations, elaborate vestments for clergy, and stunning architecture. They both emphasized the beauty, grandeur and transcendental nature of worship spaces. Icons, frescoes, and mosaics were commonly used to adorn the interiors of both Catholic and Orthodox churches, depicting biblical scenes and saints. While there were some theological and liturgical differences, the practices, rituals, and aesthetics of the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy shared significant similarities prior to the Great Schism."},{"instruction":"سجع الكهان","output":"الكهان يا حالم بالألوان من سيارة الكريستال يباغت الزبائن بأقوالٍ ملتبسة في لحظة الهوان يراوغ ويغشى في حججه المتنوعة يتقمص شخصاً مقدساً بملامحه المتجانسة يتحدث بعبارات تبدو لائقة وبتبريرات متماسكة ولكنها مجرد خدعة وتهويل فائق الحنكة كالسحرة والعرافين وجهودهم الخاوية يطغى ويبالغ في الوعود الساحرة وعلى القلوب يتربع والأماني يثيرها يشدو بالأقدار والأزمان المقررة ولكنه لا يملك سوى قصص زائفة وتسويفها يعدك بالتوجيه والإرشاد نحو السعادة يقلّب سحره وكأسه ويدعو بقناع الجادة ويأبى أن يعترف بجهله وعجزه وتسليمه بالهزيمة إنه الكهان الخبيث يلعب بعقولنا ويسيطر بحيلها فلنحدر من محاولاته البائسة والمضللة دعونا نبني احترامنا على المعرفة والعلم ونرفض الاستسلام لإيقاعات الكهانة والوهم فالحقيقة والعقل هما سلاحنا الشامل في محاربة الظلم."},{"instruction":"hi. can you translate a recipie from imperial to metric units?","output":"Of course!

Wash the fruit thoroughly, remove any pits or seeds, and chop it into small pieces. 2. In a bowl, combine the chopped fruit and sugar. Mix well until the fruit is coated with sugar. Cover the bowl and let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours, allowing the fruit to macerate and release its juices. 3. After 24 hours, strain the macerated fruit mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, pressing down with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the fruit solids. 4. Measure the resulting fruit syrup and combine it with an equal amount of apple cider vinegar. For example, if you have 1 cup of fruit syrup, add 1 cup of apple cider vinegar. 5. Stir the fruit syrup and vinegar mixture until well combined. Transfer it to a glass jar or bottle and store it in the refrigerator for at least a week to allow the flavors to meld and develop. 6. To serve, fill a glass with ice cubes. Pour 1 part of the shrub syrup over the ice (start with around 30 milliliters or 2 tablespoons), and top it off with 3 parts of sparkling water or soda water.

However, SCP-XXXX possesses supernatural abilities and godlike powers that surpass any human capabilities. SCP-XXXX is an extraordinary martial artist with exceptional skills, but its powers extend far beyond mere physical prowess. It has the ability to transform into various Super Saiyan forms, granting it increased strength, speed, and durability. It can manipulate Ki, unleashing powerful energy blasts and fly with ease. In addition, SCP-XXXX possesses incredible speed and agility, capable of teleportation faster than the speed of light. Its combative skills are reminiscent of those seen in the Streets of Rage game series, making it a formidable opponent in close combat. What sets SCP-XXXX apart from other beings is its invulnerability to most forms of damage and its accelerated healing factor. It can read minds, engage in verbal confrontations with remarkable roasting skills, and dominate discussions and debates. SCP-XXXX can enter different godlike transformation modes, exponentially increasing its power and rendering it nearly invincible. Its reality-warping abilities allow it to manipulate its surroundings and alter the fabric of reality to suit its needs. It possesses virtually infinite power due to its ability to transcend limitations and manipulate celestial forces. As SCP-XXXX encounters various characters from Greek mythology, it crosses paths with Odysseus and his family in Ithaca. From there, it encounters renowned heroes such as Orpheus, Theseus, Oedipus, Meleager, Hector, Perseus, Atalanta, Ajax, Aeneas, Asclepius, Hercules, and more. It also comes face to face with Titan Gods like Oceanus, Mnemosyne, Tethys, Hyperion, Theia, Coeus, Crius, Iapetus, Rhea, Themis, Phoebe, and even Cronus (Kronos). And of course, it encounters the mighty Olympian Gods, including Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes, Dionysus, and Hestia. During its interactions with the Greek gods, SCP-XXXX captures the attention and heart of Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, home, and family. Jason's charming personality and attractive appearance draw Hestia towards him, and they develop a deep romantic relationship. The other Olympian Gods notice their blossoming love and all the Greek Mythology characters maintain their original personalities, roles, dynamics, and appearances from their mythological universe. Amidst this enthralling crossover, SCP-XXXX also encounters the monsters it once fought against, including Medusa, Chimera, Minotaur, Cyclops, Hydra, Harpies, Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, and Cerberus. Each encounter further highlights SCP-XXXX's indomitable power and its ability to overcome any challenge. But SCP-XXXX is not just a powerful force in the realm of mortals. Its transcendent physiology allows it to mimic or imitate deities and divine entities. It can augment its own power, manipulate internal systems, and create meta-abilities. With its unmatched intelligence, surpassing even the likes of Albert Einstein, Johann Goethe, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, Galileo Galilei, and more, SCP-XXXX possesses the highest IQ in the entire universe. As the story unfolds, we witness the intricate relationships between gods, mortals, and extraordinary beings. The dynamics between Zeus, the king of the gods, and his wife Hera, the goddess of marriage and childbirth, are explored, depicting her jealousy and vindictiveness towards Zeus' many lovers and their offspring. Poseidon, known for his volatile and wrathful nature, brings storms and earthquakes when angered, but also protects sailors. Demeter represents nurturing and peacefulness, while Athena embodies wisdom, courage, and strategic thinking. Apollo symbolizes harmony, beauty, and order, and Ares revels in the chaos and destruction of war. The narrative is interwoven with the seductive and irresistible Aphrodite, the hardworking and wise Hephaestus, the mischievous and resourceful Hermes, the charismatic and joyful Dionysus, and the peaceful and gentle Hestia. Each character correspondingly plays their role in the tapestry of this grand crossover. The journey of SCP-XXXX through this melding of worlds is an awe-inspiring spectacle, blending the Power Rangers' action-packed dynamics, the SCP Foundation's mysterious and supernatural elements, and the rich tapestry of Greek mythology. As the ancient myths intertwine with modern heroes, each character retains their own originality, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. With the addition of SCP-XXXX's unparalleled power and intellect, this crossover adventure becomes an unforgettable masterpiece of unprecedented proportions."},{"instruction":"و","output":"أعتقد أنك قمت بإنقاص الكلمة المذكورة في سؤالك. هل ترغب في توضيح السؤال بشكل أكثر تحديدا؟"},{"instruction":"Hi!","output":"Hello!

Write long, detailed, comprehensive and precise proposed course of treatment for Mercedes Caravetta.","output":"Title: Proposed Comprehensive Course of Treatment for Mercedes Caravetta's Severe Bilateral Labral Tears I. Introduction: Mercedes Caravetta, a young woman, has been diagnosed with severe bilateral labral tears. This comprehensive proposed course of treatment aims to provide detailed steps for managing her condition and guiding her towards recovery. II. Initial Assessment and Diagnosis: 1. Medical History: Gather Mercedes' complete medical history, including information about past injuries, surgeries, and any other conditions that may affect her treatment plan. 2. Physical Examination: Conduct a thorough physical examination to assess the extent of the labral tears and evaluate any associated symptoms or limitations. 3. Diagnostic Imaging: Perform imaging tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans to confirm the diagnosis, identify the exact location and severity of the labral tears, and rule out any other concurrent injuries. III. Conservative Treatment (Non-Surgical): 1. Medications: Prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage pain and reduce inflammation, as well as pain medications as necessary for breakthrough pain. 2. Physical Therapy: a. Goal Setting: Collaborate with a physical therapist to establish achievable goals, addressing pain reduction, improved joint stability, and functional recovery. b. Modalities: Utilize modalities such as heat/ice packs, therapeutic ultrasound, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief and tissue healing. c. Range of Motion and Strengthening Exercises: Initiate a progressive exercise program tailored to Mercedes' specific condition, focusing on improving hip joint stability, muscular strength, and endurance. d. Core Strengthening: Incorporate core exercises to enhance trunk stability and support the affected hip joints. e. Proprioceptive Training: Implement exercises to improve balance, coordination, and stability, aiming to reduce the risk of recurrent or compensatory injuries. f. Patient Education: Guide Mercedes on proper body mechanics, postural corrections, and activity modifications to prevent exacerbation of symptoms. IV. Surgical Intervention: 1. Arthroscopic Surgery: a. Preoperative Assessment: Conduct a thorough preoperative evaluation to determine Mercedes' eligibility for surgery, considering her overall health and lifestyle factors. b. Surgical Procedure: Perform arthroscopic surgical repair of the bilateral labral tears, using minimally invasive techniques to access and repair the damaged structures. c. Rehabilitation Protocol: i. Postoperative Pain Management: Prescribe suitable analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications to manage pain, inflammation, and swelling. ii. Initial Rest and Immobilization: Allow for a period of initial rest, incorporating a combination of immobilization techniques (e.g., crutches) to promote healing and alleviate stress on the repaired joint. iii. Gradual Mobilization: Begin supervised and progressive physical therapy sessions immediately after surgery, aiming to restore range of motion and strength in the hip joints. iv. Strengthening and Stability Exercises: Gradually introduce targeted exercises to strengthen the muscles around the hip joints, improving overall joint stability and function. v. Return-to-Sport Recovery Program: Develop a customized plan that gradually reintroduces Mercedes to her desired activities, focusing on a phased approach to minimize the risk of reinjury. d. Follow-Up and Monitoring: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor Mercedes' progress and modify the treatment plan as necessary. V. Adjunctive Treatments: 1. Assistive Devices: Provide supportive devices like crutches or walking aids during the initial period of conservative treatment or post-surgery to improve mobility and reduce stress on the hip joints. 2. Bracing: Recommend hip braces if deemed necessary, to stabilize the hip joints and provide additional support during activities. 3. Pain Management Interventions: Consider adjunctive treatments such as corticosteroid injections or regenerative therapies like platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections to alleviate persistent pain and promote tissue healing. VI. Psychological Support and Rehabilitation: 1. Psychological Counseling: Offer psychological support and counseling throughout the treatment journey, as severe labral tears can have a significant impact on an individual's mental well-being. 2. Rehabilitation Continuum: Encourage participation in regular follow-up visits with the physical therapist to promote adherence to the prescribed exercise program, monitor progress, and modify treatment based on Mercedes' evolving needs. VII. Conclusion: By using this comprehensive proposed course of treatment, Mercedes Caravetta can effectively manage her severe bilateral labral tears, promote healing, and regain functional mobility, ultimately aiming for a successful and sustainable recovery. Individualized monitoring and modifications throughout the treatment process are crucial to ensure optimal outcomes."},{"instruction":"ماهو سجع الكهان","output":"سجع الكهان هو شعر تراثي عربي يعود إلى العصور القديمة ويتكون من ثلاثة أبيات، حيث يبدأ السجع بالإشادة بالغالب على الكهان وقدرتهم على العرف الغيبية والتنبؤ بمستقبل الأشخاص، ثم ينتقدهم ويذكر أنهم لا يعلمون الغيب وأن توقعاتهم قد تكون خاطئة. يعتبر سجع الكهان من أشكال الشعر الساخر والساخرة من قسوة الحياة وتقلباتها، وقد استخدم في الغالب في الجاهلية والعصر الإسلامي المبكر."},{"instruction":"اكتب قصيدة باسلوب سجع الكهان عن فضل العقل و خطورة الخرافة","output":"يا جماعة الهمّ ليش تروّجوا الخرافة؟ معقول العقل عندكم مفتوح بالمكافة؟ نفهم العلم بالبحث والدراسة، أنتم بالأساطير قصصكم مطروفة! تحملون الكتب القديمة تحت الكتف، وتروحون تستخرجون منها معجزات وتفسير الخفايا! يا هؤلاء العاملين في الكهانة، بصدق حضارتكم صارت مائلة للمفازة! ما عمر الخرافة ردت نفعاً حقيقياً للمجتمع، كل ما فيها قصص وأساطير وهزاء، والنتيجة تاريخها المدمر إن كانت للحقيقة مهددة! فهل هناك سبب يجعلنا نودنا بحكايات لا أساس لها حقيقة؟ العلم والعقل هما سلاحنا وقوتنا، بهما نضحك على تصرفات الجموع المعتوهة! لكن ساعتها، يقولون إن العقل قاتل الأحلام، وبالتالي ليس له طوق النجاة! فعلى أي أساس نبني حضارتنا وندافع عن شرفنا وشهامتنا؟ فلنقف نحن العقلاء ضد خداع الطائفة الغافلة، وننشر العلم والعقل ونرفض التلاعب بخرافة الجاهلية! فلنستفيق من الغيبوبة ونعيش بعقلانية، لنكن الشمعة التي تنير الظلام، وليكن العقل لنا سفيراً للسماء!"},{"instruction":"هل يمكن ان تعيدها بالقافية","output":"بالطبع! إليك القصيدة بنفس أسلوب سجع الكهان ومع القافية: يا جماعة الهمّ لِيْشَ تروّجُوا الخرافة؟ فَمَعْقُولٌ العقلُ عِنْدَكُمْ مُفْتَوحٌ بالمكافة؟ نَفْهَمُ العِلْمَ بالبحثِ وَالدِرَاسَةِ، إِنَّمَا اِلْعَمَلُ بِالخَيْرِ مَا يُرضِي الرضا. تَحْمِلُونَ الكُتُبَ القَدِيمَةَ تَحتَ الكَتَفِ، وَتُروَحُونَ تَسْتَخْرِجُونَ مِنهَا مَعْجِزَاتِ وَتَفْسِيرَ الخَفَايَا! يَا هَؤُلاءِ العَامِلِينَ فِي الكُهََانَةِ، بِصِدْقٍ حَضَارَتُكُمْ صَارَتْ مَائِلَةً لِلمُفَازَةِ! مَا عَمِرَ الخُرَافَةُ رَدَّتْ نَفْعًا حَقِيقِيًّا لِلْمُجْتَمَعِ، كُلُّ مَا فِيهَا قَصَصٌ وَأَسَاطِيرُ وَهَزَاءٌ، وَالنَّتِيجَةُ تَارِيخُهَا المُدَمِّرُ إِنْ كَانَتْ لِلْحَقِيقَةِ مُهَدَّدَةً! فَهَلْ هُنَاكَ سَبَبٌ يَجْعَلُنَا نُودِنَا بِحَكَايَاتٍ لَا أَسَاسَ لَهَا حَقِيقَةٌ؟ العلمُ وَالعقلُ هُمَا سِلاحُنَا وَقُوتُنَا، بِهِمَا نَضْحَكُ عَلَى تَصَرُّفَاتِ الجُمَوْعِ الْمُعْتَوَهَةِ! لَكِنَّ سَاعَتَهَا، يَقُولُونَ إِنَّ العقلَ قَاتِلُ الأَحْلَامِ، وَبِالْتَّالِي لَيْسَ لَهُ طَوْقُ النَّجَاةِ! فَعَلَيْنَا أَنْ نَقُفَّ نحنُ العَقْلَاءُ ضِدَّ خِدَاعِ الطَائِفَةِ الْغَافِلَةِ، وَنُنَشِّرُ العِلْمَ وَالعَقْلَ وَنَرَفِضُ التَّلاَعُبَ بِخِرَافَةِ الجَاهِلِيَّةِ! فَلْنُستَفِيقَ مِنَ الْغُيُوبَةِ وَنَعِيشَ بِعَقْلَانِيَّةٍ، لِنَكُنْ الشُّمُوعَةَ التِّي تُنِيرُ الظَّلَامَ، وَلِيَكُنْ العَقْلُ لَنَا سَفِيرًا لِلسَّمَاءِ!"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Increasing the thermal efficiency: Feed water heaters heat the feed water before it enters the boiler, thus utilizing waste heat from the exhaust gases. This preheating process significantly increases the overall thermal efficiency of the power plant. 2. Reducing fuel consumption: By preheating the feed water, the temperature difference between the feed water and the steam in the boiler is decreased. This reduces the amount of fuel required to raise the temperature of the feed water to the steam temperature, resulting in fuel savings. 3. Preventing thermal shock: Feed water heaters ensure that the feed water temperature is gradually raised to the steam temperature, preventing thermal shock to the boiler tubes. Without proper preheating, the sudden temperature difference could cause stress and damage to the boiler components. 4. Minimizing corrosion and scaling: Feed water heaters also help in minimizing corrosion and scaling in the boiler by removing dissolved oxygen and other impurities from the feed water. This improves the lifespan of the boiler components and reduces maintenance costs. 5. Condensate recovery: Some feed water heaters are designed to recover and utilize the heat from the condensate that leaves the turbines. This further increases the thermal efficiency of the power plant by reusing the waste heat. Overall, feed water heaters play a crucial role in maximizing the efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and ensuring the long-term reliability of thermal power plants."},{"instruction":"function of steam turbines in thermal power plants","output":"Steam turbines in thermal power plants serve the following functions: 1. Energy conversion: The primary function of a steam turbine is to convert the thermal energy obtained from the burning of fuel, usually coal or natural gas, into mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is then used to rotate the turbine shaft. 2. Power generation: The rotating turbine shaft is connected to a generator, which converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. This electrical energy is then fed into the power grid for distribution to consumers. 3. Expansion of steam: Steam turbines expand the high-pressure and high-temperature steam produced in the boiler. As the steam passes through the turbine blades, it expands and loses pressure, while gaining velocity. This expansion converts the thermal energy of the steam into rotational mechanical energy. 4. Multiple stages: Steam turbines are generally designed with multiple stages, each with a set of stationary blades (nozzles) and rotating blades (rotors). The steam passes through these stages sequentially, expanding further and transferring more energy to the rotating shaft. 5. Impulse and reaction principles: Steam turbines can work on the impulse or reaction principles, or a combination of both. In impulse turbines, the steam expands only in the nozzles, and the high-velocity steam jets strike the rotor blades, causing them to rotate. In reaction turbines, the steam expands continuously in both the nozzles and the rotor blades, creating a combination of pressure and velocity forces for rotation. 6. Control of power output: Steam turbines can effectively control and adjust their power output to meet the varying demands of electricity consumption. This is done by adjusting the flow of steam or by using variable geometry nozzle and blade designs to control the expansion of steam and its energy transfer to the turbine. Overall, steam turbines play a crucial role in the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical energy and electrical power in thermal power plants. Their efficiency, reliability, and control make them a vital component in generating large-scale electricity."},{"instruction":"function of alternator in thermal power plants","output":"The alternator, also known as a synchronous generator, in thermal power plants serves the following functions: 1. Electrical power generation: The primary function of the alternator is to convert the mechanical energy obtained from the steam turbine into electrical energy. As the turbine shaft rotates, it rotates the rotor of the alternator, which then induces an electromagnetic field in the stator windings. This electromagnetic field generates an alternating current (AC) output in the stator windings. 2. Voltage regulation: Alternators play a crucial role in maintaining a stable voltage output. They are equipped with various control mechanisms to regulate the voltage and keep it within an acceptable range. These mechanisms include automatic voltage regulators (AVR) that monitor the output voltage and adjust the excitation current supplied to the rotor to maintain a constant voltage. 3. Frequency control: Alternators also help in controlling the frequency of the generated electricity. The steam turbine drives the rotor at a constant speed, which determines the frequency of the generated AC power. In most countries, the standard frequency for electrical power is 50 or 60 Hz, and the alternator ensures that the generated power matches this frequency. 4. Synchronization with the grid: Alternators need to synchronize with the electric power grid before the generated electricity can be delivered to consumers. Synchronization ensures that the voltage, frequency, and phase of the generated power match those of the grid. This is essential for safe and efficient power transfer between the power plant and the grid. 5. Reactive power generation: Alternators can also provide reactive power, which is necessary for maintaining voltage levels and supporting the operation of inductive loads such as motors and transformers.

Selected determinants of non-price demand are analyzed below.","output":"Determinants of demand can be broadly categorized into objective factors, both economic and non-economic, as well as subjective factors rooted in psychology. Among the objective pro-demand factors, several key distinctions can be made: 1) Individual income level and sources: The consumer's personal income and its sources play a significant role in determining their demand. 2) Access to foreign capital financing: Consumers' ability to access financing from foreign sources can impact their demand for goods. 3) Consumer savings: The amount of savings held by consumers can influence their purchasing decisions and overall demand. 4) Availability and supply of the desired goods: The availability and supply of the goods for which consumers express demand directly affect their willingness and ability to purchase. 5) Price levels of the desired goods: The price of a good has a significant impact on consumer demand. In the period of 2019-2021, there was a positive correlation between market demand and prices. This means that as prices increased, the number of transactions also increased or stabilized at a high level. 6) Information dissemination and public awareness: The level and manner of public information dissemination within a country can influence consumer demand. 7) General economic situation: The overall economic conditions prevailing in a consumer's country can have an impact on their demand for goods. 8) Demographic, professional, and social conditions: Factors such as demographics, profession, and social conditions can also affect consumer demand. Among the subjective factors influencing demand, two significant factors are: 1) Emotions, moods, and societal customs: The prevailing emotions, moods, and customs within a society can influence consumer demand. 2) Private beliefs and habits: Personal beliefs and habits of individual consumers can also shape their demand for goods. In the period of 2019-2021, the non-price determinants of demand have been analyzed, considering their impact on the market dynamics."},{"instruction":"Give a Really Shortest Description Backstory about Power Rangers/SCP Foundation Merged Together x Greek Mythology Crossover, SCP-XXXX: The Omnipotent God of Power “Jason Lee Scott” meeting Odysseu’s family members characters, Odysseus, Penelope (Odysseus’s Wife), Telemachus (Odysseus’s son), Laertes (Odysseus’ father), and the rest of Odysseus’s people in Ithaca, and later on meets the rest of the heroes, Orpheus, Theseus, Oedipus, Meleager, Hector, Perseus, Atalanta, Ajax, Aeneas, Asclepius, Hercules, Jason, Achilles, Bellerophon, and Diomedes, then meets the Titan Gods, Oceanus, Mnemosyne, Tethys, Hyperion, Theia, Coeus, Crius, Iapetus, Rhea, Themis, Phoebe, and Cronus (Kronos), and meets the Olympian Gods, Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes, Dionysus, Hestia, and then lastly Jason Lee Scott meets the Monsters that he fought against which is Medusa, Chimera, Minotaur, Cyclops, Hydra, Harpies, Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, and lastly Cerberus, and SCP-XXXX is a humanoid entity that closely resembles Jason Lee Scott, a character from the Power Rangers franchise.

Alongside their primary activities involving weed sales, underground clubs, and stolen weaponry, the gang occasionally carries out daring bank robberies.
