Answer the following question: This article: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM.

I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the given process is the formation of tectonic plates and their movement along the Earth's surface. To better understand the complete process, let's explore each step in detail: 1. Formation of tectonic plates and their movement: The Earth's outermost layer, called the lithosphere, is composed of solid rock plates known as tectonic plates. These plates float atop the asthenosphere, a highly viscous and partially molten layer found beneath the lithosphere. The movement of tectonic plates is primarily driven by the process of convection within the asthenosphere and Earth's mantle, along with the forces acting at plate boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. 2. The fault lines grow over time: As tectonic plates move and interact with one another, stress accumulates within their interiors and at their boundaries, leading to the formation and growth of cracks or fractures known as fault lines. Fault lines can extend for many miles and are zones of weakness within the Earth's crust. 3. The rocks on each side of the fault lines rub against the rocks on the other side of the fault line: As tectonic plates continue to move, the rocks on one side of a fault line rub against the rocks on the other side, causing friction and further stress accumulation in the area. 4. The rocks put pressure on each other: The continuous movement and interaction between the tectonic plates cause the rocks on each side of a fault line to experience compressional, tensional, or shear forces. These forces put pressure on the rocks, further increasing stress in the area. 5. The rocks break from the pressure: Eventually, the accumulated stress becomes too great for the rocks to withstand, causing them to break or slip along the fault line. This sudden release of energy is known as an earthquake. 6. The breaking of the rocks releases a lot of energy: The rapid movement of the rock masses along the fault line results in the release of a significant amount of stored strain energy in the form of seismic waves. 7. The energy causes seismic waves: Seismic waves, which include both body waves that travel through the Earth's interior and surface waves that travel along the Earth's surface, propagate outward from the earthquake's epicenter. These waves carry the energy released during the earthquake and can travel vast distances. 8. The seismic waves make the earth shake: As seismic waves travel through the Earth and along its surface, they cause the ground to shake and vibrate. The shaking can cause various types of damage, including the collapse of buildings and other structures, landslides, and tsunamis, depending on the magnitude of the earthquake and the specific site characteristics of the affected region. In conclusion, the missing first step in the given process is the formation and movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. This movement and interaction create fault lines, which become the source of earthquakes as stress accumulates and rocks eventually break, releasing significant amounts of energy in the form of seismic waves and causing the ground to shake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.

The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them.

She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistent questioning about her father's identity.[4][5] As Alia negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have what seems to be yet another abortion.[4] [1] Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty.[1] Answer:","output":"Khedija's appeal to men in the movie \\"The Silences of Palace\\" gives her a position as a house servant and mistress in the prince's palace. This position, however, comes with sexual exploitation and servitude in an environment marked by significant gender and class differences. As a result, her daughter, Alia, struggles with understanding her mother's past and faces her own challenges as she navigates her independence and relationships."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Switzerland is one of the most developed countries in Europe. It is famous as one of the cleanest countries in the world. The Swiss think that recycling is very important. The government has made laws   which require everyone to recycle. In 1998, the Swiss government passed a law which says that people can not throw away any electronic machines. Instead, people are told to bring old ones, such as televisions, computers and fridges, to special centers when they didn't need them. Many parts of the old machines are reused, and only the parts that can't be used are thrown away. The government also charges  a rubbish bag tax . If people want their rubbish to be collected, they must buy yellow stickers  and put them on their rubbish bags. In 2003, 47% of all rubbish in the cities was recycled. This included 70% of paper, 95%of glass, 71%of plastic bottles and 85--90%of cans. Until recently, people could get a small amount of money when they recycled their bottles.

Photographed 500 feet above the central highlands and southern parts of Iceland, the dams and rivers take on amazingly sweeping shapes and colours as the water passes through glaciers and dams. Russian photographer Andre Ermolaev travelled to Iceland to capture the unique beauty of its landscape. Awash with colour: Russian Photographer Andre Ermolaev captured the incredible landscape featuring rivers and dams streaming from Iceland's glaciers. The 57-year-old from Moscow said: ‘When we were in the plane we saw a river which had flown through several dams and the water is a transparent blue. ‘A bit upstream there is a little yellow stream that flows into this river and mixes with the water. Bird's eye view: The photographer flew 500 feet above the rivers, capturing their sweeping shapes as they passed through glaciers and dams. To the sea: The water changes colour as it moves through glaciers and flat, sandy areas, creating amazing shapes and effects. Almost art: The images look almost like art rather than the natural landscape of the island country. ‘Patterns of nature are so amazing that nobody can say or describe what we see on the photograph - it's mind-blowing. ‘The photographs are a true reflection of what I saw on the day and I'm thrilled with the outcome.’ The shallow rivers spread quickly across flat and sandy surfaces after passing through glaciers, making the water cloudy. With tourism forming over 30 per cent of the island's income, visitors to the ice flows are treated to wonders such as the Jvkulsarlsn lagoon, dramatic ice walls and ominous icebergs.

A Jewish barber saves the life of a wounded pilot, Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but loses his own memory through concussion.     Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the barber escapes from his care-home to return to the ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who looks like an identical twin of the barber (both played by Chaplin). The barber falls in love with a neighbor's daughter Hannah (Paulette Goddard), and together they try to resist persecution by storm troopers. The storm troopers capture the barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz remembers that the barber had saved his life during the war, and restrains them. Hynkel tries to finance his military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy, and is removed from office and sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to mount an assassination attempt against Hynkel, but they sensibly decline to participate in his violent plan. Stormtroopers search the ghetto, arresting Schultz and the barber. They are sent to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom in the neighboring country of Osterlich. Hynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Napaloni (a spoof of Mussolini played by Jack Oakie), over which country should invade Osterlich. After signing a treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel invades Osterlich. The Jewish family is trapped by the invading force.

The reviewer's use of all-caps and exclamation marks throughout the text highlights their strong negative emotions regarding the movie. Furthermore, the reviewer suggests that the movie is not even enjoyable in a \\"so bad it's good\\" way, instead describing it as \\"tedious\\" and \\"idiotic.\\" As a comparison, the reviewer states that they would rather watch \\"Home Improvement,\\" a sitcom with a minor connection to the movie, for sixty-six hours than even look at the movie's cover again, emphasizing their extreme dislike for the film.

The aliens pull out shotguns and rob the store's owner. Sykes and Tuggle intervene when the robbers emerge from the store and a gunfight ensues. One of the newcomers changes the magazine on his shotgun and begins to fire several powerful rounds that pass through the entire width of the car Tuggle is hiding behind. Tuggle is hit in the chest by one of the shots and dies immediately. Sykes, enraged at his longtime partner's death, takes off after Tuggle's killers.Rushing into a dark tunnel near the store, the Newcomer Sykes chases pulls out a small vial of blue fluid and deposits a small amount on his tongue. The substance is clearly a drug and the newcomer, invigorated by it's effects, furiously charges Sykes.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Eldrick Tont Woods (born December 30, 1975) better known as Tiger Woods, is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time. He has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years. Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur career, Woods was 20 years old when he turned professional at the end of summer in 1996. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters. Context: Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \\"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not). At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.  A related effect was measured by University of California economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003-04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \\"superstar\\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.  Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as \\"Tiger-Proofing\\". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win. Question: Tell me more about the strategy.. Whats the answer?","output":"The strategy in question, known as \\"Tiger-Proofing,\\" was implemented by various golf courses and tournament organizers in response to Tiger Woods' dominance in the sport. The concern was that Woods' unmatched skill level and long driving distance were making the game less competitive and even discouraging for other professional golfers. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the Tiger-Proofing strategy and its impact: 1. Identifying the Problem: Early in Tiger Woods' career, his exceptional skills and consistent wins caused concern among golf experts and fans who worried that this dominance would negatively impact the sport's competitiveness and its appeal to golf enthusiasts. 2. The \\"Superstar\\" Effect: A study by economist Jennifer Brown discovered that golfers tended to score higher when playing against Tiger Woods, indicating that his presence in tournaments increased the level of difficulty for other professionals. This phenomenon is described as the \\"superstar\\" effect, where facing an exceptional competitor can decrease the motivation and effort of other players. 3. Implementing the Strategy: Several golf courses, including major championship venues such as Augusta National, decided to \\"Tiger-Proof\\" their courses by adding yardage to their tees. This change aimed to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods by making the courses more challenging overall, thereby making it more difficult for him to dominate the field. 4. Reaction of Tiger Woods: Despite the attempts to \\"Tiger-Proof\\" golf courses, Woods maintained a positive attitude about the changes. He argued that increasing the yardage did not affect his ability to win and that he welcomed the challenge. 5. Outcome and Effectiveness: Tiger-Proofing may have succeeded in making courses more challenging for all players, including Woods. However, it did not dramatically impact Woods' ability to win or significantly alter the competitiveness of the game, as he continued to have a successful career. Additionally, Tiger Woods' impact on the sport inspired a new generation of talented golfers who have contributed to the growth and popularity of golf. In conclusion, the Tiger-Proofing strategy aimed to make the game more competitive by altering golf course designs to reduce the advantages of long hitters like Tiger Woods. While this strategy may have increased the challenge for all players to some extent, it did not prevent Woods from achieving continued success in the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use.

They pass the time with small talk, and Donny looks at a photo of his wife, Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below, a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver, each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear, firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically picks off numerous hostiles, allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper's position, and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base, their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection, as the Americans aren't supposed to be in the country, and Swagger and Donny are abandoned, left to fend for themselves, left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR, and returns fire on the helicopter, bringing it down in flames.

So we add 1125 to both sides: 1612 = 62 * m Finally, to find the value of \\"m\\", we divide both sides by 62: m = 1612 / 62 m = 26 So the solution to the math problem is m = 26!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses and Chuck almost dies. Larry rescues Chuck by shielding him from the falling debris. As he and Larry awaken at a hospital later, Chuck vows to repay his debt in any way possible. The incident prompts Larry to realize the fact that death can come for him at any moment, but he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance policy. Larry was given at least a year to change his beneficiaries but he was profusely mourning his wife, and left it too late. However, One of the ways suggested for him to do so is to get married.

Answer the following question: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door.

Article: If you have been getting poor grades on homework assignments, it's time to up your game and put a little more effort into them. Even if each assignment is not worth that much, your cumulative grade for homework can be a big chunk of your final grade.  Be sure you understand what you are supposed to do before you leave class. If you have any questions about how to complete the homework assignment, ask your teacher for clarification. Always read the directions (or listen to them) and follow them precisely. Don't be lazy and write fewer words than were asked of you or neglect to show your work. Always write down when each assignment is due and hand it in on time. There's nothing worse than getting points off for handing in an assignment late because you forgot that it was due!  If keeping track of your assignments in a planner or a digital calendar helps keep you organized, then be sure to record all of your homework assignments there. Try planning out a specific time to complete each assignment, and be sure to take other obligations into consideration. For example, if you know that you have a basketball game on Thursday and will only have one hour to work on homework, don't put off any assignments until Thursday that can be completed on Wednesday. If you missed any assignments because you were absent or because you simply didn't do them, ask your teacher if you can hand them in late. While you may only get partial credit for make-up work, it's definitely better than having a zero for that assignment. Ask about the possibility of making up in-class assignments that you missed as well as homework. Offer to come to the classroom during lunchtime or a free period to work on them. Try asking your teacher to revise an essay, re-take a test, or re-do a project that you got a bad grade on.  You could suggest that the teacher could replace the grade or average the two grades together. Your teacher may be willing to let you do this if you seem committed to bringing your grade up. Try to focus on substantive assignments that have a bigger impact on your overall grade rather than smaller assignments such as homework that may not make as big of a difference. While you may want to do whatever you can to improve a specific grade, it's important to be smart about it. Do not bring up one grade at the expense of another, whether it's for the same class or another one.  Focus the majority of your energy on the assignments that will earn you the most points. For example, if your final project is worth 50% of your grade and your homework assignments are worth 10%, spend more time studying for the final than working on your homework. This does not mean you should not do your other work, but simply that you should not spend as much time on it.  Never neglect a current assignment in favor of make-up work unless you are sure that you will earn more points for it. Don't neglect your other classes either. You shouldn't end up with a bad grade in one class because you were focusing all of your energy on trying to improve your grade in another. This will have a negative effect on your overall GPA. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, improving your grades on homework assignments requires consistent effort, organization, and effective time management. Firstly, ensure that you understand the assignment by asking your teacher for clarification if needed. Next, follow directions carefully and submit your work on time. Use a planner or digital calendar to keep track of your assignments and allocate specific time for each task, taking your other obligations into account. If you've missed any assignments, ask your teacher if you can submit them late or make up in-class work. Consider focusing on substantive assignments that have a more significant impact on your overall grade. However, do not neglect other classes or assignments, as this could negatively affect your overall GPA.

The Liptons are surprised by the death because Lillian seemed so healthy. The Liptons are also surprised by Paul's cheerfulness so soon after his wife's death. Carol becomes suspicious and starts to investigate, even inventing an excuse to visit him. An urn she finds in Paul's apartment contradicts Paul's story that Lillian had been buried.

This option does not make sense in this situation as it does not relate to a physical event happening during a performance. - Fail: This means to not succeed in achieving an objective, but it doesn't explain the specific incident related to the singer's foot. - Disobey: This term refers to going against rules or laws, and it does not seem relevant to the given situation involving the singer's foot getting caught on a wire. - Stumble: This word describes a momentary loss of balance or an awkward movement due to an obstacle, which fits the context of the singer's foot getting caught on a wire. - Boo Boo: This term generally implies a minor mistake, injury, or accident. Although it seems relevant, it is less specific than \\"stumble.\\" 3.

News article: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to round up corrupt officials and toss them from his helicopter midflight — and it wouldn’t be the first time he’s done it, he says.      In a speech at Camarines Sur in the northern Philippines on Tuesday, Duterte reportedly recounted throwing an alleged kidnapper to his death — furnishing details about how high the pilot had to fly — while he was mayor of Davao City, according to local newspaper the Philippine Star.      “If you are corrupt, I will fetch you with a helicopter and I will throw you out on the way to Manila,” the newspaper quoted him as saying in Tagalog during the speech. “I have done that before, why should I not do it again?”      Duterte was in Camarines Sur after touring provinces ravaged by Typhoon Nock-Ten, which made landfall on Christmas Day. But after he announced financial assistance packages for disaster-stricken areas, talk swung to the anticorruption drive he stressed would be a main focus of his six-year term — alongside his antidrug campaign, which has seen over 6000 people killed in brutal, extrajudicial fashion.      The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now      Duterte is notorious for his outbursts. He once said he should have “been first” in the gang rape of an Australian missionary in a prison riot in 1989. He also said he would kill his own children if they used drugs. Earlier this month, Duterte admitted to personally killing three people.      Members of Duterte’s Cabinet habitually dial back on such utterances, claiming that they are jokes or hyperbole. However, the U.N. human-rights commission has urged the Philippines to launch a murder investigation into Duterte’s claims.      Write to Joseph Hincks at joseph.hincks@timeinc.com. ||||| MANILA, Philippines – Is this another joke or hyperbole?      President Duterte vowed yesterday that corrupt officials would suffer the same fate as kidnap suspects he claimed to have thrown off a helicopter in mid-flight when he was mayor of Davao City.      Duterte made reference on how he dealt with criminals in the past to drive a point that he is serious about his government’s anti-corruption drive.      “If you are corrupt I will fetch you with a helicopter and I will throw you out on the way to Manila,” he said in Filipino yesterday in a speech at the Camarines Sur provincial capitol after he visited disaster-stricken areas affected by Typhoon Nina.      “I have done that before, why should I not do it again?” said Duterte after he announced that he was giving between P50 million to P100 million in financial assistance for disaster-stricken areas, in addition to a standby P1-billion calamity fund.      Duterte stressed that his anti-corruption drive, like his anti-drug campaign, will remain the main focus of his six-year term.      He has already gotten flak from international human rights groups over summary executions and his recent admission that he personally hunted criminals and killed them when he was Davao mayor.      Duterte narrated an incident when he had to go after kidnappers of a Chinese who mercilessly abused their victim even after the parents paid ransom.      Duterte recalled ordering the pilot to fly at the proper height, indicating the helicopter must be at the right distance from the ground so the body’s splatter won’t cause a commotion.      ‘Take it or leave it’      Duterte offered no apologies for his harsh language, which had in the past triggered outrage from US President Barack Obama, members of the United Nations and the European Union. He said it is just the way he speaks. “I am that person, take it or leave,” he said.      In a previous interview during the campaign, Duterte admitted killing three kidnap suspects during an encounter.      He cited also a Chinese kidnap victim was involved in that operation which happened in 1988.      There was a report of Duterte killing a drug dealer by dropping him off a helicopter when he was mayor, but it is not clear whether the President was referring to this incident in yesterday’s speech.      In the same speech, Duterte even mentioned in passing that he did not spare two of his fraternity brothers for accepting P50-million bribe from a Macau-based online gambling operator of the Fontana Leisure Parks and Casino in Pampanga.      After announcing his assistance to the disaster victims, Duterte reiterated anew his seriousness in the anti-drug campaign.      This time, Duterte said he is faced with a tough problem on how to deal with four million drug users.      “Out of the four million, at a liberal computation, just give me one million who had gone crazy. What will I do with them? Turn them into fertilizer? I can do that in Mindanao, but here you’ll just report it. But that’s our problem,” he said. In criminal lingo, only rotten bodies turn up as fertilizers.      Duterte also slammed the Catholic Church for criticizing him over the extrajudicial killings attributed to his brutal campaign against illegal drugs.      He said he believes there is a God, he believes in Allah, but that he does not believe in religion, particularly the Catholic Church.      “My statement’s full of sarcasm because they (priests) have been criticizing me,” the President told the gathering of Davao City barangay captains and kagawads last night.      Duterte said he does not intend to follow any religious practice once he dies. “Cremate me within 24 hours when I die,” he said. – With Edith Regalado ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, said in a speech that he has thrown corrupt officials out of a helicopter before, and he will do it again if he needs to.

No The statement \\"In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea, contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year.\\" does not answer the question \\"What is recommended by the WHO for malnutrition and diarrhea?\\" as it only provides information about the consequences of malnutrition and diarrhea in children. It does not provide any recommendations by the WHO for dealing with these issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) has several recommendations for addressing malnutrition and diarrhea, including the following: 1. Proper nutrition: Ensuring that children receive a balanced diet with adequate nutrients is key to preventing malnutrition. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of a child's life, followed by the introduction of complementary foods and continued breastfeeding until at least 24 months. Micronutrient supplements like vitamin A and zinc can also be provided to children at risk of malnutrition. 2. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT): Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which is particularly dangerous for young children. The WHO recommends treating dehydration caused by diarrhea with oral rehydration salts (ORS), a simple solution of sugar, salt, and water. ORS is an effective and low-cost treatment that can save lives in cases of severe diarrhea. 3. Zinc supplementation: Zinc supplements can help treat diarrhea and reduce the duration and severity of the illness. WHO recommends providing children with diarrhea 10-20 mg of zinc per day, depending on age, for 10 to 14 days. 4. Access to clean water and sanitation: Adequate access to clean drinking water and proper sanitation facilities can help reduce the prevalence of waterborne diseases, including diarrhea. The WHO advocates for improved water quality and sanitation in communities worldwide as part of their overall strategy for addressing malnutrition and diarrhea-related issues. 5. Rotavirus vaccination: Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children, especially in developing countries. WHO recommends the inclusion of rotavirus vaccines in national immunization programs to help prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the incidence of diarrhea in children. 6. Education and community engagement: Education on proper hygiene practices, such as handwashing with soap, can help prevent the spread of diarrhea-causing bacteria. In addition, community-based interventions, such as providing health information and training to local leaders, can be effective in addressing malnutrition and diarrhea at the local level. In summary, the statement provided does not answer the question on what the WHO recommends for malnutrition and diarrhea. Instead, the WHO offers various recommendations that include proper nutrition, oral rehydration therapy, zinc supplementation, clean water and sanitation, rotavirus vaccination, and community education and engagement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: Tsunetane Oda (小田常胤 , Oda Tsunetane , March 10, 1892 – February 11, 1955) was a judoka who was influential in the development of Kosen judo. His correct name was Join Oda, but through a misinterpretation of the kanji 常胤 he is more commonly known as Tsunetane. Hypothesis: Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda were the same person.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda were indeed the same person based on the given context. The context highlights that Tsunetane Oda, born on March 10, 1892, and passed away on February 11, 1955, was a significant figure in the development of Kosen judo. It mentions that his correct name was in fact Join Oda, which is further clarified by the explanation of the misinterpretation of the kanji 常胤. This misinterpretation is mentioned as the reason why he is more commonly known as Tsunetane Oda. It's important to understand that the Japanese writing system includes kanji, which are borrowed Chinese characters that have their own unique pronunciation and meaning. The kanji 常胤, in this case, can be read as \\"Tsunetane,\\" which is a commonly known pronunciation. However, the kanji can also be read as \\"Join\\", which is the correct pronunciation of Oda's name. Due to the complexity of the Japanese writing system and the various ways kanji can be read, it's not unusual for misunderstandings and misinterpretations to occur. In addition to the shared birth and death dates, their contributions to the development of Kosen judo further confirm that these two names refer to the same individual. Kosen judo, an offshoot of Kodokan judo, emphasizes groundwork and newaza techniques, and has gained popularity in the judo community. Oda's influence and expertise in this area were instrumental in shaping the practice of Kosen judo, which solidifies the connection between the names Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda. Therefore, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Tsunetane Oda and Join Oda were indeed the same person, with the latter being the correct name of the individual. This hypothesis can also be supported by the common birth and death dates, as well as their shared accomplishments and contributions to the field of Kosen judo."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(AP) — A woman who was stranded in the rugged Sierra Nevada for nine days while suffering from some broken bones survived by using a water filter to drink from a creek, authorities said.      Miyuki Harwood, 62, was found Saturday morning in a remote area of the Sierra National Forest after she used a whistle to get the attention of a search and rescue team who were looking for her, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said at a news conference.      Harwood was airlifted to a hospital to treat an unspecified injury sustained on Aug. 20 when she got separated from a group of hikers near Horsehead Lake, about 100 miles northwest of Fresno.      She was listed in stable condition, the sheriff said after meeting Harwood at her hospital bed.      \\"Her voice was strong. She was extremely thankful that people were looking for her,\\" Mims said.      Harwood, of Folsom, Calif., was the focus of an intense search involving several law enforcement agencies after she got lost in the mountains.      She broke some bones and couldn't hike back to her base camp, Mims said. She also had very little food and supplies because she was carrying just enough for a day trip.      To survive, Harwood crawled for about two days from where she was injured to a creek where she could scoop water into a bottle with a filter inside.      \\"She was a fighter,\\" said Rusty Hotchkiss, a California Highway Patrol flight officer and paramedic who flew Harwood to the hospital.      \\"She was very exhausted — very tired, but she was very thankful to be saved and to get out of there,\\" he added.

The search efforts for the ill-fated airplane will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area in the southern Indian Ocean, based on updated satellite projections. The Australian Deputy Prime Minister has stated that it is \\"highly likely\\" the plane was on autopilot during the time of the crash, leading to a more precise calculation of the final location. This revelation comes after extensive studies and investigations were conducted to understand the events that unfolded on that fateful day. According to the new analysis, it is now believed that the aircraft continued flying in a southern direction on autopilot until it ran out of fuel, resulting in its tragic end in the Indian Ocean. The updated search area is in line with the original \\"southern corridor\\" identified as the most probable location for finding the wreckage of the missing aircraft. The shift in focus to the new 60,000 square kilometre area is based on the latest information provided by satellite projections. These projections offer a detailed map of the plane's likely trajectory and final location, enabling search and rescue teams to concentrate their efforts more effectively. Since the disappearance of flight MH370, several international agencies and experts have been working tirelessly to locate the wreckage and uncover the reasons behind the mysterious crash. The event has captured global attention, sparking numerous theories and discussions about the circumstances that led to the unfortunate incident. With an ever-changing landscape of information, theories, and analysis, it is crucial to remain flexible and responsive in the ongoing search for MH370. The newly identified area in the southern Indian Ocean offers hope to the families of the 239 people on board, as well as the international community as a whole, who are all eager for closure on this tragic event. In summary, the new analysis and satellite projections have led officials to shift the search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 further south. The Australian Deputy Prime Minister's statement regarding the likelihood of autopilot usage further supports the credibility of this new information. It is hoped that this updated approach will eventually lead to the discovery of the wreckage and provide answers to the many questions surrounding the flight's disappearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If aliens from outer space visited our planet, they might be surprised to find that we excrete waste through our genitals - which, of course, also have a vital use in reproduction. However, the Chinese soft-shell turtle has evolved to use a very different orifice to rid itself of waste . Most usually encountered at upmarket restaurants in China, where they are considered a delicacy, these unusual amphibians are the only animals known to urinate through their mouths. Wash your mouth out! The Chinese soft-shelled turtle is the only animal known to science that actually urinates through its mouth. Now scientists believe that this apparently unique ability helped the animals adapt to survive in swamps and marshes where the water is often brackish - that is, slightly salty. Scientists in the 19th Century discovered that the linings of the mouths of soft-shelled turtles are covered with tiny, finger-shaped protrusions. Subsequent research revealed that these allow the turtles to breathe underwater by increasing the surface area of the mouth where oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged. But Alex Yuen Kwong Ip of the National. University of Singapore believes that these characteristics evolved for. one reason only: to help the turtles urinate through their mouths more. easily. Here are some other Chinese delicacies that might seem odd to Western diners:. Together with Shit Fun Chew of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, Professor Ip kept four turtles in tanks of water for six days, New Scientist reported. Each animal had a tube attached to its cloaca, the posterior opening where amphibians usually excrete both urine and faeces, so Professor Ip could keep tabs on what emerged. The researchers found that, incredibly, only 6 per cent of the turtle's urea came out of the cloaca, with the rest mysteriously turning up in the tank's water. Professor Ip also restrained the turtles on land. He found that when he placed a bucket of water in front of them the creatures plunged their heads in for between 20 and 100 minutes. Observing more closely, he watched as they held some water in their mouths for a while then spat it out, increasing the concentration of the urea in the water. Delicacy: Chinese soft-shelled turtles are farmed across South East Asia, where they are considered a delicacy and are often served in upmarket restaurants. Professors Ip and Chew found that proteins in the turtle's mouth lining help to transport urea from its bloodstream. They managed to isolate on such protein and found it was only present in the mouth and not the kidney. 'I know of no other animal that can excrete urea through the mouth,' Professor Ip was quoted by New Scientist as saying. Most fish excrete through their gills, and lungfish and some amphibians can do so through their skin, but the Chinese soft-shelled turtle's oral excretion is almost certainly a one-off. Professor Ip believes oral urination helped the turtles adapt to life in brackish waters. To excrete urea via their kidneys and through their cloaca they would need to drink a lot of water to flush it through. That would mean consuming a lot of salt, which would be difficult for them to get rid of. So instead of drinking the backish water, the turtles are able to simply rinse their mouths with it. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article include: 1. The Chinese soft-shell turtle is considered unique in the animal kingdom for its ability to excrete waste, specifically urea, through its mouth rather than the usual genital route. 2. This unusual ability is thought to have evolved to help the turtles survive in swamps and marshes with brackish, or slightly salty, water.  3. Scientists in the 19th Century discovered that the linings of the mouths of soft-shelled turtles are covered with tiny, finger-shaped protrusions. These protrusions help the turtles breathe underwater by increasing the surface area where oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged. 4. Alex Yuen Kwong Ip of the National University of Singapore and Shit Fun Chew of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University conducted a study on four turtles to observe this phenomenon. They discovered that only 6% of the turtle's urea came out of the cloaca, with the rest being excreted through the mouth. 5. The researchers found that proteins in the turtle's mouth lining help transport urea from its bloodstream, allowing them to excrete wastes effectively using their mouth. 6. Oral urination is believed to have helped the turtles adapt to life in brackish waters, eliminating the need to consume large amounts of salty water to excrete via kidneys. 7. Chinese soft-shelled turtles are considered a delicacy in South East Asia and are often served in upmarket restaurants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Build a movie plot around this: Who captures Nicholas? Baron Frankenstein","output":"Title: The Shadows of Frankenstein Genre: Action, Adventure, Mystery, Sci-fi  Plot: In a small, mysterious village named Einbrook, located in the heart of the Bavarian Alps, Nicholas, a young and talented private detective, finds himself caught in the middle of a daunting case involving kidnapping, disappearances and a series of inexplicable events. Determined to get to the bottom of it all, Nicholas delves deep into the history of Einbrook and uncovers a horrifying secret.  The village is home to Baron Victor Frankenstein, a descendant of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein. The baron, hellbent on continuing his ancestor's grisly experiments with the hopes of mastering immortality, has been capturing unsuspecting villagers as well as anyone that threatens to unveil his dark secrets. Despite the terror and fear running rampant in Einbrook, the villagers remain obedient, believing that the baron possesses supernatural powers, and any attempts to confront him would result in dire consequences. Picking up the breadcrumbs left behind by his bold and analytical mind, Nicholas gets dangerously close to unraveling the mystery surrounding the missing persons and the baron's experiments. Aided by a secretive informant named Eliza, who knows more than she lets on, they come to learn about a secret laboratory hidden in the depths of Frankenstein Castle. Fearing that Nicholas is on the brink of uncovering the truth, Baron Frankenstein sends his loyal and ruthless henchmen to kidnap him. Unbeknownst to Nicholas, Eliza is, in fact, an unwilling accomplice of the baron, who uses her to monitor the detective's every move. As Nicholas follows a trail that leads him to the castle, he falls into the hands of the henchmen and is captured on the orders of Baron Frankenstein. They imprison Nicholas, intending to use him as the next subject for their twisted experiments. While locked away in a grim and dark cell, Nicholas discovers an unlikely ally: Leonard, the newest protege of the baron, sent to study under the baron's guidance. Leonard sympathizes with Nicholas when he realizes the extent of the baron's madness and the destruction he has wrought upon the village. Together, Nicholas and Leonard cautiously search the castle in a race to find the secret laboratory. They navigate through a series of hidden passageways, eventually stumbling upon highly advanced experimental machinery and the unfortunate evidence of the baron's macabre experiments. With a combination of wit, cunning, and determination, Nicholas secretly gathers crucial evidence to expose the baron's nefarious deeds, all the while avoiding capture themselves. During their daring exploration of the castle, the duo also uncovers the baron's ultimate invention - a serum able to give the user god-like abilities. As the climax of the story nears, Nicholas and Leonard confront Baron Frankenstein, leading to an intense battle where both heroes and villains are forced to use all their resources to secure their victory. The ensuing chaos results in the kingdom's authorities stepping in, sparking an all-out conflict against Frankenstein's henchmen and the baron himself. In the end, Nicholas and Leonard sabotage the evil baron's laboratory, putting a wrench in the mad scientist's plans for the moment. The baron narrowly escapes, setting the stage for ongoing battles between the forces of good and evil. Eliza repents for her part in the debacle, deciding to assist Nicholas and Leonard in their future endeavors against Baron Frankenstein. The trio emerge as new guardians against the dark forces plaguing Einbrook and the world beyond.  The Shadows of Frankenstein is an adrenaline-pumping movie that tests the limits of morality, science, and human determination. Through the characters' actions, it raises vital questions about the consequences of unchecked knowledge and the responsibility shared by those in a position of power. Exploring themes such as loyalty, betrayal, and redemption, this film is bound to captivate audiences with rich storytelling, high-stakes action, and a tantalizing taste of intrigue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.

How is \\"What's the move?\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"What's the move?\\" can be translated to \\"Jaký je tah?\\". It is important to note that languages often have multiple ways to convey a similar meaning, and the translation may slightly differ depending on the context or situation. Here, I'll provide a detailed breakdown of the translation and alternative phrases that may be relevant in different contexts. 1. Direct Translation: \\"Jaký je tah?\\"  This is the most direct translation of \\"What's the move?\\". It comprises three words: \\"Jaký\\" (What), \\"je\\" (is), and \\"tah\\" (move, as in a course of action or maneuver). In Czech, the word \\"tah\\" is often used in the context of making a move in a game, such as in chess. In a more general context, this phrase could be used to ask about someone's course of action or next step. 2. Alternative Phrases: Depending on the context, there are some other phrases that can be used to convey the same meaning: - \\"Co dál?\\" (What next?): This phrase is more colloquial and can be used in casual conversation to inquire about the next step or action that someone is planning to take. - \\"Jaký máš plán\\" (What's your plan?): This can be used when asking someone about their plans or intentions for a given situation. It also implies a more proactive approach, asking the person to share their intentions. - \\"Kam dál?\\" (Where to next?): This phrase is useful when discussing travel or moving from one location to another, especially when seeking recommendations or directions. - \\"Co budeme dělat?\\" (What are we going to do?): This phrase is useful when discussing a decision or plan that involves multiple participants, such as a group of friends deciding on their next activity. Remember, the context plays a major role in how you convey an idea in any language. It's always helpful to know the specific scenario in which you want to use the phrase.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.  - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots  \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek  \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.  - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials.   - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.  - Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge  a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.  - The chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po). The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well. Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \\"chalcogen\\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \\"chalcogen\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word \\"khalks\\" () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze/brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore or coin), and the Latinised Greek word \\"gens\\", meaning \\"born\\" or \\"produced\\".  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.  - Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.  - Chromium trioxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO. It is the acidic anhydride of chromic acid, and is sometimes marketed under the same name. This compound is a dark-purple solid under anhydrous conditions, bright orange when wet and which dissolves in water concomitant with hydrolysis. Millions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly for electroplating. Chromium trioxide is a powerful oxidiser and a suspected carcinogen.  - Pollucite is a zeolite mineral with the formula (Cs,Na)AlSiO·2HO with iron, calcium, rubidium and potassium as common substituting elements. It is important as a significant ore of caesium and sometimes rubidium. It forms a solid solution series with analcime. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system as colorless, white, gray, or rarely pink and blue masses. Well formed crystals are rare. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. It has a brittle fracture and no cleavage.  - The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, HCrO of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent.  - Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol.  - Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold (or, according to some, silver/colorless) alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at 116 °C (177 °F). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.  - Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides FeO·\\"n\\"HO and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)).  - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - Caesium chromate , the caesium salt of chromic acid , is used to produce caesium vapour by reaction with silicon , boron , or titanium , which is used to in the final stages of creating vacuum tubes ; the caesium vapour reacts with the remaining gases , including nitrogen and oxygen .  - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).  - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\".   - Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine.  - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.  - Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium.  - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.  - Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion yearsmore than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe.  - Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state.  - Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water.  - Kernite, also known as rasorite is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.  Paragraph: Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor. The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock? The answer is:","output":"The Arctic Ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock compared to the Pacific Ocean. This is because the Arctic Ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific Ocean has seven active diverging tectonic plates under its waters. The higher number of active divergent plate boundaries in the Pacific Ocean leads to more volcanic activity, and thus, increased cooling and solidification of hot molten rock, forming new oceanic crust. In comparison, the Arctic Ocean's dormant divergent plate results in less volcanic activity and cooling of hot molten rock."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who is arrested?

The priest is sent on a mission by the Pope  to find and protect the girl from Satan, although a few Vatican knights (led by a corrupt cardinal) insist that she must die. In New York a newborn girl, Christine York, is identified by Satanists (including her physician, Dr. Abel, and her nurse and future guardian, Mabel) as the person chosen to bear Satan's child on New Year's Eve, 1999. The Satanists perform occult rites on the newborn. In late 1999, Satan possesses an investment banker in a restaurant; he then destroys the restaurant, killing many inside. Suicidal and alcoholic former police detective Jericho Cane, depressed since his wife and daughter's contract killings, works for a private security company and blames God for his plight. Jericho and co-worker Bobby Chicago are assigned to protect the possessed banker. A priest, Thomas Aquinas, unsuccessfully tries to kill the banker. Jericho captures Aquinas, who tells Jericho: \\"The thousand years has ended, the dark angel is loosed from his prison\\" and says that a girl is central. Jericho shoots Aquinas, who is arrested by the New York Police Department. Marge Francis, an NYPD detective and Jericho's former colleague, tells him that Aquinas has no tongue.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. For just under five minutes on Saturday, England’s supporters found their voice. With Springbok lock Victor Matfield in the sin bin, Stuart Lancaster’s side finally gave the 82,125 fans inside Twickenham hope with two tries to level the score at 20-20. Swing Low echoed around the rain-soaked old stadium but they had barely got through the first verse before it all went flat again. Just as the power failed before the match, the lights went out on England’s momentarily sparky performance. With Matfield still off, the hulking Schalk Burger muscled his way over in the right-hand corner and South Africa never looked back. VIDEO Scroll down to see where Stuart Lancaster feels England lost the game. England captain Chris Robshaw's emotion shows what the loss, their fifth successive, means to the England players. England's players look dejected as they trudge off the Twickenham turf following their defeat on Saturday. South Africa players celebrate the only try of the first half which came from an intercept by Jan Serfontein. England: Brown, Watson,  Barritt, Eastmond, May, Farrell , Care; Marler, Hartley,  Wilson, Attwood, Lawes, Wood, Robshaw (c), Vunipola. Replacements: Webber, Mullan, Brookes,  Kruis, Morgan, Youngs, Ford, Yarde. Tries: Wilson, Morgan, Barritt. Penalties: Farrell (2), Ford.

Another consolation try seconds from time put gloss on the scoreboard but, make no mistake, for large parts of this game England were abject. If the alarm bells were ringing following defeat to the All Blacks, the sirens are screaming from the Twickenham rooftops after this loss. Five defeats in succession, albeit against the best two sides in the world, is England’s worst run since 2006. And as the countdown to the World Cup continues, there is no sign of significant improvement. For the second week running, an opposition No7 — this time Burger — won the man-of-the-match award, leaving more questions over England captain Chris Robshaw’s suitability for the openside role. For the second week running, England were second best at the breakdown. For the second week running, Owen Farrell was unable to spark his back line. For the second week running, the scoreboard told a false story. England created next to nothing when South Africa had a full complement on the field. On the few occasions they did, they bombed their chances. The first 15 minutes were truly dire with balls regularly spilled in slippery, but far from treacherous, handling conditions against a side who tackled fiercely, sat back and waited for their chances to come. And come they did. Before England knew it, they were 10-0 down and they were lucky to reach half time at 13-6. That became 20-6 just after the break when Cobus Reinach crossed for a brilliantly worked try before England briefly rallied with Matfield in the bin. But with momentum swinging, Burger and co wrestled control back and closed out the game. England had few answers. Lancaster said: ‘We got some good field position in the second half and took those chances well. In the first half we could have been a bit smarter in those conditions. It was one of those days when territory was going to be important and in the first half South Africa benefited from our errors. Springboks centre Jan Serfontein runs away for the first try of the match after intercepting the pass of Danny Care. England's Kyle Eastmond takes on South Africa's Pat Lambie as the centre makes his full international debut. Springboks' forwards engulf England's Billy Vunipola after he takes the ball from a lineout. Owen Farrell adds two points after the try of Wilson to make his tally two penalties and two conversions before being replaced. A break from England full back Mike Brown is halted by try-scorer Serfontein. South Africa celebrate Cobus Reinach's first international try in his first start for the Springboks in the first minute of the second half.

Substituted after 43 minutes, the young Saracen can rarely have produced a more error-strewn display. Ben Morgan will surely start next week if the strike-threatened clash with Samoa goes ahead. Almost as soon as Vunipola was replaced by Morgan, England found some bite. Two tries in three minutes from the industrious David Wilson and then from Morgan himself gave England’s fans hope. But like so many times under Stuart Lancaster’s reign, the home side flattered to deceive, lacking the nous to beat one of the Southern Hemisphere’s big three. Just as New Zealand did last week, South Africa gripped this game at precisely the right time. Once again England were strangled as discipline disappeared and attacking quality went missing. Dylan Hartley was sent to the bin for a cynical 61st-minute stamp on Duane Vermeulen, which could easily have brought a red card from referee Steve Walsh. As it was, the yellow compounded his side’s woes and undid a lot of excellent work from England’s hooker. Indeed, most concerning for England’s coaches is that despite the set-piece being rock solid, they are failing to create chances and field position on the back of it. England out-scrummaged their opponents with ease in an area the Springboks would have expected to dominate. England’s lineout functioned well again, with Courtney Lawes enjoying a fine game in tandem with his Northampton team-mate Hartley. So what on earth is going wrong? Victor Matfield was shown a yellow card after collapsing a maul following warnings to both sides by referee Steve Walsh. Mike Brown takes a high ball and is tackled in the air by South Africa's full back Willie Le Roux. England full back Brown pushes his South African counterpart Le Roux. David Wilson crosses for England as the hosts make South Africa pay following the sin-binning of South Africa's Matfield. England's Ben Morgan twists in the tackle to get the ball down for England's second try. Another try for the England forwards comes from Morgan as the home side make the most of the one-man advantage. 1) Losing the breakdown battle. Must generate quick ball for the backs. if you won’t use them?2) Talented wingers are isolated. Why pick them. 3) Kicking game needs improvement. No territory means no points. 4) Missed chances. England must start taking the few they’re creating. 5) Talk straight. Some home truths need telling behind closed doors. In his first start on the right wing, Anthony Watson hardly touched the ball while Jonny May was also criminally underused on the other flank. England’s much-criticised kicking game was barely any better on Saturday, with Farrell unable to manoeuvre his forwards around the pitch and lacking the passing game to get the back line moving. The England No10 was completely outshone by his opposite man Pat Lambie, who kicked 16 points including a late drop goal and pulled the strings superbly for his side. Scrum-half Danny Care was ponderous around the breakdown as England’s back row were dominated and the quick ball backs desperately crave to attack the gain-line never materialised. Tom Wood carried better than in recent matches but gave away too many penalties while Dave Attwood failed to let Watson loose with the line at his mercy on 25 minutes. Same old mistakes, same old story. Lancaster may not be for turning, but England’s fans deserve so much better than this. With the World Cup looming, there’s very little to sing about. England captain Chris Robshaw converses with referee Steve Walsh during their Test at Twickenham. Dylan Hartley walks from the pitch after being sin-binned following Walsh's chat with his TMO. England lock Courtney Lawes charges down the kick of Lambie. Stuart Lancaster's side must now regroup ahead of next week's clash with Samoa.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Jonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the Martyrologium Romanum. In Catholicism, the Book of Jonah is also read aloud in its entirety on Maundy Thursday in a Beneventan chant. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September.  Christian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for Jesus's resurrection. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that \\"Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.\\"  Other Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the kikayon represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther's antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that \\"the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes\\", and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against \\"the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.\\" Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.  John Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as \\"hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops\\", the penitence of the Ninevites as \\"untrained\\", and the king of Nineveh as a \\"novice\\". Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: \\"Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Which denominations are these?","output":"The denominations mentioned in the article are Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Armenian Apostolic Church, Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Get to know each student one-on-one. Your classroom may include students who have some disability and students who have none, and specific disabilities may vary among students who face them. To promote an inclusive environment, you'll need to know which needs exist and must be met.  Keep in mind that no two disabled students are the same. Some disabilities exist on a spectrum (such as varying degrees of low vision), and others are extremely complex (such as autism). Talking to the parents/guardians, and getting to know the child, will help you understand their unique needs. Recognize that not all disabilities may be diagnosed yet. Sometimes, people close to the child haven't recognized that the child is different or struggling. You may have several students with unrecognized disabilities. Don't assume that you can defeat or cure disability. Instead, work with the child at their level, and encourage them to gain skills one step at a time. You'll need to use the right tools if you want to meet the needs of students in your classroom. A physical environment that is somehow “off limits” to some of your students will make it impossible for those students to learn or feel welcome.  The exact tools will vary based on students' needs. For instance, students with vision impairments may need materials in large print or Braille. Those with speech impairments may benefit from speech synthesizers. Those with hearing impairments may need a sign language interpreter and subtitled instructional videos.  Some students will have needs that are not immediately obvious. For instance, some autistic students may have a sensitivity to light and sound, so rooms with soft light and minimal noise create a preferred learning environment. Unfortunately, even well-meaning individuals can end up labeling disabled students by their disabilities. Instead of fixating on the things your students cannot do, focus on your students' abilities and individual accomplishments. Viewing disabled students with pity or guilt does not empower them. Instead, you may accidentally send the message that they are less capable or less whole. Mean-spirited assumptions aren't the only hazardous ones to watch out for. In fact, well-intended assumptions can be just as damaging and might be harder to prevent. If one of your students appears to need help with something, ask instead of automatically jumping in to help. Some students may prefer to work through certain difficulties themselves. Others may appreciate your help, but may also want you to help using an approach you may not have thought of. Language is important when creating the right attitude. As a general rule, use language that affirms the identity of each student while avoiding language that is considered derogatory or language that otherwise focuses on the disability instead of the individual.  Refer to disabilities in simple language free from emotional judgments. In other words, instead of saying that someone \\"suffers from\\" or \\"is crippled by\\" a given disability, it would be better to simply state that they are \\"a person with\\" that disability (or, in the case of deaf, blind, or autistic people, a \\"_____ person\\"). Over-sensitivity can actually be harmful, too. Awkwardness over common phrases can draw unwanted attention to an impairment and may make a student feel more left out. If such phrases come up, it is best to gloss over them without making a fuss about them. For instance, if you or another student says \\"see you later\\" to a blind student, it is best not to point out the awkwardness of such a phrase unless the blind student indicates that they are upset by the remark. As the instructor, you must guide non-disabled students in your classroom as they interact with their disabled peers. Encourage a positive and cooperative attitude among all classmates under your care.  Pay attention to your own biases and preconceptions, then correct those errors as soon as possible. You will serve as a role model to your students, and poor behavior you demonstrate will be taught to them. Set ground rules regarding discussion and classroom behavior. When someone violates these rules and behaves inappropriately to another student, point out the violation and issue an appropriate consequence. Follow through consistently regardless of whether or not disabled students are involved and, if so, regardless of which position they find themselves in (i.e., the attacker or the victim). Don't enforce rules with disabled students that non-disabled students can get away with breaking.  Nip bullying in the bud. Make it clear that students need to respect others' boundaries, praise students for intervening if they see bullying, and take victims seriously if they report being bullied. In most cases, others will be actively involved in the care and education of the disabled students in your classroom. Work directly with these guardians, counselors, and advisers when addressing those students' needs.  Discuss your students' needs with their guardians. You may have insight to share with them, and they will almost certainly have insight to share with you. Depending on the circumstances, students with disabilities may need therapy from an outside specialist. These specialists may work through the school or may come from another source. Either way, it can be to everyone's benefit to communicate with such specialists when determining the best way to arrange classroom activities and instruction. Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing the unique needs of disabled students in an inclusive classroom environment, using appropriate tools and language, and promoting a positive, cooperative attitude among all students while working closely with guardians and specialists."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the premise \\"The demographic and economic assumptions imply a sharp drop in the average annual growth of aggregate hours worked from 0.7 percent through 2010 to 0.2 percent from 2020 through 2075.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Aggregate hours worked has only been decreasing for past decade.\\" is true?","output":"To evaluate if the hypothesis \\"Aggregate hours worked has only been decreasing for the past decade\\" is true, based on the premise \\"The demographic and economic assumptions imply a sharp drop in the average annual growth of aggregate hours worked from 0.7 percent through 2010 to 0.2 percent from 2020 through 2075,\\" we need to analyze the hypothesis in the context of the given premises and consider possible factors involved in the change in aggregate hours worked. 1. Premise interpretation: The premise states that there is a decrease in the annual growth rate of aggregate hours worked, not necessarily that the actual aggregate hours worked itself is decreasing. Here, we see a change in the growth rate, from a higher growth rate of 0.7% through 2010, to a lower growth rate of 0.2% from 2020 through 2075. 2. Factors affecting aggregate hours worked: To deduce whether the premise implies that the aggregate hours worked is decreasing in the past decade, we need to first understand the factors affecting it. Some major factors include population growth, employment rate, working-age population, and average hours worked per worker. 3. Changes in factors: If all the factors remain constant or show a positive trend, a slower growth rate in aggregate hours worked implies that the hours worked might still be increasing, but at a less rapid pace. For instance, a steady or growing population with a stable employment rate can still contribute to an increasing total hours worked. It is also possible that technological advancements and increased productivity compensates for a lower growth rate in aggregate hours worked, maintaining or even increasing the output achieved in the economy. 4. Effect of the given assumptions: The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the aggregate hours worked are actually decreasing over the past decade. The drop in growth rate could imply a slower pace of increase in the aggregate hours worked, but does not necessarily mean a decrease.  Thus, considering the factors affecting aggregate hours worked and the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Aggregate hours worked has only been decreasing for the past decade\\" is true. The premise only discusses the change in growth rate and not whether the aggregate hours worked are declining. Further clarification and data on the factors involved, such as demographic changes and economic performance during this period, would be needed to determine whether the hypothesis holds true or not."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

An excellent example of \\"cowboy noir\\", as it's been called, in which unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest (he's got a bum leg). With really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he's going to lie. When he walks into a bar, and the owner Wayne (the late, great J.T. Walsh) mistakes him for a hit-man whom Wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in fine form), Michael plays along and accepts Waynes' money. *Then* he goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions, and accepts *her* money to get rid of Wayne! If that didn't complicate things enough, the real hit-man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him) shows up and Michael is in even more trouble than before. \\"Red Rock West\\" gets a lot out of the locations. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother Rick, was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes. It's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation. It's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt, have at least been morally compromised like Michael. The lighting by cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is superb in its moodiness; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing. Even if the writing isn't particularly \\"logical or credible\\", the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in.

San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee (D) is barring public funding for city employees’ travel to North Carolina in protest of the state’s new law prohibiting localities from passing legislation to protect LGBT rights.      “We are standing united as San Franciscans to condemn North Carolina’s new discriminatory law that turns back the clock on protecting the rights of all Americans including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals,” Lee said in a Friday statement announcing the ban.      The mayor specified, however, that there would be an exception for travel that is “absolutely essential to public health and safety.”      The North Carolina legislature passed a law on Wednesday that prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, country of origin, age or “biological sex,” but deliberately excludes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It also barred municipalities in the state from passing their own laws against LGBT discrimination.      North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) promoted the law in part by stoking fears that laws against transgender discrimination would effectively allow men to prey on women in the bathroom.      It is not clear how often the city of San Francisco paid for trips to North Carolina, but the effort carries symbolic weight. The mayor’s move is part of a growing wave of governments and businesses trying to penalize the state for enabling anti-LGBT discrimination.      Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who has fought state-level anti-LGBT laws across the country, has said he will enlist the help of the CEO of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America in an effort to overturn the law.      PayPal, Dow Chemical, the NCAA, NBA and Google have come out against the law.      Lee indicated that San Francisco’s travel boycott is intended to serve as a warning to other states. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

The main entities involved in determining these rules are the Indian Constitution, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), and various service-specific rules and guidelines. 1. Indian Constitution: The Constitution of India forms the foundation for the rules and regulations governing All India Services recruitment. Article 312 of the Indian Constitution defines the All India Services and empowers the Parliament to create new services and modify existing ones. Furthermore, Article 320 provides for the establishment of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which serves as the central recruiting agency for these services. 2. Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT): The DoPT, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions, is responsible for formulating policies and managing the recruitment process for the All India Services. The DoPT issues guidelines, rules, and regulations concerning the selection process, training, and cadre allocation for successful candidates. 3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC): As a constitutional body, UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations and selecting candidates for All India Services. The UPSC is tasked to ensure the selection process is fair, transparent, and merit-based. It formulates examination rules, including eligibility criteria, age limit, educational qualifications, exam pattern, and reservation policies. 4. Service-Specific Rules and Guidelines: Each All India Service has its own specific rules and guidelines, laid down by the concerned Ministry or Department, which govern aspects like probation, seniority, promotion, and cadre allocation. These rules are revised periodically to reflect changes in policy and requirements. The recruitment process for All India Services consists of the following key stages: a. Civil Services Examination (CSE): UPSC conducts the CSE annually, which is a three-tier examination consisting of the Preliminary, Main, and Personality Test/Interview. Candidates who qualify the prelims go on to take the mains exams, following which those who clear the cutoff marks are summoned for a personality test or interview. b. Cadre Allocation: Based on the rank and preference of the candidates, as well as government guidelines on reservation policy, cadre allocation takes place. Candidates are allocated to different states and services like IAS, IPS, and IFoS. c. Training: Successful candidates undergo an extensive training program, first at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) for a foundation course, followed by specific service-related training at respective academies (e.g., Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy for IPS officers). d. Probation and Confirmation: After completing their training, officers are posted to various locations on probation. Upon successful completion of the probation period, they are confirmed in their respective services. The rules of recruitment for All India Services are designed to ensure a fair, transparent, and merit-based system that selects the best candidates to serve the nation.

A: Options are: (I). rain (II). chloride (III). lipoic (IV). pyruvic Answer:","output":"In alcoholic fermentation, the acid that changes to alcohol and carbon dioxide is pyruvic acid (IV).  Alcoholic fermentation is a biological process carried out by yeasts and some other microorganisms, which involves breaking down sugars like glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is anaerobic, meaning it occurs without oxygen. It is utilized in industries such as brewing, winemaking, and baking, and has been essential to human civilization for thousands of years. The process of alcoholic fermentation starts with the glycolysis pathway. Glycolysis is a series of metabolic reactions that convert glucose—a six-carbon sugar—into two molecules of pyruvate, a three-carbon compound, with a net gain of 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules (both of which are important energy carriers). The pyruvate generated during glycolysis is the crucial component that undergoes fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation consists of two primary reactions:  1. Decarboxylation: First, pyruvic acid undergoes decarboxylation, a chemical reaction where a carbon atom is removed from a molecule, forming carbon dioxide as a byproduct. In this case, the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase removes a carboxyl group (COOH) from pyruvic acid, producing acetaldehyde and releasing carbon dioxide. 2. Reduction: Following decarboxylation, the acetaldehyde is reduced to ethanol, an alcohol. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. During this reduction, the two NADH molecules generated previously in glycolysis are used, transferring electrons and protons to acetaldehyde and converting it into ethanol. This process also regenerates NAD+, which is needed for glycolysis to continue. In summary, during alcoholic fermentation, it is pyruvic acid (IV) that changes into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is essential in the production of alcoholic beverages, like beer and wine, and contributes to the leavening of dough in breadmaking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. It's a cliche of American presidential politics -- the president we elect is always a reaction to what came before. As in: Nixonian shenanigans eventually gave rise to Jimmy Carter's self-righteousness. Clintonesque parsing gave way to George W. Bush's plain speaking. Bush's plain speaking begat Barack Obama's lofty speechifying. Oversimplified? Yes. But true nonetheless. And so we head into 2016 (yes, already) and Chris Christie's ready-made narrative: If Obama is lofty, Christie is down to earth. If Obama wasn't tough enough, he's hard-hitting. If Obama couldn't run his complex health care rollout, he's a strong manager. If Obama was partisan, he's worked across party lines. In sum: Christie can lead in the precise ways that Obama disappointed. Until a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge. Then came another stark contrast: the vindictive -- and more important, petty -- Christie culture as opposed to the stature the presidency demands. So far, the New Jersey melodrama looks like the worst side of the Christie ethos. The apparent reprisals against Democratic mayors. The vanity of featuring the Christie family in taxpayer-funded commercials. The environment in which retribution reigned when Christie did not get what he wanted. The arrogance of believing he was deserving of it all, and to hell with the rest of 'em. The grand storyline behind all of this, of course, is the design on the presidency: Christie wanted to be re-elected by such an overwhelming margin that it would launch his national aspirations into the stratosphere. The plan was to get bipartisan support to show his viability as a national candidate. All who stood in the way were official enemies. This is not to say that presidents don't have enemies. Of course they do. You don't get elected to any office in this country, much less president of the United States, without accumulating political enemies. But the real question is WHY you consider someone an enemy, and then, how you deal with it. As president, LBJ had always had a bunch, but the enmity -- and payback -- generally came over issues, not self-aggrandizement. It's Politics 101: If you want to pass a civil rights bill and you don't get a \\"yes\\" vote from an opponent who wants a bridge in his state, no bridge. That's very different from saying if you don't endorse my candidacy I will shut down your bridge. That's not politics; it's puny payback. And, worse, the impact is felt not only by the opponent, but by his -- and your -- constituents. A bridge way too far. Then consider Bill Clinton, who had plenty of enemies. A former senior Clinton adviser reminds me that \\"it became a joke that the best thing to be was Clinton's enemy. If 99 people in a room were for him, and one was against him, he would spend all his time trying to persuade that one guy he was wrong. And he was always willing to argue the substance. Always. In fact, he enjoyed it.\\" This is not to turn Clinton and LBJ into saintly role models and Christie into the devil. But it is to say that Christie's staff shenanigans -- which he says he did not know about -- have raised enormous questions about his temperament and how he would run a White House. In fact, a Monmouth University poll released this week shows that only 44% of New Jersey voters believe that their governor has the right temperament for the Oval Office. The characterization of Christie and Obama as opposite numbers is accurate in many ways. There's this: When then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat-turned-independent, endorsed Republican Sen. John McCain for the presidency in 2008 -- and became his outspoken travel buddy -- there were calls for retribution after Obama won. So what did Obama do? He kept Lieberman on as chairman of an important committee. It kept an enemy close, not a bad strategy. Obama is cool and Christie is all drama. And now a line of argument against him as petty and vindictive has been opened up that will become the default narrative. But Christie will be defined as much by how he deals with this episode as the episode itself. No one expects -- or really wants -- Chris Christie to morph into a false version of himself. But how about some elevation -- and some perspective -- that flies way above the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In American presidential politics, presidents are often seen as a reaction to their predecessors. Chris Christie's down-to-earth and hard-hitting demeanor seemed poised to contrast Barack Obama's perceived disappointments, such as lofty speech and partisanship. However, the traffic jam scandal on the George Washington Bridge and the subsequent allegations of petty, vindictive behavior has raised concerns about Christie's temperament for the presidency. The way Christie deals with this scandal will define his image in political history. It's crucial for him to display an elevated perspective that goes beyond the current issues plaguing his reputation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At first glance, the restaurant's decor is lovely and inviting, but upon closer inspection, the cleanliness leaves much to be desired. While it wasn't enough to put me off entirely, it definitely dampened the ambiance. The real disappointment came when we ordered our appetizers and entrees. It took more than 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive, and when they did, the food was lackluster. The shrimp cocktail tasted rubbery and the accompanying sauce was bland. I also found a hair in my Caesar salad, which was promptly replaced by the staff, but nevertheless made me question the cleanliness of the kitchen. The main courses were similarly disappointing. My filet mignon was overly salty and cooked past the medium-rare I had requested. My date's vegetarian dish was a tasteless medley of undercooked vegetables drowning in a pool of watery sauce. Service was another area where The Fancy Fork fell short. Our server was absent most of the time, making it difficult to request refills of water or inquire about our food's long wait times. This, combined with the high price tag of our disappointing meals, left us feeling unsatisfied. In the end, it is difficult to recommend The Fancy Fork, especially with so many other great dining options nearby.

The hits just keep coming for MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, the Obamacare architect under fire for his controversial statements about the health care reform law. Video unearthed today by veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler shows Gruber agreeing that states' opposition to the Medicaid expansion dictated by the federal health law may be race-related. He also claimed states that rejected federal funds for Medicaid wanted 'to punish poor people,' which he said 'really is just almost awesome in its evilness.' The video released by Koffler on his news site, White House Dossier, is the latest in a series of damning videos of Gruber talking about the health care law that have popped up online recently. The comments have top Democrats, including President Barack Obama, disavowing both him and his claims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. In this March photo Economist Jonathan Gruber is seen speaking at a conference of the Workers Compensation Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the healthcare reform laws in Massachusetts and the Affordable Care Act. He's taken fire over recently over comments he made about the latter. In previously released videos, the economist stated that the health care law 'was written in a tortured way' to ensure that the Congressional Budget Office did not label the individual mandate portion of the law as a tax. 'If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay, so it’s written to do that,' he said during an academic panel in 2013. 'In terms of risk rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in – you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed… Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,' he continued. He then told the audience they could blame the 'stupidity of the American voter' for not seeing through Democratic spin. I wish 'we could make it all transparent, but I’d rather have this law than not,' he concluded. The video that emerged today features Gruber and the University of Chicago's Harold Pollack discussing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion on behalf of the website healthinsurance.org in April of this year. At one point in the conversation Pollack states that there's 'a politics of impunity towards poor people, particularly non-white poor people... it’s almost a feature rather than a bug in the internal politics in some of these states, not to cover people under Medicaid even if it’s financially very advantageous to do so.' Pollack goes on to say that it's an 'important principle to defeat' politically 'because it’s such a toxic political perspective.' 'It has to be shown that that approach to politics doesn’t work, because otherwise we will really be stuck with some very unjust policies that will be pursued with complete impunity in some of these places,' he said. To which Gruber replied, 'You know, that’s a great way to put it: There’s larger principles at stake here, when these states are not just turning down covering the poor people, but turning down the federal stimulus that would come with that. 'They’re not just not interested in covering poor people, they’re willing to sacrifice billions of dollars in injections into their economy in order to punish poor people. I mean, it really is just almost awesome in its evilness. And I agree, you have to recognize there’s larger principles at stake here.' Left unsaid in the discussion was that the states that rejected the Medicaid expansion and the federal dollars that came with it in the short term were steered in that direction by Republicans in the state legislature or in the governor's mansion. At a press conference during the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, last weekend President Barack Obama put as much distance between himself and Gruber as possible, arguing that the Obamacare consultant was never on staff at the White House. The White House has already addressed Gruber's other defamatory statements, with Obama spokesman Josh Earnest saying last week that he 'vigorously' disagrees with the 'stupidity' claim. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Sunday morning on Twitter that Gruber is the one who's stupid. 'As one who worked hard to make ACA and its benefits clear, let me say: if you looked up \\"stupid\\" in dictionary, you'd find Gruber's picture,' he wrote. And at a press conference this weekend in Brisbane, Australia, over the weekend, Obama made it clear to reporters that Gruber does not speak for his administration. 'The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run,' Obama said. 'I would just advise every press outlet here: Pull up every clip and every story. I think it’s fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent,' Obama said. 'It was a tough debate.' While it is true that Gruber, who claims he 'helped write' Obamacare, never served on the White House staff, records show that the Health and Human Services Department paid him 392,600 consulting fees during the time the Affordable Care Act was being drawn up. The economics professor's 'Gruber Microsimulation Model' aided the White House with estimations of how different aspects of the plan would be scored by CBO and whether it would consider affiliated costs taxes. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also tried to disassociate herself from the Obamacare consultant last week by claiming to not even 'know who he is.' In the next breath she claimed that, 'he didn't help write our bill.' That directly contradicts a 2011 claim from Gruber that 'helped design the reform' as well as 'implement' it. Likewise, he said he 'was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well.' A March 2012 New York Times article also credits him with that work. 'After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation,' the article says. After video surfaced of Pelosi citing Gruber at a Nov. 5, 2009 press conference her office was forced to back track slightly, telling the Washington Post that she 'meant that she didn't know Gruber personally.' 'She said she doesn’t \\"know who he is,\\" not that she’s \\"never heard of him,\\" ' Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said. Facet-checking website Politifact rated her claim as false however, pointing to the press conference incident as evidence that she did in fact know who Gruber was before the unflattering videos became national news. 'Even if the latter is true, that’s not what she said at the press conference, so we rate her claim False,' it said in a piece dissecting her statements.

PUBLISHED:. 18:02 EST, 30 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 18:29 EST, 30 October 2013. A long-lost Orson Welles film has finally had its U.S. premiere some 75 years after the unfinished silent movie was produced by the cinema genius. Too Much Johnson, which pre-dates his masterpiece debut Orson Welles, was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse and had its first ever American screening in Rochester, New York on October 16. The. film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette. play and stars Joseph Cotten - who was to collaborate with Welles again. in the 1941 Citizen Kane and again in 1949's The Third Man. The play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped. Scroll down for video. Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made. Welles died in 1985 and believed that the only remaining copy of the film had burned up in a 1970 fire that had destroyed his home in Spain. The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film. The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film. Italian film archivists announced in August that a copy of 'Too Much Johnson originally believed destroyed in a fire had been found in a box by a shipping company in Pordenone, a northeastern Italian city that's home to the Le Giornate del Cinema Muto silent film festival where the film had it global premier earlier this month. The film was turned over to a local film society, but the find seemed of no particular value and was left unopened for many years. Circo Giorgini, an Italian expert on Welles, identified the film about three years ago. The only remaining copy was believed to have been burned up in a 1970 fire that destroyed Welles' home in Madrid, Spain. Welles died in 1985. How the film arrived in Pordenone remains a mystery. The film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette play, but the play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped. Film accompaniment: Orson Welles wanted his 40-minute, three-act film to be prologues for the three acts of a William Gillette play he was putting on at the Mercury Theater. 'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time,' said Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project. 'Holding in one's hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that's just impossible to describe.' Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made. Too Much Johnson, filmed in 1938, has nowhere near the complexity of Kane or the tense thrills of The Third Man but offers a never-before-seen glimpse at the skills of one of cinema's greats. It had never been shown in public and. was at one time lost to Welles himself, who expressed his shock at. finding a copy in storage at his home near Madrid, Spain. It. was this copy of the film, which most experts agreed was the only copy,. that was destroyed in a fire at Welles's home in the 1970s. The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute introductions for the second and third act. But a virtually pristine print was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse, and has now been restored by George Eastman House. The film was not intended to stand by. itself, but was designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury. Theater stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy. The play follows the fortunes of a New. York playboy who flees from the violent husband of his mistress and. borrows the identity of a plantation owner in Cuba - who is expecting the. arrival of a mail-order bride. The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with. 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute. introductions for the second and third act. Welles wanted it to be a. silent film in the tradition of the Mack Sennett slapstick comedies, in. order to enhance the various chases, duels and comic conflicts of the. Gillette play. In addition - and typical of Welles's innovation - live music and live sound effects would be synchronized with the footage to provide a 'surround sound' effect for the audience. But the film was never fully. finished. It was anticipated that the play would be a flop and Welles. let the film project die a natural death, putting the footage in. storage. He recalled in a. later interview that he was surprised to find a copy at his home,. saying: 'I can't remember whether I had it all along and dug it out of. the bottom of a trunk, or whether someone brought it to me, but there it. was. Long-time collaboration: The unseen film stars Joseph Cotten - seen here with Welles in 1949's The Third Man. Welles himself said Cotten's performance was amazing, but nonetheless did not want the film shown publicly. Masterpiece: Citizen Kane - the 1941 film written, directed by and starring Orson Welles - is widely regarded as the best film ever made. 'I screened it, and it was in perfect. condition, with not a scratch on it, as though it had only been through. a projector once or twice before. It had a fine quality. 'Cotten was magnificent, and I immediately made plans to edit it and send it to Joe as a birthday present.'. But Welles never allowed the footage to be seen publicly, stating the film would not make sense outside of the full context of the Gillette play. The recent copy was found in a warehouse by the staff of Pordenone arthouse Cinemazero. Other Mercury Theater actors that appear in the film include Eustace Wyatt, Edgar Barrier, Ruth Ford, Arlene Francis, Mary Wickes, Welles himself and his wife Virginia Nicholson. The play opened without the film on August 16, 1938 - and flopped. The unfinished nitrate work print was given by Cinemazero to Italian film archive Cineteca del Friuli, which transferred it to George Eastman House to be preserved with a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation. Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project for George Eastman House, said: 'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time. Holding in one’s hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that’s just impossible to describe.' Despite the fact that it pre-dates Citizen Kane, even Too Much Johnson is not Welles's directorial debut. In 1934, while still attending The Todd School for. Boys, he co-directed (with friend William Vance) a short avant garde. film called The Hearts Of Age.

The helicopter pilot (Huey Lewis - yes THAT Huey Lewis!) tells him they've been ferrying all kinds of scientists to this location.Onboard a naval ship, Norman sees astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schriber) and biochemist Dr. Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), but is unable to talk to them. The ship's captain, Harold Barnes (Peter Coyote) briefs them - the plane crash is a spacecraft, a huge ship buried under 300 years of coral. In addition to Beth, Norman and Ted, mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson) is also on the contact team, which was recommended by Norman many years ago.The team goes through a medical examination, and a dive briefing by an instructor (James Pickens Jr.), who tells them there is \\"no quick return to the surface\\". The team takes a sub to the crash site habitat, and they all begin to exhibit signs of nervousness. It's clear that Norman and Beth have some history.

Summarize this article: (CNN) For Agness Jonathan, every day is a gamble with her children's lives.      Simple questions like whether they should go to school carry an unimaginable risk of death and dismemberment to satisfy a barbaric demand.      This is because her daughters are living with albinism, a genetic condition resulting in little or no pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. And this makes them a target.      Living in fear      It is children like Agness' who, according to a newly released Amnesty International report , are being hunted like animals in Malawi where their bones are sold in the belief the body parts bring wealth, happiness and good luck.      The report chronicles the day-to-day lives of those living with the condition, and details the extent of a recent surge in killings of albinos living in the landlocked country in southern Africa.      The bloodiest month was April this year, when Amnesty says four people were murdered, including a baby.      One of the victims was 17-year-old Davis Fletcher Machinjiri, who left his home to watch a soccer game with a friend, but never returned.      The Malawian police say he was abducted by \\"about four men who trafficked him to Mozambique and killed him.\\" Describing his gruesome death, they say \\"the men chopped off both his arms and legs and removed bones. They then buried the rest of his body in a shallow grave.\\"      Selling body parts      JUST WATCHED Albino teen attacked for her body parts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Albino teen attacked for her body parts 02:57      Since 2014 at least 18 albinos have been killed, another five have been abducted and are still missing.      And if it weren't for alert locals, Agness' youngest daughter Chakuputsa would be one of them.      She was grabbed by three men while her mother was out working the fields. Agness describes how villagers chased after the men who eventually dumped the child in the bushes nearby. It turned out one of the attackers was a relative, someone, Agness tells Amnesty, she had considered like a brother. This, the community says, is all too common.      Attackers are known to sell body parts to witchdoctors in Malawi and neighboring Mozambique, hoping to make quick money.      Amnesty says \\"thousands of people with albinism are at severe risk of abduction and killing by individuals and criminal gangs,\\" while the United Nations warns that Malawi's albinos are at risk of \\"total extinction.\\"      Grace Mazzah, a board member of the Association of People with Albinism in Malawi, is always aware of the price on her head.      \\"It really raises fear,\\" she says. \\"Why should people hunt me like they're hunting for animals to eat?\\" ||||| They are taunted, hunted and mutilated.      Over the past two years, at least 65 people with albinism have been attacked in Malawi - sometimes mutilated and dismembered alive by machete-wielding assailants.      Amnesty International has documented what it calls \\"ritual killings\\" of people with albinism in Malawi. And on Tuesday, a Malawi newspaper said that \\"two days cannot pass without hearing on the local media cases of people with albinism being killed\\". Last week, a local activist told Al Jazeera that the situation is \\"a crisis\\".      Albinism, a congenital disorder where people lack pigment in their skin, hair and eyes, affects about one in every 20,000 people. It is more common, however, in sub-Saharan Africa. There are an estimated 10,000 people with albinism in Malawi - a country of 16.5 million people.            There have also been a number of attacks reported on people with albinism in Tanzania, Kenya and Burundi so far this year.      Some in southern and eastern Africa believe that body parts belonging to people with albinism have magical powers, leading to them allegedly being sold on a black market run by criminal gangs across southern and central African countries.      Last month, Ikponwosa Ero, a United Nations independent expert on human rights and albinism, said the community faced \\"systematic extinction\\". But, she says, this can be stopped.      Al Jazeera: You recently said people with albinism in Malawi face systematic extinction.            Ikponwosa Ero: I said that this will happen over time if nothing is done. The situation is a potent mix of poverty, witchcraft beliefs and market forces which push people to do things for profit.      This is all happening in a context of long-term neglect of these people. There is a lack of understanding about people with albinism, not only in developing countries but also in developed nations. You find the albino trope used in movies where they are presented as supernatural beings or strange creatures or as idiotic.      So when they bring in this lack of knowledge in the context of poverty, witchcraft beliefs and economic factors, you get a dangerous combination. This is what has led to this current situation.            Al Jazeera: There seems to be a lot of money in this business.            Ero: I say there is allegedly a lot of money in this business. And I say allegedly because people keep on repeating the idea that there is a lot of money in this, and it would seem that the media is part of the reason some people have gotten involved.      People are like, \\"The media are reporting that body parts bring a lot of money, so it must be true\\", but it is allegedly. It could have some market value, which could explain why the attacks are happening. But then some countries have witnessed a reduction in the number of attacks, maybe because people are realising there is no value.      There is a set of perplexing themes going on here. And this is why I say an in-depth study is really needed. But that being said, there are other indicators that seem to aggravate the attacks.            Last year, for example, was an election year for many countries in the region and the attacks went up overall. This fed into the suspicion that powerful people are behind these attacks. The logic goes that powerful people go to witch doctors to win elections and to make money in their business.      And witch doctors [might] say, \\"To get that, you need to do magic, have powerful potions with rare species of people or rare animals\\". This is how people with albinism become a target. So it's possible. I don't have concrete evidence, but given what happened last year, powerful people are involved, at least indirectly.      We need to do more to get to the bottom of this.            Al Jazeera: You have travelled across Malawi to meet people with albinism. How have the threats they face affected their ability to lead a normal life?            Ero: What really struck me was how much fear they have. I guess you could imagine it but I saw it on their faces and heard it as they talked. I felt it myself. I felt scared being in the village and I couldn't wait to get back to my vehicle. I sensed the fear. And people should not be living like this. It is completely wrong.      People said they did not know who to trust. People with albinism usually do well if their family look after or protect them. But when your protectors turn against you, or could turn against you, the fear goes to another level.      Watching that play out was frightening. One lady told me about her son whose body was dug out from his grave 10 to 15 years after he was buried. It meant that someone close to the family knows that a person with albinism was buried there. How else would you find out?      Another woman, who gave birth to a girl with albinism, has her sister harassing her and asking \\"Why did you have this baby?\\"            Another man I met had survived an attack but has completely lost his mental balance. He can barely speak.            There are others who say that having children with albinism means they cannot go to the farm because they have to protect them. As a result, they are struggling with even more poverty.            The extent of the fear is high and the scope is very wide.      Al Jazeera: We are talking about witch doctors, magical potions and mutilations in the context of the African continent, but how do we discuss these issues without raising other tropes about Africa?            Ero: As the media, it's important to report on the issues, but its also important to try to humanise the story. Some journalists do that, but a lot of them do not, unfortunately. For instance, it's important to move away from the word \\"albino\\" to describe the community. Rather, it should be \\"people with albinism\\" because it puts the person before the condition, instead of equating them with it. They are not albinos, they are people. It's more humanising, like moving from \\"disabled\\" to \\"people with disabilities\\". So language is a key advocacy tool.      It is also important to consider the facts. For instance, albinism exists in every race, every part of the world and in every gender. The frequency of occurrence varies: In the developed world, it's one in 17,000. In some places in Africa, it is one in 5,000, and in other places it is higher, like one in 1,000. Among aboriginal groups, in Panama or the south Pacific, it can be one in 70.            When reporters say that body parts are sold, it is important to say \\"allegedly sold\\". There is no proof of this yet.            Also, showcasing successful people with albinism will go a long way.      AFRICA INVESTIGATES: The trade in body parts of people with albinism                  Al Jazeera: What is required for this issue to be taken seriously?            Ero: This issue may be seen as another problem from the region, but the main difference is that this can be solved. We can focus resources and energy and elevate the issue for just a couple of years and the difference will be massive.      Look at Kenya and Tanzania. They focused energies and there have been massive improvements. I think this is one of the human rights issues that is possible in a short to medium term. Not all the countries in the region are poor. It's a case of shifting priorities to make sure this issue gets the attention it needs.      In countries like Malawi, currently struggling with an economic crisis, food crisis and drought, international aid should come forward to help.      In Kenya, it was the government that took charge. In Tanzania, the people who took over were the aid agencies. The success in these countries illustrates how government and civil society can change this.

Process: - Sunlight shines on plants - Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy - Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stoma - Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves - Plants absorb minerals through their roots - Plants convert these inputs into sugars - Sugars can be used as energy sources - Oxygen and water are also produced - Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant.  Question: suppose more conversion into sugars happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If more conversion into sugars happens, there will be an increase in the production of sugar and oxygen in the plants. The perturbation of increased sugar conversion would have a direct impact on the creation of these energy sources and by-products. When plants receive more sunlight or have higher chlorophyll levels, there is an increased efficiency in the photosynthesis process. As a result, plants can capture more light energy and convert it into chemical energy, primarily in the form of sugars such as glucose. These sugars are then used by plants for growth, reproduction, and other essential functions. More conversion into sugars also means that more carbon dioxide will be absorbed by the plants during the process of photosynthesis since carbon dioxide is a vital input in the production of sugars. Consequently, the increased intake of carbon dioxide will lead to a higher rate of sugar production, and in turn, an increased rate of oxygen being produced as a by-product. The relationship between the production of sugar and the release of oxygen is directly proportional. In simple terms, if more sugar is being produced, then more oxygen will be generated as a result of the increased photosynthesis activity. This occurs because oxygen is released as a by-product when water molecules are split within the plant cells during the process of photosynthesis. So, in conclusion, if there is more conversion into sugars, it will have a positive effect on the production of both sugar and oxygen in plants. The increased sugar and oxygen production can then lead to improved plant growth, better resistance to environmental stresses, and enhanced overall ecosystem productivity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - The Krupp family (see pronunciation), a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen, have become famous for their production of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments. The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities.  - A railway gun, also called a railroad gun, is a large artillery piece, often surplus naval artillery, mounted on, transported by, and fired from a specially designed railway wagon. Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known are the large Krupp-built pieces used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The 38 cm Siegfried K ( E ) ( K - Kanone ( cannon ) , E - in Eisenbahnlafette ( on railroad mounting ) ) was a German World War II railway gun based on the 38 cm SK C / 34 naval gun that served as the main armament of the Bismarck - class battleships . Only four were produced .  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: His career spanned six decades; in that time he produced more than 700 records, wrote film scores and worked with music's greatest talents. His technical knowledge and love of experimentation saw him produce incredible sounds from equipment that modern musicians would consider primitive. His greatest success came with the Beatles; from the loveable mop-top recordings of the early 1960s to the acid-drenched psychedelia of Sergeant Pepper. George Henry Martin was born on 3 January 1926 into a working-class family in north London. His parents, a carpenter and a cleaner, wanted \\"a safe civil servant's job\\" for their son. He won a scholarship to St Ignatius' College in Stamford Hill, but when war broke out his parents moved out of London and he went to Bromley Grammar School. His passion for music really began when The London Symphony Orchestra, under Sir Adrian Boult, arrived to play a concert in the school hall. \\"It was absolutely magical. Hearing such glorious sounds, I found it difficult to connect them with 90 men and women blowing into brass and wooden instruments or scraping away at strings with horsehair bows. I could not believe my ears.\\" He harboured secret ambitions to be a composer but, in the event, took a job as a quantity surveyor before joining the Fleet Air Arm in 1943 where he qualified as a pilot. By 1947 Martin was playing the oboe professionally and had been accepted to study at the Guildhall School of Music, despite being unable to read or write a note. After graduation he spent a brief spell at the BBC's classical music department before walking through the doors of EMI in Abbey Road as a record producer. He took to the mixing desk like \\"a duck to water\\". Five years later, at the age of 29, as head of the Parlophone label, he worked with artists such as Shirley Bassey, Matt Monro and the jazz bands of Johnny Dankworth and Humphrey Lyttelton. Martin also produced catchy, comic numbers, and enjoyed such successes as Right Said Fred with Bernard Cribbins and Goodness Gracious Me with Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren. In 1962, Brian Epstein introduced him to four Liverpudlians. They had been rejected by every major record label in the country and Martin himself was more impressed by their strong personalities and natural wit than by their music. \\"They were raucous,\\" he later remembered. \\"Not very in tune. They weren't very good.\\" Nevertheless, he signed the Beatles and Love Me Do became their first hit later in 1962. Thus began the most successful recording studio partnership of all time. For the next eight years, Martin guided the Fab Four from the frothy pop sound of I Want To Hold Your Hand to the ambitious experimentation of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road. It was a steep learning curve for both producer and musicians. Martin had very little experience of pop music and the band had no idea how a recording studio worked. Martin's main talent lay in his ability to translate the adventurous ideas of Lennon and McCartney into practical recording terms. While McCartney could express his requirements, Lennon was often more vague. If he was searching for what he called \\"an orange sound\\", it became Martin's task to find it. But it all worked. In a 1975 interview with the BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test, John Lennon said that it was a true partnership. \\"Some people say George Martin did all of it, some say The Beatles did everything. It was neither one. We did a lot of learning together.\\" Martin's classical training became ever more valuable as the Beatles continued to push the boundaries of their music. He wrote and conducted the strings on Eleanor Rigby and the eclectic backing to I Am The Walrus. All this was being achieved on what would now be considered basic recording equipment, which would be pushed to the limit for the recording of the Sgt Pepper album. At the time, EMI had only four-track tape machines so Martin, and his engineers, devised a technique whereby a number of tracks were recorded and then mixed down on to one single track, giving the flexibility of a modern multi-tracked studio. He also made much use of recording different tracks at various tape speeds to change the texture of the final sound, a technique used to good effect on Lucy in the Sky. The harmony between band and producer suffered one of its rare hiccups when George Martin was temporarily unavailable and McCartney brought in another producer to arrange the strings on She's Leaving Home. By the time The White Album came to be recorded, Martin was working with a number of different artists and The Beatles produced many of the tracks themselves. Following the 1970 break-up of The Beatles, Martin worked with artists such as Sting, Jose Carreras, Celine Dion and Stan Getz, as well as Lennon and McCartney on their solo projects. By then he had set up his own company, AIR studios, which enabled him, for the very first time, to be able to receive royalties for his work. In the late 1970s, Martin built a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, and artists including Dire Straits and The Rolling Stones travelled there to record albums under Martin's respected guidance. When Hurricane Hugo devastated both island and studio in 1989, Martin produced a benefit album to help raise funds for the victims. Martin received a knighthood in 1996, and a year later, Elton John asked him to produce the reworking of his song Candle in the Wind for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. He persuaded the singer just to sit down in the studio and record it exactly as he had played it in Westminster Abbey. The resulting single was Martin's 30th number one record, the highest of any musical producer. He retired two years later after producing what he decreed would be his final album, In My Life, a collection of Beatles songs, rearranged and recorded by a collection of singers, film actors and musicians. However, he was not able to completely relax. In 2002 he was part of the team which put together the Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace and in 2006 he supervised the remixing of 80 Beatles tracks for use by Cirque de Soleil in a Las Vegas stage show called Love. In his career, George Martin worked with some of the best-known names in popular music - ranging from Jeff Beck, through Ultravox to the Mahavishnu Orchestra. But his enduring legacy will be his work with The Beatles whose timeless sounds, as acknowledged by the band members themselves, owe much to his input as a musician, arranger and producer.","output":"George Martin was a very talented man who worked with music for a long time - 60 years! He made over 700 records and worked with some of the best musicians ever. He was really good at making music sound amazing, even with old equipment. George's biggest success was with a band called the Beatles. They made lots of famous songs together and he helped them become even better. George was born in 1926 in London, and his family was not rich. He loved music ever since he heard a big orchestra play when he was young. He learned to play the oboe, went to a music school, and then worked at a big music company. He helped make songs for lots of famous people and funny songs too! In 1962, George met the Beatles and decided to work with them even though they weren't very good at first. They all learned from each other and became great together. They made many, many famous songs and albums like \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" After the Beatles ended, George kept making music with other people like Sting, Elton John, and Celine Dion. He even helped with a big concert for the Queen's special day. George Martin will always be remembered for his amazing work with music and especially with the Beatles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Question: \\"An arbalist is a soldier that utilzes what kind of weapon?\\"  Context: \\"On July 16, 1989, the Popular Front of Azerbaijan held its first congress and elected Abulfaz Elchibey, who would become President, as its Chairman. On August 19, 600,000 protesters jammed Baku’s Lenin Square (now Azadliq Square) to demand the release of political prisoners. In the second half of 1989, weapons were handed out in Nagorno-Karabakh. When Karabakhis got hold of small arms to replace hunting rifles and crossbows, casualties began to mount; bridges were blown up, roads were blockaded, and hostages were taken.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"An arbalist is a type of soldier who specializes in using a crossbow as their primary weapon. The crossbow is a historical ranged weapon that utilizes an elastic launching device, consisting of a bow-like assembly mounted horizontally on a stock. It operates by pulling back the string of the bow, placing a projectile called a bolt or quarrel in the groove, and releasing the string to launch the projectile. The mention of arbalists in the context provided is significant, as it highlights the progression of the weaponry employed during the conflict surrounding the Nagorno-Karabakh region involving Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the late 1980s, tension between the two countries escalated, and the Popular Front of Azerbaijan was a political movement that sought for greater autonomy and independence from the Soviet Union. During that time, weapons were distributed among the local population in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Initially, the Karabakhis were only equipped with rudimentary weapons like hunting rifles and crossbows. However, as the conflict intensified, they began to obtain and utilize more advanced small arms. As a result, the levels of violence and casualties increased, leading to the destruction of infrastructure and hostage-taking incidents. The arbalist's valuable role in warfare predates this conflict by several centuries, with the crossbow playing a crucial role throughout the Middle Ages all the way up to the Early Modern period. The effectiveness of this weapon derives from its ability to launch projectiles with significant force and accuracy over long distances, which made it a fearsome and sought-after weapon during battles and sieges. In the Nagorno-Karabakh context, the arbalists and crossbowmen would have offered an effective method of engaging enemies from a distance before the introduction of more sophisticated firearms. Although crossbows eventually became outdated due to advancements in gunpowder technology, their early use in the conflict demonstrated the diverse range of arms employed to defend territories and uphold the interests of the local populace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We use: אנו משתמשים - The subject \\"we\\" was translated to אנו and the verb \\"use\\" was translated as משתמשים. 2. Over five billion tons: בלמעלה מחמישה ביליון טון - The phrase \\"over\\" was translated as בלמעלה מ, \\"five\\" as חמישה, \\"billion\\" as ביליון and \\"tons\\" as טון. 3. Of coal: פחם - The noun \\"coal\\" was directly translated as פחם. 4. 30 billion-plus barrels of oil: 30 ביליון ויותר חביות שמן - \\"30 billion\\" was translated as 30 ביליון, \\"plus\\" as ויותר, \\"barrels\\" as חביות, and \\"oil\\" as שמן. 5.

And do they masturbate? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from: - no; - yes;","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question is asking whether an underage teenager watching porn involving underage teenagers would be considered a pedophile. Legally, production, distribution, and possession of underage pornography is illegal regardless of the viewer's age. The term \\"pedophile\\" is often used to describe an adult who is sexually attracted to children. In this specific context, if the underage teen is attracted to individuals around their age range, it may not be accurate to label them as a pedophile. However, it is crucial to understand that underage pornography is illegal and should not be watched or shared by anyone. The second part of the first question concerns the sexual behaviors of teen girls. It's important to remember that people's experiences and behaviors are diverse, and making generalized statements about a whole cross-section of the population can be misleading. That being said, some teen girls do watch pornographic material and may masturbate. It's essential to recognize that sexuality is a natural part of human development, and teenagers need age-appropriate resources and education to help them navigate their burgeoning sexual identities in a healthy way. The second question is essentially asking if the behaviors mentioned in the first question are standard or typical for teenage girls. While it acknowledges that some teenagers watch pornographic material, it does not focus solely on underage porn as the first question does. It also mentions masturbation, which is a separate aspect of sexual exploration not explicitly discussed in the first question.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Where does the young model begin a relationship with a literary interviewer?  Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently. Already showing signs of stress from constantly maintaining the carefree look demanded by the false, empty lifestyle to which she has become a prisoner, Diana becomes pregnant, and has an abortion.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Stephen Gregory Yzerman (; born May 9, 1965) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player who spent his entire NHL playing career with the Detroit Red Wings and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is currently the general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2017, Yzerman was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. Following the departure of Red Wings captain Danny Gare after the 1985-86 season, then-Head Coach Jacques Demers named Yzerman captain of the team on October 7, 1986, making him the youngest captain in the team's history. Demers said he \\"wanted a guy with the Red Wings crest tattooed on his chest.\\" The next season, Yzerman led the Wings to their first division title in 23 years.  During the 1988-89 season, Yzerman recorded 155 points (65 goals and 90 assists), finishing third in regular season scoring behind Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky and also winning the Lester B. Pearson Award (MVP as voted by the National Hockey League Players' Association), and was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP as voted by the NHL writers).  When Scotty Bowman took over as coach in 1993, Yzerman initially chafed under Bowman's stern coaching style. Bowman, for his part, felt that Yzerman was not concentrating enough on defence; Bowman had long expected his forwards to be good back-checkers as well. Relations between the two became so strained that at one point, the Red Wings seriously considered trading him to the then-moribund Ottawa Senators. Yzerman, however, gradually became a better defender and is now considered one of the best two-way forwards in the history of the game.  In 1995, Yzerman led Detroit to its first Stanley Cup finals series since 1966, but the Red Wings were swept by the New Jersey Devils. Before the start of the 1995-96 NHL season, Yzerman's leadership was called into question and soon he had to deal with rumours that he was to be traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Mathieu Schneider and a first-round draft pick, a deal that was publicized in Le Journal de Montreal as being pushed for hard by Yzerman's former coach Jacques Demers. Detroit finished the season with an NHL-record 62 regular season wins and were heavily favoured to win the Stanley Cup. Yzerman scored perhaps the most memorable goal of his career in the 1996 playoffs, stealing the puck from Wayne Gretzky and beating St. Louis Blues goaltender Jon Casey with a slap shot from the blue line to win the Western Conference Semifinals in double overtime of Game 7. The Red Wings, however, fell short of their ultimate goal, losing in six games to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals. Was he a Hockey captian?","output":"Yes, Stephen Gregory Yzerman was a hockey captain. Following the departure of Red Wings captain Danny Gare after the 1985-86 season, then-Head Coach Jacques Demers named Yzerman as the captain of the team on October 7, 1986. This appointment made him the youngest captain in the team's history. Demers mentioned that he \\"wanted a guy with the Red Wings crest tattooed on his chest.\\" Under Yzerman's leadership, the next season, the team secured their first division title in 23 years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: A beaver builds structures to block what sort of feature? Options:  A. books  B. zoo  C. body of water  D. wooded area  E. animals","output":"The answer to the question is C. body of water.  A beaver is an industrious, primarily nocturnal, and semi-aquatic rodent known for its remarkable ability to modify its environment by building structures like dams, lodges, and canals. The primary reason behind the beaver's construction of dams is to create a stable environment to allow for the creation of a pond or water body that the beaver will use for both its shelter and as a means of food procurement. Beavers build dams using materials like sticks, stones, mud, and other available natural resources. The purpose of building these structures is to control and manipulate the flow of water, enabling them to create a safe and comfortable habitat that is less likely to be penetrated by predators. These dam structures also serve various essential purposes for the ecosystem. First, they trap sediment and impurities, leading to improved water quality downstream. Second, beaver ponds provide habitats for a wide variety of plants and animals, promoting biodiversity and the overall health of the ecosystem. Third, the built ecosystems help to slow down the rate of water flow, playing a crucial role in flood control and maintaining the water table at a more stable level. In summary, beavers build structures like dams to block and control the flow of a body of water, ultimately utilizing the created pond to establish a safe and sustainable habitat that benefits both themselves and the surrounding ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He left advanced base camp, on the northern, Chinese side of the mountain, at 2 a.m. and reached the peak at 9 p.m. This was just five days after he set a fastest known time up the mountain from base camp, completing the journey in 26 hours.      Let’s start with this: Kilian Jornet is a freak of nature. Compare his ascent, which was made without the use of fixed ropes or supplemental oxygen, to that of climber Adrian Ballinger, who summited on the same day, also without oxygen. Ballinger is a talented mountaineer. This is his seventh summit of Everest and he has six other summits on 8,000-meter peaks. Ballinger left advanced base camp on May 24th and it took him three days to reach the summit. That’s not because he’s weak—he’s an extraordinarily strong climber. (It takes many climbers four days to make it to the summit.) That’s just to say that Jornet is absurdly gifted.      Jornet’s most recent attempt isn’t exactly an apples-to-apples comparison of his initial climb, which left from base camp rather than advanced base camp, a difference of 4,265 vertical feet. Even still, he just barely missed setting the fastest known time from advanced base camp to the summit, a record held by Hans Kammerlander, who did the route in 16 hours and 45 minutes in 1996. But that shouldn’t take away from the fact that Jornet just ran 8,000 vertical feet up the world’s highest mountain—a mountain on which it’s hard to breathe, period, for the last third of it—in less than a day. ||||| Trail running Refused supplemental oxygen      For the second time in a week, Kilian Jornet reached Mount Everest's summit, climbing all the way up from the advanced base camp, located at 6,500 metres of altitude in Tibet.      It took the Catalan climber only 17 hours to cover the distance after departing the camp on May 27.      Jornet, who refused to use supplemental oxygen and fixed ropes, overcame the strong winds and returned to the advanced base camp upon completion of the ascension, as announced by his 'Summits of my Life' team.      This second attempt had been put in doubt because Jornet had to deal with an untimely stomach ache, but the star climber still managed to conquer the challenge.      Austria's Christian Stangl holds the record for the fastest climb; 16 hours and 42 minutes to make it to the peak in 2016.      Italian mountaineer Hans Kammerlander needed three more minutes in 2006 using the North Face route. ||||| Kilian Jornet claims to have raced up the world’s highest mountain in 17 hours just five days after summiting in 26 hours      A Spanish climber and long-distance runner claims to have raced up Mount Everest twice in one week without using supplemental oxygen or fixed ropes, opening up what he calls “a new realm of possibilities in alpinism”.            Kilian Jornet, a 29-year-old mountaineer from Catalonia, says he reached the 8,848-metre (29,029ft) summit of the world’s highest mountain at 9pm local time on Saturday after a 17-hour ascent.      The time, which has yet to be officially confirmed, is just 15 minutes off the record set by the Italian climber Hans Kammerlander, who climbed Everest in 16 hours and 45 minutes in 1996.      Five days earlier, Jornet claimed to have scaled Everest in 26 hours. He had been planning to set a round-trip record but was forced to slow his pace after coming down with stomach cramps and vomiting.      In tweets and a blogpost on Sunday, Jornet said it was “cool to summit Everest twice in one season” without using oxygen.      “Today I felt good, although it was really windy so it was hard to move fast,” he said. “I think summiting Everest twice in one week without oxygen opens up a new realm of possibilities in alpinism and I’m really happy to have done it.”      According to his blog, Jornet left advanced based camp at 6,500 metres and ascended using the normal route, passing the three high-altitude camps used by climbers attempting to scale Everest.      “The climb to the summit was slow but continuous,” read a statement. “The wind was the main obstacle Jornet had to overcome, on an extremely windy Himalayan day. Weather conditions improved throughout the night in the latter part of the route and he returned to advanced base camp 29 hours 30 minutes after leaving.”      Agence France-Presse reported that the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which validates all Everest summits on the north side of the mountain, had yet to confirm Jornet’s feat.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which validates all summits on Everest’s north side, has yet to confirm Jornet’s feat. Photograph: Alamy      Ten people have died attempting to climb Everest this season. A record 509 permits have been issued to foreign climbers.      Jornet, who was accompanied on his Everest expedition by Sébastien Montaz-Rosset, a mountain guide and cameraman, is on a quest to set new records for the fastest ascents of some of the world’s best-known mountains.      His Summits of My Life project has already seen him scale Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn in Europe, Denali in North America and Aconcagua in South America.      Jornet, who describes himself as a “semi-nomadic” mountain lover, said he saw competing as a way to meet friends and better himself.      “But, above all, I conceive sport as a way to discover landscapes both inside and outside you,” he said on his website. “I love silence and solitude, but communication, listening, reading, writing and travelling also appeal to me … My life is spent pursuing and fighting for my dreams.”      In 1986 two Swiss climbers, Jean Troillet and Erhard Loretan, ascended and descended Everest in less than two days without oxygen and ropes. ||||| Kilian Jornet climbed in a single push the north face of Mount Everest (8.848m) for the second time in a week. For this he did not use oxygen nor fixed ropes. Jornet had already reached the summit on 22nd May but stomach cramps had prevented him from completing the route as planned. He said: “I’m so happy to have made the summit again! Today I felt good although it was really windy so it was hard to move fast. I think summiting Everest twice in one week without oxygen opens up a new realm of possibilities in alpinism and I’m really happy to have done it”      One week, two summits      Jornet reached the summit via the North Face of Everest on 27th May at 9pm (+5.45GMT). He left Advanced Base Camp at 6500m. He climbed to the summit on the ‘normal’ route passing the three high altitude camps used by climbers attempting the world’s highest mountain, a climb which takes on average four days.      The climb to the summit was slow but continuous. The wind was the main obstacle Jornet had to overcome, on an extremely windy Himalayan day. Weather conditions improved throughout the night in the latter part of the route and he returned to Advanced Base Camp 29 hours 30 minutes after leaving.      With this ascent Jornet repeats the feat of reaching the world’s highest point after having climbed to the summit six days previously. On the previous climb he reached the summit in 26 hours, leaving from Base Camp at Rongbuk monastery at 5100m. The climb had begun well but he was hampered by stomach problems from 7500m, which slowed him down considerably and forced him to make repeated stops. Returning to Base Camp Jornet explained that: I didn’t feel great and was moving very slowly. I had to stop every few metres with cramps and vomiting. But I felt ok with the altitude and decided to continue. When I got back down I thought I would like to try another attempt if I felt well enough.      The two ascents are part of the Summits of My Life project, in which Jornet has travelled to some of the most emblematic mountains across the globe setting records for fastest known ascents. He began in the Mont Blanc range in 2012 and has since climbed in Europe (Mont Blanc & Matterhorn), in North America (Denali) and in South America (Aconcagua).      Jornet has been accompanied on this Everest expedition by Sébastien Montaz-Rosset, mountain guide and cameraman.      Jornet is currently resting in Everest Base Camp before returning to Europe.      Accumulated route times      Everest Advanced Base Camp (6.500m)-Summit (8.848m): 17h      Summit (8.848m) – Everest Advanced Base Camp (6.500m): 28h30 ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Spanish ultra-runner and mountaineer Kilian Jornet has claimed to have climbed Mount Everest twice in a week without using supplemental oxygen or fixed ropes. Jornet said he reached the summit at 9 p.m. on May 27 after a 17-hour ascent, just five days after claiming to have scaled the mountain in 26 hours. If verified, Jornet's time on his second summit would have been just 15 minutes off the fastest-ever recorded ascent.

Several years later, a much older Meggie (Eliza Bennett) travels with her father Mo to visit an old book shop in Italy, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book, Inkheart. Shortly after finding one, Meggie comes across a marten with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger.

I put my face so close to the glass farm that I knocked it over. All the tunnels fell down. Although the ants remained alive after their earthquake, one by one began to die. I was scared as I watched them give up building their tunnels to carry the bodies to a corner the farm. My mother said that the ants were dying of sadness. They simply could not stand that their tunnels were gone. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Mom had hoped it would teach me about the natural world, but it taught me much more. Over the years, I came to realize the importance of teamwork. Working together, the ants were able to make an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently: Adversity  is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, we cannot give up when we are sad.

How to take care of a german shepherd  Make sure your german shepherd is getting proper nutrition.  Since german shepherds large, active dogs and are known to have hips that give out, it's important to make sure they have good nutrition throughout their lives. Make sure to buy healthy food that is not full of filler ingredients. Select from the following. (I). You can buy fresh vegetables, dairy products, and leafy greens at your local pet store, farm-supply store, or online. As humans, they require an occasional meal consisting of processed grains, cakes, rice, and beans. (II). Make sure your dog's fur is not wet and he has plenty of room for movement and play. German shepherds have two basic body functions: eating and walking. (III). For example, make sure you are feeding a quality food that contains animal protein and doesn't use corn for protein. You can feed your german shepherd dry or wet food, or a combination of both. (IV). Ensure your dog is drinking at least 6 ounces of water a day and is with its mother regularly. German shepherds need between 7.5-9 hours of sleep every night.","output":"Step 1: Choose high-quality dog food Go with option III: Select a high-quality dog food with animal protein as the primary ingredient, as it is vital for your German shepherd's overall health. Avoid foods that use corn for protein, as they may not provide adequate nourishment. You can feed your German shepherd a mix of dry and wet food to satisfy their dietary needs. Step 2: Ensure your dog gets proper exercise and playtime Choose option II: Since German shepherds are active dogs, it's essential to give them plenty of room for movement and play. Ensure their fur is dry to avoid any hygiene-related issues. Regular exercise is vital for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing potential problems, such as hip dysplasia. Step 3: Provide fresh water and an adequate sleeping schedule Incorporate aspects of option IV: Ensure your German shepherd has access to at least 6 ounces of fresh water daily to stay hydrated. While the requirement to be with its mother applies only to puppies, it's essential to provide a comfortable and safe environment for your dog. Make sure your German shepherd gets between 7.5-9 hours of sleep every night for proper rest and recovery. Step 4: Monitor health and provide occasional treats While option I suggests providing your German Shepherd with vegetables, dairy products, leafy greens, processed grains, cakes, rice, and beans, it is more suitable for humans. However, you may offer your German shepherd occasional healthy treats and vegetables like carrots or green beans, which can serve as low-calorie snacks.

You are presented with the question \\"what is plasma created with?\\" and the following answer choices:  - heat  - Urea  - Gases  - oxygen  - energy  - a star  - immune  - cells  Now knowing that heat can change the state of matter and plasma, the fourth state of matter, can be created on earth by supplying sufficient heat, choose the best answer.","output":"The best answer to the question \\"what is plasma created with?\\" is heat. Plasma, often referred to as the fourth state of matter, can be created with the application of sufficient heat to substances, particularly gases. This process involves providing enough thermal energy to a gas, which causes its atoms and molecules to become highly ionized, resulting in the formation of plasma. Plasma can be found in many places, both on Earth and in the universe. For instance, stars, including our Sun, are composed mostly of plasma, as the extreme temperatures and pressures within their cores cause the gases they are made up of to ionize and exhibit plasma-like properties. On Earth, plasma can be observed in phenomena such as lightning, neon signs, and fluorescent lights. Let's examine the other answer choices: 1. Urea: Urea is an organic compound and is the primary nitrogenous waste product excreted in the urine of mammals. Urea is not involved in the creation of plasma. 2. Gases: While gases can be transformed into plasma with sufficient heat, the term 'gases' itself does not encompass the process of creating plasma. Therefore, this answer is not the best choice. 3. Oxygen: Oxygen is a naturally occurring element and a necessary component for the process of cellular respiration. It is not directly involved in the creation of plasma, although, as a gas, it can transform into plasma under certain conditions such as extreme heat. 4. Energy: Though energy is a key requirement for transforming matter into plasma, the term 'energy' is quite broad and may not specifically represent the process of creating plasma. Therefore, this answer is not the best choice. 5. A star: Stars, as mentioned earlier, mainly consist of plasma; however, they are the result of plasma, not the actual cause or process behind creating plasma. 6. Immune: This term typically refers to the immune system, a bodily defense mechanism that protects organisms from harmful pathogens and diseases. It is not related to the creation of plasma. 7. Cells: Cells are the basic unit of life for living organisms and are not directly related to the creation of plasma. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"what is plasma created with?\\" is heat, as the application of substantial heat to substances, particularly gases, can ionize their atoms and molecules, resulting in plasma formation. This process demonstrates the powerful effect of heat on changing the state of matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Education is the foundation upon which individuals build their futures, opening doors to numerous opportunities and paving the way for success. It enables people to develop their potential, leading ultimately to greater social and economic prosperity. This article delves into the importance of education for children and how it shapes their futures in profound ways. The Role of Education in a Child's Life Education is crucial for instilling a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm for learning in children. Starting from an early age, a good education introduces a child to the world, allowing them to explore their interests, talents, and passions. By acquiring necessary skills such as reading, writing, and critical thinking, a child's ability to navigate through life is significantly improved. Education also plays a vital role in teaching children about cultural, social, and moral values, which help them interact with others and contribute positively to society. The Connection Between Education and Opportunity Quality education is synonymous with opportunity. With the right foundation, children can make informed decisions about their lives, enabling them to pursue their aspirations and goals. Furthermore, by ensuring access to a plethora of opportunities, education reduces the likelihood of life-altering obstacles that might otherwise limit a child's potential. For instance, educated individuals are more likely to secure higher-paying jobs and enjoy overall financial stability. This financial stability not only guarantees a better quality of life but also allows them to invest in their children's education, creating a positive cycle of success. Additionally, education plays a unique role in bolstering social mobility, giving children from disadvantaged backgrounds a chance to break free from the cycle of poverty. The Long-Term Effects on Society The benefits of a good education also extend to society at large. As children grow up to become skilled and knowledgeable adults, they contribute substantially to the development of their communities. An educated populace is more likely to engage in civic duties, fostering a healthy democracy and leading to greater social cohesion. Moreover, education is key to addressing various global challenges, including poverty, inequality, and climate change. By producing leaders who are well-equipped to find innovative solutions to these issues, education directly influences the course of our future. Ensuring Equal Access to Education Considering the profound impact education has on a child's life, it is crucial that all children, regardless of their background, have equal access to quality education. Unfortunately, disparities still exist, particularly in developing nations where poverty poses significant barriers to education. Investing in robust policies to protect and empower vulnerable and marginalized children, and promoting inclusivity in education, is of paramount importance. Furthermore, educational reforms are necessary to ensure the system meets the diverse needs of all children. Emphasizing skills-based learning, character development, and creativity can help nurture well-rounded individuals, enhancing the overall impact of education. Conclusion In conclusion, the transformative power of education is undeniable. By providing children with the necessary tools and opportunities to succeed in life, education ultimately shapes the course of their futures and the society they live in. As we strive to create a more equitable and sustainable world, ensuring that every child has access to quality education must remain a top priority. By doing so, we can create a bright future for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it.

The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence.

But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural.

Article: The big four gluten culprits are wheat, rye, barley, and triticale. Avoid these in all cases, whether you are only gluten-intolerant or have celiac.  Wheat to avoid includes kamut and spelt. Because wheat often goes by another name, here are varieties of wheat to also definitely avoid:  Bulgur Durum flour Farina Graham flour Kamut Semolina   Rye contains a protein called secalin, which is a form of gluten.  Triticale, a cross between rye and wheat, is actually a hybrid designed in laboratories in the late 19th century.  Barley is the last big gluten cereal to avoid. It is commonly made into meals and used in alcohol production, among others. White oats themselves do not contain gluten, they are often cross-contaminated with wheat because both are commonly processed in the same facilities. Avoid eating oats and oatmeal unless the packaging specifically designates the product as gluten-free. In theory, the distillation process removes all gluten proteins if done properly, even if the alcohol was manufactured using a glutinous grain (such as wheat, barley, or rye).  You can safely drink alcohols such as vodka manufactured from wheat, but be wary of beer. Look for beer that is specifically designated gluten-free. In theory, the distillation process removes all glutinous proteins. But in reality, cross-contamination may occur. Not only this, but some distillers may add mash to alcohols after distillation as a filler. This may cast doubt on alcohol's ability to deliver truly safe results. If you really want to be careful, stick with potato-based vodkas, tequilas and mescals, or rums. These all contain non-gluten grain sources, so they should be fine to drink.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who returned to Australia in 1917? ?  Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

Praxis Answer:","output":"Title: Praxis: The Final Strike Genre: Sci-Fi/Action Plot: In the year 2293, deep within Klingon territories, tension brews as the valuable energy-producing moon Praxis falls into a critical state. As tales of natural disasters on the moon increase, the Klingon High Council desperately seeks a way to stabilize Praxis and preserve their most significant source of dilithium, a mineral crucial to all spacefaring civilizations. Dr. Toral, a renowned Klingon scientist, who believes that drilling into the moon's core will save it, receives constant pushback. His daughter, K'Lara, desperate to save her people, decides to gather a team of specialists from both the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets, led by Captain James T. Kirk. The powerful alliance between Klingon and human characters marks a unique break in age-old hostilities, in the name of survival. In their dangerous journey to the unstable moon, the team faces multiple challenges, including hostile Klingon factions who see this collaboration as defiance: a challenge to their way of life. The crew must fend off these threats while racing against the clock to save Praxis from collapsing. As they drill into the core, they make an unexpected discovery: the energy fluctuations in Praxis's core aren't natural. Instead, they are man-made, orchestrated by a rogue faction of Romulans seeking to destabilize the balance of power in the galaxy. As the energy fluctuations continue, the moon's inevitable explosion draws near with little time to spare. In a climactic battle, Kirk and K'Lara's team face off against the cunning Romulan threat, who were using the moon as a weapon to trigger a war between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets. The team defeats the Romulans and uses the knowledge and technology of both the Klingons and the Federation to devise a desperate plan to stabilize Praxis's core. Their efforts succeed, albeit at great personal cost, as several crew members heroically sacrifice themselves to save millions. In the aftermath, the universe slowly begins to heal from the brink of annihilation. K'Lara earns distinction in the Klingon Empire, and her father's reputation is vindicated. With Praxis saved, dedicated to those who died in the struggle for peace, the Federation and the Klingon Empire forge a new, tentative alliance, honoring the brave individuals that laid the foundation for a potential future of unity and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images)      Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey started a social media firestorm and then apologized after he tweeted that he ordered food from Chick-fil-A.      Critics jumped on Dorsey for supporting Chick-fil-A during the month of June, which is Pride Month for the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning) community.      Chick-fil-A came under fire from gay rights supporters in 2012 because of comments made by the fast food chicken chain’s CEO, Dan Cathay, expressing opposition to same-sex marriage. The company had also donated millions to anti-gay groups.      The controversy spurred angry protests at stores by activists as well as supporters who came to rally behind the the company.      Dorsey's tweet reignited the debate. The backlash included comments like:      “Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth”      “Wow, I thought better of you @jack Way to support a homophobic company during Pride month.”      “Did your meal come with a side-order of homophonic bigotry or did you pay extra for it?”      FACES OF PRIDE: Memebers of the LGBTQ community and their allies sound off from all 50 states      Dorsey acknowledged the situation after former CNN host Soledad O’Brien tweeted :\\"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\\"      Dorsey responded in a tweet: “You’re right.

The LGBTQ community is free to make equally tasty and “hate-free” chicken.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is getting a very public reminding that Chick-fil-A is not an LGBT-supportive company — though he’s far from the only one who has forgotten.      If the crowds at your local Chick-fil-A are any indication, much of the United States, even in progressive cities and on college campuses, has forgotten that management of the restaurant chain is opposed to marriage equality and has kept right on giving money to anti-LGBT causes.      Dorsey forgot that when he posted this tweet:      The reaction was quick:      This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack https://t.co/Wmhq6Obrp1 — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) June 10, 2018      Dorsey issued his regrets:      You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018      Dorsey is far from the first to forget about that background.      None other than BuzzFeed posted a fawning story in October headlined \\"15 Facts About Chick-fil-A That'll Make You Say, 'Woah, That's Crazy,” and it never mentioned its anti-LGBT history. The piece just talked about how delicious everything tastes. Even Democrats have sometimes forgotten, as evidenced during a sit-in for gun control in 2016, when they ordered out for Chick-fil-A.      Aside from its record of questionable donations via its foundation, Chick-fil-A also scores a zero on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Although it has some vocal queer defenders, the company has taken no action that would show it welcomes LGBT customers — not a commercial, not a Pride proclamation, nothing.      Last year, ThinkProgress reported on Chick-fil-A’s most recent financial disclosures that showed it was still giving in 2015 to anti-LGBT causes. That’s two years after CEO Dan Cathy swore he would stop.      The mix of donations changed, with money going to less overtly anti-LGBT groups. But the theme remains. ThinkProgress noted 1 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which has a “sexual purity” policy that bans “homosexual acts.” Another 200,000 went to the Paul Anderson Youth Home, which teaches boys that abuse they faced as children “has produced all kinds of evil throughout the culture to include the explosion of homosexuality in the last century.” The Salvation Army got 130,000 — and yes, it’s still openly opposed to marriage equality.      The restaurant chain was recently in the news again because Scott Pruitt, the anti-LGBT head of the Environmental Protection Agency, tried (and failed) to win a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. He praised the company as a “franchise of faith.”      In other words, the right wing has not forgotten what Chick-fil-A stands for. Just the opposite.      Mike Huckabee once hosted a national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day in response to the backlash over its anti-LGBT donations. Now conservatives enjoy ordering Chick-fil-A just to show allegiance. They eat it so often that Sen. Lisa Murkowski once complained it was getting a little tedious to attend meetings.      With this latest incident, the use of Chick-fil-A as symbology for social conservatism continues. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio jumped into the Twitter debate to claim the left has gone too far with its dislike for Chick-fil-A.      This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatch — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 11, 2018      At least one famous Twitter user gets the sense that Republicans use Chick-fil-A as a political football. ||||| Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash after eating at Chick-fil-A.

One person tweeted: \\"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous.

Cathy set off a fury among gay-rights supporters in 2012 that led to nationwide protests after he told the Baptist Press that the company was \\"guilty as charged\\" for backing \\"the biblical definition of the family unit.\\"      Reports soon emerged detailing Chick-fil-A's many charitable donations to anti-LGBTQ organizations.      For months afterward, protesters rallied outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country and held \\"kiss-ins,\\" where same-sex couples kissed in front of onlookers and TV cameras covering the backlash.      Since then, Chick-fil-A has worked to shed its controversial image, and over time, protests against the chain have largely dissipated.      Given the backlash against Dorsey's Chick-fil-A meal, however, it seems the fast-food chain still has some work to do to move past Cathy's comments. ||||| Summary:","output":"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey faced a strong backlash and subsequent apology after tweeting about a meal he had purchased at fast-food chain Chick-fil-A during Pride Month, prompting critics to point out the restaurant's history of anti-LGBTQ actions.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information.

The Canary, determined to force Jimmy to marry her so she can join the social elite, threatens to reveal that Jimmy was embezzling from his father. She turns down the elder Spotswoode's bribe to leave Jimmy alone.

He is about to be released but Clouseau (Peter Sellers), who is now Chief Inspector and has arrived to speak on Dreyfus's behalf, comes to visit and his clumsiness and proneness to accidents drive Dreyfus insane again.Soon thereafter, Dreyfus escapes from the asylum, intent on killing Clouseau, who apparently had become a deranged good-cop-gone-bad. His first attempt involves planting a bomb under Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau destructively duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk), who is under orders to keep Clouseau alert by randomly attacking him. The bomb merely destroys Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau himself is unharmed, largely because Clouseau has been distracted by an inflatable costume and a telephone call. Cato ends up in the hospital.Using his knowledge of the underworld, Dreyfus frees Anthony Tournier (John Sullivan), a bank robber Clouseau had recently arrested, from prison. Other criminals with a grudge against Clouseau flock under their banner. His next step is to kidnap nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom.

A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age. Men often discover their affinity  to each other by the mutual love they have for a book just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both entertain for a third.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Floyd Mayweather Will Earn More Than 80 Million For Record Breaking Fight Showtime Networks announced Thursday that Saturday’s fight between Floyd Mayweather and Saul “Canelo” Alvarez, billed as “The One,” generated a record 150 million in pay-per-view revenue on 2.2 million buys. It breaks the record of 136 million for Mayweather’s 2007 fight against Oscar De La Hoya, but falls short of the 2.5 buys for that bout. “It shows the health of boxing and that it can deliver at the highest level,” says Richard Schaefer, CEO of Golden Boy which promoted both Mayweather fights. Showtime, owned by CBS CBS, is still counting PPV receipts from distributors and says “The One” has a shot at catching the 2007 De La Hoya fight in terms of total buys. The initial report had the 2007 fight at 2.15 million buys, but the total has grown over the years as more distributors reported sales of the event. Schaefer says money was still coming in last year for the 2007 fight. “It is the gift that keeps on giving,” he says. Mayweather received a record guaranteed purse of 41.5 million purse for the fight, and as co-promoter with Golden Boy, he will also reap the spoils of the PPV haul. Mayweather is set to earn more than 80 million from the fight based on the current PPV estimates, and his final take could approach 100 million if the ultimate PPV tally exceeds 2.5 million buys. The one night payday tops the previous record in boxing of 52 million that De La Hoya received for the 2007 Mayweather fight. The Canelo fight pushes Mayweather’s career earnings over the 350 million mark. And despite his free-spending ways and penchant for gambling, Mayweather showed that he has built up a sizable nest egg in a recent ESPN The Magazine story when he displayed his 123 million balance on a bank receipt. “This is everything we expected when Floyd made the move to CBS and Showtime. The best working with the best and record-breaking results,” says Leonard Ellerbe, head of Mayweather Promotions. Whether “The One” ultimately breaks the PPV buy record or not, it is a huge win for Showtime, which signed Mayweather to a blockbuster six-fight deal in February that will net the boxer more than 250 million. Showtime signed Mayweather to raise the profile of the network and help close the subscription gap with HBO. Mayweather’s first bout under the contract against Roberto Guerrero in May drew a disappointing PPV audience that Showtime announced was one million buys. But the Canelo fight generated an unprecedented amount of coverage and was breaking records long before the pay-per-view total was counted. “The One” set a record for largest gate for a boxing match at 20 million with the MGM Grand Arena selling out in less than 24 hours. It was also the largest closed circuit viewing audience for a bout with more than 26,000 tickets sold in Las Veagas at 100 a pop and more than 500 movie theaters showing the fight. Merchandise and sponsorships also hit record levels. Schaefer says the fight will exceed 200 million in total revenue when all revenue streams are counted. Speculation is swirling on Mayweather’s next opponent with Danny Garcia, Amir Khan and Adrian Broner the popular names. And then there is the ever elusive possibility of Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao finally squaring off. Floyd is expected to be back in the ring in May for the third bout of his six-fight Showtime deal. Ellerbe says they don’t know what is going to happen next and adds, “Floyd is going to take some time off and take a much deserved vacation.” He can certainly afford it.

Summary:","output":"Floyd Mayweather had a boxing match with Saul \\"Canelo\\" Alvarez that was watched by many people on TV. Because so many people watched, they made a lot of money - around 150 million! This was a new record, which means it hasn't happened before. Floyd was paid at least 80 million for this fight alone, which is a lot of money, even for a big-time boxer like him. This fight made more money than Floyd's fight in 2007 with Oscar De La Hoya. This shows that boxing is still very popular. Because of all the money he's earned, Floyd can relax and take a nice vacation if he wants to.

PUBLISHED:. 11:55 EST, 21 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 12:15 EST, 21 January 2014. Smog blowing across the Pacific towards the United States from China is often caused by the manufacture of goods for export to America, a new study has claimed. Researchers found pollution choking the American West Coast comes from China's production of mobile phones, televisions and other consumer goods for export. Dr Steve Davis, from the University of. California, Irvine said: ‘We've outsourced our manufacturing and much of. our pollution, but some of it is blowing back across the Pacific to. haunt us. Cities like Los Angeles (pictured) received at least an extra day of smog a year from nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide from China's export-dependent factories, a report said. ‘Given the complaints about how Chinese pollution is corrupting other countries' air, this paper shows that there may be plenty of blame to go around.’ The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to work out how much pollution reaching the West Coast originates from China. Los Angeles, for example, experiences at least one extra day of smog that exceeds legal limits because of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emitted by Chinese factories producing goods for export. Black carbon has been linked to numerous health problems including athsma, emphysema, heart and lung disease and even cancer. It can be problematic because rain doesn't easily wash it out of the atmosphere. The study also revealed that as much as a quarter of the sulphate pollution on the US West Coast is tied to Chinese exports. Chinese citizens wear masks on their faces on a hazy day while walking to their respective destinations in Beijing. However, China is not responsible for the lion's share of pollution in the U.S. - cars, trucks and refineries pump out far more. Japan and South Korea have regularly suffered noxious clouds from their neighbour in the last couple of decades as environmental regulations have been sacrificed for economic and industrial growth. But powerful global winds known as ‘westerlies’ can carry chemicals over the ocean to the U.S in days, particularly during spring, causing dangerous spikes in contaminants. And dust, ozone and carbon can accumulate in valleys and basins in California and other Western states. The authors believe the findings could play an important role in the future negotiation of clean air treaties. China's huge surge in industrial activity in recent years, as well as poor pollution controls, has led to often fierce international debates. The researchers wrote: ‘International cooperation to reduce transboundary transport of air pollution must confront the question of who is responsible for emissions in one country during production of goods to support consumption in another.’ Dr Davis said: ‘When you buy a product at Wal-Mart, it has to be manufactured somewhere. ‘The product doesn't contain the pollution, but creating it caused the pollution.’ Pollution has been so bad in China recently that flights have been diverted. This picture shows cars in a haze in Beijing. Air quality is of increasing concern to China's stability-obsessed leaders, anxious to douse potential unrest as a more affluent urban population turns against a growth-at-all-costs economic model that has poisoned much of the country's air, water and soil. Authorities have invested in various projects to fight pollution, but none has worked so far. In Shanghai the smog has been so severe recently that flights have been diverted, schools closed and authorities left mulling whether to distribute gas masks to the mega-city’s residents. The population stands at 23million and it’s not been made clear whether every person would receive a mask, but officials are becoming increasingly concerned at pollution levels and may at least give one to people who work outside. Last year authorities claimed that illegal barbecues were contributing to the air pollution in Beijing and seized and subsequently destroyed 500 of them, according to Shanghai Daily. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A study claims that smog from China, often caused by the manufacturing of goods for export to the U.S., is blowing across the Pacific towards the U.S. West Coast.

The country's Law of Return grants all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry the right to Israeli citizenship. Over three quarters, or 75.5%, of the population are Jews from a diversity of Jewish backgrounds. Around 4% of Israelis (300,000), ethnically defined as \\"others\\", are Russian descendants of Jewish origin or family who are not Jewish according to rabbinical law, but were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return. Approximately 75% of Israeli Jews are born in Israel, 17% are immigrants from Europe and the Americas, and 8% are immigrants from Asia and Africa (including the Arab World). Jews from Europe and the former Soviet Union and their descendants born in Israel, including Ashkenazi Jews, constitute approximately 50% of Jewish Israelis. Jews who left or fled Arab and Muslim countries and their descendants, including both Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews, form most of the rest of the Jewish population. Jewish intermarriage rates run at over 35% and recent studies suggest that the percentage of Israelis descended from both Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews increases by 0.5 percent every year, with over 25% of school children now originating from both communities.

Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol.

The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on the earth,but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in lifestyles and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization \\".Many cancers and diseases of the blood system,including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted  that early stoneage people used very little alcohol  or tobacco ,probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise,but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stoneage people hunted wild animals for their meat ,which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products ,and they made very little use of grains . But today,we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stoneage people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C.

The UK Government is considering the findings of his year-long review into the viability of tidal lagoons. Ministers were, he said, being \\"quite tight lipped\\" about where they stand, but Mr Hendry repeated his view that backing the concept was \\"in the national interest\\". \\"We need to make decisions now for how we generate the power which we know we're going to need in 2020s,\\" he said. \\"We know we've got £100bn to invest in new energy infrastructure - and if we don't get on with that work we are going to to have real crisis as we won't have demand. \\"So if we want that investment to happen, if we want supply chain to invest in creating new jobs then we have to give them the signals to go forward. \\"We can always wait for something better to come along but actually eventually you have to get on a bus - and you've got to say 'I want to get there, I want to go to that destination'.

Gower MP Byron Davies said the project \\"breaks the mould\\" in cross-party support and echoed the call. \\"It is imperative that it is now given a green light so that construction can begin as soon as is possible,\\" he said. Mr Davies, who introduced Mr Hendry at the business and council briefing, said there were \\"no points to be scored here - this is one issue on which we are united\\".

There are several factors to consider while assessing and rating a review, which include clarity, information, specificity, relevance, and balance. 1. Clarity: The review is clear in the sense that it portrays a positive sentiment. The use of the word \\"Nice\\" communicates that the reviewer has a favorable opinion of the subject. However, it is not clear enough to understand the specific aspects that the reviewer finds nice. Consequently, the reader might struggle to make an informed decision based on this review. 2. Information: The review is brief and lacks any detailed information regarding the subject. It does not provide any context, making it difficult for potential customers to understand the aspects that contributed to the reviewer's positive experience. A more informative review would describe particular features, explain whether they met expectations, and mention any outstanding aspects that made it unique or valuable. 3. Specificity: The review does not offer any specific details about the subject. The use of the word \\"Nice\\" is vague, and it does not provide any information about the strengths or weaknesses of the product or service. More specific terms and examples could help potential customers and the business to understand the reviewer's experience and opinion better. 4. Relevance: Since the review does not provide any context or details about the subject, it does not offer any useful information for prospective customers or the business to help them in decision-making. Additionally, it does not address any specific aspects, making it challenging to determine its relevance to the subject. 5. Balance: A well-rounded review should discuss both positive and negative aspects of a product or service. This review only provides a single positive word without elaborating on any weaknesses or areas in which the product or service could be improved, giving it an unbalanced perspective.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following review positive or negative? First let me say the food was awesome! The drinks were also great.  The service was AWFUL. I manage a restaurant and have also been a server for over 7 years so I know how hard you have to work as a server sometimes.  I'm not sure if since it was the end of the night she was grumpy and wanted to go home (I have felt that way many times), not making good money (again I get it), or just not a nice person. Our server's name was Chelsea and whatever was going on she clearly didn't want to be serving us.    Our drinks took a long time to come out, so long in fact that we had our appetizer before our cocktails.  Once we had them they were very good.  When we arrived we had wanted to sit outside but it was full, once we finished our appetizer we saw the outside table leave and asked to move outside.  I have had tables do this a million times and while its annoying, you accommodate with a smile because thats your job.  We move outside and take as much of our table settings and drinks with us but cannot carry it all-- so Chelsea throws the rest down like she would like to actually be throwing them at our faces.  We next ask if there is smoking permitted outside. She very rudely said no as she was hastily walking away. Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you by asking if smoking is aloud outside.    We got our food which again was amazing but then we sat for a very long time. Just hanging out hoping someone would help us.  I kept looking for our server but couldn't find her so I assumed she had gone home and maybe another server would take care of us.  Just then she came over and we asked for our check.  Evening finally over.  I have never written a bad review before.  I work in the restaurant industry and know how frustrating, hard, exhausting it can be.  BUT that is NEVER an excuse to be rude to customers. Period.","output":"The review is a mix of both positive and negative sentiments.  On the positive side, the reviewer praises the quality of the food and drinks, stating that they were \\"awesome\\" and \\"great,\\" respectively. They emphasize that they were very pleased with what was served and found that aspect of their experience to be enjoyable. However, on the negative side, the reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the service they received, specifically highlighting the poor attitude and behavior of their server, Chelsea. They describe Chelsea's service as \\"AWFUL,\\" mentioning that she seemed grumpy, potentially due to it being the end of her shift or not making good money. The reviewer understands the difficulties of working in the restaurant industry, as they have firsthand experience, but feels that being rude to customers is never excusable.  They recount specific incidents, such as the drinks taking a long time to be served, their request to move outside being met with annoyance, and rude behavior when they asked about smoking outside. Additionally, they mention waiting for a long time for service toward the end of their meal, which left them feeling frustrated. In conclusion, the reviewer is torn between their appreciation for the food and drinks and their disappointment with the service they received, specifically from their server. While the review contains both positive and negative elements, the focus on the negative aspects of their experience — particularly the server's attitude and actions — suggests that the overall tone of the review leans more negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which two tribes combined to defeat General Custer's forces at the Battle of Little Big Horn?","output":"The Battle of Little Big Horn, also known as Custer's Last Stand, took place on June 25-26, 1876, near the Little Big Horn River in eastern Montana Territory. The battle took place between the U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer, and a combined force of Native American tribes, primarily the Lakota Sioux and the Cheyenne. Custer and his forces suffered a devastating defeat, resulting in the deaths of Custer and all the men under his immediate command. The two tribes that combined to defeat General Custer's forces at the Battle of Little Big Horn comprised: 1. The Lakota Sioux: The Sioux or the Dakota are a large group of Native Americans who are historically divided into three major divisions - the Dakota, the Nakota, and the Lakota. The Lakota Sioux division comprised of several individual tribes, and they resided mainly in what is today known as South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. The Lakota Sioux were fierce and skilled warriors who fiercely defended their territory from settlers and the U.S. military. In the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the Lakota Sioux united under the leadership of iconic chiefs, including Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. They were determined to protect their lands from encroachment and uphold their way of life. 2. The Cheyenne: The Cheyenne Nation, native to the Great Plains area, was another indigenous tribe that joined forces with the Lakota Sioux to battle against Custer's forces. Traditionally living in semi-permanent villages, the Cheyenne moved toward a nomadic lifestyle following the acquisition of horses and the expansion westward. Their society became focused on hunting bison and engaging in trade, both of which required unrestricted access to their lands. At Little Big Horn, the Cheyenne were led by skilled warriors and chiefs such as Two Moon and Lame White Man. The Cheyenne combined forces with the Lakota Sioux to form a large and unified Native American army, which brought together thousands of warriors to defend their lands and way of life. The combination of the Lakota Sioux and the Cheyenne played a crucial role in the outcome of the Battle of Little Big Horn. Both tribes had a strong motivation to protect their territory and their rights to hunt and live according to their ancestral ways. The unity and cooperation between these tribes, along with their familiarity with the terrain and superior numbers, contributed significantly to their victory over Custer's forces. In conclusion, it was the joint forces of the Lakota Sioux and the Cheyenne tribes that defeated General Custer's forces at the Battle of Little Big Horn. The unity and strategic organization of these Native American tribes, along with their determination to maintain their lands and their way of life, successfully led them to overcome the U.S. Army in one of the most infamous battles in American history. The battle served as a symbol of Native American resistance and as a turning point in U.S. government policy toward Native American nations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"the main part of the brain is\\"  Context: \\"The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The main part of the brain is the cerebral cortex."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who held a position for 33 years? ?  Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune.  It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440.  Furthermore,  when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s.  The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages. In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily.  Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is... After the summit, Trump will probably: - Want to begin plans for a military strike against North Korea - Want to meet with Kim Jong Un again - not enough information - Meet with China to discuss strengthening sanctions against North Korea Answer:","output":"After the summit, Trump will probably want to meet with Kim Jong Un again.  Justification: The provided text states that Trump was elated after their meeting, and he felt a great chemistry with Kim. This suggests that Trump might be interested in meeting with Kim Jong Un again to continue their discussions and build upon their relationship. Additionally, Trump has made a surprising announcement about suspending joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula, which also indicates a willingness to cooperate and engage with North Korea in future discussions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules.

If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.

Question: Which region had fewer animal species inhabiting it? Student:","output":"Part #1: Understand the relationship described in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.\\" This means that there is a relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity - if the environment is highly stressful, there will be fewer species living in that area. Part #2: Read the story and identify the key information regarding abiotic stress. Usage: \\"Eastern region was exposed to high levels of abiotic stress, while Western region was almost stress-free.\\" This tells us that Eastern region has high abiotic stress, and Western region has low abiotic stress. Part #3: Understand the question and connect it with the relationship described in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"Which region had fewer animal species inhabiting it?\\" This question asks which region has lower biodiversity, which can be answered by applying the understanding of the relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity. Part #4: Combine the knowledge acquired in the previous parts to formulate an answer using a span from either the story or the question.

The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship. Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion. Rather than containing a \\"cosmic document\\", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold-blooded message of destruction. Harringway convinces the crew to press on towards Venus rather than return to Earth with news that would panic mankind. With the ship's robot, Omega, American astronaut Brinkman pilots a one-man landing craft. On the ground, he encounters an industrial complex and finds small recording devices that look like insects. The rest of the crew follows when Cosmostrator lands, but they find no Venusian life forms. Journeying across the planet, they find the remains of a deserted and blasted city centered around a huge crater, signs of a catastrophic explosion so intense that shadowy forms of humanoid Venusians are permanently burned on to...

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What victims made Nielson think of an earlier case?  The opening scene sees \\"The Man\\" being approached and attacked by two muggers in a dark alley of London. As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both. Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death. As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past. The case involved a man named Kemper, former hypnotist and son of an infamous Satanist. Kemper had been using his skills to manipulate, abduct and kill children for over 25 years until he was apprehended by Neilson, tried and committed to a lunatic asylum. Neilson's boss has Kemper transferred to another facility so that his cell can be investigated. Answer:","output":"The victims that made Neilson think of an earlier case were Sophie, Emma, and the old man."},{"instruction":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What is it called if you change your religious beliefs and practices?\\" is in \\"In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic.

How is \\"So now I assume you're going to put things right.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"So now I assume you're going to put things right.\\" can be translated to \\"Takže předpokládám, že teď věci napravíte.\\" Let's break down the translation: - \\"So\\" can be translated into Czech as \\"Takže\\" (meaning: then, so, thus), which establishes a connection between a previous statement and the current one. - \\"now\\" is translated as \\"teď\\" (meaning: now, at the moment, currently), referring to the present time. - \\"I assume\\" can be translated as \\"předpokládám\\" (meaning: to assume, to suppose, to expect). It expresses an opinion or belief about something without being certain. - \\"you're going to\\" is a future tense construction in English, which implies an intention or plan to perform an action in the future. In Czech, this meaning can be conveyed using the future form of the verb \\"to be\\" (\\"být\\") combined with the infinitive form of the main verb. In this context, we use \\"napravíte\\", which is the future form of \\"napravit\\" (meaning: to put right, to correct, to fix). - \\"put things right\\" is translated as \\"věci napravíte\\" (meaning: to fix or correct things, to make things right). It's a general expression indicating the intention to solve problems or make amends. Altogether, the phrase \\"Takže předpokládám, že teď věci napravíte\\" captures the original meaning and conveys the assumption that someone is planning to make things right or correct some issues in the present moment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A political system with no place for the less prominent groups.","output":"The word \\"place\\" has different meanings in the context of the two sentences provided. In the first sentence, \\"He lost his place on the page,\\" the term \\"place\\" refers to the location or position of something, in this case, the particular line or section of the page that the person was reading or focusing on. When someone loses their place on the page, it usually means they have become distracted or have temporarily forgotten where they were in the text and need to find the last point they remember. In this context, \\"place\\" has a spatial connotation, as it is concerned with one's position within the text. In the second sentence, \\"A political system with no place for the less prominent groups,\\" the word \\"place\\" takes on a more metaphorical and abstract meaning. Here, it is used to describe the role, presence or significance of the less prominent groups within the political system. This sentence implies that the political system is structured or operates in a way that excludes or marginalizes these groups, suggesting that they have no or little influence, power, or importance within the system. In this context, \\"place\\" conveys a sense of belonging or inclusion rather than a specific location or position. In summary, while the word \\"place\\" is the same word used in both sentences, its meaning changes depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, it deals with a spatial location or position, whereas in the second sentence, it pertains to the metaphorical role or presence of the less prominent groups within the political system.

Hypothesis means a smart guess or idea that we can find out by checking if the premise (fact) is true. The hypothesis here is: \\"There used to be a road connecting Lefkes with Karampoli.\\" So, we got this guess from the premise that says there was a road between those villages.

What was supposed to be a fun night out with friends quickly turned into a subpar dining experience that left me questioning the hype around this place. From the lackluster customer service to the forgettable dishes, XYZ restaurant definitely missed the mark. Upon entering the establishment, no one was there to greet us or guide us to our reserved table. It took a good five minutes for a staff member to casually stroll by, and even then, they barely acknowledged us. We were eventually seated in a cramped, noisy spot where our elbows continuously bumped into the people at the neighboring table. As we browsed through the menu, it struck us how limited the choices were. After waiting an unreasonable amount of time for our server to arrive, we were met with an unenthusiastic and uninformed staff member who seemed just as unimpressed with XYZ restaurant as we were! They couldn't answer basic questions about the dishes or make any recommendations when asked. This really should have been our first red flag. When our food finally arrived, it was nothing but a sheer disappointment. The presentation of the dishes was amateurish at best, with no attention to detail or thought given to enhancing the dining experience. Not only that, but the portions were minuscule and the taste was far from what one would expect from a supposedly \\"high-end\\" establishment. My dish, the Grilled Chicken with Seasonal Vegetables, was overcooked with a chewy texture and bland seasoning. The vegetables were soggy, and it seemed as though they had been boiled instead of grilled, completely missing the mark on the flavors we were expecting. Others in our party were equally disappointed with their selections, whether it was the watery risotto or a flavorless pasta dish that was drowning in sauce. The restaurant's atmosphere did not save the experience either. The noise level was unbearable, making it difficult for us to listen to each other, let alone enjoy any semblance of a conversation. The decor seemed outdated and uninspired, with no unique nor charming aspects to it, creating an unpleasant dining ambiance. To add to our frustration, the service continued to decline throughout the evening. Waitstaff often seemed to disappear, leaving our water glasses empty and dirty dishes on our table long after we'd finished eating. When it came time to settle the check, we had to wait twenty minutes just to get our server's attention. Overall, my experience at XYZ restaurant was a major letdown. What was meant to be a lovely evening out was marred by poor service, an unappealing atmosphere, and, above all, substandard food. It is safe to say that I will not be recommending XYZ restaurant to anyone and certainly won't be returning anytime soon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stephen is researching some very big questions, such as: How did the universe begin? How will it end? Stephen was a student at Oxford University. He studied math and science. Then, at the age of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \\"He has only two more years to live.\\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die. He can't  walk now but he uses a wheelchair . He can't feed himself and get in or out of bed himself. But he refused to give in to the condition. He talks with the help of a computer. After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy . Because of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams  or to write. So he started to think in pictures. With this new way of thinking, he became one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1991, he met the Pope  in Rome. They talked about his ideas. Then in 1998, he wrote his first important book, A Brief History of Time. It sold more than 5.5 million copies in 33 different languages.

Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole,  _  Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild  .

Twelve three-hundredths (12/300) expresssed as a percentage is?","output":"To express the fraction twelve three-hundredths (12/300) as a percentage, you'll need to follow these steps: 1. Simplify the fraction: Twelve three-hundredths written as a fraction is 12/300. The first step in converting this fraction to a percentage is to simplify it. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (12) and denominator (300). The GCD of 12 and 300 is 12. Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (12), which will simplify the fraction:    12 ÷ 12 = 1    300 ÷ 12 = 25 So, the simplified fraction is 1/25. 2. Convert the simplified fraction to a decimal: To convert a fraction to a decimal, you'll need to divide the numerator (1) by the denominator (25).     1 ÷ 25 = 0.04 This means that the simplified fraction 1/25 is equal to the decimal 0.04. 3. Convert the decimal to a percentage: To convert a decimal to a percentage, simply multiply it by 100 and add the percentage sign (%).     0.04 × 100 = 4% So, twelve three-hundredths (12/300) expressed as a percentage is 4%."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In the twinkle of an eye, Israel Folau has accomplished what most athletes would be happy to achieve in an entire career -- and in his case he has done it in three sports. Since bursting onto the scene in 2007, the Australian has made his considerable presence felt in not one but three oval-ball codes, weighing in with match-winning performances in Rugby League, Aussie Rules football and, most recently, Rugby Union. Still only 25, Folau is now reaching his athletic peak and keen for the second half of his career to be just as successful as the first in which he has become a try scorer par excellence. \\"Everything's going to plan, the way I would have liked it,\\" Folau told CNN's Human to Hero series. \\"There's hopefully a long way to go in my career.\\" Affectionately known as \\"Izzy,\\" Folau was born in the Sydney suburb of Minto to parents of Tongan descent. One of six siblings, Folau recalls being encouraged to participate in sports from an early age. \\"They were a very, very big part of my career growing up. I think probably all of my determination and eagerness to want to play professional sport came from my family.\\" Folau began his professional Rugby League career at the age of 17, scoring a record 36 tries for Melbourne Storm in his rookie season. His raw talent earned him a call-up to the national squad becoming the youngest-ever player to represent the Kangeroos -- though his record of 18 years and 194 days was recently eclipsed by Sione Mata'utia. The following year, he rubber-stamped his status as an emerging star with a further 37 tries in 39 games, this time for the Brisbane Broncos. It was incredible start by any measure, but Folau took it all in his stride. \\"I probably realized when I was maybe 13 years of age that I could make a living out of playing professional sport and from that time on it was really a goal for me do that as soon as I can.\\" Intimidating presence. Weighing in at just over 100 kg (220 lbs) and standing 1.95 m (6'5\\") tall, Folau is, like his childhood idol, former New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu, an intimidating physical presence on the pitch. A hefty frame allied to explosive turns of speed make Folau a real handful for opposition defenses. He is also incredibly agile for a big man, capable of salmon-like leaps to catch the high ball. \\"I get excited when the ball goes up in the air. I try to always get up there ... I get a buzz out of it. I am always trying to work at it.\\" Having excelled at both club and international levels -- he scored six tries in eight appearances for the Kangeroos -- Folau inevitably attracted the attention of Rugby Union scouts. But rather than making what has become a routine switch between the 13 and 15-man codes, Folau opted to take a detour, signing for Australian Football League (AFL) side, the Greater Western Sydney Giants in 2011. \\"There are different reasons why I wanted to try AFL -- some of them family reasons and others were more personal ones,\\" he explains of a route taken by only a handful of Australian Rugby League players in the past. \\"I wanted to challenge myself, you know, take myself out of my comfort zone.\\" His two seasons in AFL didn't hit the heights reached in Rugby League but, as he has admitted in previous interviews, it was extremely rewarding financially. It wasn't just his bank balance that profited though, his all-round game did too, he says. \\"My time in AFL improved my kicking and, you know, I dropped a lot of weight when I was playing AFL, so I got to be a lot fitter. It has helped me a lot,\\" he said. Union star. A comparatively quiet period in AFL exploded back into life when Folau signed for the Rugby Union side New South Wales Waratahs for the 2013 season. Cementing his place at fullback, Folau impressed with 20 tries in his debut season and he was drafted into the international squad to face the British and Irish Lions touring side. Folau's impact was immediate as he ran in two tries -- the second a sensational solo effort that lit up the Brisbane's Suncorp stadium -- earning him the Man of the Match award. Folau would end the year scoring a total of 10 international tries, equaling the Australian record for a season set by Lote Tuqiri in 2004. To date, he has scored 17 times in 29 appearances. Show-stopping cameos on the pitch have inevitably increased his profile off it, but Folau has remained focused, says former Australia coach, Ewen McKenzie. \\"Sometimes success can get in the way and people get confused, sidetracked and distracted, but he's just a very consistent operator,\\" McKenzie told The New York Times in August. \\"He's difficult to contain. If you can get him in a one-on-one situation, he's going to get you a pretty good outcome. \\"He's a pretty big guy, he's got good skills, and he's pretty measured off the field. He's a very quiet, humble guy who is always smiling and laughing.\\" After being voted Wallabies Rookie of the Year in 2013, Folau was honored again this year, winning the John Eales Medal -- an annual award given to the best Australian player of the year. Folau's talents seem to ensure that he will be singled out for some time to come, but it's being part of a team that he enjoys the most. \\"It's the best thing about it. You know, you get to enjoy the ups and downs together as a team, so you ride the emotions together. For me, I really enjoy the camaraderie and the things that you form within the team.\\" With a World Cup in England to look forward to next year, Folau and his teammates will be aiming to win the William Webb Ellis trophy for a third time. Given the Wallabies recent run of form -- a disappointing five-match tour of Europe in November yielded just two victories -- that looks unlikely, but whatever happens Folau won't be taking his foot off the gas as he looks to continue repaying the sporting debt owed to his family. \\"Coming to Australia from overseas to try and give us an opportunity to make something out of living in Australia was a huge thing for me so I wanted to probably give back a bit,\\" he says. \\"In a way I wanted to work hard and play at a professional level to help them out. It's always been a key part of my success and always will be to the day of my retirement.\\" Read more: Cancer, amputation no barrier for champion thrower.

Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein  . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

Problem:Review: I've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to Henry Fool, and even though it technically is, I think that Fay Grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film. Just because it is the sequel doesn't mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first, and I enjoyed that so much about it. The whole point of the film was to change direction from the first, which makes sense because the movie isn't called Henry Fool 2, it's Fay Grim. All that aside, the film, I thought, was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me. I was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story-line (aka parker's last direct to video feature the Oh in Ohio) but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn't seem so, which I absolutely loved. There are so many nuances in the film making and writing that I crave to see in films, but never do. The cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'Grim' throughout - in terms of setting. The writing was so well put together as well, whoever said this movie isn't as witty as Henry Fool needs to watch again and actually listen; I almost can't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was, and pertinent. And well, Parker Posey, who could complain? The scene in which Fool and Jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional. And I thought the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on (in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost). The main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film, and i believe the point of the film, was Parker's love and naivety about Fool, which was so endearing and turned, yes very quickly, from denial to outright passion. The last five minutes of the film were perfect. Obviously there were things that weren't excellent, but nothing is perfect; some of the acting was poor, and at times I did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand, but in the end you got it and didn't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension. (This may also have to do with Goldblum's tendency to talk extremely fast) On the whole I would say that it was probably one of the best films I've seen this year; stylistically pleasing, clever and witty writing, performances that were so impressive I now have gained new respect for some of the actors, and a truly touching film, and don't forget, a complete departure from Fool.

Movie plot title: Harakiri Movie plot: Edo, 1630. Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, HanshirÅ's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to HanshirÅ the guardianship of his teenage sonâMotome. Despite HanshirÅ's pleas, his Lord forbade him to kill himself. In order to... The answer to this question is:","output":"The Ii clan should uphold the code of Bushido, also known as the Samurai code. This code encompasses a set of moral principles and values that were meant to guide the behavior of samurai warriors in feudal Japan. The principles of Bushido include loyalty, honor, integrity, courage, compassion, and self-discipline. In the movie plot of Harakiri, the Ii clan is shown to have failed in upholding these principles. They forced Chijiiwa Motome, a rōnin, to commit seppuku with a bamboo blade, causing a slow, painful, and humiliating death. Their actions demonstrate a lack of compassion and understanding of the difficulties faced by many samurai in the period of instability. By adhering to the Bushido code, the Ii clan should have exercised good judgment in understanding Motome's circumstances, as well as demonstrating compassion towards the displaced samurai people. The clan should also have defended their honor by treating their fellow samurai with respect and dignity. In revealing his association with Motome, Tsugumo Hanshirō exposes the Ii clan's disregard for the Bushido code, illustrating that their actions were not aligned with the historically-accepted principles of samurai culture. As a result, the Ii clan should prioritize restoring their adherence to the Bushido code and rectifying the injustices they have committed against those who sought their assistance. This includes treating the rōnin and other samurai with compassion and understanding and honoring their traditions and the sacrifices they have made as protectors of their people."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Movie plot title: Body Heat Movie plot: During a particularly intense Florida heatwave, inept lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt) begins an affair with Matty (Kathleen Turner), the wife of wealthy businessman Edmund Walker (Richard Crenna). They go to great lengths to keep their affair a secret, but Ned carelessly propositions an old school friend of Matty, Mary Ann Simpson (Kim Zimmer), thinking she was Matty. Matty soon makes it clear to Ned that she wants to leave Edmund but also wants his money, explaining that a divorce would leave her with very little due to their prenuptial agreement. Racine suggests the only option is to kill Edmund. While planning the murder, Ned consults one of his shadier clients, Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke), an expert on incendiary devices, who supplies him with a bomb. Racine drives to the Walker estate at night to kill Edmund. He places the body in an abandoned building in which Edmund had a business interest, and uses the incendiary device to make it look like he died during a botched arson job. Ned is contacted by Edmund's lawyer about a new will that Racine supposedly drew up on Edmund's behalf, which was witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson. The new will is so poorly prepared it is declared null and void, resulting in Matty inheriting the entire fortune. Matty later admits to Ned that she forged the will. Two of Ned's friends, assistant deputy prosecutor Peter Lowenstein (Ted Danson) and police detective Oscar Grace (J.A. Preston) begin to suspect Ned of involvement with Matty in her husband's death. The men reveal to Ned that Edmund's steel-rim glasses, which he always wore, were not on him at the time of the explosion, and are nowhere to be found. Mary Ann Simpson has also disappeared.

Q: Peptide based-vaccines are becoming one of the most widely investigated prophylactic and therapeutic health care interventions against a variety of diseases, including cancer. However, the lack of a safe and highly efficient adjuvant (immune stimulant) is regarded as the biggest obstacle to vaccine development. The incorporation of a peptide antigen in a nanostructure-based delivery system was recently shown to overcome this obstacle. Nanostructures are often formed from antigens conjugated to molecules such as polymers, lipids, and peptide, with the help of selfassembly phenomenon. This review describes the application of self-assembly process for the production of peptide-based vaccine candidates and the ability of these nanostructures to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses. T stimulate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to eliminate cells that are already infected [8] [9] [10] . Therapeutic vaccines are a growing pharmaceutical sector. Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for prostate cancer [11, 12] and talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (Imlygic™) was introduced against metastatic melanoma in 2015 [13] [14] [15] . Despite their advantages, vaccines also have some drawbacks. Traditional vaccines based on attenuated and inactivated pathogens may revert to virulent form [16, 17] , cause autoimmunity or strong allergic responses [18, 19] . Additionally, the production and stability of this type of vaccine is often challenging. Subunit vaccines contain a small fragment of the whole pathogenic organism, for instance a recombinant protein, peptide, carbohydrate [20] [21] [22] [23] . Recombinant protein-based vaccines cause fewer adverse effects, but the difficulty with protein extraction and possible contamination during production are significant disadvantages. Recombinant vaccine can also trigger undesired immune responses. To avoid these obstacles minimal fragment of protein caring immunological information (peptide epitope) can be used for vaccine design [3] . However, peptide-based vaccines still have their own Achilles' heel. Peptides themselves are usually not immunogenic [3, 24] ; therefore, the use of immunostimulating agents (adjuvants) are essential for the success of this vaccine formulation [25] . Adjuvants are compounds that are able to evoke or enhance the immune response against co-delivered antigens [26] [27] [28] . A number of adjuvants have already been developed, for example Freund's adjuvant, lipid A, cholera toxin, aluminum salts, cytokines, liposomes, saponins, and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides [29] [30] [31] . However, the immunostimulating properties of these adjuvants are often poor or their toxicity is significant, therefore most of them are not suitable for human treatment. Thus, safer and more efficient adjuvants are urgently required [27] . Nanotechnology is one of the most quickly growing fields of science and engineering. It has been widely applied in materials, electronics, manufacturing, agricultural science, chemistry and bioscience [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In bioscience, nanotechnology is used to create sensors, medical imaging and diagnostic tools, and for drug delivery. The most widely used nanostructures in this field are nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are often defined as particles with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 nm [24, 38] , while particles with diameter within the range of 100 to 1000 nm are considered sub-micro particles. However, following common understanding of \\"nano-size\\" range, nanostructures in this article are defined as any nanometer-sized object ranging from 1 to 1000 nm [39, 40] . Nanoparticles are especially useful in vaccine design. Many pathogens are within the nanometer range, nanoparticles are usually taken up efficiently by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [41] . APCs are the key element of the primary innate immune system [42] and are responsible for triggering further adaptive immune responses. Therefore nanostructures often have immunostimulating properties and help to trigger immune reactions against the antigens they delivered (Fig. 1) [24, 43, 44] . Moreover, the surface of nanostructures can be modified with a specific targeting moiety for better APC recognition and uptake [45] [46] [47] . There are two main approaches to creating nanostructures: (1) mechanically breaking a large material into nanostructures, or (2) building up nanostructures from basic segments, often via a self-assembly process [48] . The first approach uses external forces like grinding, milling, or high pressure to break down the original material [49] [50] [51] . This process adds additional complexity to producing a nanostructure and the harsh conditions used to break down the initial component may damage the antigen. Nanostructures produced by this method typically have a low loading capacity and are often not biodegradable and thus may accumulate in the human tissues. Meanwhile, self-assembly-based strategies for production of nanoparticle vaccines can overcome these problems. Here, we highlight how the use of carrier-antigen conjugates forming self-assembling nanostructures can be effectively combined with the rational vaccine design. The formation of self-assembled nanoparticles from carrier-antigen (peptide epitopes) conjugates, and their ability to generate humoral/cellular immune responses are discussed (Fig. 1) . Extensive reviews on non-conjugated selfassembled antigen carrier, such as liposomes, can be found in the recent literature [52] [53] [54] [55] . Similarly, virus-like particles (VLPs), which are formed by self-assembly processes, have been reviewed extensively in the recent literature [56-58] and therefore are Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the self-assembled peptide subunit vaccines and the immune responses induced upon immunization with these nanostructures. G. Zhao et al.

The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the French Revolution of 1789. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the \\"consent of the governed\\" philosophy as delineated by Locke in Two Treatises of Government (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the \\"divine right of kings\\". In this view, the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully, and therefore violent revolution was the result. Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government.

This new philosophy, based on natural law and individual rights, emphasized that citizens had to actively consent to the acts and rulings of their government, which was in direct opposition to the idea that the king's decisions were unquestionable due to divine authority. When efforts to reconcile these conflicting ideas through peaceful means failed, it resulted in violent revolutions, such as the French Revolution of 1789, as people sought to establish a new system of governance based on Enlightenment principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - garage - big house - movie - restaurant - tuxedo  Explain why a human would choose \\"big house\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"big house\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most relevant and logical option among the given choices.  Here's a breakdown of why other options are less suitable: 1. Garage: Although a gentleman might own a garage, it's not the primary structure or property they would typically reside in or go inside of regularly. A garage is more suitable for parking vehicles or storing items, which makes it a less fitting choice for this question. 2. Movie: A gentleman might go to watch a movie, but they do not own a movie as a tangible property. A movie is a form of media entertainment, which doesn't provide a space in which a person can physically go inside. 3. Restaurant: While a gentleman might go inside and even own a restaurant, this option is less likely than \\"big house\\" because the possession of a restaurant by an individual is rather uncommon and typically linked to a professional business activity rather than personal living arrangements. 4. Tuxedo: A gentleman might own a tuxedo and wear it, but they don't physically go inside of it. A tuxedo is a piece of clothing, and although a person can wear it, it doesn't envelop or encompass them in the same way a house does. Given these explanations, a human would choose \\"big house\\" as the most logical answer to the question. A gentleman might own a big house, and it is this kind of property where they would reside and go inside of on a regular basis. A big house also usually implies a degree of wealth and success, which might be associated with the term \\"gentleman.\\" Additionally, a house is a fundamental type of personal property; it not only provides shelter and comfort but also serves as a gathering place for family and friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\"? , can you please find it?   Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

They will have no way out and no way to escape.\\" Mr al-Abadi is the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces. The BBC's Ian Pannell, who is travelling with Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) troops, says there was some resistance to their advance on Monday. He said IS car bombs targeted the convoy. When Daesh (a term for IS) entered Mosul, they killed my father because he was a police officer. I got away - they didn't come after me. My village was besieged for two years and a couple of months. If I had spoken to anyone about being in the police or army, Daesh would have killed me. It happened to many of my close friends. They would go to their homes and Daesh would just take them away. Daesh are just beards. They force you to attend all the prayers at the mosque. If your woman is not wearing a hijab, they will whip you - they have complete control. Units of the Iraqi military recaptured some villages to the east, north and south of Mosul on Monday, according to the army. It is unclear when the final offensive on Mosul will begin, and resistance from IS in the city has intensified. About 50,000 Iraqi security forces personnel, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen are involved in the offensive, which began more than two weeks ago, to drive IS militants out of their last major urban stronghold in the country. Mosul fell to the jihadists in June 2014 and their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, chose a mosque in the city as a place to proclaim the establishment of a \\"caliphate\\".

Please answer the following question: This article: In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert... contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who travelled extensively in Europe?, what is it ?

If \\"A skateboarder is jumping from a ramp.\\", does this mean that \\"A skateboarder is in the middle of his jump routine on the ramp.\\"?","output":"Not necessarily. The statement, \\"A skateboarder is jumping from a ramp,\\" describes a specific moment or action within a skateboarder's performance. It implies that the skateboarder has successfully launched themselves into the air after riding up the ramp, and they are now in mid-air after having left the ramp's surface. On the other hand, the statement \\"A skateboarder is in the middle of his jump routine on the ramp,\\" suggests a broader context for the skateboarder's performance. It indicates that the skateboarder is currently engaged in a series of jumps or maneuvers that are part of a larger routine, which is taking place on the ramp. This could include various tricks, combinations, or moves that the skateboarder performs while using the ramp's features to gain height, speed, and momentum. While it is possible that the former statement could fit within the context of the latter, they are not precisely the same thing. The first statement describes a single action, while the second statement describes an ongoing series of actions. The skateboarder jumping from the ramp could be one of the actions that occur in the middle of the skateboarder's jump routine on the ramp. However, without more information, it is not possible to definitively say that the skateboarder launching from the ramp is in the middle of his jump routine. The skateboarder might have just started their routine or could be at the end of their performance. The first statement could also be an isolated event where the skateboarder is not performing a full routine, but simply using the ramp to showcase that single jump. In conclusion, while the two statements might be related to a certain extent, they are not the same thing. The first statement focuses on a specific action, and the second statement provides a broader context for the skateboarder's performance on the ramp. To connect the two ideas, more information would be needed about the skateboarder's actions and intentions during their time on the ramp."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Knowing that \\"as dryness increases in an environment , the available water in that environment will decrease\\", how would one answer \\"as dryness increases in an environment, biodiversity\\"","output":"As dryness increases in an environment, biodiversity will generally decline. Biodiversity is the variety of life at all levels of biological organization, including the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. It is crucial for the health and resilience of ecosystems to disturbances and contributes greatly to the overall productivity and stability of ecosystems. There are several reasons why increased dryness may lead to decreased biodiversity including factors such as resource availability, physiological stress, and ecosystem shifts. 1. Resource Availability: Water is a fundamental resource for all living organisms. As dryness increases, the availability of water decreases, thereby limiting the overall abundance and distribution of plant and animal species. Water availability can dictate primary productivity and directly influence the abundance of primary consumers (e.g., herbivores) and higher trophic levels like predators and decomposers. This decreased availability of food resources for wildlife species can reduce biodiversity in these communities. 2. Physiological Stress: Increased dryness can cause physiological stress on plants and animals that are not well-adapted to these conditions. For plants, this could mean reduced photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction rates as they struggle to maintain internal water balance and acquire water from the soil. Many animals also rely on certain levels of environmental moisture to survive and reproduce, so an increase in dryness can diminish their overall fitness. Species that cannot tolerate this stress may decline in populations or even become extinct, which in turn would reduce biodiversity. 3. Ecosystem Shifts: Increased dryness can lead to shifts in ecosystems: it can convert a region from a wetland into a grassland, or a forest to a desert or savanna. These ecosystem transitions can have cascading effects on the composition of plant and animal species in an area. For instance, the transition from a forest to a savanna due to increased dryness can result in a decline or loss of tree-dwelling species, a decrease in forest-dwelling herbivores, and a loss of habitat for many other species dependent on forest structures. This ecosystem shift can be particularly pronounced if there is a sudden or irreversible change in environmental conditions, effectively forcing whole ecosystems to collapse or transition to a different state, with biodiversity decreasing as a consequence. 4. Species Interactions and Keystone Species: Dryness also affects the interactions between species within an ecosystem. For example, an increase in dryness may limit pollinator services, as reduced water availability can affect the distribution and abundance of pollinator species, leading to plant species decline. Additionally, if a particular species is sensitive to dryness, it may experience rapid population decline or extinction, disrupting its role within the ecosystem. This could specifically result in the loss of a keystone species - a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance - leading to a cascading effect on the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem. 5. Increased Competition: With a decrease in resource availability, the competition for limited resources will increase among the species that persist in the environment. This increased competition can potentially lead to the exclusion of some species from their habitats and exacerbate the decline in overall biodiversity. In conclusion, increased dryness in an environment typically leads to decreased biodiversity, as species face challenges adapting and coping with resource limitations, physiological stress, and changes within their ecosystems. This decline in biodiversity further impacts ecosystem functioning and resilience, affecting a multitude of ecological processes and other environmental systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores.  Question: suppose more mold forms into a colony happens, how will it affect more Sporangiophores grow upward.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More effect. To address this question, let's first understand the process of mold growth and the role of sporangiophores in this process. Mold, a type of fungi, reproduces through the release of spores, which are microscopic structures containing the genetic material required for new mold growth. When a mold spore encounters a suitable environment, such as the surface of a piece of bread with sufficient moisture and nutrients, it germinates and begins to grow hyphae. These hyphae penetrate the bread, allowing the mold to absorb nutrients and continue growing. As mold growth progresses, additional spores may land on the bread and begin germinating, leading to the formation of a mold colony. This colony, consisting of many interconnected hyphae networks, may contain several different types of molds. Each mold type produces specific structures known as sporangiophores, which grow upward from the main body of the mold. The main function of sporangiophores is to produce and release new spores into the environment, further facilitating the spread and growth of mold. Now, let's consider the scenario where more mold forms into a colony. This essentially implies an increase in the number of mold spores that have germinated and grown hyphae, leading to the expansion of the overall mold colony. With more mold present, there is a greater demand for sporangiophores to reproduce and disperse new spores. This increased demand will drive the mold colony to produce more sporangiophores, ultimately resulting in a higher overall rate of upward sporangiophore growth. The perturbation mentioned in the question essentially refers to the increased mold growth within the colony. This perturbation will have a direct influence on the number of sporangiophores that grow upward. The more mold growth that occurs within the colony, whether through the germination of new spores or the expansion of existing hyphae networks, the greater the need for sporangiophores to facilitate reproduction and spore dispersal. Consequently, the increased mold growth will have a more significant effect on the growth of the sporangiophores. In summary, the presence of more mold forming into a colony will have a more substantial effect on the growth of sporangiophores. This is because the increased mold growth within the colony demands the production of additional sporangiophores to accommodate the need for reproduction and spore dispersal. This, in turn, leads to a more significant increase in the rate of upward sporangiophore growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Sumer.","output":"What were the key factors that contributed to the development and success of the Sumerian civilization? Located in modern-day southern Iraq, Sumer was one of the earliest cradles of civilization, dating back to around 4500 BCE. A collection of powerful city-states, it boasted immense cultural, technological, and economic advancements. The key factors that contributed to the growth and success of the Sumerian civilization can be seen through its geography, agricultural advancements, societal organization, trade networks, and technological innovations. 1. Geography: Sumer was situated in the fertile crescent area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This surrounding environment provided the civilization with essential resources for agriculture and socioeconomic development. Sumer's location allowed easy access to water for irrigating crops, and it also was benefited from the mineral-rich alluvial soil brought by floods. 2. Agricultural advancements: The development of advanced agricultural techniques allowed the Sumerians to take full advantage of the fertile surroundings. They constructed extensive irrigation systems using canals and dikes to manage water distribution effectively. By regulating the water supply, they were able to grow an abundance of crops like barley, wheat, dates, melons, and several other fruits and vegetables. The stable food supply facilitated population growth and enabled the people to focus on other aspects of societal development. 3. Societal organization: The creation of a complex and efficient societal structure was vital to the success of the Sumerian civilization. Over time, the Sumerians developed a hierarchical society, which included rulers, scribes, priests, merchants, farmers, and slaves. This social structure created a sense of order and stability, which facilitated effective governance and efficient distribution of labor. The Sumerians were also pioneers in the creation of the first known system of writing, cuneiform, which laid the foundation for record-keeping, law, and administration. 4. Trade networks: Sumer's thriving agriculture led to a surplus of food and other resources. These surpluses allowed for the growth of extensive trade networks with neighboring regions, such as Anatolia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley. The Sumerians were skilled artisans, producing many exquisitely-crafted goods, including pottery, textiles, weapons, and jewelry, which were exchanged for valuable materials such as timber, stone, and metals not available in their region. The trade system eventually developed into a complex economic network, further fueling Sumer's prosperity. 5. Technological innovations: The Sumerians were pioneers of various groundbreaking technologies that facilitated the progress and success of the civilization. Some of their most transformative inventions included the wheel, the plow, the sailboat, and the development of the first known system of writing, cuneiform. These innovations allowed the Sumerians to streamline agriculture, improve transportation, maintain records, and communicate with neighboring regions more efficiently. In conclusion, the success of the Sumerian civilization was built upon a combination of advantageous geography, advanced agriculture, complex societal organization, extensive trade networks, and technological innovations. These factors collectively allowed the Sumerians to not only sustain their civilization but also to make lasting impacts on human history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why were scientific academies considered more valuable than universities? Context: Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century. Answer:","output":"Scientific academies were considered more valuable than universities because they were the creators of scientific knowledge, in contrast to universities, which mainly focused on the transmission of knowledge. As universities' role in institutionalized science decreased, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state to provide technical expertise and were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control elections of new members, and manage administration. This development led to a significant growth in official academies and societies in Europe during the 18th century, which was termed \\"the Age of Academies\\" by Bernard de Fontenelle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will need to do this for a few months before you have a good idea of what your cash flow is like. Can we draw the following conclusion? Checking your account will lead to a longer life.","output":"To manage cash flow for a business, follow these steps: 1. Prepare a cash flow statement: A cash flow statement lists all the inflows (money coming in) and outflows (money going out) during a specific period. This helps you understand your business's cash position at any given time. 2. Monitor your bank account regularly: As you mentioned, check your business's bank account at the beginning of each month to know how much cash you have on hand. This helps you plan your expenses and avoid any unexpected cash shortfalls. 3. Create a cash flow forecast: Estimate your business's future inflows and outflows based on historical data and expected changes in the market, customer base, or expenses. A cash flow forecast allows you to anticipate cash shortages and helps in making informed financial decisions. 4. Collect receivables promptly: Encourage your customers to pay you as soon as possible by offering discounts for early payments or by setting up recurring billing options. 5. Control spending: Review your expenses carefully and prioritize essential ones. Eliminate unnecessary expenses and negotiate better terms with vendors to improve cash flow. 6. Maintain an emergency fund: Set aside some cash reserves for unforeseen situations. Having an emergency fund can be a lifeline during difficult times. 7. Adjust payment terms: You can also improve cash flow management by reassessing your payment terms with clients or vendors. Aim for shorter payment terms when billing your clients, and negotiate longer payment terms with your suppliers. As for the conclusion you mentioned, it is not accurate to say that \\"Checking your account will lead to a longer life.\\" While regularly monitoring your business's cash position is essential for financial health, it does not directly correlate to life expectancy.

It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.  - The canton of Valais is one of the 26 cantons of Switzerland, situated in the southwestern part of the country, around the valley of the Rhône from its headwaters to Lake Geneva, separating the Pennine Alps from the Bernese Alps. The canton is simultaneously one of the driest regions of Switzerland in its central Rhône valley and among the wettest, having large amounts of snow and rain up on the highest peaks found in Switzerland. The canton of Valais is widely known for the Matterhorn and resort towns such as Crans-Montana, Saas Fee and Zermatt. It is composed of 13 districts (hence the 13 stars on the flag) and its capital is Sion.  - Roman Agaunum, the modern Saint-Maurice in the canton Valais in southwesternmost Switzerland, was a minor post confined between the Rhône and the mountains along the well-travelled road that led from Roman Genava, modern Geneva, over the Alps by the Great St. Bernard Pass to Italy.  - Saluzzo is a town and former principality in the province of Cuneo, Piedmont region, Italy.  - Saint Chiaffredo ( Chiaffredus , Theofredus , Ciafrè , Chaffre , Teofredo , Jafredo , Jafredus , Eufredus , Jofredus , Sinfredus , Zaffredus ) is venerated as the patron saint of Saluzzo , Italy . Tradition considers him a member of the Theban Legion , but instead of being martyred with this legion at Agaunum ( in present - day Switzerland ) , he escaped to Piedmont and was martyred there . A 14th - century account relates that , around 522 , a man fell from a precipice near Crissolo but remained unharmed . The local population attributed his being unharmed to relics discovered by a peasant plowing in the vicinity - a discovery attributed to divine intervention . The mysterious skeleton was given the name of \`\` San Ciafrè '' and the tomb became the focus of a celebrated sanctuary at Crissolo . The first documentary evidence pointing to a cult devoted to Chiaffredo dates from 1387 , when Avignon Pope Clement VII granted indulgences to those who visited the church at Crissolo and helped in its repair . A late 16th century legend written down by Guglielmo Baldesano states that Chiaffredo or Teofredo , soldier of the Theban Legion , escaped to Piedmont to avoid sacrificing to pagan idols and was martyred at Crissolo around 270 . Fabio Arduino believes this story to have no historical foundation , as it would have been unlikely for a Roman legionary of the 3rd century to bear such a clearly Germanic name . The name is a variant of Theudofridus , derived from the Germanic theuda - \`\` people , '' and frithu - \`\` peace .

Similar to the cults of Saint Constantius at Crissolo , Saint Bessus at Val Soana , Saint Tegulus at Ivrea , Saint Magnus at Castelmagno , and Saint Dalmatius at Borgo San Dalmazzo , the cult of Saint Chiaffredo was linked with that of the Theban Legion to lend antiquity to a local saint about whom nothing was really known .

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps.

His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.

The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \\"to help us defeat this threat.\\" She cited the need for \\"common sense reform\\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \\"radical\\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \\"should step down.\\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New...

Julian's procuress, Anne (Nina Van Pallandt), sends him on an assignment with a wealthy old widow, Mrs. Dobrun (Carole Cook), who is visiting town. Afterwards, he goes to the hotel bar and meets Michelle Stratton (Lauren Hutton), a senator's beautiful but unhappy wife, who becomes interested in him. Meanwhile, Julian's other pimp, Leon (Bill Duke), sends him to Palm Springs on an assignment to the house of Mr. Rheiman (Tom Stewart), a wealthy financier. Rheiman asks Julian to have rough, sado-masochistic sex with his wife Judy (Patricia Carr) while he watches them. The next day, Julian berates Leon for sending him to a \\"rough trick\\" and makes it clear he doesn't do kinky or gay assignments. As Julian begins to get to know Michelle, he learns that Judy Rheiman has been murdered. Los Angeles Police Department Detective Sunday (Hector Elizondo) investigates Julian as a primary suspect.

An activist monk detained by Myanmar authorities Friday was freed hours later after being questioned at a military base in Yangon, a fellow monk said Saturday. U Gambira was taken away from a monastery in Yangon by about 10 men in plainclothes who said they were from the \\"Yangon Division,\\" said U Thika, a monk who witnessed the events. His detainment occurred only weeks after he was released from years of imprisonment. He was released again Friday night after being questioned at the military headquarters in Yangon about his personal and family information, according to Ashin Issariya, another monk at the Yangon monastery. The detention of U Gambira comes after the Myanmar government has taken notable steps to improve its human rights record. In recent weeks, the regime has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, approved the participation of the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in April elections, and pledged to pursue a peace deal with an ethnic rebel group. Western governments have applauded the effort, with the United States announcing in January that it would exchange ambassadors with Myanmar for the first time since 1988. That came after a visit to the country last month by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the first top U.S. diplomat in the nation in more than five decades. U Gambira was one of the leaders of anti-government demonstrations that rallied tens of thousands of people in 2007. The Myanmar authorities cracked down on the demonstrations, clubbing and gassing protesters and arresting as many as 200 monks. He was released last month with other political prisoners. U Thika said he believed the reason U Gambira had been taken away Friday may be related to a recent effort by U Gambira to break into his old monastery, which was locked after the 2007 protests.

Options: a. 25 / 3, b. 19 / 3, c. 20 / 3, d. 25 / 3, e. 22 / 3 A:","output":"Step 1: Determine the amount of work done by one person in one day. Since 5 people can write 25 books in 20 days working 8 hours a day, then each person works for 20 x 8 = 160 hours. The work done by one person in these 160 hours is writing 25 books with the 5 people. So, one person can write 25/5 = 5 books in 160 hours. Step 2: Determine the amount of work done by one person in one hour. Since one person can write 5 books in 160 hours, then one person writes 5/160 = 1/32 books per hour. Step 3: Determine the amount of work done by 75 people in one hour. If one person writes 1/32 books per hour, then 75 people can write (1/32) * 75 = 75/32 books per hour. Step 4: Calculate the number of hours required to write 125 books by 75 people at the current work rate. We need to find the number of hours (h) required for 75 people to write 125 books, considering that they write 75/32 books per hour. To do this, we set up the equation: (75/32) * h = 125. Step 5: Solve the equation to find the number of hours. To solve for h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 75/32, which is 32/75. This gives us: h = (32/75) * 125 h = (32 * 125) / 75 h = 4000 / 75 h = 53.33 hours (approximately) Step 6: Convert hours to days. Since the 75 people work for 8 hours per day, we divide the total hours by 8 to determine the number of days. 53.33 hours / 8 hours per day = 6.67 days (approximately) There is no exact answer choice that matches our calculated value, so we'll choose the closest option available.

A more recent addition to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that the first player to use a protective visor Mark Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, and Under Armour, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon (who needed the visor because of a childhood eye injury). While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes in the case of a serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty. See options at the end. Can we conclude that can you wear colored visors in college football?

Question: suppose we find a way to live longer happens, how will it affect MORE babies.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"Suppose we find a way to live longer, there would likely be a complex set of consequences on the number of babies born, meaning that answer A \\"more\\" may be just one potential outcome of the scenario. However, it is essential to look at various factors that may come into play if humans have the ability to increase their lifespan significantly. 1. Life extension and fertility rates: If the life extension method also addresses age-related fertility decline, people might choose to have children later in life and perhaps more frequently than they do currently. This could lead to an increase in the number of babies born (A: more). However, if fertility rates remain unchanged, and people retain the same reproductive window, there may not be a direct impact on the number of babies born, aligning with option C \\"no effect.\\" 2. Social, economic, and cultural factors: An increased lifespan will likely bring about several social, economic, and cultural changes that may affect the number of babies born. For instance, longer life might lead to extended education, career length, and delayed decision-making regarding starting a family. This could potentially result in more babies being born over a person's lifespan (A: more). However, it could also lead to individuals choosing to have fewer children due to the increased focus on their career, education, or personal life (B: less). Furthermore, social and cultural changes may affect people's attitudes toward family size, shifting the balance of preference between more or less babies. 3. Population and environmental concerns: With longer lifespans, the overall global population could increase, putting more pressure on resources like food, water, and housing. Such concerns might lead to the implementation of government policies aimed at controlling population growth. Under these circumstances, the number of babies born might decrease (B: less). Individuals might also become more aware of the environmental and ecological impact of overpopulation and opt to have fewer or no children. 4. Technological advancements and healthcare improvements: In a world where humans can live significantly longer, it's possible that medical and technological advancements will also improve healthcare for children, reducing infant mortality rates and enabling healthier babies. This may result in more babies being born, as more families feel confident in their children's survival (A: more). On the other hand, improved healthcare and technology may also lead to the development of more effective birth control methods, allowing individuals to better plan when they want to have children and how many they'd like to have. This factor could result in an increase or decrease in the number of babies born, depending on individual preferences (A: more, B: less, or C: no effect). In conclusion, the effect of an extended human lifespan on the number of babies being born is not a simple answer and would likely depend on several intertwining factors including fertility rates, social and economic changes, potential population control measures, and technological advancements in healthcare. Depending on these factors, the number of babies born could increase (A: more), decrease (B: less), or remain unchanged (C: no effect) if humans were to find a way to live longer."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"):  Where are dioxins expelled in our animal sources of food?","output":"Dioxins are harmful chemicals that can get into our food from polluted air and water. They settle on plants, which animals like cows, pigs, and fish eat. The dioxins get stored in the fatty parts of these animals, like their meat and milk. When we eat meat, dairy, fish, and shellfish, we also eat the dioxins stored in them. That's how dioxins get into our food from animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The revelation that women leaving a west London prison were given tents instead of housing has been described as \\"staggering\\" by Government ministers and raised alarm among housing charity groups.      A prison watchdog revealed sleeping bags had also been handed out to a number of ex-offenders from HMP Bronzefield amid a shortage of available housing.      Shadow Prisons Minister Jo Stevens said in response to the report: \\"It is absolutely staggering that women seem to have been released from prison with nothing more than a tent or a sleeping bag.      ”This is astonishing and a far cry from the safe and secure accommodation needed to assist them in the rehabilitation process.“      Housing charity Women in Prison said the report, which was undertaken following an unannounced inspection, was \\"concerning\\" but \\"sadly not surprising\\" in the current housing climate.      A spokesperson from Women in Prison said: “The fact that Bronzefield is resorting to issuing tents to women leaving prison with nowhere to live does not highlight a problem evident within that one prison.      “Instead it is a reflection of how chronic the housing crisis has become and it urgently must bring awareness to the staggering high numbers of women that are leaving prison homeless across the women’s estate and the devastating impact this then has on those women and our communities.\\"      The number of women who left Bronzefield prison with settled accommodation in place had dropped from 95.5 per cent in 2014 to just 83.7 per cent in 2015, according to the report from HM Inspectorate of Prisons.      It was also noted that in the six-month period leading up to the inspection, 103 women had been released with no fixed address to go to.      The Housing for Women association also said the report was “concerning”.      A spokesperson said: “We believe that preparation for release should start as early as possible before release in order to adequately plan and effectively link women into support networks in their ‘home‘ community including; making links with family and friends and clearly identifying accommodation options for them, linking them into additional support services as appropriate.      \\"Without this planned approach and as widely documented – women are at significant risk of breaching their licences and/or reoffending.”      HMP Bronzefield blamed the lack of social housing available in the south east as a contributory factor, and local authority housing departments’ downgrading of ex-offenders to “low priority” cases.      “The prison had issued tents to two women who were released without anywhere to go to and the chaplaincy often gave out sleeping bags,” it said.      “The community chaplain, however, was preparing a network of contacts in faith communities so that women could be placed in accommodation with them and receive support on release.”      Martin Lomas, HM Deputy Chief Inspector of Prisons, who signed off the report, said: “HMP Bronzefield was a very good and improved prison… The general environment was good and care was taken to keep the prison decent.\\"      According to the report, many of the inmates at Bronzefield may be seen as vulnerable. Around one third of the women reported having a disability and 44 per cent said they felt depressed or suicidal.      The figures raise concern over the amount of support available to ex-offenders undergoing rehabilitation.      HMP Bronzefield is a high-security prison for restricted status women. It holds up to 527 inmates at any one time, between the ages of 18 and 70.      The prison's director, Charlotte Pattison-Rideout, said: ”We work with local authorities and other organisations to ensure as many women as possible have suitable accommodation upon release from HMP Bronzefield, but it's an area where there's a shortfall that affects the whole of the prison estate.      “There has been a change in process at the local authority following the Localism Act which has been a factor in more women, unfortunately, leaving without immediate housing.      ”We are building links with the local community rehabilitation company who are now responsible for housing to ensure more women have support and accommodation upon release.“      The Shadow Prisons Minister said: “The improvement noted in this report is welcome but there remain very serious questions to be answered.“ ||||| Data crawled on behalf of Internet Memory Foundation .

In his first annual report, Peter Clarke said the \\"grim situation\\" revealed in last year's report was now \\"even worse\\" is some areas.      Reforms have been jeopardised by legal highs among inmates, he added.      New Justice Secretary Liz Truss said she was under \\"no illusions\\" about the scale of the challenge to bring reform.      Last year, the outgoing inspector said prisons were in their worst state for 10 years.      'Unpalatable truth'      Mr Clarke - who was appointed as chief inspector of prisons in January - said in some key areas the situation had got even worse since then.      We have an ambitious agenda to modernise the prison estate, improve education and empower governors, so that we can tackle issues like drugs and violence Liz Truss, Justice secretary      He said there was \\"a simple and unpalatable truth about far too many of our prisons\\", adding: \\"They have become unacceptably violent and dangerous places\\".      Last year, there were more than 20,000 assaults - 27% up on the previous year - with six homicides in the 12 months to April 2016.      Incidents of self-harm rose by a quarter in 2015 to more than 32,000.      Mr Clarke said a large part of the violence was linked to the harm caused by new psychoactive substances, often referred to as legal highs, which were having a \\"dramatic and destabilising effect\\".      The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman identified 39 prison deaths linked to the use of legal highs between June 2013 and June 2015.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Justice Secretary Liz Truss said prison reforms would \\"continue at pace\\"      However, Mr Clarke said there was still \\"no national strategy\\" for dealing with the problem of legal highs in prisons.      He said he had met prisoners who had \\"self-segregated\\" in order to escape the violence caused by legal highs.      While some aspects of the problem with legal highs were being addressed by criminalising possession and better use of technology to test for the drugs, it wasn't enough, he added.      \\"A very clear strategy is required to deal with this threat to our prisons,\\" he said.      'Ambitious agenda'      Ms Truss said she wanted to see \\"radical reform\\" but was under \\"no illusions about the scale of the challenge we face or how long reform takes\\".      She was appointed as the justice minister last week - replacing Michael Gove, who had announced a series of reforms for prisons.      She said: \\"We have an ambitious agenda to modernise the prison estate, improve education and empower governors, so that we can tackle issues like drugs and violence which are key to cutting reoffending and keeping staff and prisoners safe.\\"      Ms Truss said the report showed \\"why prison reform is so important\\", adding that she would \\"set out the next steps for this agenda in coming weeks\\". ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Women leaving HMP Bronzefield, a women's prison in West London, have been given tents and sleeping bags due to a lack of housing, according to a report by a prison watchdog.

Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple.

Title: Superbly done and highly entertaining Review: This film about a bank robber being pursued by the mob for monies that he unwittingly stole from them is one of the best pictures of the crime-chase genre that I have ever seen. Not only is the pace and suspense admirably sustained by the much underrated action film director Don Siegal, and moreover, with mordantly witty (almost Hitchcockian) touches throughout, but the characters all come across as highly distinctive, even idiosyncratic, instead of generic types (as is often the case in such films). Matthau shines in an effectively low key portrayal as the unassuming but ultimately crafty and resourceful crop duster pilot/bank robber, Charley Varrick, as does Joe Don Baker, who uses his hulking presence to come across as genuinely fearsome as the hit man, Molly (how do you like that as a choice of name for a villain?). Also, John Vernon is both sophisticated and sinister as the white-collar executive bagman for the mob.Highly recommended as a very fun watch. Is the review positive or negative?

He grew a beard; he shaved. He gained weight; he dieted. Plastic surgery reconfigured his looks.      Fearful that the Islamic terrorists he helped put behind bars wanted him dead, Salem carried concealed firearms and wore Kevlar vests. He kept a packed suitcase, ready to bolt into another life in another town. In the car, he kept a nervous eye on the rearview mirror and paused before turning the ignition, scared that the car might explode. Once late at night, he says, he mistook his son for an intruder and nearly shot him.      Two decades have passed since Salem went deep undercover for the FBI and infiltrated the terrorist cell behind the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. After the explosion, he helped the FBI bring charges against a related group of terrorists for a separate plot to blow up tunnels and bridges and other New York landmarks.

(Daniel Hulshizer / Associated Press) See more galleries      In that case, for 46 days in 1995, he testified as the government's star witness in a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan.      Then Salem disappeared.      He and his wife slipped away into a world of hiding — a lonely, stressful life, separated from old friends — and raised a son and a daughter who could not understand the dangers around them. The family bounced from state to state in the federal witness protection program.      Now at 64, with no job, no home equity and no pension, Salem decided to talk about his past.      He's hoping to recapture a splash of the old fame, notoriety and sense of purpose that made him one of the FBI's most valuable — and vilified — government informants.      He used his real name to start a website and to self-publish a memoir (with a second underway). He is trying to fashion himself as a consultant on the murky world of Islamic terrorism and undercover work. He gives seminars to law school students and FBI recruits.      After blowing through the 1 million he says he received from the U.S. government, Salem toiled as an innkeeper, sold jewelry wholesale, taught karate and scuba diving, ran a juice bar and worked as a masseur.      \\"I'm tired of all that,\\" said Salem, who agreed to two days of interviews at an open-air restaurant here on Florida's Gold Coast. \\"It is time for me to talk now. I was shut up for 20-some years.\\"      ::      Salem was born in Egypt, where he served in the military for 18 years, rising to the rank of army lieutenant colonel. In 1987, he emigrated to the United States. He worked in New York as a security guard at an off-Broadway hotel, and was recruited by the FBI to monitor hotel guests suspected of being Russian mobsters.      It is time for me to talk now. I was shut up for 20-some years. - Emad Salem, FBI informant      In time, the undercover assignments grew. When El Sayyid Nosair stood trial in New York for killing a militant rabbi in 1990, Salem infiltrated his supporters. Soon he became head of security for their leader, Omar Abdel Rahman, known as the blind sheik.      He says he has carried a good measure of guilt because shortly before the bombing of the World Trade Center, he refused to wear a hidden FBI microphone and dropped out of the undercover work. He told agents wearing a wire was too risky and might bring harm to him or someone in his family. He later regretted that decision, saying he could have saved the six lives lost in that attack.      \\"I could have stopped it,\\" he said. \\"But I failed.\\"      To ease that guilt, Salem volunteered in 1993 to return to the terrorist cell to try to nail the conspirators in the second plot to detonate New York landmarks, including the United Nations building. This time he wore a wire.      Salem's testimony in 1995 led to several convictions, including those of Abdel Rahman and Nosair. Both were given life sentences without parole.      \\"He really did care about trying to help this country,\\" said Andrew McCarthy, the lead federal prosecutor in Abdel Rahman's case. Salem, McCarthy said, was \\"patriotic and very brave.\\"      But McCarthy also said Salem sometimes made up stories about his exploits in Egypt and elsewhere. \\"And he had a bad relationship with the FBI, with the institution.\\"      Salem and his family were whisked into the federal protection program just moments after he left the witness stand.      \\"It all began abruptly, out of nowhere,\\" said his son, Tom Fox, now 31. \\"One day I was told I had an hour to get everything together, and we had to go. I packed a small, little suitcase. My clothes. A few toys. My little action figures, a little monster truck.\\"      Salem and his family found it difficult to leave their past behind.      Once, they were in a fancy steak restaurant when Salem saw a man who resembled a terrorist cell member. He hurried his family out.      Another time, his daughter blurted out his real name in school. The family moved, Salem said.      Not long ago in Florida, Salem said, he spotted a van behind his Surf N Spray hotel, with suspicious characters lurking inside. The sighting led him to relocate his family.      \\"We moved so many times, it became a habit,\\" his son said. \\"I can't remember it all.\\"      Salem says the family has lived in New Jersey, Minnesota, Tennessee, California and now Florida.      He still uses an alias in daily life and wants to change it once again to protect his real identity. He also wants to leave South Florida.      Before he went underground, Salem was described by friends and colleagues as distrustful and sometimes erratic. He secretly taped his FBI handlers and suggested they had ignored warning signs about a pending attack, allegations the FBI strongly denied.      Life in witness protection may have only heightened his anxieties.      His apartment is wired with a motion detector, though only he and his wife, Karin, live there now that the children have grown. He frequently checks a cellphone app that monitors any activity outside his house. The phone vibrates if someone approaches the front door.      He has installed the security measures himself. Once known as No. 6220 in the protection program, he says he lost his government protection after his sister moved back to Cairo, and U.S. law enforcement officials felt they could no longer guarantee his safety should someone learn his whereabouts through her.      He's certain Al Qaeda wants revenge. He can still hear the blind sheik in the courtroom, jumping to his feet and issuing a fatwa — a death sentence — against him. \\"You are Satan!\\" Abdel Rahman screamed at Salem.      Salem's attorney, Joseph Brien, cautioned him against going public. \\"The higher his profile, the bigger the target he will become,\\" Brien said. \\"There is still the fatwa with his name on it. It's still out there. The fanatics still have him in their sights.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Emad Salem, an undercover FBI informant who infiltrated a terrorist cell behind the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, shared his experiences living in hiding and the impact on his family over the past two decades.

Answer: Viewed functionally, infrastructure facilitates the production of goods and services , and also the distribution of finished products to markets , as well as basic social services such as schools and hospitals ; for example, roads enable the transport of raw materials to a factory . Question: what is Non-profit infrastructure A:","output":"Non-profit infrastructure refers to the underlying framework, resources, and systems that enable non-profit organizations to function effectively and efficiently in the pursuit of their mission and goals. This infrastructure plays a crucial role in supporting and strengthening the capacity of non-profit entities, allowing them to deliver programs and services that have a positive impact on their target communities and beneficiaries. Non-profit infrastructure is a multifaceted concept encompassing a wide range of components. Some key aspects include: 1. Organizational Structure: Non-profit infrastructure relies on a well-defined organizational structure, including a board of directors, executive management, staff, and volunteers. This structure helps guide the organization’s operations, decision-making, and overall strategic direction. 2. Financial Management: Efficient financial management systems are essential in the non-profit infrastructure. These systems involve budgeting, financial reporting, auditing, and compliance with reporting requirements and regulations, ensuring that the organization uses its resources responsibly and sustainably. 3. Fundraising and Resource Mobilization: Non-profit organizations rely heavily on external sources of funding, such as grants, donations, sponsorships, and other forms of support. A robust fundraising and resource mobilization structure enables them to secure the necessary funds to fulfill their mission. 4. Technology: Technology plays a vital role in non-profit infrastructure, providing tools for communication, data management, fundraising, and service delivery. Effective technology infrastructure includes hardware, software, databases, and systems that enable the organization to meet its objectives and requirements. 5. Human Resources: People are the backbone of any non-profit organization. Investing in talent acquisition, training, and retention is crucial for a strong non-profit infrastructure. This includes developing policies, procedures, and practices to support staff and volunteers in their roles. 6. Collaboration and Networking: Non-profit organizations often work in partnership with other entities, such as government agencies, businesses, educational institutions, and other non-profits. Establishing and maintaining strong networks and collaborative relationships are integral to the non-profit infrastructure, as they help to share resources, expertise, and best practices. 7. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Non-profit organizations operate within a specific legal and regulatory environment, which requires adherence to various laws, rules, and regulations related to tax-exemption status, governance, advocacy, and more. Ensuring compliance is essential to maintain credibility, public trust, and eligibility for funding. 8. Program Development and Evaluation: Non-profit infrastructure must support the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs and services that meet the needs of beneficiaries and align with the organization's mission. This involves continuous assessment, monitoring, and improvement to optimize impact and efficacy. 9. Communications and Marketing: Effective communications and marketing strategies help non-profits raise awareness about their work, engage stakeholders, and secure financial support. Non-profit infrastructure should include robust systems and tools for managing public relations, social media, branding, and other communication channels. 10. Governance and Leadership: A non-profit organization's infrastructure must also support strong governance and leadership. This includes creating a culture of accountability, transparency, and ethical conduct that guides decision-making and ensures alignment with the organization's mission and values. In conclusion, non-profit infrastructure is the backbone of any successful non-profit organization. It encompasses a range of interconnected components that collectively enable these organizations to fulfill their mission, maintain accountability, and create positive societal impact. By investing in and nurturing a robust non-profit infrastructure, organizations can strengthen their capacity to serve their communities and contribute to the greater good."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.

All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-236 and -240, which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244.

Writing poems to share with friends and relations was, like reading poems by the fireside, another way in which poetry has a place in everyday life. How did things change? Why are most Americans no longer comfortable with poetry , and why do most people today think that a poem has nothing to tell them and that they can do well without poems? There are, I believe, three factors: poets, teachers, and we ourselves. Of these, the least important is the third: the world surrounding the poem has betrayed   us more than we have betrayed the poem. Early in the twentieth century, poetry in English headed into directions unfavor-able to reading of poetry. Readers decided that poems were not for the fireside or the easy chair at night, and that they belonged where other difficult-to-read things belonged. Poets failed the reader, so did teachers. They want their students to know something about the skills of a poem, they want their students to see that poems mean something.

Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Prosecutors trying to prove that Oscar Pistorius murdered his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp appeared to have won a round on Tuesday morning, but it was the defense team that was smiling by the end of the day. Tuesday's testimony began with the expert who conducted the autopsy on Steenkamp, Gert Saayman. He backed two key points of the state's case. He estimated that Steenkamp had eaten about two hours before she died, which contradicts Pistorius' version of events, and he said that the victim would have been able to scream after the first two bullets hit her, as the prosecution argues. \\"I think it would be somewhat abnormal if one did not scream when sustaining a wound of this nature,\\" Saayman testified of the \\"particularly devastating\\" injury to","output":"Steenkamp's hip. Furthermore, Saayman stated that the third bullet, which struck Steenkamp's head, would have caused massive trauma and instant incapacitation, rendering her unable to respond, meaning any further shots would have been unnecessary. The prosecution used this testimony to argue that Pistorius' claim of mistaking Steenkamp for an intruder was false, as her screams should have been audible to him. However, as the trial progressed, the defense team, led by Barry Roux, began to poke holes in the prosecution's case. They focused primarily on forensic and ballistic evidence. Roux brought in an independent forensic expert, Dr. David Klatzow, who examined the ballistic and blood spatter evidence at the crime scene. Klatzow criticized the police's handling of the case, noting that many pieces of evidence had been contaminated. For instance, the position of the bullet casings had been disturbed during the investigation, making it difficult to reconstruct the exact sequence of events. Roux also successfully challenged elements of Saayman's testimony. He questioned several of the prosecution's expert witnesses, raising doubts about their conclusions. The defense argued that the meal Steenkamp supposedly ate two hours before her death could have been a snack rather than a full meal, possibly in response to a bout of insomnia. Roux also brought forth witnesses who testified that Pistorius, despite his disability, could easily have confused Steenkamp's screams for those of an intruder. As the trial drew to a close, there were few definitive answers regarding Pistorius' actions on that fateful night. Judge Thokozile Masipa, along with her assessors, deliberated for several weeks before delivering their verdict. In the end, Judge Masipa found Oscar Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide but acquitted him of premeditated murder. This decision came as a shock to many who had expected a murder conviction. The Judge cited a lack of conclusive evidence proving that Pistorius knowingly killed Steenkamp. Pistorius was sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, with the possibility of parole after serving at least one-third of his sentence. He began serving his sentence at the Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Center in Pretoria in October 2014. Reeva Steenkamp's family and the prosecution expressed disappointment with the verdict and sentence, viewing it as too lenient. The state went on to appeal the conviction and sentencing in the Supreme Court of Appeal. In December 2015, the original verdict was overturned, and the court found Pistorius guilty of murder, with the presiding Judge Lorimer Leach stating that the initial judgment had been \\"fundamentally flawed.\\" The case returned to the Pretoria High Court for sentencing, and in July 2016, Judge Masipa sentenced Pistorius to six years in prison. The state appealed the sentence again, calling it \\"shockingly lenient.\\" Ultimately, in November 2017, the South African Supreme Court of Appeal increased Pistorius' sentence from six years to 13 years and five months. As the legal process finally reached its conclusion, Oscar Pistorius remained in prison, his hopes of returning to the world of professional sports shattered. The tragic death of Reeva Steenkamp and the dramatic trial that followed will forever remain a pivotal moment in South African legal history, serving as a stark reminder of the complex issues surrounding crime, justice, and celebrity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unlike most bees which will sting   you only if they are disturbed  , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase   you for your life.

Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \\"The Angry Swarm\\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered.

Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded   me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: A much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever-declining spiral of domestic violence. At times difficult to watch, while Morris Day is portrayed as the misogynist, Prince as the knight on (motorcycle) steed, he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay. That he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing. Prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women, but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. Even further, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (admittedly the album's weakest track) and Darling Nikki - are shown as being songs that kill off an audience. Perhaps the only concession to the Princely ego is a card that lists the (slightly shorter than Prince) Apollonia as 5'6. The nearly complete-amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves (and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point), and do perfectly well under the direction. Morris Day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham, though Jerome Benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well, particularly their stage act, which is hilarious. Day and Benton even go so far as to make an Abbott and Costello routine funny, which takes some doing. Lastly, there's Prince. While I admit to bias, I do actually think he's a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low-key version of himself. Acting ISN'T his profession, this was a film made for entertainment, so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn't Robert DeNiro and thinking they're making a point is sadly deluded. I don't want this review to be a derisory attack of other people's comments, but I've even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit. How would a film about domestic violence be shot, then? With full overhead spotlights and a CGI dinosaur walking into frame?  The film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths, and this isn't some retro-recreation. Prince's best film with Oscar-winning music, it sees him at his zenith, and it's saddening to realise that, even though he would make some fine albums, he would never again capture this high.

It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Check out multiple restaurant menus. Start with soup. Go for steamed over fried. Always order a vegetable. Order brown rice. Make changes to the cooking methods.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Savor the Healthiest Meal: Tips for Ordering from Restaurant Menus Introduction: Dining out presents a cornucopia of flavors that is unmatched by homemade meals. But, the experience often seems daunting for health-conscious individuals who are trying to maintain their balanced diet plans. Worry not; the guide below will help you navigate restaurant menus and make the right choices that not only suit your palate but also keep your health in check. 1. Check out Multiple Restaurant Menus: With numerous dining options available, it's essential to explore multiple restaurant menus before you settle for one. Doing this lets you compare your choices from various cuisines, ensuring you have access to the most nutritious dishes. Moreover, researching beforehand can also provide an overview of the calorie count, ingredients, and portion sizes offered by different establishments. 2. Start with the Soup: Soups are an excellent way to kick off your culinary adventure without compromising on nutrition. They can act as a natural appetite suppressant due to their high water content, ensuring that you eat less during the main course. Soups also aid digestion, provide essential nutrients, and keep you hydrated. Opt for clear broths or vegetable-based soup rather than creamy versions that are laden with cream and butter. These low-calorie, nutrient-dense versions will fuel your body without adding unwanted pounds. 3. Go for Steamed Over Fried: While it is tempting to indulge in fried delicacies, prioritize steamed dishes when checking restaurant menus. Steamed foods generally contain fewer fats, oils, and calories, retaining greater amounts of essential nutrients without sacrificing taste. Steaming requires minimal added ingredients to cook, securing its spot as one of the healthiest cooking methods. Choose steamed items such as fish, vegetables, or dumplings to make your dining experience more nourishing. 4. Always Order a Vegetable: Incorporating vegetables into your meal is a must, as they boast vibrant colors, rich textures, and a myriad of nutrients. Vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber, assisting weight management and promoting healthy digestion. They also contain essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that boost your immune system and ward off chronic diseases. Try ordering vegetable-based side dishes, such as salads, grilled asparagus, or steamed broccoli, to enhance your meal's overall nutrition profile. 5. Opt for Brown Rice: When choosing your staple food, pick brown rice over white or fried rice. Brown rice is an unrefined, whole grain that contains more natural nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Its high fiber content helps maintain stable blood sugar levels, supports digestion, and keeps you full for longer periods. Additionally, the complex carbohydrates in brown rice provide a steady source of energy to keep you fueled throughout the day. 6. Make Changes to the Cooking Methods: Do not be afraid to ask for modifications to the dish's cooking method to make it healthier. For instance, request that your food be grilled, poached, or roasted rather than fried. Similarly, ask for a lighter touch on the sauce, using olive oil instead of butter, or serving the dressing or sauce on the side. These small adjustments can dramatically decrease the calorie content of the dish while preserving its delectable flavors. Conclusion: No longer does dining out have to be synonymous with unhealthy choices. Understanding restaurant menus and mindfully making decisions can ensure you enjoy a wholesome meal without worrying about derailing your health goals. Adhering to these simple guidelines can transform your culinary outings into nutritious and gratifying experiences, allowing you to savor every bite without guilt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a multiple-choice question and need to classify your answer as 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or 'e'. Let's break down the task into simple steps: 1. Read the problem: Two trains are traveling toward each other from Howrah to Patna and from Patna to Howrah. They start at the same time and meet at some point. After they meet, it takes one train 9 hours to reach Howrah and the other train 25 hours to reach Patna. 2. Determine the goal: Find the ratio of their speeds. 3. Solve the problem:    - When two objects move toward each other, their combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds.     - Let the speed of the train going from Howrah to Patna be S1 and the speed of the train going from Patna to Howrah be S2.    - Since the trains meet at some point, they would have traveled for the same amount of time before meeting each other. Let's call this time 't'.    - The distance covered by the first train before meeting the second train is S1 * t, and the distance covered by the second train is S2 * t.    - After meeting, the first train takes another 9 hours to reach Howrah. Since it's the same distance, we can write the equation: S1 * t = S2 * 9.    - Similarly, after meeting, the second train takes another 25 hours to reach Patna. So we can write the equation: S2 * t = S1 * 25.    - Dividing the two equations we have: (S1 * t) / (S2 * t) = 9 / 25. The t's cancel out, leaving us with: S1 / S2 = 9 / 25. 4. Compare the result with the given options:    - The ratio of their speeds is 9:25, but this ratio is not provided in the options.

Trump’s big speech only hurt him At a rally in Detroit Aug. 8, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outlined what he would do as president to take the U.S. economy to \\"amazing new heights.\\" (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Donald Trump’s speech at the Detroit Economic Club, if anything, only hurt him at a time he’s plunging in the polls. Here are seven reasons: 1. To put it bluntly, wonkish and intellectually honest Republicans of the type who would pay attention to an economic speech long ago figured out Trump is a fraud. They know his numbers don’t add up and his anti-globalism is bunk. Conservative Doug Holtz-Eakins called it an “incoherent mess,” blasting his “horrific ideas (renegotiating NAFTA, killing TPP, tariffs, and other anti-trade initiatives)” and chiding him for leaving out a list of critical issues. “No mention of federal debt or deficits. No mention of entitlement reforms. No mention of productivity, innovation, the internet, or new and online business models,” he observed. “Nothing, really, about the future. Just a call to return to the steel and cars of the industrial past.” So whom was Trump’s speech targeting? Surely, no one who knows much about economics. 2. Trump managed to confuse even those few people who liked his tax plan. The Post reported: Many tax experts said Trump’s latest speech reveals an even sketchier picture of his economic vision than previous proposals. “In general, it’s less clear of a tax plan than it was before,” said Ryan Ellis, a senior fellow at the Conservative Reform Network. First, Trump pitched new, less aggressive tax cuts and appeared to be backing away from his pledge to end tax liability for 75 million households. Then he introduced a proposal for an investment income loophole that could actually benefit hedge fund managers and suggested a tax break for child care that would do little for the lowest income earners. “He’s actually doing less for the middle class than he originally planned,” said Martin A. Sullivan, the chief economist at Tax Analysts. Ellis, who previously served as the tax policy director for Grover Norquist’s group Americans for Tax Reform, said Trump’s proposal to allow parents to deduct the cost of child care would provide no benefit to low income workers and single parents who are unlikely to have any tax liability to begin with. Republicans were supposed to oppose new deductions and special giveaways. 3. Trump’s fixation on the estate tax — which is applicable to only a tiny fraction of estates (north of 5.4 million) — is the sort of thing that applies to the hardcore, Wall Street-centric GOP base, not even to his own supporters. It’s the quintessential bone to the very, very rich. It’s perfect fodder for Hillary Clinton’s argument he is no friend of the working man. 4. Stilted reading off a teleprompter does not give voters or donors any confidence he has learned anything about policy. To the contrary, it emphasizes that he can sound mildly sane only when he is not saying what he really thinks. 5. Trump is still fixated on the media. Few people listen or hear a speech like this; he expects the media to report on it to persuade voters he has gotten his act together. The mainstream media, which is no longer friendly territory, (rightly) takes the opportunity to fact-check him. He never seems to have grasped that one cannot win a general election relying on the beneficence of free media. 6. Trump’s trade inanity only reaffirms his ignorance about economics. He in essence does not think the United States can really win in the international free market. It’s a loser’s attitude. He claims, “Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero, think of that, in 1993 to almost 60 billion today. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly 800 billion last year. Total trade deficit. Almost 800 billion. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.” This is nonsense, as countless economists, businesspeople and rational conservatives will tell you. (“It would be foolhardy to force American businesses and consumers to pay more and have less freedom to choose,” writes former trade rep Robert B. Zoellick. “Lower taxes on imports from trade deals save the average U.S. household about 10,000 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Yet Mr. Trump wants to impose steep tariffs to ‘win’ on trade.” 7. He still has virtually no serious policy ideas on issues many voters care about. He declared, “One of my first acts as president will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.” And replace it with what? Don’t ask! (Moreover, The Post’s fact-checkers explain the 2 million jobs figure isn’t what Trump thinks it is.) In sum, Trump’s gloom-and-doom message, far from telling us how we win again, says we cannot win. He rejects globalism, which has lifted billions of people out of poverty, provides a panoply of goods and services and maximizes benefits for those who can participate. Rather than help Americans compete (e.g., with job training, open markets), he’s the one ironically who wants to “rig the system” — with tariffs and barriers that make life tougher for the working and middle classes and economically nonproductive giveaways to the super-rich, people like him and his rich panel of economic advisers.

Write an article based on this summary: – Donald Trump's campaign is on damage control after one of the most damaging leaks in election history—but some commentators aren't sure if he'll be able to recover at all from the release of a 2005 \\"hot mic\\" tape in which he makes some very crude comments about women. The candidate is facing an almost unprecedented backlash from his own party, with some leading Republicans calling for him to step down as the nominee. A round-up of coverage: House Speaker Paul Ryan is one of scores of leading Republicans now trying to distance themselves from Trump, the Washington Post reports. He released a statement saying he is \\"sickened\\" by the comments—and Trump is no longer invited to a Wisconsin campaign event he was supposed to attend Saturday. CNN looks at how the old Access Hollywood tape made its way to the media at a very unfortunate time for Trump. Sources say a producer remembered the tape early in the week and, after digging it up mid-week, the show planned to air it Monday—but a copy made its way to the Washington Post first. CBS reports that Mike Pence has been refusing to answer reporters' questions about the tape. Reporters accompanying Pence were suddenly ushered out of a restaurant when the tape became public Friday. At a rally in Ohio that evening, Pence said that Trump emerges \\"still standing stronger than ever before\\" whenever he is targeted by the media. Republican fundraising chief Spencer Zwick tells the AP that he has been getting phone calls from donors who \\"want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the GOP nominee.\\" He says a write-in campaign \\"could actually work,\\" although some states don't allow write-in candidates. The Los Angeles Times reports that even Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who leads a pro-Trump super PAC and had his hands full dealing with Hurricane Matthew, found the time to denounce Trump's comments. \\"I'm not following politics closely right now, but this is terrible,\\" he said. \\"I don't agree with anyone talking like this about anyone, ever.\\" The New York Times takes a look at what it calls \\"the apology that wasn't.\\" Sources say Trump huddled with advisers, including daughter Ivanka, before issuing the brief—and defiant apology—late Friday. The insiders say aides urged Trump not to mention the Clintons in the apology, but their advice was ignored. NBC News has statements from many of the Republicans who have condemned the remarks, including RNC chief Reince Priebus. \\"It's over,\\" a GOP strategist and Trump supporter tells the network. \\"Never seen anything like it. Never will.\\" People reports that Billy Bush, the co-host heard making lewd comments along with Trump, says he is \\"embarrassed and ashamed and is sorry for \\"playing along\\" with Trump. Trump tells the Washington Post he's staying in the race. “I’d never withdraw. I’ve never withdrawn in my life,” he says, citing \\"tremendous support.\\"","output":"Donald Trump is in a lot of trouble because he said some really bad things about women a long time ago.

This is making a lot of people say bad things about Donald Trump and some people don't think he will be able to win the election anymore. A lot of his friends, like Paul Ryan and Mike Pence, are trying to stay away from him and not talk about what he said because it's very bad.

How to play football squares  Draw a 10x10 grid on a large poster board with a permanent marker.  You want each square to be large enough to record your players' initials and numbers. The grid should have 100 squares in all-1 for each player. Choose your answer from: - You can draw all the squares on the board for several different seasons. Then, you can continue drawing squares on the poster board or just draw a straight line across them.. - Draw your squares using a ruler or sponge to ensure that they are evenly spaced. Use adhesive fillers to make the grid more permanent.. - Ideally, you should have 100 players total, but this isn't a hard rule. Use a ruler to keep your lines straight as you draw.. - Again, when you make your chosen squares, it's not just you, but players and spectators who will be watching you play. Make two squares of each in your grid.. Answer:","output":"Draw your squares using a ruler or a straight edge to ensure that they are evenly spaced and uniform in size. This will make it easier for everyone to read and understand the grid. If possible, use adhesive fillers or laminating sheets to make the grid more permanent and protect it from damage. This way, the football squares board can be reused for multiple games, events, or seasons. Additionally, having a neat and clean-looking grid will make the game more enjoyable for players and spectators alike, as it will be easier to identify which squares belong to whom. Once the grid is set up, have players sign up to participate by writing their initials or names in their chosen squares. To make the game fair, limit each player to a certain number of squares (for example, three or four) so more people have a chance to participate. Now, you will need to assign random numbers to each column and row along the top and left edges of the grid, ranging from 0 to 9. Use a hat, data randomizer tool, or number generator to ensure the numbers are genuinely random. Write the numbers in the designated spaces outside the grid where everyone can see them. These numbers correspond to the last digit of each team's score during the game. For example, if the score of a game is 17-14 and you have the square corresponding to \\"7\\" on the top row and \\"4\\" on the side column, you would win that quarter or play. It is common to give out prizes after each quarter and have a larger prize for the final score. Throughout the game, players will be able to track the progression of numbers that match their squares. They can compare this with the current scores of the football game to determine if they are close to winning the round. Once a round is over and a winner has been declared, clear the current scores and start again for the next quarter. This process continues until all prizes have been awarded or the game ends. In summary, setting up and playing football squares requires a neatly drawn 10x10 grid, the participation of players in choosing their squares, the assignment of random numbers to each row and column, and the tracking of scores throughout the game to determine the winner for each round. This engaging and entertaining game can be played during various football events and seasons, providing excitement for both players and spectators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\".

Learning a language is not something that can be mastered quickly or easily; it requires dedication, practice, and continuous exposure to the spoken and written forms of the language. Discipline and a structured study routine play a crucial role in language acquisition. Moreover, making use of a variety of learning resources and methods can contribute to a more comprehensive and effective learning experience. For instance, actively engaging in conversation with native speakers, enrolling in a language course, leveraging multimedia resources (e.g., books, videos, or podcasts), and adopting a growth mindset are all essential ingredients for language-learning success.

Anthony is an English version of the Roman family name \\"Antonius,\\" which was derived from the Greek name \\"Antonios.\\" Throughout history, the name Anthony has held immense popularity and significance, especially due to its association with influential figures and noble Roman families. The Greek name \\"Antonios\\" is believed to have been derived from the ancient Greek word \\"anthos,\\" which means \\"flower\\" or \\"blossom.\\" This etymological link connects the name Anthony with the notion of beauty and growth. Additionally, some sources claim that the name could be linked to the Greek words \\"anti\\" and \\"eon,\\" meaning \\"against\\" and \\"time\\" respectively. In this context, the name Anthony could be interpreted as someone who is timeless or enduring. During the Roman Republic and Empire era, the name Antonius was associated with one of the most prominent and powerful families, the gens Antonia. The gens Antonia was one of the few Roman families to gain noble status, which they attained through their influence, political alliances, and successful military campaigns. The most famous member of this family was Marcus Antonius, known as Mark Antony in English, a Roman general and politician who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Throughout the spread of Christianity, the name Anthony gained further popularity due to the life and influence of Saint Anthony the Great, also known as Saint Anthony of Egypt. Born in the 3rd century, Saint Anthony was a Christian monk who is considered the founder of Christian monasticism. His life and teachings had a profound impact on the early Christian world and continue to inspire followers to this day. The prominence of St. Anthony in Christian history has contributed to the name's continued prevalence and adoption in various forms across different languages and cultures. The name Anthony, as it is commonly used today, mostly owes its popularity to the English-speaking world, where it has been a consistently favored name in the UK and the United States. Due to historical influences and the name's versatility, Anthony has various forms and equivalents in other cultures and languages, such as Antonio in Spanish and Italian, Antoine in French, Anton in German and Russian, and Antal in Hungarian, among many others.

Write an article based on this summary: As if nothing had changed, Welsh farmers will have risen early this morning to milk their cows or feed their stock.","output":"Title: The Timeless Tradition of Welsh Farmers: Rise and Shine to Feed and Nurture Introduction In the picturesque countryside of Wales, a daily ritual takes place. As the first light of day creeps over the horizon, Welsh farmers rise early to begin their day with a dedication to their stock. Milking cows and feeding animals mark the beginning of their daily tasks, and this tradition remains unchanged despite the ever-evolving world around them. This article aims to delve into the lives of Welsh farmers and showcase the significance of this age-old practice in today's modern world. A Timeless Routine: Welsh Farmers and Their Altruistic Animals Before the sun even breaks the horizon, Welsh farmers embark on their routine journey to their fields, barns, and stables. Their bond with their animals is palpable, with the understanding that without these hardworking farmers, their livestock would not be able to flourish. From the moment they step outside, the integrated relationship between human and animal is apparent. Cows, in particular, are creatures of habit. They, too, have adjusted their wake-up times to the familiar footsteps of their human caretakers. As the farmer's trusty companions, these animals depend on their morning ritual for nourishment and comfort. This collaboration between farmer and cow is essential for maintaining a healthy, productive relationship. Step 1: Preparing for the Day Before the farmer can begin the milking process or feed their other stock, there is a series of preparatory steps they must first complete. These include checking the overall health of the animals, cleaning milking utensils, and assessing any necessary equipment updates. Proper sanitation and maintenance are crucial to ensuring the well-being of animals and minimising the risk of infection or illnesses. Step 2: Milking the Cows Dairy farmers' expertise is on full display during the milking process, which remains a vital part of the economy in Wales and the United Kingdom. By maintaining a calm and structured atmosphere, farmers foster a sense of security, making it easier for cows to release milk. With the help of advanced milking equipment, farmers can optimize the milking process, improving both the efficiency and well-being of their animals. Step 3: Feeding Stock In addition to milking duties, Welsh farmers are responsible for feeding their stock a balanced and nutritious diet. The key is to ensure that they receive adequate nutrients for their specific needs, whether that's supporting lactation, growth, or health maintenance. This process usually involves mixing a carefully crafted blend of feed, hay, and L silage, specifically tailored to suit each animal's needs.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more minerals will form happens, how will it affect LESS minerals forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If more minerals are formed as per the perturbation hypothesis, it could potentially have an indirect effect on the process leading to less mineral formation. As the increased formation of minerals can alter the environmental conditions, such as the pressure, temperature, and the availability of magma, lava, and dissolved minerals in the water, these changes may affect the rate at which minerals are formed. For example, if more minerals are formed inside the crust, it might decrease the availability of magma, which could slow down the process of magma crystallization and mineral formation. Similarly, if more minerals are formed due to lava cooling and crystallization on the surface, it might make the environment less favorable for further mineral formation. Additionally, if there is an increased rate of dissolved minerals crystallizing from water, it might reduce the concentration of minerals in the water making it harder for more minerals to form. However, it is important to note that the perturbation hypothesis only proposes a possibility and specific details of how the environment might change would depend on factors such as the type of rock, chemical composition of the magma and water, and the temperature and pressure conditions. So, the actual effect of the perturbation on the process might vary in different situations, ranging from no significant effect to moderate or even strong impacts on the rate of mineral formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot.

Question: I have a new situation: Over the years, the town of Euphoria has grown more successful and wealthier than anyone ever thought. As the wealth has increased and people have acquired more material possessions, their outlook on life has become more positive and it has been noted that the citizens have a lower incidence of depression. The town of Zenphora, on the other hand, has taken a downward financial turn over the past 50 years. The citizens have had to sell their worldly goods just to make ends meet and many do not have a good feeling about what their future holds.  But I can use this background: Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013).[17] Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.  What is an answer for this question: Which town is more optimistic, Euphoria or Zenphora? Answer:","output":"Euphoria is the more optimistic town between the two. The background information provided shows a positive association between a country's wealth and its citizens' subjective well-being (SWB), which includes factors such as optimism, financial satisfaction, and material prosperity. Diener and colleagues found that income plays a significant role in people's evaluations of their lives and that life satisfaction generally increases as a country becomes wealthier over time. In the given situation, the town of Euphoria has experienced increasing wealth and success over the years. This has led to its citizens acquiring more material possessions and developing a more positive outlook on life. The reported lower incidence of depression in Euphoria also suggests its citizens have higher overall SWB. On the other hand, Zenphora has faced a downward financial turn, forcing its citizens to sell their possessions and feeling uncertain about their future. This financial downturn negatively impacts the SWB of Zenphora citizens, as they struggle to maintain personal material prosperity and financial satisfaction. Based on the research by Diener and colleagues and the respective situations of both towns, Euphoria appears to be the more optimistic town when compared to Zenphora."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. Last updated at 3:19 PM on 20th July 2011. Under pressure: David Cameron leaves Downing Street on his way to address the Commons about phone hacking. Rupert Murdoch's company was guilty of ‘deliberately thwarting’ the criminal investigation into the News of the World, according to a hard-hitting report published today. The Home Affairs Select Committee study ‘deplores’ the behaviour of News International and condemns the police for bungling their investigation and getting too close to the Murdoch empire. The report raises questions about the honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Andy Hayman, who oversaw the original 2006 police probe of the newspaper. The development came before David Cameron made an emergency statement on the scandal to the House of Commons. He faced questions from MPs about his party's links to phone hacking suspect Neil Wallis. The Prime Minister arrived home from a. shortened trip to Africa last night as it was revealed that his. communications chief Andy Coulson, had been advised by Mr. Wallis in the run-up to the general election. In. a further extraordinary development, Labour MP Chris Bryant today. hinted that the Queen may have told Mr Cameron not to hire Mr Coulson. Mr Bryant told the BBC: 'Very senior. people at Buckingham Palace were very troubled by the appointment of. Andy Coulson and tried to make it absolutely clear to the Prime. Minister. 'I am not sure whether this information ever got directly to the Prime. Minister, but it certainly got to senior figures at Downing Street. 'The Queen's grandchildren had their phones hacked. And quite probably. other members of the Royal Household ... I think it would be perfectly. natural for very senior members of the Royal Family to be very troubled. about the appointment. 'After all, Andy Coulson was the editor of the. News of the World when the royal princes' phones were hacked. That is. not in dispute. Morning after the night before: Rupert Murdoch left his house today reading the front page of his paper The Times which covers his appearance at the Commons select committee. 'And Andy Coulson resigned from the News of the. World expressly because of the hacking of the royal princes' phones.' Mr Bryant did not name the Queen directly. His claim prompted a furious denial from Downing Street. A No 10 source said the allegation was 'scurrilous' and 'complete rubbish'. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt leaves the House of Commons after Rupert Murdoch and his son James gave evidence. Today he defended the Prime Minister's handling of the scandal. In his statement Mr. Cameron will announce the names of the panel that will. look at press regulation and the final terms of reference for the. judge-led inquiry into claims about phone hacking and illegal payments. to police. But, after the Murdochs, Rebekah Brooks and senior police. officers were grilled in an extraordinary series of Commons committee. hearings, the Prime Minister will now be in the firing line. Aides. have indicated that he expects to be questioned by MPs on the admission. last night that Coulson, ex-News of the World editor, was received help. from Wallis, former deputy editor at the same newspaper. Both men have. been arrested and bailed in connection with the Scotland Yard hacking. inquiry. A senior Cabinet minister defended Mr  Cameron's handling of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal today as the Prime Minister prepared to face a barrage of MPs' questions over his role in the affair. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied that the continuing political firestorm represented the biggest crisis of Mr Cameron's premiership so far. But he acknowledged that the Prime Minister needed to demonstrate he was capable of the leadership needed to sort out the crisis which has rocked politicians, police and the media. He said Mr Cameron 'didn't have a crystal ball\\" but has made big decisions 'to sort this out'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'What we've seen is that he's recalled Parliament, he's got an independent police inquiry, he's got an independent judge-led inquiry, he's published all the meetings he's had with media owners and said in the future ministers will publish all the meetings that they have with media proprietors, so he's done more in a couple of weeks than I think any other prime minister has done in a couple of decades and I think that is the key judgment call that the people of Britain will be looking for him to make.' Mr Hunt added the Murdochs' committee hearing had shown that 'so much wrongdoing seemed to happen without the knowledge of the people at the top'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'But it does seem like a huge amount was going wrong in that organisation and no one felt it necessary to tell the person at the top, and I think that was something that will have worried a lot of people.' The report raises issues about the honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, left. It also said the conduct of former assistant Met commissioner Andy Hayman, right, during the investigation and 'during our evidence session was both unprofessional and inappropriate’ Scotland Yard's current communications chief Dick Fedorcio, left, was also criticised for apparently showing 'no due diligence' in conducting proper checks on Neil Wallis, right, the ex-News of the World deputy editor. The Conservatives disclosed yesterday. that former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis had given. informal advice to Andy Coulson when he was Mr Cameron's communications. director in the run-up to the general election. The role of Mr Wallis - who was. arrested last week by police investigating the phone-hacking allegations. - was already under scrutiny after it was disclosed that he had been. working for Scotland Yard as a part-time PR consultant. In a further twist, Downing Street. released emails yesterday showing that Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed. Llewellyn had prevented senior police officers briefing Mr Cameron on. the phone-hacking investigation. He wrote to Assistant Commissioner. John Yates telling him 'we will want to be able to be entirely clear,. for your sake and ours, that we have not been in contact with you about. this subject'. Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell. ruled last night that Mr Llewellyn had acted 'entirely properly' but the. disclosure is likely to increase the pressure on the Prime Minister. He is already facing demands to. apologise for appointing Mr Coulson after he quit as News of the World. editor in 2007 after royal reporter Clive Goodman and private. investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for hacking the phones of royal. aides. The Home Affairs Select Committee said in its withering assessment today: ‘We deplore the response of News International to the original investigation into hacking. ‘It is almost impossible to escape. the conclusion that they were deliberately trying to thwart a criminal. investigation. We are astounded at the length of time it has taken for. News International to co-operate with the police.’ The. report points out that Mrs Brooks’s denial of knowledge of phone. hacking ‘is limited to her time as editor of News of the World’, a small. part of her career in News International. Holding hands, Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi leave Parliament after yesterday's hearing. And. it also raises concerns about her knowledge of illegal payments to. corrupt police officers. ‘She did not say that she had no knowledge of. specific payments but that she had not intended to give the impression. that she had knowledge of specific cases,’ the MPs conclude. The committee condemns the police,. singling out former assistant Met commissioner Mr Hayman,  criticising. his handling of the case, his social contacts with News International. executives and his decision to take a job with the firm after leaving. the police. It said:. ‘Mr Hayman’s conduct during the investigation and during our evidence. session was both unprofessional and inappropriate.’ There was also criticism in the. report for Dick Fedorcio, Scotland Yard's current communications chief,. for apparently showing 'no due diligence' in conducting proper checks on. Neil Wallis. Mr Wallis,. an ex-News of the World executive, was employed by the Met in 2009 and. was last week questioned about phone hacking allegations. The committee said it was. 'particularly shocked' by Mr Fedorcio's approach to hiring Wallis and. said he tried to deflect blame on to Mr Yates. MPs called for extra funding to support Operation Weeting, saying it would take years to inform all potential victims without it. They praised Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers' decision to contact all potential victims of phone hacking by the News of the World. But they said they were 'alarmed' that only 170 had have so far been informed, adding that 'up to 12,800 people may have been affected.' David Cameron chats to a mother about her twins during a visit yesterday to an immunisation clinic in Lagos, Nigeria. The Prime Minister cut short his visit to Africa so he could make a statement to the House of Commons today. ● Police officers will be jailed for accepting cash bribes from News of the World journalists, MPs were told yesterday. The newspaper is alleged to have paid tens of thousands of pounds to officers who supplied information. Asked by MPs on a parliamentary committee if any officers would go to prison, the outgoing assistant  commissioner of the Met Police, John Yates, replied: ‘If the corruption cases, which are very small in number, are properly investigated, I have no doubt.’ Mr Yates resigned from the force on Monday after he was told he faced suspension over his links to the newspaper. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article talks about a report that accuses Rupert Murdoch's company of blocking the investigation into the News of the World phone hacking scandal. The report from the Home Affairs Select Committee also criticizes the police for not handling the investigation well.

Summarize the following: Most dead skin build-up occurs in and around your bed because you spend so much time there. This attracts dust mites and accumulates allergens. You will want to have multiple blankets, sheets and pillowcase covers to switch out with. Wash all blankets, sheets, pillow cases, bed covers and other bedding with detergent in hot water at a minimum of 131°F weekly to kill dust mites and remove allergens. High water temperature can kill dust mites better than just using detergent. Also wash curtains.  Set your washing machine to its hottest setting.  If the water isn't hot enough, check your hot water heater. Most hot water heaters have an adjustable knob to change the maximum temperature.  If you can't wash bedding in hot enough temperatures, throw them in the dryer for at least 15 minutes at a temperature above 130 °F to kill mites. Afterward, wash and dry the bedding so allergens are removed.  You could also dry items in direct sunlight. Use a product that contains essential oils, like eucalyptus, cedar or tea tree oil to add to the wash's effectiveness.   Using detergent plus bleach will remove most allergens and a significant amount of dust mites, even in cold or warm water. Items can be washed again to reduce mite levels further.   Know that live mites can be transferred from mite-infested items to mite-free items during washing.  Hot tumble dry items for an extra half an hour after drying or dry clean items to kill dust mites. This will not get rid of the allergen dust mites produce, however. Vacuum everything that you can, including couches, mattresses, armchairs, floors, mattresses and other places where people frequently sit or lay down on. To trap allergens effectively, your vacuum should have a double-layered microfilter bag or a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. This is important because it helps ensure that dust is not recirculated into the air.  Vacuuming removes surface dust but can't remove most dust mites and dust mite allergens. Mites are tiny enough to pass through the vacuum cleaner bag. However, vacuuming keeps dust down so these areas aren't as attractive to mites. Get underneath and behind furniture to keep \\"dust bunnies\\" from forming. If you have severe allergies, leave the area being vacuumed and let someone else do the work. Stay away from the vacuumed room for about two hours to let everything settle. Keep your vacuum serviced so that it continues to work well. Use a water vacuum to keep mites inside the water container so you can dump the water into your toilet and flush it. You may wish to wear a mask when you vacuum to avoid inhaling allergens. Even if you don't have allergies, it's best to leave the house for about half an hour after vacuuming for the remaining dust and allergens to settle. Steam cleaning dissolves dirt and grime, removes germs from surfaces and kills dust mites. However, the moisture that accumulates in carpet padding from steam cleaning creates an ideal environment for dust mites. Think about using dry cleaning methods instead. Feather dusters and dry cloths will stir up allergens into the air. Use a damp or oiled mop, rag or electrostatic cloths to clean hard surfaces once a week. This will help keep dust and dust mites down. Whether you packed up clothing for a move or it's starting to get cold for winter, wash all these items before using them. Dust mites love to settle into the fibers of unused and unwashed clothing and blankets as they collect dust in storage. Washing them ensures that both mites and allergens are destroyed so you can enjoy your items sneeze-free.","output":"Dead skin build-up in and around the bed attracts dust mites and allergens. To reduce this, wash bedding weekly in hot water (minimum 131°F) with detergent, and consider using products containing essential oils or bleach for added effectiveness. If washing in hot water isn't possible, use a dryer or sunlight exposure to kill mites before washing. Be aware that live mites can transfer during washing, so hot tumble dry or dry clean items to eliminate them. Vacuum all surfaces with a HEPA filter-equipped vacuum to minimize allergens, but be prepared to leave the area for some time after vacuuming. Steam cleaning can kill dust mites but may create a moist environment suitable for their growth, so consider dry cleaning instead. Use damp or oiled cleaning tools for hard surfaces weekly, and remember to wash stored clothing and blankets before use to eradicate mites and allergens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsjöbygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden.  - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot.  - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.  - The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.  - Since the United States was recognized as an independent country in 1783, it first established diplomatic relations with Norway in 1818 when Jonathan Russell was accepted as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden and Norway. From 1814 to 1905, Sweden and Norway were in a personal union. Although each country was fully sovereign, they had a common foreign policy and diplomatic service. The United States Ambassador to Sweden thus was the US representative to Norway as well as Sweden. In 1905 Sweden and Norway peacefully separated and Norway continued to be an independent constitutional monarchy. On November 14, 1905, the US State Department instructed Ambassador Charles H. Graves to handle affairs for Sweden and Norway separately and the Ambassador was thus commissioned to Norway equally with Sweden, though he remained in Stockholm.  - Charles Hinman \\"C. H.\\" Graves (August 14, 1839  October 7, 1928) was an American army officer, politician, and diplomat.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.  - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast.

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - This is a list of Ambassadors of the United States to Finland.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya.  - The United States Ambassador to Sweden serves as the official diplomatic representative of the President and the Government of the United States of America to the King and the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden. Diplomatic relations between Sweden and the United States began with the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1783.   - Härjedalen is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" in the centre of Sweden. It borders the country of Norway as well as the provinces of Dalarna, Hälsingland, Medelpad, and Jämtland. The province originally belonged to Norway, but was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Brömsebro, 1645.  - Mark Evans Austad ( April 1 , 1917 -- October 20 , 1988 ) , was an American radio and television commentator in Washington D.C. ( under the name Mark Evans ) , and served under the Ford administration as United States Ambassador to Finland in 1975 to 1977 and under the Reagan administration as United States Ambassador to Norway from 1981 to 1984 .  - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938).  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.

The Lions entered the game looking to sweep a season series from the Bears for the first time since 2007, and did so. Chicago scored on the game's opening possession when Jay Cutler capped a 65-yard drive with a 32-yard TD pass to Brandon Marshall. The Lions tied the game at 7 later in the first quarter when Matthew Stafford found Kris Durham in the back of the end zone with a 5-yard TD pass. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Stafford hit Calvin Johnson with a 4-yard TD pass to put the Lions up 14-7. The Bears narrowed the lead to one point with Robbie Gould field goals of 25 and 32 yards. With 2:22 left in the game, Stafford and Johnson connected again, this time on a 14-yard TD pass play, putting the Lions up 21-13.  Josh McCown, who relieved an injured Cutler, led the Bears on a 74-yard TD drive, capped by an 11-yard pass to Brandon Marshall for the score. Needing a two-point conversion to tie the game, McCown's pass to Dante Rosario sailed out of the end zone, but Detroit's Willie Young was called for roughing the passer, giving the Bears another chance from the 1-yard line. The Bears attempted a rushing play for the conversion, but Nick Fairley tackled Matt Fort&#233; behind the line of scrimmage, ending the Bears hopes.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ford, GM see Barrett-Jackson as great place to sell new cars Updated: 4:10 p.m. ET with stats on GM test drives. If you want to sell cars, you couldn't find a more receptive audience than the mostly middle-aged men prowling the auto auctions in Scottsdale this week. At least that's what Ford and General Motors think. Both have made big investments in showing off their latest models at the Barrett-Jackson auction, including a test-drive lot. Yesterday alone, Ford gave 400 test drives. And to attract a crowd, Ford had a promotion in which participants could drag race a pair of Mustangs tethered to dynos. Not to be outdone, GM signed up nearly 2,000 drivers through Friday to test drive one of its new models, such as a Chevrolet Equinox or Buick LaCrosse, then take a spin in a Chevrolet Corvette with a driving instructor at their side. \\"We want people to interact with our cars,\\" said Ford spokesman Robert Parker. And it pays off. Last year Ford's display resulted in sales of seven Mustang GT500KRs, some very expensive pony cars. Tim Stoehr, the sales operation manager for Ford in Phoenix, said he thinks at least three have been sold this year. Ford's president of the America's, Mark Fields, was due to attend today. GM design chief Ed Welburn arrived last night. The presence of both executives underscores how seriously automakers take the auctions. GM, for its part, was showing off the Chevrolet Volt and other models. Both automakers have their displays in a place where enthusiasts have to walk through them to get to the auction floor.

Option A: வெள்ளலூர்  Option B: குனியமுத்தூர்  Option C: கரூர்  Option D: பேரூர் A:","output":"The statement is about the course of the Noyyal River in Tamil Nadu which starts from the Velliangiri hills and further flows through several places before merging with the Kaveri river near Noyyal village near Karur. The masked word is a place through which the river flows from West (கிழக்கு நோக்கி translates as 'towards the west'). All the four options are names of places. On examining the sentences before and after the MASK, we can see that these places are listed in the order that the river flows through them.  Option A: Vellalur (வெள்ளலூர்) - is already mentioned after the MASK, in the list of places, hence cannot be it. Option B: Kuniamuthur (குனியமுத்தூர்) - is also mentioned after the MASK in the list, hence this also cannot be it. Option D: Perur (பேரூர்) - is not mentioned anywhere in the statement. However, knowing that Perur is in the east of Coimbatore not in the western region which the river flows through, this can also be eliminated. Option C: Karur (கரூர்) - is mentioned at the end of the statement and it's the final place where the river merges with the Kaveri. But Karur is located east of Coimbatore, and here we are talking about the places which the river flows through from west. Since the statement is specifically mentioning places where the river flows from West of Coimbatore, logically we need a place name that falls to the west of Coimbatore. None of the places provided in the four options is located west of Coimbatore.

Wrap the washcloth or paper towel around your index finger, dampen it, and add toothpaste if you have some. Brush your teeth as if using a toothbrush: begin at the gums and work down, cleaning each individual tooth with a circular motion.  Don’t forget to brush your tongue. Rinse your mouth thoroughly when done, swishing back and forth. Before there were toothbrushes, most people brushed their teeth with twigs. In many parts of the world, they still do, using twigs from oak, arak, or neem trees. Research shows that twigs from the arak tree contain natural fluoride and antimicrobial agents, and brushing with them is as or more effective as brushing with a toothbrush and toothpaste.  Pick a young, flexible branch about 6 to 8 inches long (15 to 20 cm). You want one without real bark, only a thin skin.  Peel the skin off and chew on one end of the stick until the fibers separate, turning the end into a little brush. Use it to brush your teeth.  You can also use a toothpick to clean between teeth, but use caution so as not to hurt your gums and make them bleed. If no paper towels, washcloths, or twigs are at hand, you can always use your finger. Be sure to wash your hands very well first, then use your index finger as you would a toothbrush: begin at the gums and work down for the upper arch and work up for the lower arch, cleaning each individual tooth with a circular motion.

The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.

For example, the story might explore the events leading up to Fact3 (Satyananda's path of righteousness) and describe how the men ended up in jail. Example Story: Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived two friends named Rama and Krishnulu. Although they were not related by blood, their friendship was so strong that it could only be described as a story of bond, not blood (Fact1). Rama was the son of a righteous man named Satyananda, who always upheld justice (Fact2). He was a respected judge in the village and never hesitated to make difficult decisions. Satyananda's unwavering commitment to the path of righteousness had its consequences (Fact3). One fateful day, a group of men who had been jailed by him decided to seek their revenge. They attacked his family, murdering Satyananda's beloved wife and daughter. The news shook the village, leaving everyone heartbroken and afraid. In the same village, there lived a young orphan named Mahesh (Fact4). He had lost his parents at a very young age and had to fend for himself. Never having experienced the love and care of a family, Mahesh was determined to help others in need. He would often steal food and other essentials from the wealthy people in the village and distribute them to the poor. However, Mahesh's actions eventually caught the attention of the same group of men that had murdered Satyananda's family. These men had also killed Mahesh's mother and sister, leaving him all alone in the world (Fact5). Initially, they wanted to kill Mahesh too, but upon learning about his stealing from the wealthy to feed the poor, they formed a twisted sense of respect for him and decided to let him live. Time went on, and Rama, devastated by the loss of his mother and sister, decided to bring the murderers to justice. With the help of his loyal friend Krishnulu, they started gathering evidence against the group of men. Meanwhile, Mahesh continued his Robin Hood-esque endeavors, helping the poor in the village and keeping himself safe from the savage men. As his reputation grew, the villagers began looking up to him as a hero. Rama and Krishnulu, recognizing Mahesh's noble intentions, decided to join forces with him in their quest for justice. Together, they worked tirelessly to ensure that the murderers were brought to trial and faced the consequences of their heinous actions. The combined efforts of Rama, Krishnulu, and Mahesh led to the arrest and conviction of the group of men, bringing peace and justice back to their village. Thus, the story of Rama, Krishnulu, and Mahesh became a legendary tale of friendship and the power of righteousness. Their bond, not by blood but by their shared values and love for their village, had transformed the fate of everyone who lived there.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Step 1: Gather Ingredients and Tools To make a cold cut sandwich, you will need a variety of ingredients. These include: - Bread of your choice (whole grain, white, rye, etc.) - Cold cuts of your choice (turkey, ham, roast beef, etc.) - Cheese of your choice (cheddar, swiss, provolone, etc.) - Condiments of your choice (mayonnaise, mustard, etc.) - Vegetables of your choice (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, etc.) - A knife to cut your ingredients and spread the condiments - A cutting board It's crucial to have all of these ingredients and tools ready before you start. This will make the assembling process quicker and more efficient. Step 2: Prepare the Bread Take out two slices of bread and place them on your cutting board. The bread serves as the base of your sandwich, encasing all of the other ingredients. If you want, you can lightly toast your bread to add extra flavor and texture.  Step 3: Spread the Condiments Using your knife, spread your selected condiments (like mayonnaise and/or mustard) onto one or both of your slices of bread. This step adds flavor to your sandwich. The condiments also act as a sealant to prevent the bread from getting soggy. Step 4: Add the Cold Cuts Place your chosen cold cuts on one piece of bread. The amount is up to you, but typically, two to three slices are used. This protein will be the main flavor component of your sandwich. Step 5: Add the Cheese Place your cheese on top of the cold cuts. The cheese is another key flavor component and can also help to hold the sandwich together. Step 6: Add the Vegetables Place your chosen vegetables on top of the cheese. This can include lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. Adding vegetables to your sandwich provides key nutrients, adds refreshing crunch, and helps to balance out the heavier flavors of the cold cuts and cheese. Step 7: Put the Sandwich Together Place the second piece of bread on top of the stack of ingredients. Press down lightly to ensure everything stays together. Step 8: Cut the Sandwich Using a knife, cut your sandwich in half or in quarters, whichever you prefer. This makes the sandwich easier to eat and also allows you to see all your layers of ingredients. Now your cold cut sandwich is ready to be served. This kind of sandwich is versatile, easy to make, and handy for quick meals or to-go lunches. You can customize it to your preferences, making it a sandwich you'll always enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Wieder ein Talent auf dem Chartgrill verheizt . Grundgütiger, bei Lisa Bund wäre doch nun wirklich Zeit gewesen, in Ruhe ein Album heranreifen zu lassen, dass ihrer Stimme und Ausstrahlung angemessen ist.  Stattdessen bekommt sie ein Album von der Stange, bei dem jeder Ton pure Berechnung ist. Offenbar lag die Schublade \\"Kelly Clarkson\\" am nächsten zum vorbereiteten Image, also bekommt sie soften amerikanischen Radiorock mit glatten Gitarren und Refrains aus der Klonfabrik.  Es bleibt ein pelziger Geschmack von angestaubtem Achtziger-Rock a la Bonnie Tailer, Heart oder Cher, zumeist bräsig aufgemotzt und mit schlaffen Drums umterlegt.  Das ganze zieht dermaßen lustlos an einem vorbei, dass man in Gedanken schon die Alben von Pink oder Avril Lavigne in der Hand hat (denn beide werden ausgiebig nachgeäfft.)  Wie schon bei Monrose bleibt zwischen all dem Produktionsbling kaum Platz für die Stimme, die hier langweilige Melodien für Millionen zu Gehör bringt.  Also ist der erste Stern für Ihre Stimme, der zweite dafür, \\"Flugzeuge im Bauch\\" mit auf das Album zu nehmen.  Bleibt zu hoffen, dass sie mit dem Album soviel Geld verdient, dass sie beim nächsten Mal die rauhe, ehrliche und verletzliche Platte macht, die uns ihre Stimme längst versprochen hat.  Bis dahin schüttelt man den Kopf, wie die Musikindustrie ihre mühsam ausgesiebten Talente mit nichtssagender Dutzendware verheizt. Student:","output":"Based on my understanding of the task, I have to analyze the given text for its sentiment. As the text is in German, I will first translate it to English using a reliable translator, and I will try to perceive the general tone of the review. Translation: They have wasted yet another talent on the charts. God, it would really have been time to let Lisa Bund's album mature in peace, which would have been appropriate for her voice and charisma. Instead, she gets an off-the-rack album where every note is a pure calculation. Apparently, the \\"Kelly Clarkson\\" drawer was the closest to the prepared image, so she gets soft American radio rock with smooth guitars and choruses from the clone factory. A furry taste of dusty eighties rock a la Bonnie Taylor, Heart, or Cher remains, mostly stuffy upped and underlaid with limp drums. The whole thing passes by so listlessly that you already have the albums of Pink or Avril Lavigne in mind (both are extensively mocked.) As with Monrose, there is hardly any room for the voice amid all the production bling, here it brings boring melodies for millions to listen to. So, the first star is for her voice, the second for taking \\"planes in the stomach\\" onto the album. Let's hope that she earns so much money with the album that next time she makes the rough, honest, and vulnerable record that her voice has long promised. Until then, shake your head as the music industry wastes its painstakingly sifted talents with meaningless off-the-rack goods. From this translation, it appears the reviewer is critical of the music product, mentioning it as 'meaningless off-the-rack goods', 'boring melodies', mocks other artists, and mentions a lack of room for the artist's voice. They do give some credit for the artist's voice and hope for better in the future, but overall, this seems to be negative.

An example of a chain is: \\"pesticides cause pollution\\" (fact1) + \\"pollution can harm animals\\" (fact2) → \\"pesticides can harm animals\\" (conclusion fact). Parts of the concluding fact overlap with the first and the second fact. To construct such a  concluding fact, a useful way is to borrow the subject from one fact and the ending conclusions from another fact. Q: Fact 1: satellites are used to take images from space.

Should I validate this answer? Available options: [I] No; [II] Yes; Answer:","output":"Option I: No The suggested answer appears to be incomplete and does not adequately address the given question. The provided answer addresses the removal process of waxing but does not provide any information about the duration of the results.  A more appropriate answer would be as follows: A back waxing procedure, which involves removing hair from the back using wax, will provide varying results depending on the individual's hair growth cycle, hair type, and other factors. On average, the results of back waxing can last anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks. However, this duration may vary among individuals and can be affected by factors such as the person's genetics, hormones, and lifestyle. It is essential to note that hair growth is typically slower following a waxing procedure, and the hair that grows back may appear finer and less noticeable. Regular waxing may also lead to a more prolonged duration between sessions as the hair growth may slow down over time. However, the duration within which a person needs to have their back waxed again can vary and is ultimately dependent on their personal preferences and hair growth patterns. In summary, the results of a back waxing last on average from 4 to 6 weeks, depending on various factors, such as the individual's hair growth cycle, hair type, genetics, and lifestyle.

He deliberately cuts his cheek and then hands the blade to his son Amsterdam, who is about to wipe off the blood. Vallon tells him to leave it there, and his son puts away the blade in a black pouch with a sliver cross clasp. Vallon then says a prayer to St. Michael, puts a medallion over Amsterdam's head, grabs a steel cross, and marches out of his cave with Amsterdam. They walk past people making and finishing weapons, including a woman with clawed gloves named Hellcat Maggie. Vallon, his son, and the rest take communion as they continue exiting the caves. They finally reach the top level of an old brewery. They stop and Vallon asks a man named Monk if he will join them. Monk says he'll fight for pay. Vallon promises him ten dollars for every \\"new notch\\" on his club, so Monk agrees, picks up his wooden club, and kicks open the door, revealing a snow-covered intersection known as Paradise Square, the Five Points of Lower Manhattan.Vallon and his crew, the Dead Rabbits, leave the brewery and make their way onto the street.

A few moments later, men dressed in blue, The Natives, led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a ruthless New Yorker with a glass eye, walk onto the street, clearly outnumbering the Rabbits. Bill says that the ensuing fight will decide who holds the rule of the Five Points; Bill's mob who are Protestant or Vallon's Catholics. Vallon recants that it's a free country, that he and his immigrant crowd have been harassed incessantly by Bill and his men. The Rabbits are then joined by several other gangs that have allied themselves with Vallon, greatly increasing their numbers.Moments later, they begin fighting.

A fluffy kitten, spotted piglet and duckling all exit the box one by one to the surprise of the family. The 60-second video clip from McVitie's stars adorable puppies, kittens, a hedgehog, piglet and a reindeer. Created by Grey London, the advert features the McVitie's Victoria biscuit selection before a host of animals appear from the blue pack. It is the first Christmas advert created by the biscuit company in more than 30 years and will air for the first time today (Thursday, 4 4) at 7.42pm on E4. The group of cute creatures includes an Alaskan malamute puppy, piglet, Persian kitten, rabbit, duckling, ginger kitten, pug puppy and a baby hedgehog. Along with a reindeer calf and even a narwhal - a tusked whale - all the animals emerge from the box. An adorable malamute puppy clambers up the armchair in an attempt to wake up the snoozing granddad. Tangled up in Santa's hat, the spotted piglet is just one of the many baby animals appearing in the advert. United Biscuits Sweet Biscuits marketing director, Sarah Heynen said: 'The launch of McVitie's Victoria on our TV screens this Christmas marks another momentous occasion for McVitie's at the end of what has been a highly successful year for us.

It has seen the company invest some £12million into the adverts in a bid to modernise and increase the brand's profile.

Article: The London Underground (The Tube) The main source of public transport in London revolves around the Underground (or the Tube as it is known to Londoners). This network of 12 lines can get you to most places in the center of the city quickly. It's most necessary to get an Oyster Card or a Travelcard. Single tickets are priced starting at the intentionally absurd   price of PS 4.80 (Zone 1-3), if you pay cash. Using an Oyster card, a single fare is PS 2.30 if you are traveling within the central Zone 1. On hot days it is also advisable to take a bottle of water with you as Underground trains are not air-conditioned. Last trains leave central London at around 00:30 weekdays, 23:30 Sundays. First trains leave the suburbs at around 5:00. The Bus System Outside the center of London, Tube stations are farther apart, so buses help fill the gaps. Also, the bus offers a cheaper alternative, even if it is a slower journey. Cash fares for London buses have been abolished -- you cannot pay cash. A bus fare costs PS 1.50 if using only buses, the fare is capped at PS 4.40 per day for Oyster or contactless users. River Services There are a number of different routes along the River Thames. The faster commuter services operate all day from Greenwich Pier to Embankment and from Putney and Chelsea harbour to Blackfriars during Peak Hours only. These routes will pass a number of places of interest including the Houses of Parliament and London Bridge. A return fare from Putney to Blackfriars will cost about 12 pounds. National Rail Once you leave Central London or if you are traveling South of the River Thames, the best public transport option will often be National Rail. There are numerous connections to the Rail System from the Tube. Travelcards can be used for travel on the National Rail (but not the Heathrow Express). Oyster cards can be used up to Zone 6 except certain services including Heathrow Express, Heathrow Connect and HSI. Question: When taking the London Underground,   _  .

Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men.

Read this: Wherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received support from the ruling authorities, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church, but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters, namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the Council of Trent. Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action.

Their works mainly fall into the fiction genre, and their most popular works have become enduring classics. The type of publication that they both have in common is the novel. Len Deighton, born in 1929, is a British author best known for his spy novels. His writing career spans over five decades, and he is considered an important figure in the development of espionage and thriller fiction. Deighton has written numerous novels, including his famous \\"Harry Palmer\\" series – the first of which was \\"The IPCRESS File\\" (1962) – and standalone novels like \\"Bomber\\" (1970). His works are characterized by meticulous attention to detail, well-researched background information, and complex but engaging narratives. Margaret Landon, born in 1903 and passed away in 1993, was an American writer who wrote the popular historical novel \\"Anna and the King of Siam\\" (1944). This novel was a fictionalized retelling of the experiences of Anna Leonowens, a British governess who served at the court of King Mongkut of Siam during the 19th century. The book was immensely popular and became a bestseller upon publication and was later adapted into Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical \\"The King and I\\" in 1951. Both Deighton and Landon have written novels that have captivated readers around the world and, in different ways, have contributed to reflecting broader truths about human nature, society, and history through their works of fiction. The type of publication they both share — the novel — showcases their prowess as storytellers and ensures that their works continue to resonate with contemporary audiences. Today, these novels remain widely read and continue to receive critical acclaim for their engaging stories, rich characters, and compelling insights into the human experience."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why were Europeans excited?\\" is in \\"By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.\\".

Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote? And it worked on most people. This woman was not one of them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Q: Title: Good but hard to put on Review: I offered my mother these compression stockings given that she is always standing and complains about her legs aching. Her legs feel so much better now but she did mention they were hard to put on. The open toe ones cut the circulation to her toes (I ordered some closed toe ones the second time around). It's too bad I couldn't find them for the same price though, hope it doesn't go up every time I will have to order her some. Is this product review negative? A:","output":"This product review can be considered a mixed review as it consists of both positive and negative aspects of the product. The reviewer details their experience with purchasing and using the compression stockings, focusing on two main aspects: the effectiveness of the product, and the ease of use. On the positive side, the reviewer notes that the compression stockings have significantly helped their mother's legs feel better, indicating that the product has achieved its intended purpose and has been effective in providing relief from the leg pain experienced due to their mother's occupation of standing for long hours. However, the review also mentions some issues and limitations with the product. The first issue is the difficulty experienced in putting the stockings on. Compression stockings are generally tight-fitting to provide the necessary compression, which can make application more challenging. Nevertheless, this can be seen as a drawback for users who may struggle with the application process. The second issue the reviewer brings up is related to the open-toe design, as they found it to cut off circulation to their mother's toes. As such, they had to order a different version of the product (closed-toe stockings) to address this problem. It is worth noting that this issue might be specific to the reviewer's mother and might not be relevant to all users. Lastly, the reviewer expresses concern about the price of the product, since they could not find the closed-toe version at the same price as the open-toe version they purchased earlier. The anticipation of potential price changes in the future adds an element of uncertainty to their overall satisfaction with the product. In conclusion, while the effectiveness of the product is praised and appreciated, the review also highlights some concerns regarding the stockings' usability, design, and pricing. Thus, this product review can be classified as mixed, as it consists of both positive feedback on the product's effectiveness and negative aspects related to user experience and potential future pricing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009.  - Adult Swim is a programming block of the American cable network Cartoon Network that operates at night from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Eastern and Pacific Time. It is programmed by Williams Street Productions, a subsidiary of Turner, which also developed two prior television programming blocks seen on Cartoon Network: Toonami (which later became a block on Adult Swim in 2012) and Miguzi.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  During the 1950s, Szigeti began to develop arthritis in his hands and his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l’Ungheria! (Italian for \\"Long live Hungary!\\"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to Switzerland with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt, who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that \\"Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed\\".Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness.

Question: In which sport was Graeme Obree briefly world record holder in 1993, only to lose it to another Briton shortly afterwards? Answer:","output":"Graeme Obree was briefly the world record holder in 1993 in the sport of cycling, specifically in the Individual Pursuit discipline. Born in Scotland in 1965, Obree rose to prominence in the early 1990s as a professional cyclist with a knack for innovation and unconventional approaches to bicycle design and riding techniques. The particular milestone in which Obree set the world record occurred on July 17, 1993, during the World Cycling Championships in Hamar, Norway. Obree broke the world record for the 4,000m individual pursuit event, posting a stunning time of 4 minutes, 22.668 seconds. His innovative approach and unusual riding style, with hands tucked tightly into his chest to minimize air resistance, earned him the nickname \\"The Flying Scotsman.\\" However, Obree's reign as the world record holder was short-lived, as another British cyclist, Chris Boardman, reclaimed the title just six days later on July 23, 1993. Boardman, who also had a penchant for pushing the limits of cycling technology, completed the same distance in an astounding time of 4 minutes, 20.894 seconds. The rivalry between Obree and Boardman made headlines throughout the cycling world at that time, and the two competitors continued to push each other to greater heights of cycling achievement in the years that followed. Their ongoing duel led to further refinements in the sport's technology and techniques, which ultimately benefited the entire cycling community. Graeme Obree's innovative spirit, dedication to his craft, and determination to push the boundaries of conventional cycling wisdom helped the sport of cycling to advance and reach new levels of performance. Although his time as a world record holder was brief, his impact on the sport remains significant and enduring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Christine kept badgering Monica to get her affection and attention because","output":"she had always looked up to her older sister. Monica, on the other hand, was tired of her little sister's constant need for attention. But this time, as Christine kept hounding her, Monica noticed that the desperation in her sister's eyes was different from the usual. It seemed more urgent, laced with a hint of sadness and fear. As the siblings sat down across from each other in the living room, they began to talk. Christine hesitated for a moment, her lips quivering with emotion. Gathering her courage, she finally spoke, \\"Monica, I have to tell you something. I've been really scared and I don't know what to do.\\" Immediately, Monica felt concern and a deep sense of responsibility swell within her. She reached out to hold Christine's hands, her stern demeanor softening. \\"What's wrong, Christine? You can tell me anything,\\" she comforted her sister, anxious to help. Christine took a deep breath and told Monica about the strange experiences she'd been having recently. After moving into her new apartment three months prior, Christine began to feel an eerie presence, as if someone was watching her. It started with quiet whispers in her ears when she was alone in the apartment, followed by strange noises in the night that sounded like footsteps pacing in circles. But the scariest part was the dark figure that she saw every night in her dreams, looming over her bed with a suffocating sense of dread, paralyzing her as she slept. As she recounted her tale, Christine's face was etched with fear, the pain of sleepless nights and the constant burden of dread making her life a living nightmare. Monica's heart ached for her little sister, not knowing how to solve this terrifying situation. Utilizing her problem-solving nature, Monica set out to help Christine confront her fears. She started to do research on paranormal activity, hauntings and sleep paralysis to try to understand Christine's experiences. She also reached out to her group of friends, some of whom had similar experiences, to gather advice on overcoming these supernatural occurrences. To alleviate Christine's fear of being alone in her apartment, Monica invited her to stay with her for a few weeks. Together, they tackled the overwhelming fear that gripped Christine each night, Monica comforting her sister whenever she woke up from terrible dreams or restless sleep. During the day, the sisters sought support from each other and specialist groups, ensuring that Christine underwent an extensive spiritual and psychological healing process. They visited trusted counselors and psychologists to remove anxiety and stress from her life. Monica took the initiative to contact paranormal investigators, who helped discover the source of the haunting experiences and effectively confront the presence in the apartment. Through patience, dedication, and teamwork, Monica was able to successfully guide her sister through the harrowing ordeal, expelling the darkness that had taken hold of her life. As Christine regained her sense of security and freedom, their bond became stronger than ever. The sleepless nights and echoing dread were replaced with laughter and the warmth of familial love. Their relationship was no longer just about the older sister being chased for her affection and attention, but about the sisterly love and support that conquered fear and brought light to the darkness. Christine would always be grateful for Monica's unwavering support and dedication to saving her from her living nightmare, and Monica saw her little sister in a new light – a resilient young woman who faced her fears head on and emerged stronger than ever. As Christine and Monica sat together in their living room, the warmth of the golden sun casting their shadows on the colorful carpet, they knew they had faced something terrifying and had come out on the other side not only unbroken but stronger and more united than ever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Neatly sandwiched between THE STRANGER, a small film noir picture that proved Welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties, and MACBETH, a no-budget Shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days, comes THE LADY FROM SHANGAI, a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of Wellesian mythos that covers THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, MR. ARKADIN and any other film the director didn't manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses. Six years after THE MALTESE FALCON, with the post-war craze of the film noir in full swing, Welles, always ahead of his time, a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity, envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker, more sinister, paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time. It's no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time, to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor, and it was once again Europe that championed it as another Welles classic. Certain set-pieces stand out. The aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows, and of course the Funhouse/Hall of Mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of Wellesian bravura as any in CITIZEN KANE or THE TRIAL. The only faults I find with the movie is Welles' ill-advised Irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act. The story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner, which the cuts only serve to intensify. I believe the heavily chopped versions of Shangai and Ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter. Welles would exile himself in Europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic, the monumental TOUCH OF EVIL, perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time. Shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for Hollywood's premiere star of the time, Rita Hayworth, ought to have been, and Welles marriage with Hayworth ended before the movie was even released. Sixty years later and one hour of footage less, Shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover. Surely that must count for something.

Q:Information:  - Anampses is a genus of wrasses native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans .  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.

Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, asserts that, due to the nature of time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future.

What is the answer for the question: What was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism? from the following article ?  At this point Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the guidance of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: \\"Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book\\". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\\". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the \\"Reds\\" (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the \\"Whites\\" (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: \\"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\\"In January 17, 1920, Malevich and Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived Molposnovis (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between \\"old\\" and \\"young\\" generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as UNOVIS (Exponents of the new art) in February. Under the leadership of Malevich the group worked on a \\"suprematist ballet\\", choreographed by Nina Kogan and on the...

The poster's design, which alluded to the shapes used on military maps and contained strong political symbolism, marked a departure from Malevich's pure abstraction and represented a distinct stylistic shift for Lissitzky. This development allowed him to explore new ways of visual expression, as he stated: \\"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\\" Through this new approach, Lissitzky began establishing his own artistic identity, distinct from the ideals of Malevich's suprematism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sled worked better in the snow than the toboggan, because the  Select from: (A). toboggan had a sticky bottom.; (B). sled had a sticky bottom.;","output":"The sled worked better in the snow than the toboggan, because the toboggan had a sticky bottom. While this might not seem like a significant issue at first, the sticky bottom plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of each of these two snow vehicles. Let's explore the factors contributing to this difference and discuss various aspects of the sled and the toboggan and their implications on their effectiveness in the snow. A toboggan is a traditional form of a sled, generally used for leisurely pursuits during the winter season. They are constructed using different materials, such as wood or plastic, and have a flat, low-profile design, providing stability and balance to its riders. When a toboggan has a sticky bottom, its ability to slide smoothly on snow is vastly hindered. The sticky surface of the bottom slows down the movement because it increases the friction between the toboggan and the snow.  As a result, the ones on the toboggan might find themselves struggling to gain momentum and speed on the slopes. Additionally, the sticky surface can cause the snow to accumulate and clump underneath the toboggan, further increasing the resistance and effort required for the riders to experience the fun of snow sliding. This might create a tiresome and frustrating experience for those who seek a thrilling ride. On the other hand, a sled, especially one with a non-sticky or slick bottom, is designed for optimal performance on snow. Sleds are typically equipped with runners, which are thin, curved metal or wooden rails that help to elevate the sled above the snow. These runners enable the sled to glide effortlessly on snow, providing relatively low friction and allowing for a swift and smooth sliding experience. The sled's design accommodates various sitting or lying positions and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  Sleds with a non-sticky bottom are superior to toboggans with sticky bottoms in numerous ways. Firstly, they provide greater control, allowing users to steer, maneuver, and adjust their sled to suit their individual preferences and comfort. The slick surface ensures smooth movement, swifter speeds, and maximized enjoyment on the slopes. Sleds can tackle varying terrains, from icy surfaces to powdery snow, offering a versatile and exciting experience that can be customized depending on the user's skill level. In conclusion, the sled's enhanced performance in the snow compared to the toboggan with a sticky bottom is attributed to the sled's runners, non-sticky surface, and versatile design. When the toboggan has a sticky bottom, it fails to provide the thrilling and smooth snow sliding experience many individuals seek. In contrast, sleds cater to a wide range of skill levels and snow conditions, making them a clear favorite for winter adventurers and sliding enthusiasts alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim acquitted in sodomy trial REPORTING FROM NEW DELHI –- In an unexpected conclusion to a controversial two-year trial, a Malaysian court Monday acquitted opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on sodomy charges, ruling that the DNA evidence submitted by the prosecution was unreliable. Sodomy, even between consenting adults, is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia although few people are prosecuted. Anwar, who faced up to 20 years in prison for allegedly having sex with a former aide, has repeatedly maintained his innocence, terming the charges politically motivated. Malaysia's information minister said Monday in a statement that the verdict in the case showed that the Southeast Asian nation's judiciary was free from government interference. As news of the verdict spread, cheers erupted among Anwar's supporters, opposition politicians and his wife and daughters, many of whom raised their fists in the air. \\"Thank God justice has prevailed,\\" Anwar, 64, told journalists outside the courtroom amid heavy security. \\"To be honest, I am a little surprised.\\" The allegations against Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, were raised shortly after 2008 elections saw the opposition make sizable gains against the ruling United Malays National Organization party, in power for the last 50 years. This was the second sodomy trial against Anwar, who was beaten and jailed for six years in another case widely seen as politically motivated. National elections are due by 2013, although analysts expect they'll be called later this year. Minutes after the verdict, a message from Anwar's Twitter account read: \\"In the coming election, voice of the people will be heard and this corrupt government will be toppled from its pedestals of power.\\" Holy koalas!

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Christina Maria Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, reality show personality and television personality. Born in Staten Island, New York and raised in Rochester and Wexford, Pennsylvania, she appeared on the television series Star Search and The Mickey Mouse Club in her early years. After recording \\"Reflection\\", the theme for Disney's 1998 film Mulan, Aguilera signed with RCA Records. She rose to prominence with her 1999 self-titled debut album that spawned the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \\"Genie in a Bottle\\", \\"What a Girl Wants\\", and \\"Come On Over Baby When planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth. She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented \\"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\\". For the album, Aguilera served as executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs. The album was preceded by the single \\"Dirrty\\", which was released to shed Aguilera's teen pop image and express her sexuality and aggression. Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting various sexual fetishes and concepts. Aguilera's new image presented in the video started to overshadow her music, generating widespread criticism from both her peers including Shakira and Jessica Simpson and the public. Aguilera defended her new image, explaining that \\"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\\"  The final cut of Stripped incorporated various genres from flamenco and R&B to rock and lyrically revolved around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality. It was released in October 2002 to mixed critical reviews; Jancee Dunn from the Rolling Stone praised Aguilera's vocals yet panned the album for its lack of musical concentration. The album was nonetheless a commercial success, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the United States. It was a major success in the United Kingdom, having sold 2 million copies and became the second highest-selling album by a female US artist of the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me. Stripped has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album was followed by four singles, \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", and \\"The Voice Within\\". \\"Beautiful\\" received universal acclaim for positive portrayal of the LGBT community and was the album's most commercially successful single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It earned Aguilera a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony. The song was later listed at number 52 among the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s by the Rolling Stone in 2011.  During the promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings. She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake's album Justified, before embarking on her solo The Stripped Tour until December. Aguilera garnered media attention after attending the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Hollywood\\". Later that year, she was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won an award for Best Female. Billboard also announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.

Aguilera's new image presented in the video started to overshadow her music and generated widespread criticism from both her peers, including Shakira and Jessica Simpson, and the public. Aguilera defended her new image, explaining that \\"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\\" Additionally, Aguilera garnered media attention after attending the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Hollywood\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two days before Christmas, the alleged smuggler apparently thought Easter eggs would be the perfect ploy to conceal 14 pounds of cocaine. It didn't work. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers sensed something was a little off with candy for the wrong holiday, a spokeswoman said. \\"That's certainly an anomaly, isn't it? They're trained to detect anomalies in all kinds of situations,\\" said Lee Harty, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \\"It's an unusual concealment method -- at least for this time of year. Maybe not for spring.\\" Esteban Galtes, 23, of Miami, Florida, was being held without bail being set Monday after he asked a federal court in Los Angeles to continue his Monday hearing until Wednesday, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice. Galtes' attorney could not be reached for comment Monday evening. \\"But cocaine camouflaged as","output":"Easter eggs were not enough to fool the vigilant customs officers who carefully examined the suspicious shipment. Upon closer inspection, the officers discovered inconsistencies in the textures and weights of the festive candy, raising further suspicion. These observations, coupled with the unusual timing of the delivery, prompted the authorities to initiate a thorough investigation of the package's contents. The customs team proceeded to dismantle the Easter eggs, carefully removing the layers of packaging, only to unveil the cunningly concealed cocaine hidden within. The contraband was exquisitely hidden, with a great deal of effort exerted in ensuring that the colorful eggs emulated the exterior of regular, innocent candy. But ultimately, these elaborate attempts to deceive the seasoned law enforcement professionals proved futile.  Once the cocaine was discovered and Galtes' involvement confirmed, he was promptly arrested and charged with various counts of drug smuggling and trafficking. His arrest highlights the ongoing determination and tireless efforts of customs and border protection officers in thwarting smuggling attempts, even those employing the most inventive and unorthodox concealment methods. Galtes now faces a lengthy legal process, and if convicted, could receive a hefty sentence due to the magnitude of the crime and the street value of the narcotics involved. The investigation into the smuggling operation is set to continue, as more individuals and criminal networks potentially linked to this drug trafficking attempt may be uncovered. This case serves as a cautionary tale of the relentless commitment and keen eye of customs and border protection officials, reiterating their role as the frontline guardians against drug smuggling and reinforcing their relentless pursuit of justice.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: The question is, can a movie this entertaining really be considered a \\"bad\\" movie? My husband and I picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words \\"Vestron Pictures\\" on it (Vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since I first acquired the legendary films \\"Suburbia\\" and \\"Class of 1984\\"). We were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was. Your basic plot as is follows: Grange, this goombaesque thug from planet Earth, robs \\"the bank of the Moon\\" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I don't even remember the planet's name) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. The \\"governor\\" of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the whole planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with. Then there's the nameless \\"Colonel\\", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare. Much of the movie centers around \\"futuristic\\" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides) with explosions galore. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of those other dusty Inland Empire outposts. But what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several LA punk bands of the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. I can't even remember the names of the bands (they're listed in the credits) other than Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I'd heard of before I saw this movie, but I'm definitely looking into them. Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the review - The question about whether this movie can be considered bad - They bought it at a cheap price - Mention of Vestron Pictures - Basic plot summary - Futuristic car chases - Awesome soundtrack featuring several LA punk bands of the mid-80s - Recommended way to enjoy the movie Step 2: Analyze the sentiment of each element - The question about the movie being bad seems to be rhetorical, as the reviewer goes on to describe it as entertaining.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: From the moment that an animal is born it has to make decisions. It has to decide which of the things around it are for eating, and which are to be avoided; when to attack and when to run away. The animal is, in fact, playing a complicated and potentially dangerous game with its environment, discomfort or destruction. This is a difficult and unpleasant business and few animals would survive if they had to start from the beginning and learn about the world wholly by trial and error, for there are too many possible decisions which would prove fatal. So we find, in practice, that the game is always arranged in favor of the young animal in one way or another. Either the animal is protected during the early stages of its learning about the world around it, or the knowledge of which way to respond is built into its nervous system from the start. The fact that animals behave sensibly can be attributed partly to what we might call genetic learning, to distinguish it from individual learning that an animal does in the cause of its own life time. Genetic learning is learning by a species as a whole, and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to behave in the right way. However, genetic learning depends upon a prediction that the future will more or less exactly resemble the past. The more variable individual experience is likely to be, the less efficient is genetic learning as a means of getting over the problems of the survival game. It is not surprising to find that very few species indeed depend wholly upon genetic learning. In the great majority of animals, behavior is a compound of individual experience added to the action patterns animals are born with.That is why animals can survive. Options: A a series of trials and errors B knowledge obtained in their life time C the nervous system D genetic learning and individual experience Answer: D genetic learning and individual experience Question: A:","output":"Which of the following factors contribute to an animal's ability to survive in its environment?

He was found not far from the city of  Umea in the north of Sweden by snowmobilers who thought they had come across a ruined car until they dug their way to a window and saw movement inside. The man, who was lying in the back seat in a sleeping bag, said he had been in the car since December 19. \\"Just incredible that he's alive considering that he had no food, but also since it's been really cold for some time after Christmas.\\" a rescue team member told regional daily Vasterbottens- Kuriren, which broke the news.

Umea University Hospital, where the man is recovering after being rescued by police and a rescue team, said in a statement he was doing well considering the circumstances.

CONTEXT: 22 de abril de 2013 Desde el pasado viernes un grupo de 15 encapuchados mantiene tomada la Torre de Rectoría de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), ubicada en la Ciudad Universitaria de México, D.

De los ataques que ha sufrido la UNAM, no ha habido consecuencias penales para los responsables a pesar de las exigencias de los directivos de esta institución educativa. El sábado autoridades de la UNAM afirmaron que no iniciarán el diálogo “en tanto prevalezca la violencia y la ocupación contrarias a la legalidad”. Raúl González, abogado de la UNAM, informó a los jóvenes que la toma de Rectoría significa un delito, aconsejando que “depongan su actitud y desalojen las instalaciones”. Mientras tanto, se ha iniciado una demanda penal por los hechos violentos, así como la toma de la Torre de Rectoría, que en 2007 fue declarada por la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura como Patrimonio Cultural de la Humanidad. Los jóvenes afirman no haber tomado la Rectoría, sino \\"estar haciendo un plantón\\". El domingo, 74 directores de facultades, escuelas, institutos y centros de la UNAM la liberación de la Torre. Los directivos expresaron por medio de un comunicado que “existen vías adecuadas para expresar sus demandas o inconformidades”.

Además declaró que la investigación y las posibles acciones corresponden a la Procuraduría General de la República puesto que estos actos constituyen un delito federal. Por su parte, los jóvenes redujeron sus demandas dos horas después de que el recto mostró su postura respecto a la toma. Los encapuchados volvieron a leer sus demandas, centrándose en evitar las represalias en su contra, el inicio del diálogo abierto y la “reinstalación inmediata” de los jóvenes expulsados. En la conferencia, Narro aconsejó que “no se atrevan a saquear una vez más el patrimonio de la nación. [...] Los responsables de este acto deberán responder por su conducta frente a las autoridades judiciales y frente a la historia”. También se informó que la toma “proyecta una imagen de la Universidad que para nada corresponde con la realidad”, afirmando que “no habrá impunidad”.

It does sound pretty serious. But I'm sure you can all sit down and work this out.  W: Well,you're over at the law school. So, I wondered if you would mind coming with Sarah and me when we go to talk to Ms. Corners. We're supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight.  M: Sure. I haven't studied a lot about contracts yet,but I'll be glad to help you straighten things out. Why don't I stop by about 7:30?  W: Thanks Sam. You are our lifesaver.  What was said before this conversation? The answer to this question is:","output":"Before this conversation, Paula Hanson and Sarah moved into an off-campus apartment on the west side of town in the fall. They had been happy with the apartment until the past couple of months when their dishwasher broke down. They reported the issue to Ms. Corners, the owner of the apartment, who said she would take care of it. However, after a month passed and nothing happened, Paula got an estimate for the repair and sent it to Ms. Corners. When she didn't hear back from her, Paula had the repair done and deducted the cost from the rent check. This led to Ms. Corners getting mad and threatening to expel them for not paying the full rent. Paula and Sarah decided to seek help from Sam, who is studying at the law school, to resolve this issue with Ms. Corners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ENA must always comply with the Trade  Option Exemption when entering into options (as buyer or seller) with a third  party. Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from  regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying  commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering  into the transaction for business purposes.

Kenyan legislators voted to give themselves send-off bonuses of 110,000 each, despite the president's veto of their earlier attempt at another hefty payoff. Members of parliament approved the retirement package in a late-night vote this week, this time adding extra perks such as diplomatic passports, a state funeral and VIP access to the nation's airports. In addition to their perks, they included a bonus for President Mwai Kibaki, who is not running for re-election in March. Read more: Kenyan DJs go six days without food to promote peaceful elections. Kibaki blocked their earlier attempt to award themselves bonuses in October, calling it unconstitutional and unaffordable. The nation's parliament members are among the highest paid on the continent. An average Kenyan makes about 1,800 annually, and would have to work for more than 60 years to earn the bonus amount. The proposal has sparked an outcry among citizens, who demanded that the president block the bill's passage. \\"I'm disgusted,\\" said Warothe Kiru, a blogger who lives in the capital of Nairobi. \\"They really don't care. The thing that's making it worse is what's happening in Tana,\\" he said. In the same news reports about women being attacked with machetes, \\"you're seeing ... MPs getting bonuses.\\" In recent months, retaliatory attacks between rival tribes have raged in Tana River District, leaving more than 100 people dead.

In October, when the first bill passed in another late-night vote, throngs gathered outside parliament offices and hollered \\"thieves\\" as lawmakers dashed into their offices. The president vetoed that bill hours after the protests. Read more: Kenyan lawmakers vote for bonus of 120,000 each at taxpayer expense.
