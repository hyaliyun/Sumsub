Created:. 19:52 EST, 20 February 2012. Jobless people attending courses run by David Cameron's 'back to work' tsar  Emma Harrison were ordered to sign blank timesheets, it was alleged yesterday. Others complained of being forced to waste hours sitting doing nothing instead  of being allowed to look for gainful employment. A damning dossier of allegations about Mrs Harrison's employment agency A4e has been handed to the Comptroller and Auditor General by former minister Fiona  Mactaggart. She is the Labour MP for Slough, Berkshire, where last week A4e's offices were  visited by police as part of a fraud probe. The Prime Minister is facing demands to suspend lucrative Whitehall contracts  which A4e won to help the long-term unemployed find jobs. 'Posh commune': A4e boss Mrs Harrison's £5million pile has 16 bedrooms, 100 acres of land, a pool, spa, a bar, a nightclub and a long dining table for banquets. Millionairess Mrs Harrison, 48 - made. families tsar by Mr Cameron after she  boasted she could help problem. families find work - triggered outrage when she  paid herself. £8.6million of mainly taxpayers' cash. Ministers. have sought urgent reassurance there is no 'systematic fraud' of the. public purse, after Thames Valley Police were called in by the. Department of  Work and Pensions. Ms. Mactaggart's dossier contains accusations from constituents who were. made to  attend an A4e 'back to work' course as a condition of receiving. state benefits. One claimed: 'Every Friday, the \\"clients\\" have to sign a blank timesheet and  the times are filled in later. 'Members of my group were told to fill in a blank piece of paper outlining any  \\"modules\\"...and to sign a blank \\"review\\". 'I would guess this was to fraudulently claim that all \\"criteria\\" as laid down  by the government was adhered to.' Another. complainant, a construction worker, said he had spent 13 weeks on an. A4e course supposedly to renew a forklift operator's licence yet had. 'received  no training at all', despite repeatedly asking for some. Attendance. on a back-to-work course is mandatory for the long-term unemployed  if. they want to keep being paid benefits, and companies such as A4e charge. taxpayers millions of pounds to run them. But a third person described a 'chaotic, unorganised' A4e course in which 'we  would mostly be shunted in and out of rooms, staring at walls, long silences  with none of the staff telling the group what was happening'. She told the MP her group was forced to 'learn' menial tasks such as how to  write a letter on a computer. She said: 'I did not learn anything that I did  not know already, and it is ridiculous and worrying that people like myself  should be forced into this position where I have a proven work history.' Last night Ms Mactaggart, a former Home Office minister and a member of the  influential Public Accounts Committee, said: 'I think there is a series of what  appears to me on the face of it to be fraudulent actions - expecting people to  sign blank time sheets and so on. Prime Minister David Cameron is facing calls to sack his 'back to work' tsar after a fraud probe was launched. 'It is in itself wrong to get vulnerable unemployed people to sign blank time  sheets, because this company is in the position where it has the power to put  people in breach of their Jobseekers' Allowance conditions. 'In my view, that makes A4e not fit to receive a government contract. The  government should absolutely consider suspending the contracts. 'The concerns that my constituents have raised are sufficient for me to believe  that they are not a proper company to get taxpayers' money and to be dealing  with vulnerable people.' The MP forwarded the complaints to Sir Amyas Morse, the Comptroller and Auditor  General - the head of the National Audit Office which scrutinises the accounts  of government departments and agencies. She demanded an investigation, telling him the cases seemed to be examples of  'A4e taking money from the Government without actually delivering anything  worthwhile'. Other MPs have attacked Mrs Harrison's vast dividend, which she paid herself  after A4e recorded a £234million turnover. A4e - which used to be called Action  For Employment - makes all its UK income from state contracts. Mrs Harrison, worth an estimated £70million, lives in a £7million country  mansion in Derbyshire with her husband Jim, their four children, and a group of  11 close friends and their six children in a 'posh commune'. Labour's Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has led calls for Mrs Harrison's company to have its state contracts suspended. Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, yesterday  tabled a parliamentary question asking whether the Government would suspend the  company's contracts pending inquiries. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Officers visited the offices of A4e in  Slough as part of an allegation of fraud, which was referred to the Force by  the Department for Work and Pensions. The investigation is ongoing and at an  early stage, therefore we are currently unable to comment any further.' A4e said the police had only come in 'for a meeting' and had not taken away any  documents. It said the fraud probe concerned an isolated incident two years ago  relating to four employees who had since left the company, and that A4e had discovered the alleged fraud itself and reported it to the Department for Work  and Pensions within 48 hours. Last night an A4e spokesman insisted the concerns raised by Ms Mactaggart had  been resolved, saying: 'Under the new Work Programme, customers are no longer  required to fill out timesheets. 'All our staff have clear guidelines on how to complete claims made under Work  Programme and these claims are independently verified by the employer and by  JobCentre Plus. 'A4e has a zero tolerance policy towards any form of behaviour that might lead  to allegations of fraud. 'The concerns raised by Fiona Mactaggart's constituents are not linked to the  current Thames Valley Police investigation.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- David Cameron's 'back to work' tsar Emma Harrison's employment agency A4e has been accused of ordering jobless people to sign blank timesheets. - Former minister Fiona Mactaggart has handed a damning dossier of allegations about A4e to the Comptroller and Auditor General. - A4e's offices in Slough were visited by police as part of a fraud probe. - The Prime Minister is facing demands to suspend lucrative Whitehall contracts awarded to A4e. - A4e has denied any systematic fraud, and claims that the police visit was for a meeting, not to seize documents. - Emma Harrison has previously faced controversy for paying herself £8.6 million in taxpayer-funded dividends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times and I never get tired of it. The setting has a lot to do with it (the Colorado I know would be jealous), but the storyline is original and I liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes. There has not been a movie I can compare this too. John Lithgow plays a smart villain, but I love how he is completely out of his element--he has to follow Tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting. This is an action movie at it's BEST.

The restaurant is right at the front of the Monte Carlo and they seated us adjacent to the main window, overlooking the strip. The server was friendly and told us about the tapas menu yet failed to warn us of just how small the portions were.  The problem is that at other places, tapas are usually priced accordingly.  At Yusho however, the prices are way out of proportion to the size and, unfortunately, the taste of the food.  The drink menu looked interesting so I tried the Last Word (13), which is a mixture of gin, green chartreuse, maraschino, lime and egg whites. The flavor was ok but there was more egg white foam than liquid in the glass and I didn't taste any gin at all.  We also tried a Negroni which did have a strong taste of Campari (13). However, similar to what they did with the previous cocktail, there was so much ice jammed into the glass that there were only a few sips of liquor.  We started with the house pickles (9) and assorted kimchi (7).  The taste of the kimchi was interesting but there wasn't much there to eat. We had one order of the Tiger shrimp which came in a small bowel containing a few shrimp and cucumber pieces with a tangy vinegar coating (9).  We ordered one of the specials which was an ear of corn, broken into two pieces and smothered in a spicy miso sauce (7).  The taste of the sauce was great but the corn was a bit waterlogged and mushy.  Next came the duck breast which consistent of one skewer holding four small pieces of bland duck meat wrapped around mushrooms (12). We ordered two cod buns (16 for two) and two pork buns (16 for two). The meat in both tasted all right however the mix of ingredients that they threw in with it seemed like a desperate attempt to create something different by throwing in anything on hand rather then creating a unified concept of flavors that meshed together. The portions are so small however and you are so hungry throughout the experience that you will eat anything they bring to the table. Last to come was the crab fried rice (24) and the chicken drummies with red miso sauce (9).  The fried rice tasted ok but there was only enough to fill the small miso soup bowl that it came in. The chicken dish was the most substantial of the night with several flat medallions of chicken meat with a red dipping sauce.  We skipped dessert.  All in all, some of the dishes tasted ok but nothing had a wow factor. Certainly nothing to demand the exorbitant prices for what you actually received.  I can't see this place staying at the Monte Carlo for very long if nothing changes.  I would recommend skipping Yusho and heading right next door to the Dragon Noodle Co. or Andre's for a real meal.

One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine  . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot  . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,... A:","output":"Which of the following findings were reported in two new studies about modern running shoes and the risk of injuries to runners? A.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The researcher who found more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was Bob, who studied a present-day county. Over the past 10,000 years, human activities have greatly increased, leading to significant growth in industries, transportation, and energy production, among other areas. These activities have contributed to a considerable rise in the release of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere. Today, atmospheric CO2 levels are substantially higher than they were 10,000 years ago, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes.

This choice encapsulates a more comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted benefits that arise from hard work and perseverance, as opposed to the other options provided. Here are some detailed explanations behind selecting \\"better life\\": 1. Personal growth and self-improvement: Hard work in one's personal and professional life often translates into enhanced skills, expertise, and efficiency. The accumulated knowledge and experiences contribute to a person's growth, making them more self-reliant, confident, and prepared to face challenges. This improved version of themselves leads to a better, more fulfilling life. 2. Financial stability and growth: Working hard usually results in better job prospects, promotions, and increases in salary. This financial stability allows individuals to enjoy the comforts of life, invest in their future, provide for their family's needs, and create long-term financial security. As a result, a better life with less financial stress and more opportunities is achieved. 3. Career advancement and job satisfaction: By working hard, individuals demonstrate commitment, dedication, and reliability in their chosen field.

Write an article based on this summary: Pour the milk into individual glasses to serve. Garnish the milk with sliced almonds. Refrigerate extra milk. Discard milk once it goes bad. Finished. Article:","output":"Article Title: Proper Handling and Serving of Milk: A Detailed Guide Milk, a scrumptious and nutritious white fluid, is often a staple in most households. While its consumption is straightforward, there are still specific steps that can be taken to enhance its enjoyment and longevity. This article elaborates those methods based on a compact summary provided. Firstly, we point to the individual serving of milk, particularly when you have guests or a gathering at your home. It's significant to pour milk into individual glasses. This not only adds a personal touch but also ensures hygienic handling. Rather than sharing from a common bowl, each person having their separate glass guarantees a fresh and untampered drink. Moreover, the elegance in the serving plays a substantial role in our eating habits. It's not just about what we consume, but also how aesthetically pleasing it's presented. With this in mind, consider garnishing the milk before serving. A simple but effective garnishment for milk is sliced almonds. Not only do these sliced almonds provide a vibrant visual contrast to the milk, but they also enhance the flavor and deliver extra nutritional value with their healthy fats and proteins. It's an easy but significant method to make the everyday glass of milk more appealing. However, depending on the volume of milk purchased, you may often find yourself with leftovers. If one is not mindful, these leftovers could potentially lead to wastage. To minimize this, it's important to refrigerate the extra milk. Refrigeration slows down microbial growth and extends the milk's shelf life. This not only helps conserve the milk for future use, thereby preventing unnecessary wastage but also maintains the milk's freshness and flavor.   Lastly, consequential to all food items' nature, there will come a point when the milk will no longer be consumable. Like any perishable, milk once it goes bad is dangerous for health and should be promptly discarded. Bear in mind that consuming spoiled milk may lead to food poisoning or other health problems. Keeping track of the milk's expiration date, practicing proper storage methods, and using your senses to identify signs of spoilage can help prevent these health risks. In conclusion, enjoying milk is not just about drinking it straight from the carton. By pouring your milk into individual glasses, garnishing with tasty and nutritious additives like sliced almonds, refrigerating any extra for extended freshness, and making a point to discard milk once it goes bad, you're ensuring a safe, tasteful, and enjoyable milk-drinking experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cells will be attacked happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process you described involves the following steps: 1. Bacteria enters the body. 2. Bacteria enter the bloodstream. 3. Cells in the body are attacked by bacteria. 4. Cells are killed by bacteria. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed as a result of cell damage. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: if more cells are attacked by bacteria, how does it affect the possibility of fewer cells being damaged? If more cells are attacked, it is likely that more cells will potentially be damaged. This is because the bacteria attacking the cells are responsible for causing damage, usually through the release of toxins or through direct invasion and destruction of the cells. However, several factors can influence whether this increased attack on cells would necessarily lead to more cells being damaged: 1. The immune system response: The body's immune system may respond more robustly to the increased bacterial attack, neutralizing a larger number of bacteria before they can cause damage to the cells. 2. The virulence of the bacteria: Some bacteria are more aggressive in their ability to attack and damage cells. If less virulent bacteria are responsible for the increased attack, the resulting damage may not increase proportionally to the number of cells attacked. 3. The resilience of the cells: Some cells may be better equipped to resist or recover from bacterial attack. For example, they may have protective mechanisms or be more capable of repairing damage. Although these factors may alleviate the potential increase in cell damage due to more cells being attacked, it is still reasonable to assume that, in general, increased bacterial attack on cells will lead to a higher likelihood of cell damage. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests more cells being attacked would result in less cell damage is likely not accurate in most cases. More cells being attacked by bacteria will typically lead to more cells being damaged, potentially leading to more severe or widespread illness. However, factors such as the immune system response, bacterial virulence, and cell resilience can influence the extent of the damage caused."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I had another offer on the table from someone I am close with that I kept pushing back at the time so when the company told me they would get back to me the next week I said sounds great, I have another offer so as soon as a decision is made it would be awesome if you let me know.  On Tuesday of the following week they got back to me with an offer to which I asked if I could get back to them the next day and if I had any questions I would email them over. Both of these jobs are hourly, I just graduated college. I emailed them the next day asking if they had a policy in place for reviews for potential raises whether it be 60, 90, or 180 days from the start date. I only asked this because the other position I was considering offered a 60 day raise review. The boss responds and says they typically do yearly reviews other than for title changes. I respond back saying great thank you, is there anyway I could get back to you on Friday and sleep on the decision. I don’t get a response, so I email again asking if Friday is okay. I get an email later that night saying while they wanted to know today, after reading my email they wanted to further discuss my role and I could get back to them Friday. I was shocked and knew that this wasn’t good. The next day I get an email from them telling me I should accept the other job and that after reconsidering I am not a good fit for the company because I want to eventually leave the state (this was already discussed prior and okayed). I ask to call them so I could explain myself as my intentions were getting lost in translation and I get no answer.

So I send one final email apologizing for asking too forthcoming of questions and reiterating my desire to work for the company long term, accepting the position, and that again I would love to talk on the phone to sort this out. I get no response until past the end of the workday basically saying that while they respect my decision to ask for a pay raise and “my desire to sleep on working with them” they had other candidates more eager than me.

Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents.

Image Kathleen Sebelius Credit Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency      Even if Ms. Sebelius had not presided over the Department of Health and Human Services at a time of turmoil and self-inflicted distress — and while carrying out a law that inspires such anger on the right — her candidacy would be a tough sell in Kansas. Democrats have not held a Senate seat in the state since 1939. And even before the president’s popularity started to take a steep slide last year, he fared especially poorly in Kansas, winning only 38 percent of the vote there in 2012.      Democrats say that Ms. Sebelius would be their best hope at winning in a tough state, especially if Mr. Roberts loses his primary to Milton Wolf, a Tea Party-backed radiologist who has alarmed mainstream Republicans with some of his actions, such as when he posted gruesome pictures of gunshot victims on Facebook.      Perhaps more significant, Ms. Sebelius would force Republicans to spend money in Kansas as they tried to fight off her challenge. Her family has a long history in the state, and she was a popular, twice-elected governor. In 2006, she was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote.      But friends and Democrats who know her said that they seriously doubted she would follow through and mount a campaign, considering how personally difficult the past six or seven months had been. She has been mocked and excoriated by Republicans on Capitol Hill, who made her the face of the Affordable Care Act’s problems. And she has told people that she anticipated staying on in her job as secretary for a while longer. President Obama has already nominated a successor, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the current director of the Office of Management and Budget, but her appointment must be approved by the Senate.      Ms. Sebelius would have until June 2 to decide, the deadline for filing for the Senate primary in Kansas. ||||| Before she was President Barack Obama‘s embattled Health and Human Services secretary, tasked with overseeing the initial stages of the implementation the Affordable Care Act, Kathleen Sebelius served as the governor of Kansas. With her time in the administration behind her, reports indicate that Sebelius is openly contemplating a return to politics in her home state via a challenge to Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS).            The New York Times reports that Sebelius is “weighing revenge” against Roberts, a Sebelius family friend who reportedly wounded her when he accused her of “gross incompetence” as HHS secretary.      Roberts, who is currently running for a fourth term in the upper chamber of Congress, saw his job approval rating dip following a the report that he did not actually own a home in the state which he represents in Congress. After that report, the 77-year-old senator drew a primary challenge from a tea party-aligned candidate.

Polls presently show Roberts leading Wolf among Kansas GOP primary voters and indicate that Roberts’ primary challenger is a flawed candidate. Roberts polls significantly worse against a generic “more conservative” Republican candidate than he does against Wolf, a condition that goes to show Kansas’ Republican electorate is ready to send new blood to Washington.      However, the last time Sebelius won a race in Kansas was in 2006, a year in which the political environment heavily favored Democrats seeking national and statewide office. Furthermore, a Democrat has not occupied a U.S. Senate seat from The Sunflower State since 1939.      In spite of Roberts’ troubles, Sebelius has an uphill battle if she wants to replace the aging Republican in Washington D.C.

The premise states that \\"only some wall fragments remain of the former Etruscan stronghold in Fiesole itself.\\" This indicates that a significant portion of the original Etruscan stronghold has been lost or destroyed over time, leaving behind only a limited number of fragments. The Etruscan civilization was a powerful and advanced one that flourished in ancient Italy before the rise of the Roman Republic. The stronghold in Fiesole was likely a well-fortified structure that served as a defensive or strategic location for the Etruscans. Over the centuries, it would have been subjected to natural disasters, decay, and possibly invasions by external forces. As a result, many of its original structures and features would have eventually crumbled away. However, while only some fragments of the Etruscan stronghold remain, the premise also highlights the existence of extensive Roman ruins in the area. This includes a well-preserved amphitheater dating back to 100 BC that seats 2,500 spectators and is still in use for summertime festivals. The Roman Empire succeeded the Etruscan civilization and expanded its influence over the Italian Peninsula. It is likely that the Romans repurposed parts of the Etruscan stronghold or built their own structures on its foundations, resulting in the preservation of some aspects of the site while allowing others to decay or be lost over time. In conclusion, the hypothesis that there are only a few fragments of the walls of the Etruscan stronghold remaining can be considered true based on the information provided in the premise. While there may be more information or archaeological evidence available beyond the scope of the premise that could further substantiate or contradict this claim, the current details support the hypothesis that just a small portion of the walls of the Etruscan stronghold in Fiesole have survived to the present day. The Etruscan stronghold's remnants coexist with the extensive Roman ruins, including the amphitheater, providing a rich historical and cultural landscape that demonstrates the continuous use and transformation of the site through the ages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit. Question: What are the minerals that supplement users are likely to be exceeding the upper limit? Answer: A:","output":"The minerals that supplement users are likely to be exceeding the upper limit are magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Fashion always keeps at least one eye on the future. Now scientists are lending a hand, developing tomorrow's super-powered clothing such as coats that can recharge  your MP3 player and make you stronger. For example, electronics could get recharged in the future simply by plugging  them into your outer wear, because Australian researchers are designing clothing that can collect energy from a person. The coats would include small things that change vibration energy from a person's movements into electricity. High-tech fabrics would carry this energy to batteries . \\"It will look like an ordinary(common)coat but have super energy,\\" said Adam Best, an Australian head research scientist. \\" _ has important uses for soldiers in the field and could mean they no longer need to carry heavy batteries,'' Best added. \\"Above all, they'd be wearing the battery, not carrying it.\\" Besides helping soldiers, these coats could also have common uses for common people, such as powering radios, mobile phones, MP3 players or medical things. Solar-powered handbags could do the same thing. Thanks to self-cleaning fabrics developed by scientists working for the U. S. Air Force, underwear and sports clothing could go weeks without washing. The general idea of clothes that never get dirty can be found in the 1951 film The Man in the White Suit. The new technology helps keep off water, oil and bacteria . High-tech fabrics could also help serve as protection. For example, future fabrics could lead to soft helmets that turn hard in an accident. Not all the possible fabrics of tomorrow are necessarily high-tech. For example, chicken feathers  and other things of the farming industry could get changed into wool-like fabrics or cotton-like ones, helping use fewer fabrics made from oil. Scientific development is also creating wool that doesn't become bigger or smaller after washing. And future clothing could help soldiers shoulder heavy bags and help people walk. But not all electronic coats have such uses--some might serve as video game... Answer:","output":"Which of these is an application of high-tech fabrics being developed by Australian researchers?

The probe is intercepted by an alien ship which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth. However, instead of greeting the alien craft, the US government shoots it down. Crashing in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin, the lone alien occupant, looking like a floating ball of glowing energy, finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen). While there, the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches. The alien \\"Starman\\" (Jeff Bridges) has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days' time. He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona. Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape. Having a rough understanding of English language from the Voyager 2 disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, Arizona's Barringer Crater, in three days, he will die.

It's Christmas Eve and Richie Rich, the world's richest kid, is all excited to spend the day with his friends. While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \\"big pie\\" from it, and is given a \\"pig sty\\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes. During tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage. While getting ready, Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days, in a band called Root Canal. When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using the remote invented by Keanbean that Cadbury used earlier. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process.

De plus, le développement des statistiques est également un moyen de renforcer la transparence, la gouvernance et la responsabilité des institutions publiques et privées. Les principales recommandations de la Déclaration de Dakar comprennent la nécessité d'instaurer des systèmes de collecte, de traitement et de diffusion des données statistiques solides et intégrés aux systèmes d'information nationaux, ainsi que de mettre en place des mécanismes de financement durables pour les activités statistiques. Parmi les autres engagements pris par les signataires figurent également la promotion des partenariats entre les producteurs et les utilisateurs de données, la formation de statisticiens professionnels et la coopération régionale et internationale dans le domaine de la statistique.

President Washington is the founding father of the country;the 3rd President Jefferson drafted the U. S. Declaration of Independence;the 16th President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and the26th President Roosevelt protected the average people's right to compete fairly with trusts. All of them,made outstanding achievements for their country. They were pioneers of U. S. history. The stone statues of presidents were built at the suggestion of an historian in the State of Dakota,with a view to carrying forward the U. S. pioneering spirit everlastingly. The statues are 18 meters high. They are the highest and greatest realistic stone statues in the world,taller than a 6-storied building and larger than the Great Sphinx of Egypt. The size of each head is 20sq mt,with a 20-meter- long face,a 7-meter -long nose,a 2.6-meter- wide mouth and two 1.5-meter -wide eyes. Though not facing the same direction,they are all lifelike and look ahead gravely in harmony with fixed gazes. On clear days,one can have a sight of the four presidents with their firm and steady expression at a distance of dozens of kilometers. Since the stone sculpture is unique in style,the Monument is now the U. S. National Art Centre of Popular Education.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S. Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae.  But I can use this background: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Drum keys are used to tune drums and cost about two dollars at a music store. If you're going to play drums, it's a good idea to get one and make sure your kit is in tune with itself. To start tuning your drums or changing the heads, all you need is a stick and your drum key. Turn the snares off and you're ready to start.  If you have any drummer friends, you can ask if they have spare keys to lend or give you. Consider using two drum keys at rods opposite each other on the drum. You'll be able to tune faster and will get a more even tension (so long as you continue keeping them across from each other as you move diagonally around the drum). Center the new head on the drum and put the rim and tension rods back onto the drum. You might want to place the rim back on the drum in the spot it was originally since the rim's shape has probably moved to fit in that position. Tighten all of the tension rods evenly using your hands (no drum key yet) and keep going until all of the tension rods are finger tight. Keep your tension rods and drum lugs clean and lubricated. To lubricate the rods, rub a little oil, petroleum jelly, or paraffin wax over them. Prevent your drum from repeatedly going out of tune by pushing down in the center of the drum with your fist. Do this 5-10 times. Don't worry, you won't break it. You should be able to put a good portion of your body weight onto the drum. Don't be alarmed if you hear popping or glue-cracking sounds. Make sure the tension rods are all still tight and adjust them as needed. Once you've got the new head seated and the tension rods relatively tight, you're ready to start tuning the drum.","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to use drum keys for tuning drums, discussing the importance of owning a drum key, tips for faster and even tension tuning, proper head replacement and rim placement, pre-tightening tension rods by hand, maintaining and lubricating tension rods and drum lugs, breaking in a new drum head by applying pressure, and fine-tuning the drum to achieve the desired sound."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Book 1 (at the head of the Odyssean section) opens with a storm which Juno, Aeneas' enemy throughout the poem, stirs up against the fleet. The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which historically was Rome's deadliest foe. The queen, Dido, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. In Book 5, Aeneas' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him. On reaching Cumae, in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl, who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome's destiny to his son. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who is Aeneas' enemy throughout the Aeneid?","output":"In the Aeneid, Aeneas' primary enemy is the goddess Juno. Juno harbors a deep resentment and hostility towards Aeneas and the Trojans because she is a staunch supporter of the Greeks and also due to the judgment of Paris, in which he chose Venus over her as the most beautiful goddess. As a result, she takes every opportunity to thwart Aeneas' mission to establish a new city for his people, which will ultimately become Rome. Throughout the epic, she uses her divine powers to create obstacles and challenges for the hero, making his journey even more arduous and difficult. Her antagonism towards Aeneas is a driving force in the narrative and represents the divine intervention that often complicates the lives of mortals in classical mythology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Catch That Kid Movie plot: Madeline Rose \\"Maddy\\" Phillips (Kristen Stewart) is 12-year-old girl who loves to climb. Her father Tom (Sam Robards) has climbed Mount Everest so it runs in the family. Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her. They remain hesitant, so she tells both of them that she loves him and does not care for the other and gives half of her friendship necklace to each of them, claiming she has the other half. They break into Harderbach Financial (a bank in which Molly had begun to work for, designing a security system). They manage to break in, but with her mother at the hospital visiting their father, she is forced to babysit her younger brother Max. She and Gus progress to a room with thousands of security deposit boxes while Austin keeps the guards away from them.

Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face.

Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster:. Northwest Florida. Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syruplike oil on the white sand, but local officials said the situation is getting better. \\"Our beaches continue to improve hourly as the crews clean up,\\" said Ed Schroeder, director of Visit Pensacola, in a statement on the bureau's website. On Thursday, yellow tape blocked about a quarter mile of the beach to public access, CNN affiliate WPMI-TV reported. Local officials said the temporary closure was put in place to speed up the cleanup process. Pensacola Beach is open, but the waters from the Park West recreation area to the area just west of Portofino are closed to all swimming and wading until further notice because of large quantities of emulsified oil in shore waters and along the shoreline, the visitors bureau said. \\"The shoreline and water along Santa Rosa Sound on the north side of the island is still clean, clear and open for swimming,\\" according to the bureau's website. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches. A no-swimming notice has been issued for Destin Beach because of the presence of \\"tar chips,\\" according to the website of the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the destination. There were no reported oil impacts along beaches of south Walton County on Friday morning, the area's Tourist Development Council said on its website. The health advisory issued this week for a stretch of beach in the western end of the county has been lifted after two consecutive, clean high-tide cycles, the council said. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. \\"Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,\\" according to the bureau. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key.

Bond kills a test subject, and later the \\"real\\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud. While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd systematically kill several diamond smugglers, M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem as though Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse. At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter, then travels to Las Vegas. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send it to a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond watches Tree's act and afterwards goes to his dressing room, where he discovers that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake.

Simply write a short message thanking them for their time, explain that you’re not interested, and wish them the best.

Review: This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre defining MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, brainiac, great whites(and other species of shark, bull, black-tip, oceanic white-tip, tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found. Humans don't often make it onto that menu, granted, but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior. It's not like it's never happened. The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town, singling out a human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned \\"nemesis\\", are close enough to the water for it to reach, are so slim as to be laughable. Much like this turd of a Jaws knock-off. Laughable. Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, as they look like seals from below. A shark the size of Bruce(if you don't know, look it up)would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca(hey! that's the name of the blatant rip-off we're discussing!), as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs. I could go on, but I don't need to. Jaws is amazing(better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is crap(BLATANT rip-off of Jaws, lousy writing, abominable effects, most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick).

Eye contact can also help you determine whether a topic of conversation is one that your conversation partner will enjoy. If he begins to seem distracted or look elsewhere, you should consider changing the topic, asking your partner a question, or politely ending the conversation. Silences happen. Feel free to embrace these silences, especially with those with whom you are already close. Don't feel obligated to fill every break in a conversation with your opinions, questions, and stories: sometimes these breaks are natural and positive. Pause every once in a while as you speak. This will allow your partner to change topics, ask you questions, or end the conversation if necessary. Be sure that you are not monologuing. If you are first getting to know somebody, you should withhold your most intimate details until you get to know them better. Oversharing might make you appear gossipy, inappropriate, or shocking. Keep things factual but appropriately intimate until you become better acquainted. Some topics to avoid oversharing about include:  Bodily or sexual functions Recent breakups or relationship turmoil Political and religious opinions Gossip and salacious stories Topics that people do not like discussing in the workplace include personal appearance, relationship status, and socioeconomic status. Political and religious affiliations can also be taboo, depending on the context. Be sensitive to your listener and try to keep things casual and light until you have a better sense of what they are interested in. If you have a funny story to share, make sure that it is brief or that it has something to do with your listener's interests. Just because a topic is interesting to you doesn't make it interesting to others. Feel free to share (briefly) your interests and enthusiasms, and then gauge your listener's responses. Let them ask you follow-up questions (if they are interested in learning more) or change the subject (if they'd rather discuss something else). It is not just your responsibility to keep the conversation going—it takes two to tango. If the other person is really not interested in your conversation, find another person to converse with. Don't beat yourself up over an unsuccessful conversation. Maintain eye contact and listen carefully when your conversation partner is speaking. Do not appear distracted or bored. Show that you are engaged and interested. A good listener is someone who will actually listen and focus on the other person instead of just trying to look engaged. Be present when someone else is speaking. Avoid trying to think of what you are going to say next. Instead, just listen to them. Conversations will go more smoothly if you smile, nod, and show interest with your body language. Don't shift too much, cross your arms, look down at your toes, or stare at your phone. Maintain an appropriate amount of eye contact and face your conversation partner openly.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Stepfather III ( also known as Stepfather III : Father 's Day in home video releases ) is a 1992 slasher film directed and written by Guy Magar and starring Robert Wightman and Priscilla Barnes . Stepfather III is the second sequel to 1987 's The Stepfather and concerns the titular serial killer seeking out yet another all - American family to become a part of , using plastic surgery to disguise himself from the authorities .  - Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It includes cosmetic or aesthetic surgery, reconstructive surgery, craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns.  - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection....    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'color' with 'color'. Answer:","output":"There is no specific entity mentioned in the paragraphs above that has a direct relation to 'color.'

Într-o lume în care tehnologia și inovația joacă un rol esențial în dezvoltarea economică și socială, protejarea drepturilor de proprietate intelectuală devine tot mai importantă. Comisia Europeană ar trebui să depună eforturi suplimentare în promovarea unei legislații eficiente și implementarea unor măsuri adecvate împotriva contrafacerii și a încălcării drepturilor de proprietate intelectuală, atât la nivel național, cât și internațional. Aceasta ar duce la stimularea inovării, consolidarea pieței unice și creșterea încrederii consumatorilor în produsele și serviciile oferite. Lupta împotriva contrafacerii implică o serie de acțiuni, precum despărțirea în două a lanțurilor de aprovizionare ilicite, persecutarea traficanților și a infractorilor responsabili de producerea și distribuirea bunurilor contrafăcute și cooperarea dintre autoritățile naționale și internaționale în vederea schimbului de informații și a coordonării acțiunilor. În plus, ar trebui să se acorde o atenție sporită educării consumatorilor cu privire la riscurile asociate cu utilizarea și achiziționarea bunurilor și serviciilor contrafăcute, precum și măsuri de prevenire a acestor situații. Protejarea drepturilor de proprietate intelectuală înseamnă asigurarea că persoanele care au creat și dezvoltat idei și produse originale beneficiază de recunoaștere și recompensă corespunzătoare pentru efortul și resursele investite în procesul de inovație. Acest lucru implică îmbunătățirea legislației și a reglementărilor privind brevetele, mărcile, drepturile de autor și alte forme de proprietate intelectuală, precum și combaterea eficientă a plagiatorilor și a celor care încalcă aceste drepturi.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Fact 2: Plants breathe oxygen into the atmosphere.  Given the two facts above, cells cannot survive without plants breathing into what? The answer is:","output":"Cells cannot survive without plants breathing into the atmosphere. The intricate connection between cells, oxygen, plants, and the atmosphere is a testament to the delicate balance of life on Earth. Based on the two facts given, we can conclude that cells cannot survive without plants contributing oxygen to the atmosphere. To understand this relationship more deeply, we need to explore the processes that enable cells to use oxygen and the role plants play in providing it. Fact 1 states that cells cannot survive without oxygen, which is true for many living organisms, especially for those that rely on aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the process by which cells use oxygen to break down glucose and other organic molecules, ultimately producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Oxygen is essential in this process, acting as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, which drives ATP synthesis. Without oxygen, the electron transport chain would not function effectively, leading to the buildup of toxic waste products and, eventually, cell death. Fact 2 highlights the crucial role of plants in maintaining life on Earth by generating oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into organic compounds like glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct. This released oxygen then enters the atmosphere, replenishing the oxygen supply that aerobic organisms need for cellular respiration. Given these facts, it becomes clear that cells cannot survive without plants breathing oxygen into the atmosphere. The relationship between plants and other living organisms is mutually beneficial. While plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, they also utilize a portion of the oxygen generated for their cellular respiration. The remaining oxygen released into the atmosphere supports the respiration of countless aerobic organisms, including animals and microorganisms. Moreover, these organisms release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration which, in turn, provides the carbon dioxide necessary for plants to continue photosynthesis. This interconnected cycle highlights the interdependence between different life forms on Earth, and its delicate balance. In conclusion, cells cannot survive without plants breathing oxygen into the atmosphere. This essential resource is a fundamental component of life on Earth, ensuring the continual survival and growth of countless organisms. By exploring the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis, we gain insight into the intricate balance that exists between different life forms and the indispensability of plants in maintaining this equilibrium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We see laughter , we see the faces , we hear the music .","output":"Analyzing these sentences, we can conclude that the two sentences do not mean the same thing even though they contain the same elements. The difference lies in the senses involved and the observation attributed to each element. Explanation : 1. \\"We hear the laughter, we see the faces, we see the music.\\" This sentence indicates that laughter is being heard and the faces and music are being visually perceived or metaphorically seen (since music is generally associated with hearing and not sight). 2. \\"We see laughter, we see the faces, we hear the music.\\" This sentence indicates that both the laughter and faces are being visually perceived while music is being heard. The difference between these two sentences is that in the first sentence, laughter is associated with hearing, and music with sight. In the second sentence, laughter is associated with sight, and music with hearing.  Hearing laughter and seeing music can be a figurative or metaphoric use of senses, like seeing music could be interpreted as seeing the people play music or the visual representation of the music, whereas seeing laughter could mean seeing people laugh. However, in their standard understanding, laughter is usually something we hear, and music is something we hear as well. Consequently, matching sensory input with expected understanding, the second sentence is more congruent.

Article: It's important to learn about protecting our environment. Here is a 5R rule for us: 1.  Reduce If you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste 2.  Reuse You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters. 3.  Recycle Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted   and the melted things are made for new coke cans. 4.  Recover When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food. 5.  Repair If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away.

Please answer the following question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?

Koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \\"exi\\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records. As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year. Credited to \\"Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers\\", the single \\"My Bonnie\\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the Musikmarkt chart.After the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing Merseybeat movement.

Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is then seen running away from home. He and his friends ride down the Mississippi River on a raft, but hit a sharp rock, which throws Tom into the water. His friends find him washed up on the shore, and Tom finds it was Huck Finn (Brad Renfro) who carried him to safety. Huck learns of an unusual way to remove warts - by taking a dead cat to the graveyard at night. There they witness Injun Joe and Muff Potter (Mike McShane), the town drunk, digging up the grave of Vic \\"One-Eyed\\" Murrell for Doctor Robinson. A treasure map is discovered and when Doc tries to betray the two men, Injun Joe murders him with Muff's knife. The next morning, Muff is charged for the murder. Unfortunately, Tom and Huck had signed an oath saying that if either of them came forward about it, they would drop dead and rot. The boys embark on a search for Injun Joe's treasure map, so they can declare Muff innocent and still keep their oath. The only problem is, the map is in Injun Joe's pocket. After Injun Joe finds the last treasure, he burns the map and discovers that Tom was a witness to the crime. He finds Tom and threatens he will kill him if he ever tells anyone about the murder. However, at the time, the entire community believed that he was dead, and the friendship between Tom and Huck starts to decline because of the fact that their evidence (the map) to prove Muff innocent, while preserving their oath, is destroyed. At Muff Potter's trial, Tom decides that his friendship with Muff is more important than his oath with Huck and tells the truth. The court finds Muff innocent of all charges and goes after Injun Joe. As a result, Injun Joe decides to hold up his end of the bargain by killing Tom. When Injun Joe returns to the tavern, he kills his accomplice Emmett (Lanny Flaherty) for cheating him.

Answer the following question: Digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb, and digestive enzymes are necessary for a complete digestion. Given these facts, what supplement would a human take to aid in breaking down food among the following options: - sweating  - Energy  - Enzymes.  - Calcium supplements.  - Energy.  - Antacid.  - Protein supplement.  - evaporation Answer:","output":"Out of the given options, the most suitable supplement for a human to take to aid in breaking down food would be enzymes. This is because digestive enzymes play a crucial role in the process of digestion, helping to break down large food molecules into smaller, more easily absorbed components. These enzymes are essential for the proper functioning of the digestive system, and taking a supplement containing them can help to ensure that food is being broken down effectively. Here's a brief overview of the other options and why they are not as suitable for aiding in digestion: 1. Sweating: Sweating is a natural bodily function that helps to regulate body temperature, but it has no direct relation to the process of digestion. Thus, it would not be an effective supplement to aid in breaking down food. 2. Energy: Energy is not a supplement, but rather a general term used to describe the capacity to do work or produce heat. In the context of digestion, the body needs energy to perform the various processes involved, but consuming a supplement called \\"energy\\" would not directly help to break down food. 3. Calcium supplements: While calcium is an important mineral for maintaining strong bones and teeth, as well as for proper nerve and muscle function, it does not specifically aid in the digestion of food. 4. Antacid: Antacids are medications that help to neutralize stomach acid, providing relief from heartburn, indigestion, and other symptoms related to excess stomach acid. While they can provide some relief in cases of indigestion, they do not directly aid in breaking down food, as they do not contain digestive enzymes. 5. Protein supplement: Protein supplements are designed to provide additional protein to one's diet, which can be helpful for muscle growth, repair, and overall health. However, they do not play a direct role in the process of breaking down food in the digestive system. 6. Evaporation: Evaporation is the process of turning a liquid into a gas and has no relevance to digestion or supplements that aid in breaking down food. In conclusion, the best option among the given choices for a supplement specifically designed to aid in breaking down food in the digestive system is enzymes. A supplement containing digestive enzymes can help to support healthy digestion by supplementing the body's natural production of enzymes and ensuring a more efficient breakdown of nutrients for absorption and utilization in the body."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Radiologic follow-up examinations took place postoperatively, after 6 and 12 weeks, and after 6, 12, and 18 months to measure osteotomy gap filling at each follow-up. Bone healing was compared in smokers versus nonsmokers who underwent open wedge HTOs with intact lateral hinges. Fractured lateral hinges were classified according to the Takeuchi classification and separately analyzed regarding bone healing. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo early (11 days) or standard (6 weeks) full-weight-bearing rehabilitation.', 'A delay in the osteotomy gap filling rate between smokers and nonsmokers could be observed at all follow-up periods, but differences were not significant. A fracture of the lateral hinge was found in 39% of the patients. A type I fracture was observed in 14% of patients, a type II fracture was observed in 13%, and a type III fracture was found in 6%. The highest increase in the osteotomy gap filling rate was observed between 12 weeks and 6 months after surgery in patients with intact lateral hinges. For patients with unstable type II fractures, the highest increase in the gap filling rate was delayed until 6 to 12 months. Early full weight bearing had no effect on the gap filling rate in any of the patient groups evaluated. Answer: This study shows that osteotomy gap filling after open wedge HTO is delayed in smokers and in patients in whom opening of the gap resulted in unstable lateral hinge fractures. Early full weight bearing did not have a significant effect on the gap filling rate.

What is the answer: Which French phrase translates as ‘blow of mercy’?","output":"The French phrase translating to \\"blow of mercy\\" is \\"coup de grâce.\\" This phrase has been borrowed into the English language and is commonly used in various contexts today. The phrase \\"coup de grâce\\" combines the words \\"coup\\" (blow, stroke), \\"de\\" (of), and \\"grâce\\" (mercy). In the original French context, this term is related to offering a swift, decisive, and merciful blow to end the suffering of a wounded individual or animal. It is often seen being used to describe a finishing stroke, meant to bring an end to the physical pain and suffering. This finishing blow could be anything from a sword thrust to a gunshot, depending on the circumstances. In the English language, \\"coup de grâce\\" has taken on a slightly broader meaning. While it still refers to an action that effectively puts an end to a difficult situation or suffering, it can also be used metaphorically. For example, in literature, a coup de grâce can refer to the final event or plot twist that brings a story to a close. It can also refer to the decisive moment in a competition or contest when the outcome is determined. In short, the French phrase \\"coup de grâce\\" translates to \\"blow of mercy\\" and is used to describe an action that mercifully ends the suffering or struggle of a person or an animal. It can be employed both literally and figuratively to depict the final, decisive event that brings closure to a challenging situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ask them for an autograph politely if you’re mailing a letter. Thank them and wish them well.","output":"Title: The Art of Writing the Perfect Fan Letter: A Guide to Conveying Your Admiration Introduction: In today's era of digital communication, receiving a heartfelt handwritten note, especially from a devoted fan, can warm a celebrity's heart. While it can be tempting to let your passion for a famous person translate into pages of admiration, it is essential to note that brevity is the key to writing a tasteful and thoughtful fan letter. This guide will walk you through the steps of expressing your gratitude and appreciation effectively, ensuring that your message is not only genuine but also well-received by the recipient of your praise. Step 1: Keep it Short and Concise Long, rambling letters may be cathartic to write, but they can be difficult for busy celebrities to read and digest. Remember that your favorite star likely receives countless fan letters, so being concise and respectful of their time will make your note stand out and increase the chances of a favorable response. Step 2: Introduce Yourself Don't assume that the recipient of your message knows who you are; give them a brief introduction to your life. Include your name, occupation, hobbies, and perhaps some details about how you became a fan. It's perfectly fine to express your admiration for the celebrity, but be sure not to go overboard. Focus on highlighting your genuine connection to their work instead of bombarding them with excessive flattery. Step 3: Mention Your Favorite Works By identifying and discussing your favorite book, film, or television show featuring the celebrity, you demonstrate genuine appreciation for their art and achievements. Detail why that particular work resonates with you, such as its powerful impact on your life or a particular scene that moved you. This reinforces your authenticity as a fan and helps build a stronger connection to the celebrity. Step 4: Request an Autograph If you're mailing your letter, politely requesting an autograph creates an extra touch of personalization. However, keep in mind that the primary goal of your message should be to express admiration for the celebrity's talent, not just to collect a memento. As such, be polite and understanding in your request - make it clear that having their autograph would mean a great deal to you, but also express that you understand if they are too busy or unable to provide one. Step 5: Gratitude and Well Wishes Always end your letter by thanking the celebrity for the time and effort they invest into their work, and wish them continued success in their career and personal life. By acknowledging the hard work and dedication they put into their craft, you demonstrate that you understand and appreciate their role as an artist. Conclusion: Whether sending a letter by traditional mail or engaging in a social media exchange, a well-crafted fan letter can leave a lasting impression on a celebrity.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who is depressed and distrustful? is inside the article: Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing. One of the boys from the cafe agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot to do some investigating there., can you guess it ?

Let's combine them: (-3678 + 3634) * s = -44 * s Now our equation looks like this: -44*s + 572 = 0 Next, we want to move +572 to the other side of the equation where we have the zero. To do that, we will subtract 572 from both sides: -44*s = -572 Now, we need to find the value of \\"s\\". To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -44: s = -572 / -44 When you divide -572 by -44, you get: s = 13 So, the solution to the math problem is s = 13."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN)  -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari denied his nation was involved in last week's deadly attacks on Mumbai, India, and told CNN on Tuesday he's seen no evidence that a suspect in custody is a Pakistani national as Indian officials claim. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari says he believes the Mumbai attackers were \\"stateless actors.\\" \\"I think these are stateless actors who have been operating all throughout the region,\\" Zardari said on CNN's \\"Larry King Live\\" in an interview set to air Tuesday night. \\"The gunmen plus the planners, whoever they are, [are] stateless actors who have been holding hostage the whole world.\\" \\"It was conveyed to the","output":"Indian government that we are ready to cooperate in any possible way in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks,\\" Zardari continued. \\"Our security agencies are on high alert, and we are committed to bringing the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice.\\" Indian officials have accused the Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, of carrying out the November 26-29 assault on the Indian financial capital, which left at least 164 people dead and more than 300 injured. India's Foreign Ministry has said that the sole surviving attacker, Ajmal Kasab, is a Pakistani national and has provided what it calls \\"evidence\\" to Pakistani authorities. In response to these claims, Zardari urged for caution and further investigation. \\"We need to act responsibly and thoroughly investigate all possible sources of information before pointing fingers at anyone,\\" he said. \\"We must remember that our goal is not to create tensions between our two nations but to work together to combat terrorism.\\" Despite the growing tensions and accusations, both Pakistan and India have expressed their willingness to cooperate with each other to find those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. A joint investigation team has been established, consisting of representatives from both countries' intelligence and law enforcement agencies. As the investigation progresses, new evidence emerges, including phone intercepts and intelligence reports suggesting that the planning and training for the attack took place in Pakistan. This information puts increasing pressure on Pakistan to provide a satisfactory response and concrete actions to prevent future attacks. In an attempt to ease the escalating tensions, President Zardari orders a crackdown on Lashkar-e-Taiba and its affiliated groups. Several arrests are made, including high-ranking members of the organization, and their assets are seized. The crackdown on Lashkar-e-Taiba reveals connections to other extremist groups operating within Pakistan. As a result, the country is forced to review its domestic counter-terrorism strategy and implement stricter measures to prevent the rise of extremist ideologies and terrorist activities. Ultimately, the growing pressure on Pakistan to cooperate in the investigation and address its internal security issues results in positive developments for both India and Pakistan. The joint investigation team achieves significant breakthroughs, leading to the arrest and prosecution of key individuals responsible for the Mumbai attacks. This increased cooperation in intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism efforts sets the stage for a new era of collaboration between the two countries in their fight against terrorism. However, the region's complex history and ongoing tensions remain a challenge for India and Pakistan. As they continue to build trust and work together on matters of security and terrorism, both countries must remain vigilant against the evolving threats and be prepared to reassess their strategies as needed. Only time will tell if this newfound spirit of cooperation between these two nuclear-armed neighbors will lead to a more stable and peaceful South Asia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

No Although both questions are related to working at Evalueserve, they have slightly different meanings and may elicit different responses. Let me provide a detailed explanation of each question and how they differ: 1. What is it like to work at Evalueserve, Mumbai? This question focuses on the overall experience of working at Evalueserve's Mumbai location. The person asking this question may be interested in understanding the office environment, company culture, employee interactions, work ethics, and the type of projects they might be working on. Responding to this question may involve sharing personal experiences, work-life balance, challenges, growth opportunities, and learning experiences while working at Evalueserve, Mumbai. Additionally, this question directs attention to the specific location (Mumbai) and may expect responses that address location-specific advantages or challenges. 2. How is the work-life at Evalueserve? This question, on the other hand, primarily focuses on the work-life balance at Evalueserve. Work-life balance refers to the equilibrium between one's professional and personal life and how the company supports employees in achieving that balance. The person asking this question might be more interested in knowing about flexible working hours, workload management, stress levels, and the company's policies for vacation time, maternity/paternity leaves, and availability of support systems. In this case, the question does not specifically mention the Mumbai location so it could apply to any of Evalueserve's locations.

We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson. Such a creepy individual, I didn't make that mistake again. Question: What happened after the author asked for the I.D. of the utility man? === The answer to the above question is OPTIONS:  (A). not enough information  (B).

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  I am facing a new situation today: Gary researched two old human settlements. Village A was smaller, it existed about 12,000 years ago. He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village had a more dependable food supply available? The answer is:","output":"Village B likely had a more dependable food supply available. Based on the information from the background article, agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago, which provided a bigger and more dependable food supply for human settlements. Since Village A existed about 12,000 years ago, it predates the invention of agriculture, and its inhabitants likely relied on hunting and gathering for their sustenance, which would not have been as dependable. On the other hand, Village B existed about 6,000 years ago, after the invention of agriculture. The fact that it was also bigger and better developed suggests that the people in Village B had access to the benefits of agriculture, which would have provided a more dependable food supply."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Question: Where would you put some coffee if you are thirsty? Options:  A. container  B. internet cafe  C. starbucks  D. cup  E. supermarket Answer:","output":"The most reasonable and common-sense choice would be option D. Cup.  Here is a detailed explanation: A. Container: It's not wrong per se to put coffee in a container, as containers do serve the function of holding beverages. However, the term 'container' is quite broad and may not necessarily imply something suitable for immediate consumption - it could refer to large storage containers or small Tupperware boxes. When you are thirsty and want to have a drink, you typically put the beverage in an easily accessible and useable container, like a cup or mug. B. Internet Cafe: An Internet cafe is a small business that offers Internet services to the public. They might serve coffee, but one wouldn't put coffee 'into' an Internet cafe (unless it's a coffee delivery order for the cafe). C. Starbucks: Starbucks is a well-known coffeehouse chain that sells a variety of beverages, including coffee. Similar to the Internet cafe reasoning, one wouldn't put coffee 'into' a Starbucks unless you crafted coffee yourself to sell there, which doesn't seem applicable based on the question. D. Cup: A cup is a small, bowl-shaped container for drinking from, typically having a handle. It's common that coffee is consumed from a cup. Hence, if you're thirsty and want to consume coffee, pouring it into a cup would make the most sense.  E. Supermarket: Supermarkets are where you can buy coffee, not a place where you would put it to drink. Putting coffee into a supermarket would mean you are intending to sell or distribute it, not consume it. So, selecting a 'cup' as the best option aligns with common sense and is consistent with everyday human activities. It's conventional to drink coffee from a cup, and the question implies immediate consumption (\\"...if you are thirsty\\"), thus suggesting drinking rather than storing or selling the coffee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: When you truly love being a server, it shows. You will become infectious with your good attitude and earn larger tips. People are proven to tip higher when they feel a social connection with their server, as if they could be friends. The best way to cultivate this attitude is to enjoy your work and interactions with others. A big, open-lipped smile can increase tips up to 140%. Take some time to get presentable before arriving to work. A dirty waiter or waitress is unpleasant to look at and reflects poorly on you and the restaurant. Wash your apron and uniform, and make an effort to wear nice clothes when at work. While attractiveness hasn't been proven to increase tips for male waiters, effort and cleanliness definitely does.  Women should wear a little basic make-up to earn more tips, as a French study showed that 50% more men left tips to waitresses wearing make-up than those wearing none. Unfortunately, more attractive women have been proven to get higher tips than less, but you should exploit this fact for your own benefit as well.  The same study found that adding a bit of personality to your outfit, like a flower or button, increased tips by roughly 15%. For women, this is particularly noticeable when wearing something in your hair. In order to build connections with customers, and thus increase your tips, be sure to let the table know your name. When you arrive, say hello and let them know your name before launching into the specials. Waitstaff who introduced themselves earned roughly 2 more per bill. If the table offers you their names, be sure to remember them and use them. The best way to do this is when you get the check. When returning a credit or debit card, be sure to thank the name on the card when handing over the check -- it's been shown to increase tips. When people feel treated or gifted upon, they generally try to \\"pay back\\" the person being generous to them. Even writing a simple \\"Thank You\\" on the back of a check was shown to increase tips, and simple smiley faces and pictures help as well. Being kind and generous during the meal can create the same effect. If someone spills something, or an order doesn't come out perfectly, you should offer to rectify the situation for them as best you can. This is especially crucial when it is busy or the restaurant is filling up. While you should always be kind and courteous, you want people to eat, pay, and move on so that you can get a new table, and thus a new tip. To do this, come collect the dishes once everyone has finished eating, and ask about further courses (like dessert) instead of waiting for them to ask you.","output":"To earn larger tips as a server, cultivate a genuine, positive attitude and social connections with customers. Present yourself cleanly and attractively, and consider adding a personal touch to your outfit. Introduce yourself and remember customers' names. Thank customers when handing over checks and consider writing a small \\"Thank You\\" note.

I am a huge fan of Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, and Almost Famous (I wasn't that big on Singles), so it's safe to say that I look forward to anything that Cameron Crowe attaches his name to. I went to see Vanilla Sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that I probably wouldn't like it if I was expecting anything similar to Crowe's other films. Well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong. It is a very weird movie, and nothing really comes together until the end. Anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory. Anyway, the movie was stellar, and I look forward to owning it as soon as the DVD is released. I was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end. This is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion, if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot.

I'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this. I don't mean that to sound pompous, but some people are more cut out for the Seagal, Chan, Van Damme genre of movies, and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie. It is very cerebral, so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender, as well as much thought afterwards. As far as comparing this film to other Crowe movies, it is very similar in at least one regard, in all Crowe movies, the soundtrack is a character unto itself. This is almost definitely due to Crowe's longstanding ties to music, as anyone who has seen Almost Famous knows, and to his marriage to Heart star Nancy Wilson. It was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between Tom Cruise's acting and Crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen Jerry Maguire. In my mind, that is not a bad thing.

It may exist a man in the park.","output":"A linguist would likely find the given sentence, \\"It may exist a man in the park,\\" to be grammatically incorrect in standard English. While the sentence attempts to convey a message that there might be a man in the park, it fails to adhere to English grammar rules. In order to understand the linguistic reasoning for this, let's analyze the sentence's structure, syntax, and word choice. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence. A standard English sentence follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. In the given sentence, \\"It\\" is the subject, \\"may exist\\" is the verb phrase, and \\"a man in the park\\" is the object. This structure is deviant from the typical SVO word order due to the presence of a so-called \\"dummy\\" subject \\"it,\\" which does not refer to a specific entity but is used for purely grammatical purposes. 2. Word choice: \\"Exist\\" is used in this sentence to suggest the presence of a man. However, the verb \\"exist\\" is not typically used in the context of a person being in a location. More appropriate verbs such as \\"be\\" or \\"find\\" would convey this meaning more accurately. In addition, the modal verb \\"may\\" is combined with \\"exist\\" in this context, which makes the construction somewhat awkward. 3. Alternative structures: A correct structure would involve using the existential \\"there\\" construction, which is widely used in English to indicate the presence or existence of something. In this case, the sentence can be rephrased as: \\"There may be a man in the park.\\" or \\"A man may be in the park.\\" Both alternatives adhere to English grammatical rules and convey the intended message more effectively and directly. The first sentence utilizes the \\"there\\" construction, while the second avoids it, employing the standard SVO syntax with \\"a man\\" as the subject. In conclusion, the original sentence, \\"It may exist a man in the park,\\" would be considered grammatically incorrect by most linguists due to its deviance from standard English syntax rules and peculiar verb choice. By rephrasing it using the appropriate verbs and syntax, the intended message can be effectively communicated."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president.

News article: Mars' two moon,s Phobos (shown here) and Deimos, may have formed from a ring of debris around the Red Planet. Larger moons formed in the same debris ring may have crashed into Mars.      The moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, may be the only survivors of a giant impact that created many short-lived, but now-absent moons around the Red Planet, a new study finds.      Phobos and Deimos are both small for moons — about 14 and 7.7 miles (22.5 and 12.4 kilometers) wide, respectively — and sort of potato-shaped. Compared to other satellites in the solar system, they look more like asteroids. As a result, astronomers previously hypothesized that these moons were asteroids captured by Mars' gravitational pull.      But if that were the case, previous research suggested that Phobos and Deimos would have relatively irregular orbits. In reality, these moons have nearly circular orbits positioned near the Martian equator. [Photos of Mars' Moon Phobos Up Close]      This diagram shows the collision model for the formation of Mars' two moons. A giant collision (top left) creates a disk of material around Mars (top right), and large moons emerge from the disk of material. More moons form. Eventually, the large moons fall back into Mars, and two small moons remain. Credit: A. Trinh - Royal Observatory of Belgium      Another possible origin story for the Martian moons is that they coalesced from the debris of a giant impact, similar to the one largely thought to have formed Earth's moon. This rubble would have first formed a ring around Mars, and as moons emerged from this ring, they would have ended up with similarly circular orbits. However, this possibility raises the question of why Mars would end up with two moons instead of a single moon like Earth did, according to the new research paper.      To learn more about the potential origins of Phobos and Deimos,study lead author Pascal Rosenblatt, lead author on the new study, and a planetary scientist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels, and his colleagues investigated scenarios \\"left on the side until now,\\" Rosenblatt told Space.com. \\"I rapidly discovered they were left not always for justified reasons.\\"      The scientists focused on the huge impact that previous research suggested created the gigantic Borealis basin in the northern lowlands of Mars, which covers two-fifths of the Red Planet's surface. Prior work suggested that this basin is an impact crater, created when an impactor about 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) wide struck Mars, generating a ring of debris around the Red Planet with a mass of about 110 quadrillion tons (100 quadrillion metric tons), or about 10,000 times the combined mass of Phobos and Deimos.      The research team's computer models suggested that, over time, in the inner part of this debris ring where the rubble was most densely packed, large moons up to hundreds of miles in diameter would have clumped or accreted together. In contrast, in the outer part of the debris ring, dust and rocks were thinly dispersed, making it difficult for this material to accrete into moons.      However, the scientists found that gravitational tugs from one or more large moons from the inner debris ring could have stirred up rubble in the outer ring, shepherding rock and dust to form smaller outer moons, such as Phobos and Deimos. The researchers calculated that after about 5 million years, Mars' gravitational pull would have doomed the other moons, sending them crashing to the Red Planet's surface and leaving Phobos and Deimos as the sole survivors.      \\"Our results pave a new path to re-understand the Martian system in a context of formation similar but not identical to [that of] our own moon,\\" Rosenblatt told Space.com.      After a large moon forms from the disk of material around Mars (following a collision with a second body), the gravitational influence of that large body spurs the formation of smaller moons, like Phobos and Deimos. Credit: Labex UnivEarths / Université Paris Diderot      If a giant impact did create the Martian moons and the Borealis basin, that might help explain many other aspects of early Martian history, such as how Mars got its current rate of spin and lost its atmosphere and surface water, Rosenblatt said.      Although the orbit of Deimos is stable, previous research found that Phobos will one day crash against Mars as well. Indeed, a 2015 study found that Phobos already has stretch marks from the Red Planet's gravitational pull.      This model suggests that Phobos and Deimos are composed of a mix of material from Mars and the impactor that created the Borealis basin. Future research can test this model by returning samples from Phobos or Deimos to Earth for study, Rosenblatt said. He noted that Japan's space agency, JAXA, and the European Space Agency (ESA) are considering missions to these moons that \\"could be launched as soon as 2022 or 2024.\\"      The scientists detailed their findings online July 4 in the journal Nature Geoscience.      Follow Charles Q. Choi on Twitter @cqchoi. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebookand Google+. ||||| Mars is a planet of outsized splendor. Despite being only half as big and a tenth as heavy as Earth, it bears the solar system’s tallest mountain, longest canyon and largest crater. At 22 and 12 kilometers wide, however, its inner moon Phobos and outer moon Deimos are figurative small potatoes. Scientists suspect both formed much as Earth’s single large moon did, from a massive debris disk ejected into orbit by a giant impact eons ago. But if Mars’s moons formed like Earth’s, why are they so very much smaller?      The answer may be that they did not form alone. New simulations from Pascal Rosenblatt of the Royal Observatory of Belgium and colleagues show how the debris disk from a giant impact on Mars could have generated additional moons a few hundreds of kilometers in size. After forming in the dense inner regions of the disk, those larger moons would have stirred the disk’s sparser outer reaches, allowing smaller companions like Phobos and Deimos to coalesce from the ripples. The study appears in the journal Nature Geoscience. [Rosenblatt et al., Accretion of Phobos and Deimos in an extended debris disc stirred by transient moons]      In this scenario, the reason we only see Phobos and Deimos today is that the bigger moons were destroyed a few million years after their formation. Their low, fast orbits outpaced Mars’s rotation, creating a tidal pull that sent them spiraling down to crash into the planet (Earth’s moon, by contrast, orbited slower than our planet’s rotation, allowing it to spiral outward and survive). Future investigations could test the new hypothesis by looking for clusters of Martian craters produced by the infalling moons, but in the meantime, proof that Mars can kill its companions is right before our eyes: The orbit of Deimos is stable, but Phobos is in a death spiral, losing two centimeters of altitude per year to Mars’s tidal pull. It will plunge into the planet in 20 [million] to 40 million years, leaving lonely, far-out Deimos as the last vestige of what may have been a once-mighty system of Martian moons.      —Lee Billings      [The above text is a transcript of this podcast.]      [Scientific American is part of Springer Nature.] ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"New research suggests that Mars' two potato-shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, could be the sole survivors of a giant impact, creating many short-lived, now-absent moons around the Red Planet.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON — Clinics that provide abortions or refer patients to places that do would lose federal funding under a new Trump administration rule that takes direct aim at Planned Parenthood, according to three administration officials.      The rule, which is to be announced Friday, is a top priority of social conservatives and is the latest move by President Trump to impose curbs on abortion rights, in this case by withholding money from any facility or program that promotes abortion or refers patients to a caregiver that will provide one.      The policy would be a return to one instituted in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan that required abortion services to have a “physical separation” and “separate personnel” from other family planning activities. That policy is often described as a domestic gag rule because it barred caregivers at facilities that received family planning funds from providing any information to patients about an abortion or where to receive one. But a Trump administration official who detailed the forthcoming proposal said the new version of the policy would not impose a blanket prohibition on abortion counseling.      Federal family planning laws already ban direct funding of organizations that use abortion as a family planning method. But conservative activists and Republican lawmakers have been pressing Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, to tighten the rules further so that abortions could not occur — or be performed by the same staff — at locations that receive Title X federal family planning money. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Jonathan Allen      WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved forward with a proposal Friday that would effectively ban Planned Parenthood and similar organizations from providing abortion and related services under the same roof as operations funded by federal family-planning grants, according to an administration official.      The so-called Hyde amendment prohibits the use of competitive federal family-planning grant funds for abortion, but organizations like Planned Parenthood have traditionally used the federal money for other health services while using private money for abortions and related services — sometimes at the same facilities and with the same staff.      Based on a Reagan-era regulation and championed by abortion-rights opponents, the new rule would force entities that receive so-called Title X family-planning funding to maintain physical and financial separation between taxpayer-backed operations and any related facilities that perform abortions, support the procedures or receive referrals about them, the official said.      In addition to the policy implications, the decision is a monumental signal by President Donald Trump to anti-abortion activists entering a midterm election cycle in which Republicans are worried that they will lose seats in Congress — and perhaps control of one or both chambers — because of a lack of enthusiasm within the GOP base.      \\"We thank President Trump for taking action to disentangle taxpayers from the abortion business,\\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that provides political support for candidates who oppose abortion. \\"This is a major victory which will energize the grass roots as we head into the critical midterm elections.      The proposed rule change — which was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by the Health and Human Services Department Friday morning — will drop a requirement that Title X grant recipients provide abortion counseling to patients. But it will stop short of giving abortion foes one provision they sought: a gag rule prohibiting recipients from discussing abortion with pregnant women.      \\"This is an attempt to take away women's basic rights, period,\\" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \\"Under this rule, people will not get the health care they need. They won't get birth control, cancer screenings, STD testing and treatment, or even general women's health exams.\\"      She added: \\"Everyone has the right to information about their health care — including information about safe, legal abortion, and every woman deserves the best medical care and information, no matter how much money she makes or where she lives. No matter what. They won’t get it under this rule.\\"      Alex Azar, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, which is issuing new rules on abortion funding Friday. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images      The proposed rule could hit many of the front-line health providers for the nation’s poorest. About two-thirds of people who visit family planning services are below the federal poverty level, according to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association.      The Title X program, which provides grants for a broad range of family-planning services, was created by a 1970 law whose lead sponsors included George H.W. Bush, then a Republican congressman from Texas.      In fiscal 2017, Congress appropriated 286.5 million in Title X grants, much of it to Planned Parenthood affiliates.      For critics of Planned Parenthood who have been frustrated by their inability to get Congress to ban funding for the group, the new rule is a tool to achieve a similar result.      The administration official framed the proposed rule as a choice for Planned Parenthood: separate themselves from abortion services or fund themselves entirely with private money. ||||| FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2018 file photo, President Donald Trump speaks to participants of the annual March for Life event, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington. The Trump administration... (Associated Press)      FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2018 file photo, President Donald Trump speaks to participants of the annual March for Life event, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington. The Trump administration... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration will resurrect a Reagan-era rule that would ban federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, or sharing space with abortion providers.      The Department of Health and Human Services will announce its proposal Friday, a senior White House official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to confirm the plans before the announcement.      The policy has been derided as a \\"gag rule\\" by abortion rights supporters and medical groups, and it is likely to trigger lawsuits that could keep it from taking effect. However, it's guaranteed to galvanize activists on both sides of the abortion debate ahead of the congressional midterm elections.      The Reagan-era rule barred family planning clinics from discussing abortion with women. It never went into effect as written, although the Supreme Court ruled that it was an appropriate use of executive power. The policy was rescinded under President Bill Clinton, and a new rule went into effect that required \\"nondirective\\" counseling to include a range of options for women.      According to a Trump administration summary, the new proposal will roll back the Clinton requirement that abortion could be discussed as an option along with prenatal care and adoption.      Abortion is a legal medical procedure, but federal family planning funds cannot be used to pay for abortion procedures.      Abortion opponents say a taxpayer-funded family planning program should have no connection to abortion. Doctors' groups and abortion rights supporters say a ban on counseling women trespasses on the doctor-patient relationship.      \\"The notion that you would withhold information from a patient does not uphold or preserve their dignity,\\" said Jessica Marcella of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, which represents family planning clinics. \\"I cannot imagine a scenario in which public health groups would allow this effort to go unchallenged.\\"      She said requiring family planning clinics to be physically separate from facilities in which abortion is provided would disrupt services for women across the country.      But Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America said, \\"Abortion is not health care or birth control and many women want natural health care choices, rather than hormone-induced changes.\\"      Abortion opponents allege the federal family planning program in effect cross-subsidizes abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood, whose clinics are also major recipients of grants for family planning and basic preventive care. Hawkins' group is circulating a petition to urge lawmakers in Congress to support the Trump administration's proposal.      Known as Title X, the nation's family-planning program serves about 4 million women a year through clinics, at a cost to taxpayers of about 260 million.      Planned Parenthood clinics also qualify for Title X grants, but they must keep the family-planning money separate from funds used to pay for abortions. The Republican-led Congress has unsuccessfully tried to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood, and the Trump administration has vowed to religious and social conservatives that it would keep up the effort.      __      Associated Press writer David Crary in New York contributed to this report. ||||| Senate Committee Any Committee Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (70th-115th) Armed Services (79th-115th) Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (70th-115th) Budget (93rd-115th) Commerce, Science, and Transportation (79th-115th) Energy and Natural Resources (70th-115th) Environment and Public Works (79th-115th) Finance (70th-115th) Foreign Relations (70th-115th) Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (70th-115th) Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (70th-115th) Judiciary (70th-115th) Rules and Administration (79th-115th) Small Business and Entrepreneurship (81st-115th) Veterans' Affairs (91st-115th)      State or Territory Indicated Any State or Territory Alabama Alaska American Samoa Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Guam Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Northern Mariana Islands Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virgin Islands Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming      Nomination Actions Any Nomination Action Placed on calendar as privileged nomination Committee requested information was received Referred to committee Hearings held Ordered reported Reported to Senate Committee discharged Placed on calendar Placed on calendar with footnote Considered by Senate Unanimous consent agreement Cloture motion Cloture invoked/not invoked Rereferred to committee Received message of withdrawal Returned to president Confirmed by Senate |||||","output":"The Trump Administration is planning a rule that would make clinics that provide or refer patients to places that do abortions lose federal funding.

Stories about animal kindness have really changed my point of view. In fact, some stories are amazing, especially when animals are meeting with people. Here are two stories that interest me.   James, a wildlife writer, told a story that an African woman had placed her baby in the shade of a tree while she was working. An elephant group walked by and saw the baby. Several elephants pulled leafy branches from the tree covered the sleeping baby. Flies can be a problem in Africa and the branches protected the baby from the flies. The elephants were so gentle and quiet that they did not even wake up the baby. Then the elephants walked away.    An English magazine offers another story. Bill, a cat, stayed at home while its master was away on a trip, but the man was injured in a railway accident and died a few days later in a hospital. At the funeral, the Man's brother was surprised to see that Bill was there. The faithful cat had traveled a long way to the hospital, looked at the coffin , and then sadly returned home.    Humans are only one part of the earth. The beautiful flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horses and the great eagles, these are our brothers. The sky and mountains, the cows and men, all belong to the same family. These stories, I hope, will inspire more people to treat animals as our friends rather than pets or our next meal.

Summarize the following: Rollers should be left in your hair for around 10 hours so a good time to have them in is while you sleep. Since you will need to wash your hair before putting in the rollers, it also makes sense to do this at night. It is best to put in the curlers when your hair is damp so that the curls last longer. Additionally, the hair will be easier to work with if it is damp.  Let your hair air dry rather than using a towel. Using a towel will make your hair difficult to put into rollers. Only use water when washing your hair before a curling. Combing your hair can help straighten it out so that the rollers will be more effective. Refer to this article about combing for more information. Continue combing until the comb does not catch any knots. It is best to use a spray as a cream can leave white flakes behind in your hair. Let the spray sit in your damp, combed hair for around 3-5 minutes before putting in the rollers. Divide your hair into equal 1-inch wide sections. Roll each of these sections into the roller so that your hair looks uniformly curly after the rollers are removed. Continue putting in the rollers until all of your hair is rolled up. If you do not have naturally curly hair, hairspray is the key to ensuring your curls will last a long time. Do not use much more than three sprays since too much hairspray can be damaging to your hair and the environment. Remove the rollers slowly so that your hair does not snag. Instead of pulling the rollers, roll them out. Reverse the process of putting them in. Apply even more hairspray to ensure that your curls last for a long time.","output":"To effectively use rollers for curls, wash hair with water and let it air dry until damp.

Himself unharmed, two of Gaddafi's sons were injured, and he claimed that his four-year-old adopted daughter Hanna was killed, although her existence has since been questioned.  In the immediate aftermath, Gaddafi retreated to the desert to meditate, while there were sporadic clashes between Gaddafists and army officers who wanted to overthrow the government. Although the U.S. was condemned internationally, Reagan received a popularity boost at home. Publicly lambasting U.S. imperialism, Gaddafi's reputation as an anti-imperialist was strengthened both domestically and across the Arab world, and in June 1986, he ordered the names of the month to be changed in Libya.

After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. The album topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive \\"No Synthesisers!\\" sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-\\"hard\\"-rock stance by the band, but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time. In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon.

It is important to recognize that the effectiveness of a workout can vary for different individuals and be impacted by multiple factors. Despite the lack of an incline setting, you can still achieve a good workout on a flat treadmill, though it may limit the variation and intensity of your exercise. In comparing treadmills with incline features to those without, there are several aspects to consider: 1. Workout variety: A treadmill with adjustable incline settings offers more versatility in workouts, allowing users to simulate uphill running or walking, which can enhance muscle engagement, offer a greater challenge to the cardiovascular system, and increase calorie burn. This may lead to more dynamic and engaging workouts compared to a treadmill with just one flat angle setting. 2. Muscle engagement: Using an incline setting on a treadmill can help target different muscle groups, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. On a flat treadmill, the engagement of these muscles is less diverse, but they are still exercised, specifically during running or walking at higher speeds. 3. Intensity: A treadmill with incline settings typically allows users to increase the intensity of their workouts, maximizing the cardiovascular benefits and overall fitness gains. While a flatt treadmill may not provide this added intensity, you can still increase the intensity of your workout by focusing on speed or interval training. 4. Joint impact: Running on a flat surface can impose greater stress on joints, such as the knees and ankles, particularly if done for long periods. An incline setting can help alleviate some of this pressure and encourage a more natural running stride. However, it is essential to adapt to your body's needs and be mindful of your joints when using any treadmill. In conclusion, the presence of only one flat angle setting on your treadmill does not necessarily mean you cannot get a good workout. It may limit the variation and intensity of your exercise to some extent, but there are still ways to optimize your workout, such as interval training, increasing speed, and incorporating complementary exercises to target different muscle groups. Each individual's fitness level, preferences, and goals play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of their treadmill workouts, whether on a flat treadmill or one with an incline setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The harrowing experience of the girl and her siblings has sent shockwaves throughout not only Austria but the world. As news of their captivity and the horrifying events that took place behind the walls of the Fritzl family home spread, communities everywhere were left reeling, questioning how such a monstrous act could go unnoticed for so long. The case of Josef Fritzl and his imprisoned daughter highlights the distorted reality of an individual who was able to maintain a double life for 24 years, deceiving friends, family, and neighbors. The situation also raises concerns about the effectiveness of social services in detecting and addressing instances of abuse, especially in cases as extreme as the Fritzl family's. As the story of the Fritzl family came to light, various organizations and agencies worked together to try to provide the appropriate assistance, therapy, and legal help for the abused children and their mother. The process of healing and adapting to a life of freedom is undoubtedly a tremendously difficult one, yet it is a necessary journey for these once-captive family members. The Fritzl case demonstrates the importance of increased vigilance within communities, reinforcing the need for open communication and timely reporting of suspicious behaviors. It is also a stark reminder that, even in seemingly quiet and peaceful towns, unimaginable horrors may be lurking behind closed doors. As society grapples with the ramifications of this deeply unsettling case, the focus must be on supporting and assisting the survivors in their transition to a better, safer life.

However, despite utilizing the best science and cutting-edge technology, the deep-sea search has been terminated without any trace of the missing plane, as reported by Reuters. The last vessel has departed the search area, and the families of the passengers and crew have been notified of the decision. The statement issued by the authorities mentioned, \\"The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.\\" After thoroughly scanning a 46,300-square mile search area in the Indian Ocean, the three countries had decided last year that the search would be suspended. Loss of Confidence in Data Australian experts had recently suggested that the search should be extended to the north by an additional 10,000-square mile area. However, it seems that the authorities have lost confidence in the data, as reported by the Guardian. Relentless Fight for the Search to Continue The families of the missing passengers and crew refuse to give up and will keep fighting for the search to continue. Danica Weeks, whose husband, Paul, was on the plane, says, \\"It just can't end like this. The Malaysian government promised to bring them home. If they think this will go away, it definitely won't.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald also confirms that families will not back down in their fight to find their missing loved ones. Conclusion The heartbreaking disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the 239 passengers and crew will likely go down in history as a significant unsolved mystery. As the search comes to a halt, friends and family members of the missing continue to hold on to hope, vowing to keep fighting for the search to resume."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Questions: People using a machine gun are a part of what? Options: - quake 2 - arsenal - in a - armory - military service A:","output":"The option that is in line with common sense to answer the question is \\"military service.\\"  People using a machine gun are typically associated with military service or, in some cases, law enforcement agencies. In both cases, they serve to ensure security and defense for their respective countries. It is important to note that machine guns are heavy, fully automatic firearms designed to shoot multiple bullets quickly and are primarily used in combat situations or for suppressing enemy fire. This is why the association with military service is the most reasonable option among those provided. Let's briefly examine the other options to understand why they're not appropriate: 1. Quake 2: This is a first-person shooter video game released in 1997, developed by id Software and published by Activision. It features virtual characters using weapons such as machine guns, but it does not represent real people using machine guns as part of their job or duty. 2. Arsenal: An arsenal typically refers to a collection of weapons or the place where weapons are stored and maintained. While machine guns can be part of an arsenal, this term doesn't directly connect to the people using those machine guns. 3. In a: This option seems incomplete or out of context, and it does not offer any meaningful connection to people using machine guns. 4. Armory: An armory is similar to an arsenal, referring to a building or room where firearms and other munitions are stored and maintained. While machine guns can be stored in an armory, it doesn't directly relate to people using the machine guns as part of their duties. To sum up, the most sensible option among the provided choices to answer the question \\"People using a machine gun are a part of what?\\" is \\"military service,\\" as it represents the context in which real people might use machine guns for their job or duty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Both sentences highlight that the FBI did not monitor or keep track of al-Bayoumi despite having received information that identified him as a secret Saudi agent. The sentences use slightly different phrasing and word choices, but the overall meaning remains the same. Here's a breakdown of the differences: 1. In the first sentence, \\"But the FBI never kept tabs on al-Bayoumi\\" is used, whereas in the second sentence, \\"But the bureau never kept tabs on al-Bayoumi\\" is used. \\"The FBI\\" and \\"the bureau\\" are synonymous terms, both referring to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 2. In the first sentence, the phrase \\"even though it had received information\\" is used, while in the second sentence, the phrase \\"despite receiving prior information\\" is employed. Both phrases convey a similar meaning. However, the first sentence emphasizes that the information was already received, while the second sentence specifically highlights that the information was received before the described situation took place. 3. Lastly, both sentences end with the same information, stating that al-Bayoumi was a secret Saudi agent. The first sentence uses \\"the document says,\\" while the second sentence says, \\"the report says.\\" These two phrases are interchangeable, and both are used to attribute the source of the information.

Paragraph: After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

Article: The Kinsey scale has been praised for dismissing the dichotomous classification of sexual orientation and allowing for a new perspective on human sexuality. However, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants. Particularly, they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person's history when using the scale. They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences.

Given the below context:  Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released  the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation.

In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale.

Question: If cells are the basic units of the structure and function of tigers, then cells are the basic units of the structure and function of what?  Answer choices: - water  - mammals  - ice  - tigers  - animals  - humans  - plants  - the Sun Answer:","output":"Cells are the basic units of the structure and function of not only tigers, but also other living organisms, including mammals, animals, humans, and plants. Let's discuss each of these in detail to understand why cells are the basic units of their structure and function. 1. Mammals: Tigers are a part of the mammalian group, characterized by having fur or hair, giving birth to live young, and producing milk to nourish their offspring. Like tigers, other mammals such as humans, dogs, and whales are composed of cells, each of which work collectively to build tissues, organs, and organ systems, resulting in the complex body structures and functions that enable these creatures to survive and thrive in their respective environments. 2. Animals: The animal kingdom encompasses a diverse range of species, from mammals and birds to reptiles and amphibians. All these multicellular organisms share a common feature: their bodies are composed of cells - specialized units that perform various functions within the organism. From the tiniest microscopic protozoa to the largest whales, all animals rely on cells to build their body structures and carry out vital physiological processes such as digestion, respiration, and reproduction. 3. Humans: As a part of the mammal category, humans are also composed of cells, which make up tissues, organs, and organ systems. The human body contains trillions of cells, which vary in their structure and function, enabling the intricate processes of life to occur, such as the beating of the heart, the electrical signaling of the nervous system, and the ability to regenerate new skin when injured. 4. Plants: Although plants may seem drastically different from animals, they too rely on cells as their fundamental structural and functional units. Plant cells differ from animal cells in several ways, including the presence of a rigid cell wall, chloroplasts (the site of photosynthesis), and a large central vacuole. These unique cellular components enable plants to perform functions such as growing towards light, producing food through photosynthesis, and providing structural support to prevent collapsing. However, cells are not the basic units of structure and function for water, ice, or the Sun, as these entities are not living organisms: 1. Water: Water is a chemical compound composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). Water molecules do not contain cells, as they are not living organisms but rather an essential component of living organisms. 2. Ice: Ice is the solid form of water that occurs when water molecules bond together in a crystalline structure at freezing temperatures. Like water, ice does not have cells and is not a living organism. 3. The Sun: The Sun is a massive celestial body primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases undergoing nuclear fusion. As a non-living entity, the Sun does not contain cells, which are found exclusively in living organisms. In summary, cells are the basic units of the structure and function of mammals, animals, humans, and plants, but not for water, ice, or the Sun."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Electromagnetic fields obey what laws? Is \\"If the object is black, meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it, then its thermal light emission is maximized.\\" the correct answer?","output":"No, the statement provided, \\"If the object is black, meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it, then its thermal light emission is maximized.\\" relates to the concept of a blackbody in physics, which deals with thermal radiation and absorption of light. This does not directly answer the question about electromagnetic fields. To answer your question about the laws that electromagnetic fields obey, they are governed by a set of four fundamental laws called Maxwell's equations. These equations describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and how they interact with charges and currents. Named after James Clerk Maxwell, these equations are: 1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: This law states that the electric flux passing through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by the surface. Mathematically: ∮E・dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀ 2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: This law states that there are no isolated magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles). The total magnetic flux passing through a closed surface is zero. Mathematically: ∮B・dA = 0 3. Faraday's Law: This law explains the relationship between a changing magnetic field and the electric field it induces. It states that the electromotive force (EMF) induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit. Mathematically: ∮E・dl = -dΦ_B/dt 4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): This law relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop and the rate of change of the electric field. The law accounts for both stationary charges that produce a steady magnetic field (Ampère's Law) and the time-varying electric field that can also create a magnetic field (Maxwell's addition). Mathematically: ∮B・dl = μ₀(I_enclosed + ε₀ dΦ_E/dt) Maxwell's equations form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, and they play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Information:  - The Sword of Osman was an important sword of state used during the enthronement ceremony of the sultans of the Ottoman Empire. The sword was named after Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Dynasty. The practice started when Osman I was girt with the sword of Islam by his mentor and father-in-law Sheikh Edebali. The girding of the sword of Osman was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks of a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at Eyüp, on the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. Even though the journey from Topkap Palace (where the sultan resided) to the Golden Horn was short, the sultan would board a boat amid much pomp to go there. The Eyüp tomb complex was built by Mehmed II in honour of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad who had died during the first Muslim siege of Constantinople in the 7th century. The sword girding thus occurred on what was regarded as sacred grounds, and linked the newly enthroned sultan both to his 13th-century ancestors and to Muhammad himself.  - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.  - Mehmed VI (\\"Memed-i sâdis\\", \\"Vahideddin\\", or ), who is also known as \\"ahbaba\\" (meaning \\"Emperor-father\\") among his relatives, (14 January 1861  16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of Mehmed V, he succeeded to the throne as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide of Abdülaziz's son Yusuf Izzettin Efendi, the heir to the throne. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth \\"padishah\\". His father was Sultan Abdülmecid I and mother was Gülüstü Hanm (1830  1865), an ethnic Abkhazian, daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afie Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba. Mehmed was removed from the throne when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished in 1922.  - Gülüstü Hanm; (1840  1865) was the Empress consort of Sultan Abdülmecid I. She was the mother of Mehmed VI, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.  - Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish:    \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him.  - The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\".   - The March of Abdülmecid (Turkish: \\"Mecidiye Mar\\") was the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan.  - Mehmed V Reshad ( Ottoman Turkish :   Memed - i âmis , Turkish : Mehmed V Read or Reat Mehmet ) ( 2 November 1844 -- 3 July 1918 ) was the 35th Ottoman Sultan . He was the son of Sultan Abdülmecid I. He was succeeded by his half - brother Mehmed VI .  - Padeshah, Padshah, Padishah or Badishah is a superlative royal title of Persian origin, composed of the Persian \\"pd\\" \\"master\\" and the widespread \\"shh\\" \\"king\\", which was adopted by several monarchs claiming the highest rank, roughly equivalent to the ancient Persian notion of \\"The Great\\" or \\"Great King\\", and later adopted by post-Achaemenid and Christian Emperors. Its Arabized pronunciation as Badshah was used by Mughal emperors.  - Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish:   \\"Mahmud-u sn\\",   \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785  1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I.  - Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike.  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

It is on the north-eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, the second deepest lake in the world after Lake Baikal.  - The dry season is a yearly period of low rainfall, especially in the tropics. The weather in the tropics is dominated by the tropical rain belt, which moves from the northern to the southern tropics and back over the course of the year. The tropical rain belt lies in the southern hemisphere roughly from October to March; during that time the northern tropics have a dry season with sparser precipitation, and days are typically sunny throughout. From April to September, the rain belt lies in the northern hemisphere, and the southern tropics have their dry season.

News article: Cholera outbreak threatens Haiti's capital PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- A cholera outbreak that already has left 250 people dead and more than 3,000 sickened is at the doorstep of an enormous potential breeding ground: the squalid camps in Port-au-Prince where 1.3 million earthquake survivors live. Health authorities and aid workers are scrambling to keep the tragedies from merging and the deaths from multiplying. Five cholera patients have been reported in Haiti's capital, heightening worries that the disease could reach the sprawling tent slums where abysmal hygiene, poor sanitation and widespread poverty could rapidly spread it. But government officials said Sunday that all five apparently got cholera outside Port-au-Prince, and they voiced hope that the deadly bacterial disease could be confined to the rural areas where the outbreak originated last week. \\"It's not difficult to prevent the spread to Port-au-Prince. We can prevent it,\\" said Health Ministry director Gabriel Timothee. He said tightly limiting movement of patients and careful disposal of bodies can stave off a major medical disaster. If efforts to keep cholera out of the camps fail, \\"the worst case would be that we have hundreds of thousands of people getting sick at the same time,\\" said Claude Surena, president of the Haiti Medical Association. Cholera can cause vomiting and diarrhea so severe that it can kill from dehydration in hours. Doctors Without Borders issued a statement saying that some Port-au-Prince residents were suffering from watery diarrhea and were being treated at facilities in the capital. Cholera infection among the patients had not been confirmed, however, and aid workers stressed that diarrhea has not been uncommon in Port-au-Prince since the earthquake. \\"Medical teams have treated many people with watery diarrhea over the last several months,\\" Doctors Without Borders said. Aid workers in the impoverished nation say the risk is magnified by the extreme poverty faced by people displaced by the Jan. 12 earthquake, which killed as many as 300,000 Haitians and destroyed much of the capital. Haitians living in the camps risk disease by failing to wash their hands, or scooping up standing water and then proceeding to wash fruits and vegetables. \\"There are limited ways you can wash your hands and keep your hands washed with water in slums like we have here,\\" said Michel Thieren, an official with the Pan-American Health Organization in Haiti. \\"The conditions for transmission are much higher.\\" Aid workers are coaching thousands of impoverished families how best to avoid cholera. Various aid groups are providing soap and water purification tablets and educating people in Port-au-Prince's camps about the importance of hand-washing. Aid groups also began training more staff about cholera and where to direct people with symptoms. The disease had not been seen in Haiti for decades, and many people don't know about it. Members of one grass-roots Haitian organization traveled around Port-au-Prince's camps booming warnings about cholera from speakers in the bed of a pickup. \\"In a way, it couldn't have happened at a better moment than now because everyone is on the field - lots of [nongovernmental organizations], lots of money. We haven't had any hurricanes so far this fall but people are here, and people are prepared,\\" said Marc Paquette, Haiti director for the Canadian branch of Medecins du Monde. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"There's a big sickness called cholera that has spread in Haiti. It has made 250 people die and more than 3,000 people sick already. What's worrying is that this sickness might spread into places where many people are living because their homes were destroyed in an earthquake. These places are not very clean and might make it easy for cholera to spread more. Cholera is a really bad sickness that can make people throw up and have diarrhea so much that they can die because their bodies run out of water. Five cases have been seen in the capital city, but everyone is hoping to keep it from spreading more. They're trying to do this by keeping sick people from moving around and making sure any people who die are dealt with carefully. There's a fear that if cholera gets into the big camps where the earthquake survivors live, many, many people could get sick all at once. Aid workers are educating people about how to not get cholera, like washing their hands well. They're also training more people about cholera and where to send people who have symptoms.  Lastly, despite the current situation, there is some relief as there has been a good response from support organizations and no hurricanes have occurred yet this fall."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Regular script has been attributed to Zhong Yao, of the Eastern Han to Cao Wei period (c. 151–230 AD), who has been called the \\"father of regular script\\". However, some scholars postulate that one person alone could not have developed a new script which was universally adopted, but could only have been a contributor to its gradual formation. The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao's works, including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi. This new script, which is the dominant modern Chinese script, developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with addition of the pause (頓/顿 dùn) technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal. Thus, early regular script emerged from a neat, formal form of semi-cursive, which had itself emerged from neo-clerical (a simplified, convenient form of clerical script). It then matured further in the Eastern Jin dynasty in the hands of the \\"Sage of Calligraphy\\", Wang Xizhi, and his son Wang Xianzhi. It was not, however, in widespread use at that time, and most writers continued using neo-clerical, or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it, for daily writing, while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae, alongside some semi-cursive, but primarily neo-clerical.

They reside with Hank's ailing father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a racist retired corrections officer whose wife committed suicide. Hank is a deputy warden. He oversees the execution of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs). As explained to Sonny by Hank, at the diner bar the night before, a \\"Monster's Ball\\" is what the execution team calls that night's get-together. The proceedings prove too intense for Sonny, who begins to vomit and then collapses as he is leading Lawrence to the electric chair. Hank confronts Sonny in the jail's bathroom afterwards and slaps him for being so \\"soft\\" and ruining a man's last walk. At home, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed and tells him to get out of the house. Sonny grabs a gun, and threatens his father, who backs off. The confrontation ends in their living room with Hank at gunpoint, lying on the carpet, and Sonny in Buck's customary chair. Sonny asks his father if he hates him. After his father calmly confirms that he does and always has, Sonny responds, \\"Well I always loved you,\\" and then shoots himself in the chest, dying instantly. Hank buries Sonny in the back garden with no real funeral because, as Buck observes, \\"He was weak.\\" Hank subsequently quits his job, burns his uniform in the backyard, and locks the door of Sonny's room.

Ulman asks to meet her but stands her up, later apologizing and offering to pay double the original salary. Samantha accepts and gets a ride to the remote mansion from her best friend, Megan (Greta Gerwig), who expresses her distrust. At the house, Mr. Ulman pulls her aside and reveals that he does not have any children to be monitored; the babysitting job is to attend to his wife's ailing mother. Samantha balks but finally agrees, if he will pay her 400, a significant increase in her pay. Megan immediately leaves, citing Ulman's lies and peculiar behavior, but she reluctantly promises to pick up Samantha later. Samantha stays, after accepting the money. On the way home, Megan stops in her car to smoke a cigarette. When her car lighter will not work, a stranger (A.J. Bowen) suddenly appears out of nowhere, startling her, and lights her cigarette for her.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Stenciling is a great way to add simple or complex designs to walls. You can even go back over the stencil with a second color to add shading. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time for this project, however, as stenciling can take a while. Here's a list of what you will need:  Wall stencils Painter's tape or repositionable spray adhesive Foam roller or good quality stencil brush Acrylic paint or wall paint Paint pan or paint palette Paper towels You can place it anywhere you want. If you want to cover your entire wall with the design, you can start off  by placing it in the top left corner of your wall or right in the middle of your wall. Once you know where you want your stencil, trace the corners lightly with a pencil. You can also outline the corners with some painter's tape. Consider using a level tool to ensure that your stencil is straight. It looks like a metal or plastic ruler, with a short, fluid-filled tube in the middle of it. The air bubble inside the tube moves around as you tilt the level about. Your project is leveled if the bubble is in the middle of the tube. You can do this by taping it to the wall along the edges with painter's tape. You can also spray the back with a repositionable spray adhesive, wait for the adhesive to get tacky, then press the stencil against the wall. Consider sealing the edges off with a few rows of painter's tape, especially if the design on your stencil is close to the edge. The painter's tape will prevent you from accidentally going over the edges of the stencil and painting the wall by mistake. Acrylic paint would be great for small areas, but if you are stenciling your entire wall, you might want to consider some wall paint instead. Choose a finish that matches the original finish of your wall: glossy, satin, eggshell, matte, etc. Do not pour too much paint out at once, or the paint will dry before you can use all of it. This way, you won't be wasting any paint.  If you are using a foam roller, pour the paint out onto a paint pan. Foam rollers are great for covering large stencils and large areas. If you are using a stencil brush, pour the paint out onto a paint palette. Stencil brushes are great for covering small stencils. They are also good for designs with multiple colors. You don't want to apply too much paint all at once, or you might get drips. The paint may also leak under the stencil and create blotches. Because of this, it is much better to apply many thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat. If you are working with a stencil brush, you can tape several folded paper towels onto the wall next to your work. This way, you can hold the palette in one hand and the brush in the other. Everything will be close by. Just make sure that your paper towels are folded thick enough so that the paint does not bleed through them and onto the wall. Apply the paint using light to medium pressure. You don't want to press down too hard with your brush or foam roller, or you will squish the paint out and create blob. Work with one color at a time, and use a fresh paint roller or brush when you do.  If you are using a foam roller, simply roll back and forth lightly across the pencil. If you are using a stencil brush, lightly tap the brush over the stencil. At some point, you will probably need to reload the roller or brush with more paint. Do this only when your roller or brush completely runs out of paint. Whenever you dip your roller or brush into paint, be sure to tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel.  If you accidentally painted outside the stencil, wipe the paint off using a damp paper towel or a baby wipe.  Consider adding some shading to your design using a stencil brush. Use a slightly darker color to do this, not straight black. This will look more realistic. A great places to use shading is around the edges or tips of your design. If some paint got under the stencil and onto the wall, use a damp Q-tip to clean the excess paint off. If there are any gaps along the edges of your design, use a thin paintbrush and some extra paint to fill in those gaps. If you painted a design, such as a branch with flowers and leaves, your stencil may have left some gaps between the different shapes. You can fill those gaps in using a thin paintbrush and extra paint for a more authentic, hand painted look. If you plan on reusing the stencil, double-check underneath it. If any paint got underneath the stencil, you might end up transferring that paint into your wall. If you see any leaked paint, wipe it off using a damp paper towel. If you attached your stencil using painter's tape, pull off the old pieces and use new ones. If you used repositionable spray adhesive, you may need to re-spray the back before you press the stencil down again. Refer to the label on your paint can or bottle. Just because something is dry to the touch does not necessarily mean it is fully dry. Most acrylic paints will be dry in 20 minutes, while some may require up to two hours. Latex wall paints will require a much longer drying and curing time. What is a summary?","output":"Stenciling is an effective way to add designs to walls with various patterns and shading. To stencil a wall, gather materials like wall stencils, painter's tape or repositionable spray adhesive, a foam roller or stencil brush, acrylic or wall paint, a paint pan or palette, and paper towels. Begin by positioning the stencil on the wall, using a level tool to ensure it's straight, and attach it with painter's tape or spray adhesive. When applying paint, use several thin coats to avoid drips and blotches. For intricate designs, use a stencil brush for shading and filling in any gaps. Allow the paint to dry according to the label instructions before reusing the stencil for other parts of the wall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Afraid for his life, he frequently tries to enlist in martial arts classes at a local dojo, only to have his applications mysteriously (read: deliberately) vanish. To further matters, the local minister turns the sermon at an Easter mass from the passion and resurrection of Christ to matters of Sodom and Gomorrah at the very sight of McClain and his mother entering the church to join in the ceremony. In the dojo's defense, they turn young McClain away not directly because of his sexual orientation, but because they fear losing their students over the matter. In fact, the family that runs the dojo has had some acceptance issues of their own to deal with, not just because of being Asian, but actually because of being multi-ethnic, with Irish, Asian, and even Filipino members and relatives. They're also of mixed faiths, with the grandparents devout Buddhists and one of their sons a Christian actively involved with the local church. The family has a very proud tradition of teaching the martial arts throughout the generations, a tradition that sadly is not open to the women of the family, as we learn when we are introduced to Karen O'Neil (played by the film's director D.

Sisters Fiona, Evelyn, and Susie Gaylord, are orphaned when first their mother goes down with the Lusitania and then their wealthy father, Major Penn Gaylord, is killed in France in World War I. Before Penn left for France, he told Fiona, the eldest, that the Gaylords have never sold the land they have acquired. However, their half billion dollar inheritance is held up in probate for decades; Fiona complains that they have practically grown up in court. Though they have a New York City Fifth Avenue mansion, the sisters have had to borrow money to live. A French charity claims that Penn made a later will before he died, leaving 10% of the Gaylord estate to it. Though the Gaylords are now willing to give up the 10%, their real antagonist, Charles Barclay, who wants their mansion, and the choice land on which it sits too, so he can tear it down as part of his real estate development, Barclay Square.

Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.  Now, I have a new situation: A team of geologists studied two islands. Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity.  Answer this question please: Which island displayed more seismic waves? Answer:","output":"The island that displayed more seismic waves was the Large Island. It's mentioned in the situation that the Large Island had a lot of seismic activity.  Seismic activity refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The term 'a lot of seismic activity' refers to frequent occurrences of earthquakes in that particular region, in this case, the Large Island.  These earthquakes produce seismic waves, which became an area of study for the team of geologists described in the situation. When an earthquake happens, it radiates waves of energy from its focus. This energy, traveling in the form of waves, are referred to as seismic waves. Thus, the more the seismic activity (or earthquakes), the greater the seismic waves that can be noted and studied. Conversely, the Small Island presented almost no seismic activity, indicating that it had very few or almost no earthquakes happening. Therefore, it can be deduced that due to the lack of earthquakes, there were fewer seismic waves produced in the Small Island. From the background given, we know that the absence of seismic waves can't help geologists understand the composition of the Earth's interior of that specific location. In this situation, the geological team might have an insufficient understanding of the Small Island's internal constitution as compared to the Large Island. It's also important to note that the number of seismic waves doesn't necessarily denote danger or safety. High seismic activity can indicate a tectonically active area, which might be more prone to earthquakes, but the severity of these earthquakes depends upon a multitude of factors like depth of the seismic focus, proximity to populated areas, building structures, etc. So to summarize, the Large Island displayed more seismic waves because it had more seismic activity or more earthquakes happening there. This produced more seismic waves, allowing geologists to have a better understanding of the Earth's interior in this location."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Answer the following question: This article: The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"Based on a thorough analysis of the product review given, it is apparent that this review depicts the product in a primarily flattering light, with a few minor concerns raised by the reviewer. The following points illustrate the reasoning behind this conclusion: 1. Positive remarks about the content: The reviewer has complimented the product, an audio CD, by mentioning the \\"distinct dreamy guitars and descriptive prose\\" present in the music. This positive appraisal suggests that the overall quality of the musical content is admirable and enjoyable, reflecting a flattering image of the product. 2. Comparisons to another band: The reviewer has mentioned, \\"Not to diminish the quality of this release, but I smell some late Superchunk in a couple of tracks.\\" While it is a comparison to another band, the statement starts with a disclaimer that the intention is not to diminish the quality of the product, which implies that the reviewer acknowledges the album's uniqueness and quality despite drawing similarities to another band. This comparison can still be considered as a part of a generally flattering depiction of the product. 3. Appreciation of the SACD capability: The reviewer points out the product's Super Audio CD (SACD) ability as a positive feature, which is seen as a bonus for the listeners who can experience high-quality audio and enjoy the album to its fullest potential. This notation further reinforces the flattering depiction of the product. 4. Concern over potential obsolescence: The only explicit concern raised by the reviewer is about the SACD capability, mentioning the hope that it \\"doesn't go the way of Betamax,\\" referring to the outdated video cassette format which was eventually replaced by VHS. This concern, however, does not directly reflect upon the quality or the content of the CD itself and is a relatively minor issue compared to the other positive points mentioned. In conclusion, the review presents the audio CD in a largely flattering light, praising its content, unique sound, and SACD capability. While there is a concern about the future relevance of the SACD format, it does not take away from the positive aspects of the product. As such, this review can be considered as one that depicts the product in a predominantly flattering manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - St. Gallen or traditionally St Gall, in German sometimes Sankt Gallen (; ) is the capital of the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland. It evolved from the hermitage of Saint Gall, founded in the 7th century. Today, it is a large urban agglomeration (with around 160,000 inhabitants) and represents the center of eastern Switzerland. Its economy consists mainly of the service sector.  - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\".  - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second most populous of Switzerland's cantons.  - The canton of St. Gallen (; dialectally , , ) is a canton of Switzerland. The capital is St. Gallen.   - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.  - Rapperswil-Jona is a municipality in the \\"Wahlkreis\\" (constituency) of See-Gaster in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland. Besides Rapperswil and Jona, which were separate municipalities until 2006, the municipality includes Bollingen, Busskirch, Curtiberg, Kempraten-Lenggis, Wagen, and Wurmsbach.  - Stäfa is a municipality in the district of Meilen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.  - Jona is a former municipality in the \\"Wahlkreis\\" (constituency) of See-Gaster in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland.  - Swiss German (Standard German: \\"Schweizerdeutsch\\", , and others) refers to any of the Alemannic dialects spoken in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in some Alpine communities in Northern Italy bordering Switzerland. Occasionally, the Alemannic dialects spoken in other countries are grouped together with Swiss German, as well, especially the dialects of Liechtenstein and Austrian Vorarlberg, which are closely associated to Switzerland's.  - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein.  - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World).  - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau  constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Rapperswil (Swiss German: or ; short: \\"Rappi\\") is a former municipality and since January 2007 part of the municipality of Rapperswil-Jona in the \\"Wahlkreis\\" (constituency) of See-Gaster in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland, located at the east side of the Lake Zurich.  - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

It was named 'Bridewell' after the Bridewell Palace, which during the 16th century had become one of the City of London's most important prisons. Tothill Fields later became the Westminster House of Correction. Sentence: Tothill Fields Bridewell is a prison with many names.","output":"The sentence \\"Tothill Fields Bridewell is a prison with many names\\" is true. Throughout its history, Tothill Fields Bridewell was known by multiple names reflecting its location, purpose, and connections to other institutions in London. Firstly, it was referred to as Tothill Fields Prison, which indicates its primary function as a prison and its location within the Tothill Fields area. The name Tothill Fields Bridewell also connects this prison to the historical Bridewell Palace, which was originally a royal residence and, in the 16th century, was repurposed as a prison, eventually lending the term 'Bridewell' to other similar institutions. Thus, naming the prison Tothill Fields Bridewell provided a wider context for its use and operation in London's early modern incarceration system. Additionally, the prison went by the name of Westminster Bridewell due to its location within the borough of Westminster, which was and still is an important area in central London. Utilizing this name highlights the geographical component of the prison's identity and association with the region served by the institution. Finally, the prison was referred to as the Westminster House of Correction, particularly when it underwent administrative and functional changes. The term 'House of Correction' was commonly used throughout England to designate institutions responsible for the punishment, reform, and rehabilitation of minor offenders. This name emphasizes the prison's role in reforming its inmates through labor and other means, thus capturing the broader scope of its mandate and objectives. In conclusion, Tothill Fields Bridewell, which operated under several names, sheds light on the evolution of early modern prisons in London.

Options: - refrigerator - supermarket - pantry - shelf - trunk  The answer is \\"shelf\\" because","output":"there are several factors to consider when deciding where to put groceries after buying them and reaching your home. Each option can cater to different types of groceries. As you have selected \\"shelf\\" as the answer, I will provide you with a detailed explanation of why this might be the best choice for certain items and also touch upon the other options. A shelf is an appropriate storage space for a variety of groceries, particularly non-perishable items. Here is a more detailed breakdown of what type of groceries can be stored on a shelf and why: 1. Non-perishable goods: Shelves work well for dry, non-perishable foods like canned goods, pasta, rice, cereals, and baking ingredients. These items have a long shelf-life and do not require refrigeration to preserve their quality. 2. Snacks and treats: Shelves can also be used to store snack foods such as chips, cookies, and candies. These items typically come in sealed packaging that doesn't require refrigeration, so they can be easily displayed and accessed on a shelf. 3. Household and cleaning supplies: While not technically groceries, household items like cleaning supplies, laundry detergents, and paper products can also be stored on shelves. Placing them on a shelf can help keep them organized and within easy reach when needed. However, it's important to note that not all groceries are suitable for storage on a shelf. Some items require more specific storage conditions, which brings us to the other options mentioned: - Refrigerator: Perishable goods like meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, and some condiments are best stored in a refrigerator. This helps preserve their freshness and prevent spoilage, ensuring the food remains safe to consume. - Pantry: A pantry is a cool, dark, and dry storage space that can be used to store similar non-perishable goods as shelves, such as canned goods, pasta, and rice. It can also be a suitable storage space for items like potatoes and onions, which require a cool and dark environment but not refrigeration. - Supermarket: This option is not applicable after bringing groceries home and is where groceries are originally purchased. - Trunk: A trunk is useful for transporting groceries from the supermarket to your home but is not ideal for long-term storage. In conclusion, a shelf is a practical choice for storing a wide range of dry and non-perishable groceries at home. It keeps items organized, easily accessible, and within view. Other storage options, such as the refrigerator, are necessary for perishable goods that require specific temperature conditions to maintain their freshness. A combination of shelves, refrigerator, and pantry will likely be required to effectively store groceries at home, depending on the specific items purchased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...","output":"The name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged is Saint-Saëns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"D.F.\\" derives from the Spanish language, indicating an aspect of Spanish influence. However, to provide a more comprehensive answer to the question, it's important to understand that \\"defeños\\" might not be the only nickname that reflects the Spanish influence of the city. The term \\"chilangos\\" is another common nickname for Mexico City residents. The nickname is believed to have originated from the Nahuatl word \\"chil\\" (chilli) and the Spanish \\"sancochar\\" (to cook), perhaps reflecting a mixture of indigenous and Spanish culinary traditions in the city. Additionally, other regional nicknames in Mexico also draw from the Spanish language or historical Spanish influence. For instance, people from the northern states of Mexico are sometimes called \\"norteños\\" while those from the southern states may be called \\"sureños,\\" both nicknames derived from the Spanish words for \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" respectively. These terms might not reflect the Spanish influence on the city of Mexico City directly but do exhibit the overall Spanish impact on regional identities within the country.

Which group would be able to hear higher frequency, group A or group B?  David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C.  Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. Answer:","output":"Group C would be able to hear higher frequency sounds. According to the information provided, David categorized animals into three different groups based on the sound waves they can hear: Group A with animals that can only hear infrasound, Group B with animals that can only hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do, and Group C with animals that can only hear ultrasound. The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz). Humans can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Infrasound refers to sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz, which is the range Group A can hear. Ultrasound refers to sounds with frequencies above 20,000 Hz, which is the range Group C can hear. Group B, on the other hand, can hear sounds in the same frequency range as humans (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz). Since Group C animals can hear only ultrasound, which is defined as having frequencies above 20,000 Hz, they would be able to hear higher frequency sounds compared to Group A (infrasound, less than 20 Hz) and Group B (same as humans, 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz). Examples of animals that can hear sounds in the ultrasound range include dogs (up to 50,000 Hz) and bats (higher than 100,000 Hz)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is an interrogative sentence and adheres to the proper grammar rules of the English language. Let's break it down into individual elements to further analyze the correctness of this sentence. 1. Interrogative Sentences: In English, there are four types of sentences, which include declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory sentences. The test sentence in question is an interrogative sentence, as it is a question that seeks information or a response. It is indicated by the question mark (?) at the end of the sentence. 2. Contraction: \\"Who's\\" is a contraction of \\"who is\\" or \\"who has.\\" In this case, it means \\"who is.\\" Contractions are commonly used in English, and they are formed by combining two words with an apostrophe (') to indicate the omission of one or more letters. Using contractions, like the one in the sentence, is perfectly grammatical and acceptable in informal speech and writing. Moreover, \\"Who's\\" starts with a capital letter \\"W,\\" which is the correct way to start a sentence in English. The sentence has a subject (\\"Who\\") and a verb (\\"is\\"), making it a complete and grammatically correct sentence. 3. Word Order: The word order in any standard English sentence usually follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. However, when forming questions with interrogative pronouns, such as \\"who,\\" \\"what,\\" or \\"where,\\" the subject and verb may switch places, followed by the rest of the sentence. In this test sentence, we have the interrogative pronoun \\"who\\" followed by the verb \\"is.\\" 4. Punctuation: The test sentence ends with a question mark, which is the proper punctuation for interrogative sentences in English. In addition, the sentence starts with a capital letter, conforming to the standard capitalization rules. In conclusion, \\"Who's there?\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence that follows the rules of creating interrogative sentences, employs a valid contraction, and uses proper punctuation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Meek’s Cutoff, review\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"Meek's Cutoff: A Journey Through the Perils of the Oregon Trail\\" Introduction Meek's Cutoff, directed by Kelly Reichardt, is a captivating indie film that transports its audience on an epic journey of survival, determination, and the complexities of the human spirit. Released in 2010, Meek's Cutoff places its focus on a small group of settlers on the Oregon Trail in the early 19th century, grappling with the harsh realities of the trail and the consequences of their decisions. This review aims to analyze the film's themes, setting, characterization, and the director's technique, shining a light on the brilliance of this arresting piece of cinema. Plot and Setting Set in the dry, arid plains of Oregon, the film follows a small group of settlers, led by Stephen Meek, a self-proclaimed expert guide boasting a wealth of knowledge in traversing the Oregon Trail. As the travelers soon realize, Meek's claims are full of embellishments and deceptions, resulting in a treacherous journey that tests their physical and emotional endurance. Meek's Cutoff presents a fresh perspective on the western genre, which often romanticizes the experience of those who sought new lives in the American West. Instead of finding easy riches and endless opportunities, the characters contend with thirst, hunger, exhaustion, and their faith in one another. Themes The primary themes explored in Meek's Cutoff center around trust, leadership, and group dynamics. At the foundation of the film's tension is whether the settlers can place their faith in the ill-natured Meek. With each day bringing new hardships, the group's trust in Meek deteriorates, resulting in a power struggle that exposes the fractures within the settlers' relationships. Reichardt delves deep into the psychology of leadership and decision-making. Meek's inability to guide the group to safety exposes the consequences of blind faith in those who make grand promises but cannot deliver. The settlers' plight also serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of humility, adaptability, and teamwork in the face of adversity. Characterization Meek's Cutoff boasts an ensemble cast of exceptional actors, including Michelle Williams, Bruce Greenwood, Paul Dano, and Zoe Kazan. Through their performances, the true essence of each character emerges, making it easy for the audience to immerse themselves in their stories. Michelle Williams delivers a mesmerizing portrayal of Emily Tetherow, the film's primary protagonist. Emily serves as the group's moral compass, challenging Meek's decisions and questioning the consequences of their actions. Her resilience and strength represent the backbone of the group, proving that collaboration and communal support are integral to their survival. As the eponymous character, Bruce Greenwood is superb in his portrayal of Stephen Meek. Equal parts charismatic and infuriating, Meek represents the quintessential flawed leader—his overconfidence and ego preventing him from admitting his errors and seeking the help of others. Directorial Technique Reichardt's approach to storytelling is subtle and slow-burning. She allows the film to breathe, allowing the audience to soak in the stunning landscape while contemplating the complexities of humanity. The film maintains a sense of authenticity by showcasing the grit and toil of life on the trail, an effective counterpoint to the often-glamorized western genre. Meek's Cutoff is rich in symbolism, and Reichardt's keen eye for detail is ubiquitous throughout the film. The juxtaposition of Pioneer-era gender roles with Emily's defiance disrupts the stereotypical western narrative, offering a refreshing and nuanced portrayal of women in the American frontier. Additionally, the film's denouement hints at the dire stakes and potential consequences of the settlers' journey. Conclusion Meek's Cutoff is a visceral and thought-provoking experience that leaves the audience pondering the complexities of survival and the human spirit. With stunning performances and masterful storytelling, this film invites viewers to delve deep into the thematic core of trust, leadership, and our collective search for a better life. Meek's Cutoff is a hidden gem of the indie film scene and a haunting reminder of the American West's harsh reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Question: what do mucous membranes secrete? Would \\"The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is termed mucus .\\" be a reasonable answer? Possible answers: (A). No. (B). Yes. A:","output":"B). Yes. The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is indeed termed mucus. Mucous membranes are specialized tissues that line the inner surfaces of many body cavities and organs, such as the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and reproductive systems. These protective tissues serve as the body's first line of defense against pathogens and foreign particles. Mucus is a complex, viscous liquid secreted by specialized cells called goblet cells or mucous-secreting glands, such as submucosal glands or the exocrine glands in some cases. The principal components of mucus are water, glycoproteins called mucins, various electrolytes, lipids, and a variety of immune cells and proteins that help defend the body from infection and maintain tissue homeostasis. The primary functions of mucus are numerous and vital to the body's health and well-being. Here are some of the essential functions of mucus: 1. Protection: Mucous membranes and their secreted mucus serve as a physical barrier between the body's internal environment and the external world, preventing the entry of harmful substances and microbes. 2. Lubrication: Mucus reduces friction between mucous membranes and other tissues, easing and facilitating movement in the body, such as swallowing, digestion, and respiration. 3. Hydration: The water content of mucus helps to keep mucous membranes moist, preventing them from drying out and maintaining their durability and flexibility. 4. Immune defense: Mucus contains numerous components of the immune system, such as immunoglobulins, lysozyme, and lactoferrin, that help neutralize and capture pathogens to protect the body from infection. 5. Ciliary movement: In the respiratory system, the presence of mucus and the coordinated movement of cilia on the surface of specialized epithelial cells create a \\"mucociliary escalator,\\" which helps to trap and expel foreign particles, microbes, and other debris from the lungs and airways. 6. Digestion: Mucus plays a significant role in gastrointestinal function, as it provides lubrication to facilitate the passage of food through the digestive tract and plays a role in protecting stomach lining from acidic digestive juices. Hence, the answer is B). Yes. \\"The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is termed mucus\\" is a reasonable answer, as it accurately describes the nature and origin of mucus in the context of mucous membranes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, and remains in operation. Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.  - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy  a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.  - The Galactic Center is the rotational center of the Milky Way. The estimates for its location range from 7.6 to 8.7 kiloparsecs (about 25,000 to 28,000 lightyears) from Earth in the direction of the constellations Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, and Scorpius where the Milky Way appears brightest. There is strong evidence consistent with the existence of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way.  - WR 102ka , also known as the Peony star , is a Wolf - Rayet star that is one of several candidates for the most luminous known star in the Milky Way . An even more luminous yet closer star , WR 25 , appears to be most likely to the title . Another nearer star Eta Carinae , which was the second brightest star in the sky for a few years in the 19th century , appears to be slightly more luminous than WR 102ka , but is known to be a binary star system . There is also the more recently discovered Pistol star that , like the Peony star , derives its name from the shape of the nebula in which it is embedded , and which it has probably created through heavy mass loss via fierce stellar winds and perhaps also major \`\` mini-supernova - like '' eruptions as happened to Eta Carinae around the 1830s - 1840s creating the lobes observed by the Hubble Space Telescope . The luminosities of the Pistol Star , Eta Carinae , and WR 102ka are all rendered somewhat uncertain due to heavy obscuration by galactic dust in the foreground , the effects of which must be corrected for before their apparent brightness can be reduced to estimate their total radiated power or bolometric luminosity . Both Eta Carinae and WR 102ka are believed likely to explode as supernovas or hypernovas within the next few million years . As is typical of such extremely massive and luminous stars , both have expelled a considerable portion of their initial mass , when originally formed , in dense , massive stellar winds . As WR 102ka lies near the Galactic Center , it is the more distant and heavily obscured of the two , and is essentially totally obscured in visible wavelengths . Thus it must be observed in longer wavelength infrared light , which is able to penetrate the dust . The Spitzer Space Telescope observed WR 102ka at wavelengths of 3.6 µm , 8 µm , and 24 µm on April 20 , 2005 . The observations were carried out by L. Oskinova , W. - R. Hamann , and A. Barniske of Potsdam University , Germany . WR 102ka was previously observed by the Two Micron All...  - Eta Carinae (abbreviated to  Carinae or  Car), formerly known as Eta Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity over five million times that of the Sun, located around 7500 light-years (2300 parsecs) distant in the constellation Carina. First recorded as a 4th-magnitude star, it brightened considerably over the period 1837 to 1856 in an event known as the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae became the second-brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, peaking above magnitude 4.5 in 2014. Eta Carinae is circumpolar south of latitude 30°S, so it is never visible north of latitude 30°N.  - The Pistol Star is a blue hypergiant star, one of the most luminous known in the Milky Way. It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates. It is located approximately 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light.  - The Pistol Nebula is located in the constellation Sagittarius. It surrounds one of the most luminous stars known, the Pistol Star. Both are located 25,000 light years away from Earth in the Quintuplet cluster, near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula contains approximately 9.3 solar masses worth of ionized gas that was ejected by the star several thousand years ago. The nebula was named in the 1980s for its shape as seen in low resolution images that were available at the time. The Pistol Star, a luminous blue variable is 1.6 million times brighter than the Sun making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way.  - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.  - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Watch the masters. . Distort the mic. Move around. Get down into the crowd. Look like your audience\\"","output":"Title: The Art of Stage Mastery: Embracing the Mantras of Performance Music may be the heart and soul of a live performance, but the magic ensues from how it is handled and delivered. Based on this mantra, \\"Watch the masters... Distort the mic...Move around... Get down into the crowd...Look like your audience\\", the essence of a captivating performance transcends beyond just talent. It merges principles such as learning from the greats, manipulating the tools of your trade, engaging the crowd physically and emotionally, and connecting with them on a human level. To begin, the starting point for any aspiring performer should be to \\"watch the masters\\". Understanding great performers and their techniques hold incredible value. It offers first-hand inspiration that can fuel artistic growth and polishes the natural talent one may possess. The masters - the likes of Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Mick Jagger, or Beyonce - are regarded as such not just because of their vocal prowess or instrumental genius, but for their abilities to encapsulate an audience, their towering stage presence, and their unique delivery styles. Break down their performances, decipher their techniques, learn their art, and apply these lessons to your performances. The next mantra \\"distort the mic\\" refers to manipulating the tools of your trade, in this case, the microphone. The microphone is a performer's best friend. Learn its tricks, understand its nuances, and make it an extension of yourself. The power of microphone control can amplify emotion, focus attention and can transform a simple phrase into an unforgettable performance. How you hold it, how you move it around, and how you maintain your distance from it - all equates to how clearly, loudly or softly the audience hears your music. Ultimately, distortion of the sound can create a sense of closeness, a feeling of rawness, and an intense emotive connection to the audience. \\"Move around\\" and \\"get down into the crowd\\" embody yet another vital aspect of stage performance - crowd engagement. Static performances may feed the ears, but they certainly don't feast the eyes. Moving across the stage, exploring the space, and using your body language to narrate your music makes a significant difference in the overall performance. Moreover, coming down into the crowd has a literal and psychological implication. Literally, it means get close, be part of them, engage them in your performance, make it an experience they will never forget. Psychologically, it signifies humility, a shared experience and a deep connection which makes the audience feel as though they are part of the show. Finally, \\"look like your audience\\" is a mantra that transcends the mere physical, delving into deeper realms of emotional affinity and authenticity. It is about rendering yourself relatable to your audience, finding common ground, and using that to form a profound connection. This can be achieved through your outfit, your language, your interests or the themes of your songs. Authenticity here is key. It is not about pretending to be like your audience; it is about finding and emphasizing the similarities that exist. In conclusion, the secrets to delivering a captivating live performance float beyond talent alone. Embracing techniques and principles such as watching and learning from the masters, mastering your tools, actively engaging and connecting with your audience, and bringing authenticity to your stage persona are indispensable. Such a performer does not only entertain the audience but also creates an unforgettable experience, a bond between the performer and the listener that lasts long after the curtain falls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Continue the story by detailing Jennifer's experience with ironing. Jennifer found ironing to be a rather relaxing and meditative activity. She enjoyed the feeling of transforming wrinkled garments into neat, orderly clothes ready to wear. Because of this, she rarely took her clothing to the dry cleaners, saving both money and time. Step 2: Introduce a conflict or situation that distinguishes the difference between Jennifer and Tanya's approach. One day, Tanya reluctantly invited Jennifer over to help her with a special project. Tanya was going to an important event in a few days and needed an elegant dress ironed to perfection. She was too afraid that if she went to the dry cleaners in such short notice, they wouldn't do a good enough job. Step 3: Show Jennifer's willingness to help Tanya despite their differences. Although Jennifer was initially surprised by Tanya's request, she agreed to help her friend with the task. Upon entering Tanya's home, she found an impressive pile of clothing waiting to be ironed. Step 4: As Jennifer helps Tanya, they bond over the experience and learn from each other's perspectives. As Jennifer expertly handled the garments, Tanya marveled at her ability to turn the chore into an art form. The two friends chatted about other aspects of their lives, finding common ground in their love of fashion and personal style, despite their differing opinions on ironing. Step 5: As a result of their bonding, Tanya starts to change her views on ironing and its role in her life. By the time the last garment was pressed and hung, Tanya found that she had not only gained a deeper appreciation for Jennifer's skills but also a new perspective on ironing itself. While she still didn't particularly enjoy the task, she could now see the value in mastering the technique. Jennifer offered to help Tanya learn the basics, starting with her newly ironed dress. Step 6: Show how their relationship grows from the experience, with each person learning and growing as a result. Tanya gratefully accepted Jennifer's offer, and the two friends spent the next day learning and practicing the art of ironing. This shared experience helped to strengthen their bond and further enrich their friendship while also allowing them to develop newfound skills and understanding. Jennifer then started to understand why some people just couldn't stand ironing and Tanya learned ways to make it a more enjoyable task."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Francis George Steiner, FBA (born April 23, 1929) is a French-born American literary critic, essayist, philosopher, novelist, and educator. He has written extensively about the relationship between language, literature and society, and the impact of the Holocaust. An article in The Guardian described Steiner as a \\"polyglot and polymath\\", saying that he is either \\"often credited with recasting the role of the critic\\", or a \\"pretentious namedropper\\" whose \\"range comes at the price of inaccuracy\\" and \\"complacency\\". Among his admirers, Steiner is ranked \\"among the great minds in today's literary world.\\" In 1956 Steiner returned to the United States, where for two years he was a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He also held a Fulbright professorship in Innsbruck, Austria from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, he was appointed Gauss Lecturer at Princeton, where he lectured for another two years. He then became a founding fellow of Churchill College at the University of Cambridge in 1961. Steiner was initially not well received at Cambridge by the English faculty. Many disapproved of this charismatic \\"firebrand with a foreign accent\\" and questioned the relevance of the Holocaust he constantly referred to in his lectures. Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at the University of Southampton said that at the time, \\"Britain [...] didn't think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain.\\" While Steiner received a professorial salary, he was never made a full professor at Cambridge with the right to examine. He had the option of leaving for professorships in the United States, but Steiner's father objected, saying that Hitler, who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. Steiner remained in England because \\"I'd do anything rather than face such contempt from my father.\\" He was elected an Extraordinary Fellow at Cambridge in 1969.  After several years as a freelance writer and occasional lecturer, Steiner accepted the post of Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva in 1974; he held this post for 20 years, teaching in four languages. He lived by Goethe's maxim that \\"no monoglot truly knows his own language.\\" He became Professor Emeritus at Geneva University on his retirement in 1994, and an Honorary Fellow at Balliol College at Oxford University in 1995. He has since held the positions of the first Lord Weidenfeld Professor of Comparative European Literature and Fellow of St Anne's College at Oxford University from 1994 to 1995, and Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University from 2001 to 2002.  Steiner has been called \\"an intelligent and intellectual critic and essayist.\\" He was active on undergraduate publications while at the University of Chicago and later become a regular contributor of reviews and articles to many journals and newspapers including the Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian. He has written for The New Yorker for over thirty years, contributing over two hundred reviews.  While Steiner generally takes things very seriously, he also reveals an unexpected deadpan humor: when he was once asked if he had ever read anything trivial as a child, he replied, Moby-Dick.

Ono (@PrezOno) June 22, 2015      The average cost for a four-year degree at UC is about 50,000, Ono said.      Ono said UC's offer goes beyond what is covered by an Ohio law that states \\"the child of a public service officer killed in the line of duty\\" and \\"who is admitted to any state university or college\\" \\"shall not be required to pay any tuition or any student fee for up to four academic years of education, which shall be at the undergraduate level.\\"      \\"Our scholarship to the Kim children we will be on top of any support from the Ohio Safety Officers fund,\\" he said. \\"They can use it for room and board, books and study abroad.\\"      Kim, 48, a husband and father of three boys, died after being shot while responding to a call of a gunman acting erratically Friday morning.      Police said Kim's shooter, 21-year-old Trepierre Hummons, called 911 at 9:03 a.m. to report a black man in his early 20s \\"walking around, getting belligerent with a gun\\" at the corner of Whetsel Avenue and Roe Street in Madisonville. They said he called again a few minutes later.      Kim was the first officer on the scene at 9:19 a.m. Hummons started a fire fight with Kim, Cincinnati Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell said. Both men died in the encounter.      Kim, a 27-year veteran of the Cincinnati Police Department, also worked as the owner and main karate instructor at the Japanese Karate-Do dojo in Symmes Township.      One of Kim’s sons left a powerful message left on Instagram Saturday telling his father goodbye.      In it, Kim's son remembers riding bikes, running 5Ks and laughing at his dad's \\"stupid jokes that (he) would purposefully make a straight face at even though they were actually funny.\\"      UC's offer of free college educations isn't the only thing being offered to the Kim family. Mason Police Association President Derek Bauman started a GoFundMe page that topped 100,000 in donations for the family Monday morning.      A public viewing and visitation for Kim will be held from 2 to 8 p.m. Thursday at the Cintas Center at Xavier University for Officer Kim. The Queen City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 69 will hold services at 7 p.m.      The funeral service will be held at the Cintas Center at 11 a.m. Friday, followed by a procession to the Gate of Heaven Cemetery for burial.      UC Public Safety tweeted on Wednesday that they will coordinate shuttle rides to Kim's funeral services in conjunction with Cincinnati Police. They said that campus late night shuttles may be delayed due to this effort. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article is about a fund set up by the Mason Police Association for the family of slain Cincinnati Police Department Officer Sonny Kim, who was shot and killed on June 19, 2015, while responding to a call about an armed individual.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress.

Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which genus includes more plants that produces flowers, Zanthoxylum or Legousia? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the question Before I begin researching to answer the question, I must make sure I understand it completely. The question is asking which genus, Zanthoxylum or Legousia, has more plants that produce flowers. Step 2: Research the genera Zanthoxylum and Legousia In order to provide an accurate answer, I will need to gather information on both genera. I will investigate each genus separately to understand their characteristics and number of plants that produce flowers. -Zanthoxylum: This genus belongs to the family Rutaceae and contains about 250 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. The plants in this genus have pinnately compound leaves, and they are known for their flowers and fruit. -Legousia: This genus belongs to the family Campanulaceae and consists of herbaceous plants. There are approximately 6-9 species in this genus, and they are known for their bell-shaped flowers. Step 3: Compare the number of plants producing flowers in each genus Now that I have gathered information about both genera, it's time to compare them. Zanthoxylum has around 250 species, while Legousia has approximately 6-9 species. Step 4: Draw a conclusion and answer the question Based on the research, the Zanthoxylum genus includes more plants that produce flowers compared to the Legousia genus. With around 250 species in Zanthoxylum and only 6-9 species in Legousia, it is evident that Zanthoxylum has a greater number of flowering plants. Answer: The genus Zanthoxylum includes more plants that produce flowers compared to the Legousia genus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare.   - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the southern German statesBaden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadtinto an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded.  - The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: \\"Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes\\"), or simply the Knight's Cross (\\"Ritterkreuz\\"), and its variants were the highest awards in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II.   - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The swastika (also known outside the Indian subcontinent as the Hakenkreuz, gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, croix gammée, fylfot, or tetraskelion) (as a character  or ) is an ancient religious symbol originating from the Indian subcontinent, that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross with four legs each bent at 90 degrees. It is considered to be a sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and dates back at least 11,000 years. It continues to be commonly used as a religious symbol in religions native to the Indian subcontinent, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.  - Kurt Kuhlmey ( 19 November 1913 -- 30 April 1993 ) was a Stuka pilot of the Second World War . He flew over 500 combat missions , and in July 1942 was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( German : Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) , which was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership .  - Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (9 January 1903  8 April 1945), was a German Aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II.  - Hanna Reitsch (29 March 1912  24 August 1979) was Germany's most famous female aviator and test pilot, starting in the early 1930s. During the Nazi era she served as an international representative for the regime. In the 1960s she was sponsored by the West German foreign office as a technical adviser in Ghana and elsewhere.  - German is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein; it is also an official, but not majority language of Luxembourg.

Background: Sheldon Gary Adelson (pronounced ; born August 4, 1933) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which owns the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and is the parent company of Venetian Macao Limited, which operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. He also owns the Israeli daily newspaper Israel Hayom and the American daily newspaper Las Vegas Review-Journal. Adelson, a lifelong donor and philanthropist to a variety of causes, also founded the Adelson Foundation in 2007, at the initiative of his wife, Miriam. Context: A June 2008 profile in The New Yorker detailed several controversies involving Adelson. In 2008 Richard Suen, a Hong Kong businessman who had helped Adelson make connections with top Chinese officials in order to obtain the Macau license, took Adelson to court in Las Vegas alleging he had reneged on his agreement to allow Suen to profit from the venture. Suen won a 43.8 million judgement; in November 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the judgment and returned the case to the lower court for further consideration. In the 2013 retrial, the jury awarded Suen a verdict for 70 million. The judge added another 31.6 million in interest, bringing the total judgment against Adelson to 101.6 million. Adelson is appealing again. Adelson faces another trial over claims by three alleged \\"middlemen\\" in the deal who are suing for at least 450 million.  In February 2013, the Las Vegas Sands, in a regulatory filing, acknowledged that it had likely violated federal law that prohibits the bribing of foreign officials. Allegedly, Chinese officials were bribed to allow Adelson to build his Macau casino.  Adelson successfully sued the Daily Mail of London for libel in 2008. The newspaper had accused him of pursuing \\"despicable business practices\\" and having \\"habitually and corruptly bought political favour\\". Adelson won the libel case, which was described as \\"a grave slur on Mr Adelson's personal integrity and business reputation\\", and he won a judgment of approximately PS4 million, which he said he would donate to London's Royal Marsden Hospital.  In August 2012, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), after being threatened with a libel suit, apologized and withdrew two blog posts that claimed Adelson had donated \\"Chinese prostitution money\\" to Republicans. Another organization, the National Jewish Democratic Council, posted on their website that Adelson \\"personally approved\\" of prostitution at his Macau resorts. Adelson sued for libel, but a federal judge dismissed the suit in September 2013, ordering Adelson to pay the NJDC's legal fees. Question: What was the judgement due to?. Whats the answer?","output":"The judgment was due to a legal dispute between Sheldon Adelson and Richard Suen, a Hong Kong businessman. In 2008, Suen filed a lawsuit against Adelson alleging that Adelson had reneged on his agreement to allow Suen to profit from the venture of obtaining a license for Adelson's Macau casino. Suen claimed that he helped Adelson make connections with top Chinese officials in order to secure the license for the Macau casino operation. Initially, Suen won a judgment of 43.8 million, but the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the judgment in November 2010 and sent the case back to the lower court for further consideration. In the 2013 retrial, the jury awarded Suen a 70 million verdict, and the judge added another 31.6 million in interest on top of that, bringing the total judgment against Adelson to 101.6 million. Adelson has appealed the decision again. In summary, the judgment was due to the lawsuit filed by Richard Suen against Sheldon Adelson, alleging that Adelson had breached their agreement for Suen to profit from the Macau casino venture after helping Adelson secure the necessary license and connections with Chinese officials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Opened in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first longspan bridge to carry motor traffic, and it quickly became the model for the great suspension bridges of the following century. Spanning New York's East River, it provided the first traffic artery  between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. Before that, the only transportation was by ferries, which were slow and could be dangerous in winter. The construction of a bridge over the EastRiver had been discussed since the early 19th century, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 _ all consideration of the project. When the war ended in 1865, the bridge became an important issue once more. In 1867, the New York State passed an act setting up the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge. Born in Germany in 1806, he held aggressive views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous figure. He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination. Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1,500 feet (465 m), with two towers in the East River serving as the main piers. The bridge that was actually built is longer--1,597 feet (486 m), the longest suspension bridge at that time. Question: According to the passage, which of the following correctly describes John Augustus Roebling? Yes or no, is the answer \\"He moved to America because he was discriminated against in his home country.\\"?","output":"Yes, the answer \\"He moved to America because he was discriminated against in his home country.\\" correctly describes John Augustus Roebling according to the passage.

Summarize this article: The enormous drought scorching the central USA will almost certainly cost at least 12 billion, making it the costliest since 1988, experts said Wednesday.      \\"There does seem to be near-unanimous agreement from industry experts that this year's drought losses will surpass the 12 billion recorded in 2011,\\" says meteorologist Steve Bowen of Aon Benfield, a global reinsurance firm.      The Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that food prices next year could go up by 3%-4% as a result, with beef expected to take the highest jump at 4%-5%.      About 64% of the contiguous USA is in a drought, according to today's U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal website.      \\"Right now, it is difficult to say whether we end up reaching the loss levels of 1988 (40 billion) and 1980 (20 billion), given that it will be several months for agricultural industries to fully assess the total extent of their losses,\\" Bowen says.      If adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars, Bowen says, those drought losses would be 78 billion and 56 billion, based on National Climatic Data Center figures.      \\"If the intensity of this year's drought is prolonged throughout the rest of the summer, it may not be out of the question to experience losses that rival something seen out of those 1980s events,\\" Bowen says.      Joseph Glauber, chief economist for the USDA, says his department won't have a clear picture of how much damage the nation's crops have sustained until a report Aug. 10. However, \\"it is safe to say\\" that this year's crop-insurance payments to farmers hit by drought will top the 10.8 billion paid last year, he says.      Paul Walker, senior meteorologist for AccuWeather, says that in many areas of the Corn Belt, rain wouldn't help because \\"it is getting too late in the growing season.\\"      David Friedberg, founder and CEO of the San Francisco-based Climate Corporation, which sells insurance to farmers to supplement their federal crop insurance, estimates that yields on the 160 million acres of corn and soybeans planted in the U.S. this year will eventually be 30% lower than in a typical weather year.      \\"In 2013, as a result of this drought, we are looking at above-normal food-price inflation. … Consumers are certainly going to feel it,\\" Richard Volpe, USDA economist, says.      Normal grocery price inflation is about 2.8%, he added, so even at the low end of the projected range people will see their grocery expenses rise more than usual in 2013. The USDA kept its projected food price increase for 2012 steady at 2.5% to 3.5%. ||||| Drought-damaged ears of corn are seen against dry, cracked earth on a farm near Fairbury, Illinois July 24, 2012.      WASHINGTON |      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Food prices will race ahead faster than prices of other goods in the United States this year and next, due to the worst drought in more than a half a century, the government forecast on Wednesday.      Food prices rose 3.7 percent in 2011, and American consumers may pay 3.5 percent more at the grocery store this year, with higher prices for meat, poultry and fruit, as the drought gripping the U.S. farm belt drives up crop prices.      The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast that food prices would jump between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in 2012 and then rise 3-4 percent in 2013.      \\"The drought is really going to hit food prices next year,\\" said Richard Volpe, a USDA economist, adding the pressure on food prices would start to build later this year.      \\"It's already affecting corn and soybean prices, but then it has to work its way all the way through the system into feed prices and then animal prices, then wholesale prices and then finally, retail prices,\\" Volpe said.      Food prices will rise far more rapidly than the overall U.S. inflation rate, according to USDA, a turnabout from the usual pattern. The U.S. inflation rate is estimated for 2 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2013. Food inflation was 3.7 percent last year but only 0.8 percent in 2010.      Corn and soybeans have hit record highs on concerns the drought will slash yields for grain that is already in tight supply globally.      Corn for September delivery was up 3.5 cents on Wednesday to 7.93 a bushel after forecasts showing the region could expect only patchy rains and more of the scorching triple digit heat.      (Reporting By Russ Blinch) ||||| Summary:","output":"The central US is experiencing a severe drought, which experts predict will cost at least 12 billion, making it the costliest since 1988. Food prices are expected to rise by 3-4% in 2013 as a result, with beef experiencing the highest increase of 4-5%. Around 64% of the contiguous US is affected by the drought, and crop insurance payments to farmers are expected to exceed the 10.8 billion paid in 2011. Yields on the 160 million acres of corn and soybeans planted in the US this year are anticipated to be 30% lower than in a typical year, leading to above-normal food price inflation in 2013."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sasha Avonna Bell was one of the first of a growing number of people to file a lawsuit in connection to the Flint water crisis after she claimed that her child had been lead poisoned.      Bell was found dead April 19 in the 2600 block of Ridgecrest Drive at the Ridgecrest Village Townhouses. Sacorya Renee Reed was also found shot to death in the home.      An unharmed 1-year-old child was also found inside of the Ridgecrest home when Bell's body was discovered and was taken into custody by child protective services. Police declined to confirm if it was Bell's child discovered in the home.      \\"Sasha was a lovely young woman who cared deeply for her family, and especially for her young child,\\" said her attorney Corey M. Stern. \\"Her tragic and senseless death has created a void in the lives of so many people that loved her. Hopefully, her child will be lifted up by the love and support from everyone who cared deeply for Sasha.\\"      Bell's case was one of 64 lawsuits filed on behalf of 144 children by Stern's firm, New York-based Levy Konigsberg, and Flint-based Robinson Carter & Crawford.

The case also named three individual government, or former government, employees who played significant roles in the alleged misconduct that led to the alleged poisoning of thousands of children in Flint, her attorneys claim.      The Bell case, however, played an important role in determining the future of the more than five dozen other lawsuits that were filed.      Flint water crisis conspiracy theories swirl after two recent deaths      Initially, Bell's case and the others were filed in Genesee Circuit Court. However, they were transferred to U.S. District Court on a motion from one of the defendants, engineering company Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam.      However, Ann Arbor U.S. District Judge John Corbett O'Meara ruled April 13 that Bell's case should return to the state court claiming it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.      Stern said the case will continue and a representative will be appointed for Bell's child.      The ruling also forced the other 63 cases to be returned to state court.

The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1]  Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.  Which country experiences a more noticeable distance decay effect? A:","output":"Nigeria would experience a more noticeable distance decay effect because it did not develop its infrastructure and communications technology. These developments, as highlighted, help to mitigate the effects of distance decay by enabling quicker travel and easier communication over distances. Hence, without these developments, Nigeria's interactions with other locales, especially those further away, would be likely to decrease more significantly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of electrochemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating ferrous oxide layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\" is \\"glucose\\", given that  oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's first break down the components and processes involved in cellular respiration for organisms consuming Volatile Organic Acids (VOAs) and alcohols. Step 1: Identify the role of VOAs and alcohols in cellular respiration Volatile Organic Acids (VOAs) and alcohols, such as ethanol, are alternative carbon sources for certain organisms. These organisms have the ability to metabolize VOAs and alcohols to generate energy through cellular respiration. Step 2: Identify the key elements involved in cellular respiration Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down organic molecules, such as glucose, and convert this into ATP, the energy currency of the cell. There are three key stages in cellular respiration: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), and the electron transport chain. Oxygen plays a crucial role as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, allowing the generation of a significant amount of ATP. Step 3: Compare the roles of glucose and oxygen in cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols Glucose is a common carbon source for most organisms and is broken down through glycolysis, followed by the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain to produce ATP. However, when organisms consume VOAs and alcohols, they metabolize these compounds to generate energy instead of glucose. Oxygen is essential because it serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, regardless of whether the organism is metabolizing glucose, VOAs, or alcohols. Step 4: Answer the question Given that oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols, the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\" is not \\"glucose.\\" Instead, oxygen plays a crucial role in this process, as it is required for the generation of ATP via the electron transport chain, regardless of the carbon source being utilized."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\"  part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor  has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion.  - Sir George Ivan Morrison, OBE (born 31 August 1945), known as Van Morrison, is a Northern Irish singer and songwriter with a reputation for being at once stubborn, idiosyncratic, and sublime. His studio albums \\"Astral Weeks\\" and \\"Moondance\\", and the live album \\"It's Too Late to Stop Now\\", are acclaimed as among the greatest recorded. In 2016, he was knighted for his musical achievements and his services to tourism and charitable causes in Northern Ireland.  - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubsrefining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, \\"Inside Wants Out\\". His following two full-length albums\\"Room for Squares\\" (2001) and \\"Heavier Things\\" (2003)did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\".  - The Library of Congress (\\"LOC\\") is the research library that officially serves the United States Congress and is the \\"de facto\\" national library of the United States. It is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. The Library is housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.; it also maintains the Packard Campus in Culpeper, Virginia, which houses the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center.  - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille.  - \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\".  - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century  Question: \\"What novellas are morality tales about Asia's Femme Fatale White Snake?\\" Answer: \\"âThe Lust of the White Serpantâ & âEternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagodaâ\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. \\"The Lust of the White Serpent\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\", a traditional Chinese story, are indeed novellas that serve as morality tales about Asia's Femme Fatale Madame White Snake. These stories depict her not just as a villainous entity but also as a complex and multi-dimensional character that evolves into a more realistic human figure, embodying qualities of both a loving wife and a dangerous snake demon. Both novellas demonstrate the character's transformation and journey as a femme fatale, drawing the readers into her world, which is fraught with passion, danger, and transgression. However, both stories also serve as cautionary tales, warning the reader of the dangers inherent in succumbing to the allure of a femme fatale. In the course of the narrative, Madame White Snake transitions from a snake demon preying on her human husband, to a caring, loving wife, who even assumes the role of a rescuer in times of adversity, thereby embodying the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife. Yet, the essence of her character as a femme fatale endures—intriguing, captivating, and dangerous—and is manifested in her sexuality, proving the point that she cannot lead a peaceful life with her human husband. The contradictions in her character thereby enhance her appeal, making the readers empathize with her, while simultaneously cautioning them about the potential dangers such a character could pose. Over the centuries, the legend of Madame White Snake has had a considerable influence on East Asian folktales, stories, and narratives, with her character emerging as an enduring symbol of the enigmatic and dangerous femme fatale. This enduring appeal of her character highlights the fascination for such figures in literature and underscores the intricate balance between attraction and danger, morality, and transgression, that they represent. Thus, these novellas not only offer an intriguing domain of a femme fatale but also prompt the reader to confront the moral dilemmas posed by such characters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After initial hostility and declaring that she is not gay, Aileen talks to Selby over beers. Selby takes to Aileen almost immediately, as she likes that she is very protective of her. Selby invites her to spend the night with her. They return to the house where Selby is staying (temporarily exiled by her parents following the accusation from another girl that Selby tried to kiss her).

Article:","output":"Title: Enhancing Your Living Space: Tips for Creating a Welcoming Atmosphere Introduction: A well-arranged living space can set the tone for a comfortable and enjoyable environment, whether you're relaxing alone or entertaining guests. In this article, we will explore some simple yet effective ways to optimize your living space, focusing on seating arrangements, creative decor, guest-friendly features, and functional furniture such as tables for food and drinks. Step 1: Arrange your seating near windows The first thing you can do to create a welcoming atmosphere is to consider the placement of your seating. Positioning your seating arrangements near windows not only takes advantage of natural light but also provides a visually-pleasing view for you and your guests. Ample sunlight gives a feeling of warmth and brightness, making your space more inviting and comfortable. Remember, natural light can also help to lift your mood and increase productivity. Step 2: Display creative pieces Incorporating a few creative pieces into your living space can add personality and make your space uniquely yours. Consider adding artwork, sculptures, or even a small collection of items that reflect your interests and passions. The key is to select pieces that have a meaningful connection to you without overwhelming the space or causing visual clutter. Keep in mind that attractive decor can also serve as a conversation starter for guests. Step 3: Create a designated area for coats and belongings When inviting guests over, it is essential to provide a designated area where they can comfortably leave their coats and belongings. This could be as simple as a coat rack, a separate closet, or a designated area near the entrance. Providing a designated space helps your guests feel at ease, ensuring they can enjoy the gathering without worrying about their possessions. Step 4: Add tables for food and drinks Finally, including one or more tables dedicated to food and drinks adds a practical yet essential touch to your living space. Having a designated area for snacks and refreshments encourages guests to help themselves and mingle while preventing spills that could damage your belongings or create potential hazards. Consider the size of your space and the number of guests you typically entertain when selecting the right table size and style. Conclusion: By strategically arranging your seating near windows, showcasing personal creative pieces, creating a designated area for coats, and adding tables for food and drinks, you can greatly enhance your living space and create a welcoming atmosphere for both relaxation and entertainment. So don't be afraid to get creative and make adjustments based on your unique tastes and needs – a little effort can go a long way in transforming your living space into a comfortable and inviting sanctuary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical.

It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital.  - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.  - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it.  - The Ictaluridae , sometimes called ictalurids , are a family of catfish native to North America , where they are important food fish and sometimes as a sport fish . It includes about 51 species . They include fish commonly known as bullheads , madtoms , channel catfish , and blue catfish .  - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Ictalurus is a genus of North American freshwater catfishes. It includes the well-known channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") and blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\").  - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL.  - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States.  - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably.   - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.  - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\".  - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: An EU official said Turkey was not heading in a European direction, as he gave an annual appraisal of its progress towards EU membership. The Turkish president challenged the EU to \\"make your final decision\\". For days there has been a war of words, with Europe accused of failing to take terrorism in Turkey seriously. And a Turkish minister rejected the latest appraisal as \\"not objective\\". The worsening relations have led to fears that an EU-Turkey deal on migrants in March could collapse. Under the March 2016 agreement, migrants arriving in Greece are now sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum or their claim is rejected, but Turkey complains it has not got its end of the bargain. A conditional promise of visa-free travel now seems a long way off. Nonetheless, the Commission statement stopped short of severing talks or imposing sanctions - reflecting the reliance of each side on the other, say commentators. Negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU began in 2005, and its progress on 72 benchmarks are reported on annually along with other would-be new members. In a tweet sent as the report was launched, EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn said there had been \\"serious backsliding in areas of #RuleofLaw and #fundamentalrights\\". The post-coup crackdown, he said, had \\"affected all spectrums of society\\". The Commission highlighted several issues of concern including: In a statement on Tuesday, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, condemned last Friday's bomb attack in the south-eastern, mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir which followed the HDP detentions and killed 11 people, demanding an end to violence. But she added that actions against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) had to be proportional and respect human rights. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, meanwhile, used blunt words to voice his disdain for Turkish actions. \\"I say this with bitterness, I who am a friend of Turkey, that every day Turkey is moving further away from Europe,\\" he said on Tuesday. \\"We need Turkey... but we cannot compromise on our main principles\\", he said, challenging Turkey to \\"clearly say whether it wants to be a member of the EU or not\\". Earlier this week, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn compared Turkey's purge to methods used by Nazi Germany. The EU's criticisms have been angrily rejected by Turkish leaders. On Tuesday, the Turkish foreign ministry branded the criticisms \\"unacceptable\\", saying European nations \\"insistently refused to understand Turkey's sensitivities concerning terrorism\\" - and for tolerating the PKK despite its EU status as a terrorist organisation. \\"The EU has lost its plausibility and credibility with the Turkish people on the issue of the struggle against terrorism,\\" the statement said. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave a frustrated response on Wednesday, telling a business group in Istanbul: \\"They say unabashedly and shamelessly that the EU should review its negotiations with Turkey.\\" \\"You are late, go and review them as soon as you can. But don't just review them - go and make your final decision.\\" He referred explicitly to the migrants packed into Turkish camps under the terms of the March deal, saying: \\"What if the negotiations end and they open the gates, where would we put those three million refugees? \\"That is their worry. That is why they cannot come to the end point.'' Summary:","output":"Turkey wants to be a part of the European Union (EU), but the EU is worried about some things happening in Turkey. They are worried about how the government is treating people and handling some problems. The people in charge of Turkey don't like the EU's worries and think that the EU is not understanding their situation. Both sides need each other for different reasons, so they are still talking. There are also concerns about a deal between the EU and Turkey about people who want to live in Europe.

To combine the terms, subtract 2616 from 2625:     (2625 - 2616) * i = -153 3. This simplifies to:     9 * i = -153 4. To solve for i, we will now divide both sides of the equation by 9:    i = (-153) / 9 5. Simplifying the division, we get:    i = -17 So, the solution is i = -17."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of the story, the author probably: Options:  A. not enough information  B.

Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \\"rather distressed\\". Two days later, he wrote again: \\"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \\"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\\". Consequently, he was baptised \\"Albert Frederick Arthur George\\" at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth.

But on this earth, we can be with him as well, by simply praying and engaging in a relationship with him. As we build our faith, we can gain a deeper understanding of Jesus through studying the Bible, attending religious services, and participating in communities of fellow believers. Remember, heaven is not solely a destination, but it is also a connection we can have with Jesus in the present moment, impacting our daily lives and reinforcing our spiritual growth. It is important to recognize that interpretations of heaven and biblical teachings differ among individuals and denominations, but at the core, the belief in heaven ingrained in Christianity is unified by the promise of being with Jesus Christ eternally. This promise brings hope and solace to people who may face difficulties, struggles, and loss in their lives. The presence of Jesus offers a sense of spiritual comfort and guidance, even during the darkest times. Additionally, Matthew 2:7-10 reminds us of the fundamental values of Christianity: love, forgiveness, and seeking justice for the wrongs committed. The Bible encourages us to strive for righteousness in our actions and to treat others with compassion and mercy. In doing so, we are living out the teachings of Jesus and emulating the spirit of heaven here on earth. In conclusion, to know what heaven is like, one must study the Bible, engage in a personal relationship with Jesus, and strive to live according to the teachings of Jesus throughout life. Heaven is not just a far-off destination but can be experienced daily through the loving connection we have with Jesus and our commitment to living in a manner that reflects his love and mercy.

It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

President Trochu resigned on 25 January and was replaced by Favre, who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight. Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter's arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight. At Tours, Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed. A delegation of Parisian diplomats arrived in Tours by train on 5 February to negotiate with Gambetta, and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.\\".

Which person made a fire that burned less bright?  Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright.  Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. The answer to this question is:","output":"Danny made a fire that burned less bright.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: resentful toward Jordan  B: grateful to Jordan  C: angry at Jordan Answer:","output":"Jan would most likely feel grateful to Jordan.  According to the context provided, Jordan found Jan's wallet in the back of the car and returned it to Jan. This act demonstrates honesty, helpfulness, and thoughtfulness on Jordan's part. Losing a wallet can be a stressful situation, as it often contains valuable personal items like cash, credit cards, and identification documents. By returning the wallet, Jordan actively prevented those items from being lost, stolen or misused, and saved Jan from potential worry and the inconvenience of having to replace those items. Given the positive aspects of Jordan's actions, Jan would feel a sense of relief that their wallet has been found and returned to them. Consequently, the most appropriate answer to the question is B: grateful to Jordan.  A: resentful toward Jordan - Resentment is an emotion that stems from feelings of unfairness and being hurt or wronged by someone else. In this context, Jordan's actions don't reflect any aspect of causing harm or being unfair to Jan, so there would be no reason for Jan to feel resentful toward Jordan. C: angry at Jordan - Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism towards someone or something that caused harm or interfered with personal goals or desires. In this context, Jordan's actions have not caused harm and, in fact, were beneficial to Jan. Therefore, there is no rationale for Jan to feel angry at Jordan."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: A wide variety of commercial cleaning products can help you clean brass.  While the specific directions for these products vary with manufacturer, generally you will spray the product on the brass hinge, then wipe it down with a clean cloth.  Popular brass cleaning products include Wright’s Premium Brass Cleaning Polish and Brasso Multipurpose Polish. Test the cleaning product on an inconspicuous area of the hinge before applying it to the whole thing.  If the cleaning product causes the brass plate to flake off, discontinue use of that product and try another instead. Consult manufacturer directions before using any brass cleaning product. Apply a thin patina of ketchup, marinara sauce, or tomato paste to the brass hinge using a paper towel or hand cloth.  Allow the tomato-based product to remain on the brass hinge for about 60 minutes.  Dip a clean cloth or sponge in hot, soapy water, then scrub the brass hinge. This technique also works with Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Combine equal parts vinegar, salt, and flour.  For instance, you might combine two tablespoons of vinegar, two tablespoons of salt, and two tablespoons of flour.  Smear this paste across the surface of the brass hinge.  Wait for about 60 minutes.  Rinse the hinge off with warm water.  Wipe it down with a dry cloth until it shines. Cut a lemon in half and remove the seeds from one half.  Cover the half of the lemon you removed the seeds from with salt.  Rub the face of the lemon (the flat side covered in salt) over the brass hinge.  As you rub the hinge, add additional coats of salt to the lemon as it flakes off. Wipe the hinge down with a clean cloth. Combine two tablespoons of cream of tartar and one tablespoon of lemon juice.  Rub the paste on the hinge using a clean paper towel or an old toothbrush.  Allow the paste to sit for 30 minutes.  Then, dip a clean cloth in warm water and wipe the paste away. Mix equal parts white vinegar and baking soda in a bowl with steep sides.  For example, you could combine two tablespoons vinegar and two tablespoons baking soda.  The ingredients will fizz when combined.  Dip a soft-bristled brush or a soft cloth in the mix and wipe down the brass hinge for a minute or two.  Wipe the hinge clean with a damp rag, then dry it with a clean dish cloth. Use a spatula to lightly cover the hinge in plain yogurt.  Try to stand the hinges on their edges so as to coat the maximum surface area possible with yogurt.  Allow the yogurt to dry overnight.  Rinse the hinges thoroughly using warm water.  Use a toothbrush to get the yogurt out of any recesses where it might have coalesced. Another dairy-based cleaning solution involves combing equal parts water and milk.  For instance, you might mix five tablespoons of water and five tablespoons of milk in small pot.  Whatever volume of each you choose to combine, ensure it coats the hinges completely.  Place the hinges in the pot, bring it to a boil, then turn the heat to its lowest setting.  The amount of time it takes to get your brass hinges clean by simmering them in milk depends on the extent of grime and tarnish the hinges have acquired.  Use tongs to pull the hinges out every 10 minutes  and examine them. If they’re clean, turn the stovetop off and rinse your hinges in water. If the hinges are not clean, drop them back in their milk bath. Place your brass hinges in a crockpot.  Cover the hinges with water.  Set the crockpot to low and let the hinges “cook” for a few hours.  Pull the hinges out using tongs or just conduct a visual inspection to discern whether the paint is coming off.  If the paint is coming off, remove it and restore the hinge to its rightful place. If it is not, place it back in the crockpot for another few hours. If, after another dip in the crockpot, the paint is still not coming off or has only partially come off, rub a cloth dampened with mineral spirits over the entire surface of the hinge.  This should further loosen the paint. This technique also works for removing lacquer from brass hinges. Summary:","output":"The article discusses various methods for cleaning brass hinges using both commercial products and homemade solutions.

They both touch upon the topic of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, but they are asking about different aspects and situations. The first question is asking about taking AP classes during a gap year while college admissions start before the AP exams. The student is wondering if they can still use their AP scores in admissions decisions or for course credit, even though the exams take place later than the admissions process. The second question is asking about whether a student should take both AP Biology and AP Chemistry during their senior year or take the classes ASB (Associated Student Body) and yearbook instead. This is more about deciding the appropriate course load and the potential trade-offs between the choices. In more detail: 1. The first question relates to the timing of AP exams and college admissions. Since AP exams usually take place in May, and college admissions decisions often occur earlier in the year, students may have doubts about whether they can still use their AP scores in their college applications. The answer depends on the specific college or university policies regarding AP scores, their deadlines, and their flexibility in accepting later scores. Some institutions may allow students to report AP scores they receive after the application deadline, while others may not. Additionally, depending on the AP score situation, students might still be able to use their scores for course placements, credit or advanced standing, but might not impact the admission process itself. 2. The second question is about choosing classes for the senior year of high school. The student is debating between taking two AP science courses (AP Biology and AP Chemistry) or opting for extracurricular activities through the Associated Student Body (ASB) and yearbook classes. The answer depends on multiple factors, such as the student's personal interests, their career goals, the importance of the AP classes for college applications, and the potential workload. The decision also depends on how competitive the student's college applications are and whether they feel taking AP courses will strengthen their academic profile. On the other hand, it is also essential to consider the potential benefits of ASB and yearbook involvement, which could be valuable in building soft skills, leadership qualities, and teamwork abilities."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Jackson) is a twenty-eight-year veteran of the LAPD. A single and widowed father, he is particularly strict with his two children, Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) and Celia (Regine Nehy). As his kids leave for school, the new neighbors begin moving in next door. They are a young interracial couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington), who are recently married and buying their first home. Chrisâs first exchanges with Abel have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chrisâ smoking (which Chris hides from Lisa) and listening to hip hop music. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children are watching. Abel arrives home to see this spectacle and is upset, so he repositions the home security floodlights so they shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. When Chris confronts him, Abel claims that the lights are part of his security system to prevent crime and says that it is a complex process to shut down the system and the lights. Abel attends a housewarming party hosted by Chris and Lisa. He is garrulous but has an edge, and criticizes Chris and his friends for their liberal political and social tendencies. He also exposes Chris' smoking to Lisa, as Chris has been discarding his cigarette butts on Abel's lawn. As he leaves, Chris tells Abel that he is starting to take offense to him, but does not plan to move. One evening, they hear noises downstairs, and find the tires of Chris' car slashed. They suspect Abel and call the police. However, because of Abel's status within the LAPD, the arriving officers are unable to do anything.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is involved in repairing a 400-year-old clock mechanism? from the following article ?  Mr. Wilson of the United Nations War Crimes Commission is hunting for Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler, a war criminal who has erased all evidence which might identify him, with no clue left to his identity except \\"a hobby that almost amounts to a mania—clocks.\\" Wilson releases Kindler's former associate Meinike, hoping the man will lead him to Kindler. Wilson follows Meinike to the United States, to the town of Harper, Connecticut, but loses him before he meets with Kindler. Kindler has assumed a new identity and is known locally as \\"Charles Rankin,\\" and has become a prep school teacher. He is about to marry Mary Longstreet, daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet, and is involved in repairing the town's 400-year-old Habrecht-style clock mechanism with religious automata that crowns the belfry of a church in the town square. When Kindler and Meinike do meet, Meinike, who is repentant, begs Kindler to confess his crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him. Eventually, Wilson deduces that Rankin is Kindler, but not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband. To get her to admit this, Wilson must convince her that her husband is a criminal—before Rankin decides to eliminate the threat to him by killing her. Kindler's pose begins to unravel when Red, the family dog, discovers Meinike's body. To further protect his secret, Kindler poisons Red. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who is involved in repairing the 400-year-old clock mechanism is Charles Rankin, who is, in fact, an alias assumed by Nazi fugitive and war criminal Franz Kindler. He engaged in the repair of the town's Habrecht-style clock with religious automata atop the church belfry in Harper, Connecticut, while simultaneously maintaining his cover as a prep school teacher."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.  _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV. Sound interesting? Maybe you can have a \\"voice\\" in acting after all!

Philosophy of space and time In 1781, Immanuel Kant published the Critique of Pure Reason, one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an a priori notion that, together with other a priori notions such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant denies that either space or time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events. Although space and time are held to be transcendentally ideal in this sense, they are also empirically real—that is, not mere illusions. Q: What did Kant say was similar notion to time?","output":"Immanuel Kant argued that space was a similar notion to time. According to Kant, both space and time are a priori notions, which means they are pre-existing structures within our minds that shape our experiences and understanding of the world. These notions are not derived from experience or external objects; rather, they serve as a necessary framework for organizing and comprehending sensory input. So, both space and time play fundamental roles in structuring and interpreting the phenomena we encounter in our day-to-day lives, making them transcendentally ideal but also empirically real aspects of human experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is not entirely conclusive, as the premise only provides partial information that supports, but does not confirm, the hypothesis. The premise provides information about the grandiose interior of a space filled with 12th- and 13th-century mosaics that depict the complete cycle of the Old Testament. The mosaics in the nave and apse include a 66-ft high Christ Pantocrator with saints, while those in the aisle depict the miracles of Jesus. From this description, we can deduce that the space underwent significant artistic work and design in the 12th and 13th centuries. The hypothesis claims that the interior was completed in the 13th century. Although the fact that 13th-century mosaics are present in the space gives us reason to believe that the interior might have been completed during this time, it does not provide sufficient evidence. It is possible that other parts of the interior were completed earlier or later than the 13th century. The premise doesn't mention the entire interior but only focuses on the mosaics. In conclusion, although the information provided in the premise partially supports the hypothesis that the interior was completed in the 13th century, it doesn't provide a solid basis for this claim. To come to a more definite conclusion, further information regarding the entirety of the interior and its timeline for completion would be required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 10 women who made Beyoncé Bessie Smith was the highest paid black entertainer of the Jazz Age, but her New York Times obituary was barely a paragraph long. The blues singer sang about the plight of a black woman in a white man’s world, which made her popular in her own community but ignored by the wider world during her short life. Most importantly, Smith made the path for black female singers far easier to tread in her wake. (James Fortune / Rex Features) Peggy Lee, best known for her 1958 hit Fever, was a pioneer of stagecraft. The Grammy-winning country singer didn’t perform gymnastic dance routines, but meticulously choreographed her movements on stage and controlled her lighting and costumes. Lee’s single finger-click in Fever may be subtle, but it was as key to her image as Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love bum-wiggle. (Everett Collection / Rex Features) Before there was Independent Women and Run The World (Girls), there was Respect. Franklin’s 1967 single became a global anthem for the feminist and civil rights movements, helping to break down the gender barriers for future generations of female singers. Furthermore, Beyoncé’s vocals echo Franklin’s gospel-inspired singing, and they were both chosen to sing at President Obama’s inaugurations. Unlike Beyoncé, Franklin, now in her seventies, chose to sing live. (Brian Rasic / Rex Features) Beyoncé played Ross in the musical Dreamgirls, a film about the 1960s girl group The Supremes, which Ross fronted. Their career paths are eerily similar: Ross left the group she fronted as a teen to have an impressive solo career and both separated from the male managers who defined their early success. Beyoncé co-write Listen for Dreamgirls, and the song reflects the steely work ethic behind both divas: “I’m more than what you made of me / I followed the voice you gave to me/But now I’ve gotta find my own.” Beyoncé is worth an estimated 350 million, and she’s not shy about how she made it. But Dolly Parton preceded her in making music into business. Ventures such as her Dollywood theme park, and Dolly Records, have earnt Parton over 500 million and she’s proud of her brand. Both women are also traditionalists and firm supporters of matrimony: Dolly has always maintained both her status as a wife and an independent woman, and so has Beyoncé, naming her latest tour The Mrs Carter Show. Fashion, vocals, stage presence: Beyoncé has been compared to the Tina Turner in many ways, despite the fact the singers have different musical styles. Fans of big hair, big voices and big, flashy stage shows, Turner and Beyoncé proved they were compatible during the 2008 Grammy awards, when, in matching silver outfits, they performed Proud Mary, a song about a woman who shared their strong work ethic. (SIPA PRESS / Rex Features) Beyoncé is rarely found singing perched on a stool - dance is central to her live and video performances. Madonna was a pioneer of eye-catching dance routines - she brought underground New York dance craze Voguing to the masses in 1990 - and her provocative videos were perfect for the new MTV generation. Madonna still, like Beyoncé, uses dance to evoke power and sexuality. Meanwhile, Beyoncé has reinvented the video once again, sparking viral remakes of her routines on YouTube and combining the advert for her fashion line with the release of new song Standing On The Sun. Mary J. Blige has criticised Beyoncé for being “groomed to be a pop artist”, but Beyoncé was growing up while Blige was releasing her own music: an influential bridge between hip-hop and contemporary R’n’B which came out of her Bronx background. Blige has since become a matriarch of hip-hop culture, and allows herself to be glamourous while talking about female sexuality. (Fotex Medien Agentur GMBH/REX FEATURES) Along with Queen Latifa, Salt-n-Pepa were the first women to confront misogyny and sexism in hip-hop in the only way it would understand: by beating the boys with their rhymes. The Brooklyn trio used infectious tracks to discuss issues like gender equality and female sexuality with fierce attitude, inspiring Destiny’s Child less than a decade later. Furthermore, their efforts weren’t limited to the underground: they won a Grammy award in 1995 for None of Your Business, a feminist clarion call against slut-shaming. Beyoncé and Aaliyah were contemporaries in the early noughties R’n’B scene, the latter was even romantically linked with Beyoncé’s husband Jay-Z. However, Aaliyah’s brief career ended after a tragic plane crash in 2001. But as shown in her track Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number - reportedly about her controversial relationship with R Kelly - youth didn’t prevent Aaliyah from being in control of her sexuality without being objectified, something Beyoncé went on to emulate and build into a brand.

Explicitly including health care in the Index further drives up the share of households “at risk.”      Saving more and working longer may substantially improve the outlook.

This index takes into account the critical challenge of ensuring retirement security for an aging population in the United States. Recent findings in the NRRI indicate that the retirement landscape has changed considerably, resulting in a less optimistic outlook for Baby Boomers and Generation Xers in comparison to current retirees. Currently, 50 percent of households are considered \\"at risk\\" of not having sufficient funds to maintain their living standards upon retirement. When healthcare costs are explicitly included in the index, the percentage of \\"at-risk\\" households increases even more. To combat these challenges and improve the outlook for future retirees, researchers suggest that saving more money and working longer can help substantially. The NRRI has published numerous research studies on various aspects of retirement security, including how factors such as race, ethnicity, divorce, raising children, housing, inheriting wealth, and student loan debt affect retirement readiness. Overall, the NRRI serves as an important tool for understanding and addressing the challenges facing an increasingly aging population in terms of retirement security. This index helps highlight the need for individuals, policymakers, and the financial industry to take action to improve retirement preparedness for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do that, we need to add 125 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 125 = 125*k Now, it looks like this: 125 = 125*k Finally, we need to find out what 'k' is. Since 125*k means 125 multiplied by 'k', we should divide 125 by 125 to find 'k': k = 125 / 125 And when we do the division, we find out that: k = 1 So the answer is: k = 1.

I always thought that Lotus of Siam got so much publicity and business from their reputation alone that I didn't think that I would ever come here.  The last thing I wanted to do is fight locals and tourists for a seat.  BUT, my group wanted to try them on the final day of our trip and who am I to tell them no?  So I headed out here first to snag a table for eight of us, a very hard task considering that they are always busy even after the lunch hour passes.  After confirming with the hostess that our table was ready, another group of 21 comes in and asks for a table.  Now mind you, my group hasn't arrived yet and that group eyeballed my empty table for a bit but thankfully, my group showed up and proceeded to sit down.  The things that I remembered enjoying the most were the satay appetizer, the pineapple fried rice, the drunken noodles, pad thai, and the pork belly.  They also served a dish with raw shrimp served sashimi style.  I'm a fish sashimi guy but never had I ever tried shrimp raw before.  After dipping the shrimp in their sauce, I can honestly say that I can add raw shrimp to my favorites list.  It was really good.

However, ten years after the fantastic Granada series debued, Brett was a remarkably ill man. He was in the midst of a nervous breakdown after the death of his wife, and it is obvious in his face during the mosntrous two hours. I care not a wick for the story, I simply could not tear my eyes off of Brett's stricken and woebegone face. He looked so tired, so utterly tired of the role he has played for a decade. It was indeed cruel to have him come back into this role at that point in his life. He is so talented, so brilliant in his works of the past. I cannot stress that enough. Watch this movie and tell me he is not a suffering man! God rest his soul, we all miss this actor of unmistakeable calibur. I shall miss you, Mr. Brett.

(CNN) -- If voters in the United Kingdom were offered the chance tomorrow, in a snap referendum, to change the name of the nation to \\"Team GB\\" the result would hardly be in doubt. Such is the mood of euphoria fostered by the country's gold medal-winning performers, and London's successful staging of an Olympic Games that some had predicted would become the latest in a long tradition of Great British cockups, that a country more used to wallowing in sporting failure is waking up to the unfamiliar feeling of giving itself a collective pat on the back.

What was the full name of the person who died on 10 October 1646?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair.

During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work that was criticised as old-fashioned?, what is it ?

The answer is:","output":"The Blue Picardy Spaniel and Alpine Dachsbracke are both breeds of domestic dogs, which are scientifically classified under the species Canis lupus familiaris. These particular dog breeds belong to different breed groups, originating from separate regions, and have distinct historical backgrounds, physical characteristics, personalities, and roles they were bred for. The Blue Picardy Spaniel, known as \\"Epagneul Bleu de Picardie\\" in its native France, originated in the Picardy region of Northern France in the 19th century. It was developed by crossing the old French spaniels with the now-extinct English (or Gordon) Setter, which led to the emergence of its beautiful bluish-gray coat. This breed is classified under the sporting group and excels as a gundog due to its strong hunting instincts and excellent scent-tracking abilities. These medium-sized dogs are known for their amiable nature, high energy levels, and incredible intelligence, making them ideal for both hunting and as family companions. Initially bred for its hunting skills, the Blue Picardy Spaniel is ideal for various terrains from marshlands and water to thick forests, where it efficiently hunts, flushes, and retrieves different game like pheasants, ducks, and hares. Being highly trainable, it can successfully participate in dog sports like agility, tracking, and obedience competitions. Their gentle and affectionate temperament makes them great with children and other pets, requiring a family that can provide ample physical activity and mental stimulation to keep them happy and avoid destructive behavior. The Alpine Dachsbracke, on the other hand, comes from Austria, where they are known as \\"Alpenländische Dachsbracke.\\" Alpine Dachsbracke was developed in the mid-19th century by crossing the larger Austrian Hound with the Dachshund, aiming to create a breed with the Dachs' size and the Hound's agility. Classified under the scent hound group, the Alpine Dachsbracke was primarily bred for scent-tracking and pursuing wounded game in challenging alpine terrains. Along with its distinctive short legs, the Alpine Dachsbracke possesses a muscular body, waterproof coat, and robust constitution that aids in its efficiency as a hunting dog. Owing to their hunting background, these dogs are known for their fierce loyalty, devotion to their family, and a strong protective instinct. Despite the hunting lineage, the Alpine Dachsbracke also thrives as a family pet, bonding closely with its owners, and enjoying the company of children and other animals. Their unique, low-to-the-ground build and hunting skills make them active participants in various dog sports such as tracking, scent work, and even earth dog trials. In conclusion, the Blue Picardy Spaniel and Alpine Dachsbracke are both breeds of domestic dogs, distinct in their backgrounds, appearances, and skill sets. Their shared quality of being excellent hunters, trainable, loyal, and affectionate makes them not only reliable sporting dogs but also lovable family pets."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information:  - A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an oratory.  - Prior, derived from the Latin for \\"earlier, first\\", (or prioress for nuns) is an ecclesiastical title for a superior, usually lower in rank than an abbot or abbess. Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior.  - Lanfranc ( Latin : Lanfrancus ; 1005 x 1010 at Pavia -- 24 May 1089 at Canterbury ) was a celebrated Italian jurist who renounced his career to become a Benedictine monk at Bec in Normandy . He served successively as prior of Bec Abbey and abbot of St Stephen in Normandy and then as archbishop of Canterbury in England , following its Conquest by William the Bastard . He is also variously known as Lanfranc of Pavia ( Italian : Lanfranco di Pavia ) , Lanfranc of Bec ( French : Lanfranc du Bec ) , and Lanfranc of Canterbury ( Latin : Lanfrancus Cantuariensis ) .  - A title is a prefix or suffix added to someone's name in certain contexts. It may signify either veneration, an official position or a professional or academic qualification. In some languages, titles may be inserted before a last name (for example, \\"Graf\\" in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage or clerical titles such as Archbishop). Some titles are hereditary.  - Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is abbess.  - In Christianity, an abbess (Latin \\"abbatissa\\", feminine form of \\"abbas,\\" abbot) is the female superior of a community of nuns, which is often an abbey.  - Pavia (Lombard: \\"Pavia\\" Medieval Latin: \\"Papia\\") is a town and \\"comune\\" of south-western Lombardy, northern Italy, south of Milan on the lower Ticino river near its confluence with the Po. It has a population of c. 68,000. The city was the capital of the Kingdom of the Lombards from 572 to 774.  - Medieval Latin was the form of Latin used in the Middle Ages, primarily: as a medium of scholarly exchange; as the liturgical language of Chalcedonian Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church; and as a language of science, literature, law, and administration. Despite the clerical origin of many of its authors, medieval Latin should not be confused with Ecclesiastical Latin. There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where Late Latin ends and medieval Latin begins. Some scholarly surveys begin with the rise of early Ecclesiastical Latin in the middle of the 4th century, others around 500, and still others with the replacement of written Late Latin by written Romance languages starting around the year 900.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.    What is the relationship between 'lanfranc' and 'catholic church'? Answer:","output":"Lanfranc was a prominent figure in the Catholic Church during the 11th century, and his relationship with the Church was multifaceted. As a Benedictine monk, a prior, an abbot, and later an Archbishop, his ecclesiastical positions allowed him to contribute significantly to the Church's development and reforms during this period.  Born in Pavia, Italy, Lanfranc renounced his successful career as a jurist to become a Benedictine monk at Bec Abbey in Normandy, France. As a monk, he devoted his life to prayer, study, and service within the monastic community, exemplifying the principles and values of the Catholic Church. Lanfranc's intellectual abilities led to his appointment as the prior of Bec Abbey. In this role, he was responsible for the monastery's day-to-day administration and spiritual well-being of the monks under his care. As a prior, he also collaborated closely with the abbot, thus participating in the broader affairs of the Church. His effective leadership as a prior led to his appointment as the abbot of St Stephen in Caen, Normandy. Here, Lanfranc continued to be an influential figure within the Catholic Church, responsible for overseeing the spiritual and administrative matters of the Abbey. He implemented several reforms in the monastic community, emphasizing discipline and spiritual rigor that eventually helped in shaping Church practices over the years. Lanfranc's reputation as a wise and capable ecclesiastical leader reached England, where William the Conqueror appointed him the Archbishop of Canterbury after the Norman Conquest. In this role, Lanfranc held the highest ecclesiastical position in England, making him a key figure in the Catholic Church and a direct representative of the Pope. He enacted numerous reforms within the English Church, in both administrative and spiritual matters, aligning it more closely with the Roman Catholic practices and traditions. As archbishop, Lanfranc also participated in several Church councils and synods, both in England and the broader European context, addressing various aspects of ecclesiastical governance and doctrine. He contributed significantly to the Church's intellectual life by engaging in theological debates, notably in defense of the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Eucharist against Berengar of Tours' teachings. In summary, the relationship between Lanfranc and the Catholic Church was one of devotion, service, and leadership across a range of ecclesiastical roles - from a Benedictine monk to the Archbishop of Canterbury. His intellectual, administrative, and spiritual contributions had a profound and lasting impact on the Church's development and practices during the 11th century and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen.

These computers connected well.","output":"The word \\"connect\\" is used in both sentences, but it is employed in slightly different ways in each of them. Let's analyze the usage of \\"connect\\" in both contexts to understand these differences. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Operator, could you connect me to the Raffles in Singapore?\\", the word \\"connect\\" is used as a verb in the context of establishing a communication link, in this case, a phone call. Here, the speaker is asking the operator to establish a connection between their phone line and the phone line of the Raffles in Singapore. Essentially, it is about creating a direct or indirect link between two parties so that they can communicate with each other. 2. In the second sentence, \\"These computers connected well.\\", the word \\"connect\\" is also used as a verb and signifies that two or more computers were linked together successfully, presumably in a network or through other methods of computer communication. This might imply that the computers are sharing data, applications, or resources, and they can efficiently communicate or interact with one another. In conclusion, while the overall meaning of the word \\"connect\\" remains constant - that is, to establish a link or a communicative channel between two or more entities - the specific context differs in these two sentences. The first instance is about building a communication line for a phone call between two parties, while the second one refers to the successful linking of computers, likely in a network or similar platform, enabling data and resource sharing.

Teacher:In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question.

Can we draw the following conclusion? East Oakland is the good part of Oakland.  Available choices:  1). Yes  2). It's impossible to say  3). No","output":"2). It's impossible to say Elmhurst, as a part of East Oakland, is only one neighborhood within the larger area of East Oakland. Drawing a conclusion about the overall goodness of East Oakland as a whole based on Elmhurst alone is impossible. Oakland is a diverse city with various neighborhoods, each having its unique qualities, strengths, and challenges. East Oakland itself is quite diverse, with some areas experiencing more crime and poverty than others. While Elmhurst is a residential neighborhood, and the Eastmont Town Center is a key commercial area within it, there are other neighborhoods in East Oakland, each with their own character, resources, and challenges. The perception of what constitutes a \\"good\\" part of a city is often subjective and can depend on various factors such as safety, accessibility, affordability, and the availability of amenities and resources such as schools, parks, and public transportation. It is important to evaluate the overall qualities of the city as a whole to form a holistic understanding, as opposed to generalizing based on a single neighborhood or section. In summary, the conclusion that East Oakland is the good part of Oakland cannot be drawn from the information provided about the Elmhurst neighborhood alone. Further research and understanding of the various aspects of East Oakland, as well as people's experiences living and working there, would be necessary to form a well-rounded and accurate opinion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which county is using a unit mesured with millimeter, Germany or United States?  John is a world traveler. Recently, he visited two countries, France and Germany. He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other.  Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm.

The complete sentence would be: Cynthia decided to hire Sarah to create a new logo for her company because Cynthia needed a professional designer. This sentence implies that Cynthia recognized the need for a professional touch for her company's logo. By looking at the available options, she decided that Sarah would be the best candidate for the job. This choice could have been based on a number of factors, such as Sarah's experience, portfolio, or her reputation in the industry. In contrast, choice [b].

It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.  - The Garigliano is a river in central Italy . It forms at the confluence of the rivers Gari ( also known as the Rapido ) and Liri . Garigliano is actually a deformation of \`\` Gari - Lirano '' ( which in Italian means something like \`\` Gari from the Liri '' ) . In ancient times the whole course of the Liri and Gagliano was known as the Liris . For the most part of its 40 km ( 25 mi ) length , the Garigliano River marks the border between the Italian regions of Lazio and Campania . In medieval times , the river ( then known as the Verde ) marked the southern border of the Papal States .  - A boot is a type of footwear and a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality  protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking)  and for reasons of style and fashion.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - The Liri (Latin Liris or Lyris, previously, Clanis; Greek: ) is one of the principal rivers of central Italy, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea a little below Minturno under the name Garigliano.   - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile.  - San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains.

The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.  - The Tyrrhenian Sea (, , , ) is part of the Mediterranean Sea off the western coast of Italy. It is named for the Tyrrhenian people, identified since the 6th century BCE with the Etruscans of Italy.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".

Article: Scarlett Johansson has been the subject of intense scrutiny since she became a brand ambassador for SodaStream, a company that has drawn criticism for operating a factory in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank.      In a statement released exclusively to The Huffington Post, Johansson says she \\"never intended on being the face of any social or political movement, distinction, separation or stance as part of my affiliation with SodaStream,\\" but wants to \\"clear the air.\\"      \\"I remain a supporter of economic cooperation and social interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine,\\" the actress said. \\"SodaStream is a company that is not only committed to the environment but to building a bridge to peace between Israel and Palestine, supporting neighbors working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights. That is what is happening in their Ma’ale Adumim factory every working day.\\"      Oxfam International, which Johansson also promotes, had earlier criticized the actress over the SodaStream deal. \\"Oxfam respects the independence of our ambassadors,\\" a statement on the organization's website reads. \\"However Oxfam believes that businesses that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.\\"      In her own statement, Johansson made direct reference to Oxfam.      \\"As part of my efforts as an Ambassador for Oxfam, I have witnessed first-hand that progress is made when communities join together and work alongside one another and feel proud of the outcome of that work in the quality of their product and work environment, in the pay they bring home to their families and in the benefits they equally receive,\\" Johansson said. \\"I believe in conscious consumerism and transparency and I trust that the consumer will make their own educated choice that is right for them. I stand behind the SodaStream product and am proud of the work that I have accomplished at Oxfam as an Ambassador for over 8 years. Even though it is a side effect of representing SodaStream, I am happy that light is being shed on this issue in hopes that a greater number of voices will contribute to the conversation of a peaceful two state solution in the near future.\\"      A representative for Oxfam told the New York Times that the organization has not asked Johansson to abandon her relationship with SodaStream. Susan Sarandon has previously promoted the product.      SodaStream, which offers products that allow users to carbonate beverages at home, has said its West Bank factory employs 550 Palestinians who are afforded the same benefits as Israeli workers. The company has 25 factories around the world, and has released videos illustrating its claims that the West Bank factory operates in equitable conditions. An unnamed Palestinian worker disputed the claim that workers at the plant are treated well in a report published by The Electronic Intifada.

To do this, subtract 284 from both sides of the equation. -886 - 284 = -117*v + 284 - 284 Simplify: -1170 = -117*v Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable (-117). -1170 / -117 = (-117*v) / -117 Step 3: Simplify the expression. 10 = v So the solution to the equation -886 = -117*v + 284 for v is v = 10."},{"instruction":"Facts:   - name: priyanka chopra      - image: priyanka chopra 2014.jpg    - awards: full list   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of priyanka chopra .

The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.

The plan is for the imposter to masquerade as Napoleon until the Emperor has time to reach Paris, and then for the imposter to declare his role as imposter, so that the real Napoleon can announce his return to Paris. The people of France will then flock to their leader and rise in glory under Napoleon once again.The trouble is, the imposter quickly warms to the role, privileges, and fine life of an exiled Emperor. He refuses to reveal his true identity, and when one of Napoleon's generals in exile with him tries to turn the imposter in, the imposter has the general sent away, as having lost his mind in the isolation of St. Helena.

Solve this math problem Solve 2 = 14*d + 8 + 8 for d.","output":"To solve the given equation 2 = 14*d + 8 + 8 for d, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining the like terms. In this case, we have two constants, 8 and 8, that we can combine: 2 = 14*d + (8+8) Simplify the constants: 2 = 14*d + 16 Step 2: Solve for d by isolating the term with the variable (14*d). To do this, we need to get rid of the constant on the right side of the equation. We can subtract 16 from both sides: 2 - 16 = 14*d - 16 + 16 Simplify the left side: -14 = 14*d Step 3: Now we need to isolate d. To do this, we'll divide both sides by the coefficient of d, which is 14. (-14) / 14 = (14*d) / 14 Simplify the left side: -1 = d The value of d in the given equation is -1.

Article: Teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence, a Cardiff University study has found. A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents  who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders  rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \\"teachable moment\\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night.

Kenneth works in his whimsical factory, along with his children Leslie, and Alsatia.In recent months, Kennth has grown deathly ill, and sends for his Militaristic brother, General Leland Zevo. Upon meeting his brother, Kenneth explains that he wants Leland to take control of Zevo Toys once he dies. This strikes Leland as a very strange request, since he is not at all like his brother, and is more concerned with the 'rank and file' of his former glory days.Eventually, Kenneth dies, and Leland is still not sure what to do. He goes to consult with their father, a bed-ridden, retired 4-star general. But even this doesn't lead to any answers. Leland finally decides to fulfill his brother's request, but even with Leslie and Alsatia welcoming him to the factory and trying to get him acclimated, Leland seems largely like a 'fish out of water,' not seeing the humor or fun in the factory's workings.During a board meeting, word of industrial espionage rouses his attention. Consulting with Kenneth's former advisor, Owen Owens, Leland decides to implement some changes.At a formal dinner at Leslie and Alsatia's home, they are introduced to Leland's son, Patrick, a master of camouflage. Leland takes the opportunity to explain to everyone about his upcoming plans. Patrick is being implemented to step-up security measures to prevent future information leaks, and Leland also plans to start a new line of 'war toys,' a concept that has never been introduced in the factory.Some months pass, and a major security detail is now in place, with the once happy workers now rather dour. Leland has grown upset that the design teams are not fulfilling his vision for a war toys line, and berates them, much to Leslie's displeasure. While passing by the copy room, Leslie meets Gwen Tyler (Robin Wright), who he soon strikes up a conversation with, and finds her to have a rather intriguing personality....

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \\"fugitive\\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \\"Grand Tunes\\", Cavaradossi's \\"Recondita armonia\\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \\"fugitive\\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation.

Summarize the following: Use a pencil and sketch your lines in lightly so you’re able to erase them easily. Make the circle in the center of the page, leaving room on each side of it so you have space to add more features. The circle doesn’t need to be perfectly round, but you may use a compass to help you draw your lines if you want.  The drawing of the dragon head will be in profile view when you’re finished. If you plan on adding the rest of the dragon’s body to your drawing, then make sure the circle is small enough so you can fit the body on your sheet of paper. If you want your dragon to have a longer face, then make a horizontal oval instead of a circle. Choose either the left or right side of the circle depending on which way you want the dragon head to face. Draw the top horizontal line of the snout coming from the top of the circle so it’s the same length as the circle’s diameter. Make another horizontal line coming from the bottom of the circle to make the bottom of the snout. Connect the 2 lines so the corners are rounded.  You can make the snout longer or shorter depending on how you want the dragon to look. Don’t leave sharp corners on the end of the snout or else your dragon won’t look natural. Start one of the lines where the bottom of the snout connects to the head. Make a curved line coming down from the head as long as you want it. Then draw another curved line that’s parallel to the first one on the opposite side of the head. The dragon’s neck usually gets wider closer to its body, so you can make the lines get further apart near the bottom if you want to. Start drawing the mouth in the middle of the trapezoid’s narrow end. Extend the line horizontally so it ends near the middle of the dragon’s head. Curve the end of the mouth up if you want your dragon to look like it’s smiling, or angle it down if you want it to frown. Put a parallel line underneath the mouth if you want it to look like your dragon has a bottom lip. You can either add teeth that point up or down along your dragon’s mouth. Choose anywhere along the mouth and draw a triangle that points up or down starting from the mouth line. Add 5-6 separate teeth in your dragon’s mouth so it looks more fearsome.  Don’t line the entire mouth with teeth or else your drawing may start to look messy. You can have teeth pointing both up and down. Place the eye next to where the top of the snout connects to the side of the circle. If you want your dragon to look more realistic, draw a small circle for the eye so there’s a small gap between it and the top of the snout. For a dragon that looks angrier, add a horizontal triangle so the point faces the snout.  Don’t make the eye too large or else you won’t have room to add other features. Search for pictures of other reptiles to see what their eyes look like so you can use them as a reference. Dragons don’t have smooth skin, so their heads will look bumpy and knobby from their scales. Use the outlines you currently have as guides and go over them to add curves to the snout. Use wavy or zig-zag lines going from the end of the snout toward the back of its head.  For example, you may add a large bump above the dragon’s eye if you want to give it a prominent brow. You can add as many or as few bumps and ridges to the dragon depending on how you want it to look. If you want to add horns to your dragon, make a vertical line extending out from the top of the dragon’s head. Extend the line out so it’s about the same length as the snout. Add another line that starts on the back side of the dragon’s head and connects to the end of the first line to complete the horn.  Make the horn shorter if you want to make it seem like your dragon is younger. You can make the horns any shape you want. Look up horns on real animals to get influences for what you can include on your dragon. You may also choose to add horns or spikes running down the back of the dragon’s neck if you want to. Go over your drawing with an eraser and get rid of any lines that aren’t still a part of your dragon. For example, you may erase the circle or the original outline of the snout if you added more bumps to it. Continue erasing any guides or mistakes you made, and blow off the shavings when you’re finished.  Darker lines will be harder to erase than lightly sketched lines. Get a clickable detail eraser if you need to erase lines in small areas. You can get special erasers from an art store or online. Once you erase the guide lines, start adding the final details into your drawing. Start with small ovals or circles for the nostrils at the end of the snout. Once you add the nostrils, draw in U-shaped lines on the sides of the dragon’s head and down its neck give the illusion of scales.  You don’t need to draw every scale on the dragon’s face since it could make your drawing look messy or unclear.  Shade your drawing with a pencil or colored pencil if you want to add more perspective or color. Summary:","output":"To draw a dragon head, sketch a circle lightly in pencil for the base. If desired, make it a horizontal oval for a longer face. Draw horizontal lines from the circle's edges to form the snout, and curve the corners. Add a curved line for the neck, extending from the bottom of the snout. Draw the dragon's mouth in the middle of the snout's narrow end, with optional teeth. Add a small circular eye near the top of the snout. Create texture with wavy lines and scales on the dragon's head. Add horns or spikes if desired and use references from real animals for inspiration. Erase unnecessary lines and add final details such as nostrils and scale-like lines. Shade with a pencil or colored pencil to finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.

Gaining knowledge in these areas can help you better understand the industry you will be working in, making it easier for you to represent your clients and negotiate contracts. 2. Attend law school Next, you will need to attend law school and earn a Juris Doctor (JD) degree. While in law school, make sure to focus on courses related to intellectual property, copyright, contract law, and entertainment law. These subjects will be crucial to your career as a music attorney. 3. Pass the bar exam After completing law school, you must pass the bar exam in your jurisdiction to become a licensed attorney. The bar exam is a comprehensive test of your legal knowledge, and passing it is required to practice law in the United States. 4. Gain experience in the music industry While not mandatory, any experience in the music industry can be beneficial to a music attorney. This can be anything from working in a recording studio to managing a band or working as an intern at a record label. Gaining industry-specific knowledge and contacts will help you develop a deeper understanding of the business you will be representing. This will, in turn, make you a more attractive candidate for clients. 5. Develop a network of music industry professionals Networking is a vital skill for a successful career as a music attorney. Attend conferences, join organizations, and take part in industry events to build relationships with other professionals in the music business. Connecting with musicians, agents, managers, record label executives, and others will not only help you learn more about the industry but also provide opportunities for new clients. 6. Secure a job at a law firm or as an in-house attorney To begin your career as a music attorney, look for positions at law firms with a focus on entertainment or intellectual property law.

Such organizations also often offer workshops, seminars, and various events where you can continue your education and foster connections with other professionals in your field. 10. Specialize in a niche area As your career as a music attorney progresses, consider specializing in a specific aspect of the industry, such as music publishing or live events. Developing expertise in a niche area will differentiate you from other attorneys and make you more attractive to potential clients. By following these steps and dedicating yourself to the field, you can establish a successful career as a music attorney.

The individual's injuries stemmed from the ongoing unrest between protesters and law enforcement in the region. Upon sustaining injuries during the protest, the individual was rushed to the hospital where medical professionals promptly provided aid. The swift and efficient treatment allowed for the protester's recovery and subsequent return to their home. While in the hospital, the protester received support and encouragement from fellow demonstrators and well-wishers. Over time, their condition improved significantly, and doctors eventually deemed that they were fit to be discharged. Upon being cleared by medical professionals, the protester expressed their gratitude to the healthcare team and those who supported them during their recovery period. As the pro-democracy demonstrations continue in the Hong Kong Islands, the situation remains tense between authorities and citizens advocating for their rights. Despite the ongoing conflict, moments of hope and unity like this serve as a reminder of the powerful resilience displayed by protesters and their supporters. The return of the injured protester to their home marks an end to their personal struggle, but also highlights the ongoing battles faced by others who remain caught in the midst of the unrest. Situations like these continue to draw attention to the conflict and the need for a peaceful resolution on the Hong Kong Islands. In summary, the Hong Kong Islands protester's recovery and subsequent return home signifies both personal victory and a broader call for unity, support, and the promotion of social justice. As long as the unrest persists, the people of Hong Kong will continue to seek understanding and hope for a brighter future."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: -  Prophase, the chromosomes become visible - Centrioles separate to move to opposite poles - Metaphase, the chromosomes line up in the center - Anaphase, the chromatids separate - Are pulled apart - Telophase, the chromosomes gather at opposite poles - Two new nuclear membranes form - The cell membranes pinch","output":"The final step of the process is cytokinesis, which is when the cytoplasm of the cell divides, resulting in two separate daughter cells."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gifts should show that you care and that you specifically care for her. You don't want to give a gift that could be just as nice for your ex-girlfriend or your sister. Give a gift that is significant to her. Try giving her something in her favorite color, something she said she wanted or needed, or (best of all) something that reminds you of significant moments that you've had together or inside jokes that you share. If she calls or texts you and mentions that her day is not going very well, bring her some flowers on your lunch break or when you get home. If she tells you at the end of the day, have the flowers sent to her first thing in the morning with a note like \\"I hope these help today go better than yesterday.\\" Bonus points if the flowers are unique, such as giving her a tiny Christmas tree during a tough holiday season or a \\"bouquet\\" of stuffed kittens. Leave her a series of notes, each one telling her something you love about her and a clue to the next location. End the scavenger hunt with dinner and a gift. Use your creative skills to make something for her. It doesn't have to be fancy or perfect. It just has to show that you think she's worth the time and effort. You can make her a card on nice paper, make her a necklace pendant, or make hr a sculpture for her desk (check your local art store for polymer clay). When you've had a hard day, the last thing you want to do is add insult to injury by having to slave over the stove for half an hour, right? When you know she's stressed (or even when she isn't), help her out by cooking her a nice dinner. Write her letters as often as you can manage. You don't even have to talk about anything interesting, but it is a very useful time to talk about your feelings. This vintage touch will show her just how much you care, and charm your way into her heart. Make a cd/tape/USB stick with songs that are significant to your relationship or remind you of her. Try to tell the story of your love (how you felt before you had her in your life, how you met her, what you first thought, etc) through the songs that you choose. Women, like anyone, want to feel useful. They want to feel like they serve a purpose, especially to people that they care about. Let her be and feel useful by asking her for advice about problems that you have in your life. Importantly, you should take her advice and let her see that you've taken her advice. Know her for who she really is, not just who you want her to be or the face that she puts on for everyday life. Talk to her about things that matter and find ways to show her that you get her. For example, buy tickets to a play that you don't care about but that you know she really wants to see.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After seeing this film months ago, it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and I feel I must buy it or at least see it again, even though I watched it at least 3 times when I rented it at that point. I fell in love with Hal Hartley's directing many years ago - I found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained. It is a strange feeling, granted, and I assume most people out there really just don't get it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I guess I just really get it - its as if these films were made for me. Although I don't remember if I actually laughed out loud during this film, it remains one of the funniest films I've seen in many years. If you don't see the humor of the grocery bag Fay carries from the street to a church, to her brother's publisher's office, to her son's principal's office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film. The bag is a silent character in itself, being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash, bitchy Parker Posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her. I consider \\"Henry Fool\\" my least favorite of Hartley's films. I honestly don't remember it very well - I think the character himself was so despicable I found it tedious. Hartley's forte seems to be feminine character development. Aside from Posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. Her extravagant naiveté is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout. This film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story, explaining political situations in Afganistan. This is never suspected at the beginning. The complexity of this film's development is unparalleled. This is the epitome of a \\"stand alone\\" sequel. The less you know about Henry Fool the more mystery is spun around him, the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-smoking complaint machine, hurling insults at his Islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him. Its like finding out Santa Claus is actually a 12-year-old schoolyard bully. Although I was impressed and satisfied with Hartley's other recent films \\"the Girl from Monday\\" and \\"No Such Thing\\", \\"Fay Grim\\" goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality no Oscar winner would ever dare.

Article: Hello, I'm Severn Suzuki speaking for E.C.O.--The Environmental Children's Organization. We are a group of twelve and thirteen-year-olds from Canada trying to make a difference. Vanessa Suttie, Morgan Geisler, Michelle Quigg and me. We raised all the money ourselves to come six thousand miles to tell you adults you must change your ways. Coming here today, I have no hidden agenda. I am fighting for my future. I am here to speak on behalf of the starving   children around the world whose cries go unheard. I am here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet because they have nowhere left to go. I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in the ozone  . I am afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals   are in it. I used to go fishing in Vancouver with my dad until just a few years ago we found the fish full of cancers. And now we hear about animals and plants going _ every day. In my life, I have dreamt of seeing the great herds of wild animals, jungles and rainforests full of birds and butterflies, but now I wonder if they will even exist   for my children to see. Did you have to worry about these little things when you were my age? All this is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions  .

Options: A: bored B: sleepy C: impatient D: worried Answer:","output":"When giving this speech, Severn Suzuki probably felt D: worried. The content and tone of Severn Suzuki's speech indicate a sense of concern and urgency. As a representative of the Environmental Children's Organization, she is addressing serious global issues that affect not only her generation but future generations as well. Suzuki discusses various environmental problems, such as the holes in the ozone layer, air pollution, and the extinction of animals and plants. She emphasizes the need for immediate action and change, stating that she is \\"fighting for her future.\\" Throughout the speech, Suzuki highlights the potential consequences of inaction, such as the loss of wild animals, jungles, and rainforests. She questions whether these natural wonders will even exist for her children to see, expressing a deep concern for the disappearing biodiversity of our planet. Moreover, Suzuki emphasizes her own fear when she mentions being afraid to go out in the sun and breathe the air, both due to environmental hazards. She also touches upon the fact that she is a child, and though she may not have all the solutions, she wants adults to acknowledge that they don't either. This statement implies that there is a need for people to come together, irrespective of age, and work towards finding solutions to environmental issues. Given the content, context, and tone of her speech, it is evident that Severn Suzuki most likely felt worried when delivering it. She expressed her fear and concerns for the future of our planet and urged adults to recognize the urgency of the situation and to take appropriate action to protect the environment for current and future generations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What did Demetrius do after negotiating with Ptolemy and Athens?\\"  Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls.

Here's how we do it step by step: 1. Create a 2D array with dimensions (len(A) + 1) by (len(B) + 1) to keep track of the LCS length from the initial elements to the corresponding indices. 2. Iterate through both lists and compare each element of A to each element of B. If they are the same, set the value of the current cell in the 2D array to the value of the top-left diagonal cell incremented by 1. If they are different, set the value of the current cell to the maximum of the cell above and the cell to the left. 3. The value in the bottom-right cell of the 2D array represents the length of the LCS. 4. Trace back from the bottom-right cell of the 2D array to the first row or column by following a path of the maximum values. The elements in the path make the LCS. Here's the Python code: \`\`\`python def longest_common_subsequence(A, B):     m = len(A)     n = len(B)     # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of LCS     dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]     # Fill up the 2D array     for i in range(1, m + 1):         for j in range(1, n + 1):             if A[i - 1] == B[j - 1]:                  # Same elements found                 dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1             else:                 dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])          # Traceback the path to construct the LCS     result = []     i, j = m, n     while i > 0 and j > 0:         if A[i - 1] == B[j - 1]:             result.append(A[i - 1])             i -= 1             j -= 1         elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:             i -= 1         else:             j -= 1     return list(reversed(result)) A = ['r', 'U', 'a', 'b', 'O', 2089] B = [8117, 'Y', 'a', 'b', 'T', 7817] print(longest_common_subsequence(A, B)) \`\`\` This will output: \`['a', 'b']\`  So the longest common subsequence in lists A and B is ['a', 'b']."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Your job is to classify the command into one of these seven categories: (1) majority, (2) unique, (3) superlative, (4) count, (5) comparative, (6) aggregation, and (7) ordinal.   Here are the defications of each category:   1. majority: Describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   2. unique: Describing one unique row, regarding one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   3. Superlative: Describing the maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   4. Ordinal: Describing the n-th maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   5. Comparative: Comparing two rows in the table, regarding their values in one column   6. Count: counting some rows in the table based on the values in one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows   7. Aggregation: Describing the sum or average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows.   Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command:   1. count: returns the number of rows in the view.   2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view.   3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row.   4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments.   5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column.   6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column.   7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column.   8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column.   9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal.   10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance.   11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.   12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.   13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument.   14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument.   15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument.   16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table   17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.   20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.

We are given a command with logical operations, and we have to classify the command into one of the seven given categories. The command is: eq { count { filter_all { all_rows ; driver } } ; 10 } Let's break this down step by step: 1. filter_all { all_rows ; driver }: This basically means we are selecting the whole table and focusing on the \\"driver\\" column. 2. count { filter_all { all_rows; driver }}: We are counting the number of rows after filtering, which in this case would be the total number of rows in the table since we didn't apply any filter conditions. 3. eq { count { filter_all { all_rows ; driver } } ; 10 }: We are checking if the count of rows equals 10. This command is checking if the number of rows in the table is equal to 10. Based on the provided definitions, it fits in the \\"Count\\" classification (category 6) as it is counting the rows in the table based on a specific column (\\"driver\\") and the scope is set to all table rows without any condition-based filtering.

Problem: Solve -88*v - 833*v = -22104 for v. And the answer is...","output":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this problem together, step by step! We have the equation: -88*v - 833*v = -22104 First, we need to simplify the left side of the equation, which has '-88*v' and '-833*v'. When we combine these two parts, we are actually adding the numbers -88 and -833 but keeping the 'v' part the same. So, -88 - 833 = -921 and the left side becomes, -921*v. Now, our equation looks like this: -921*v = -22104 To find the value of 'v', we need to 'untangle' it from the -921. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -921. So, the equation becomes: v = -22104 / -921 When we divide -22104 by -921, we get the answer: 24 So the answer is, v = 24! Great job, little buddy! We found that v is equal to 24!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

It is a treasure trove of letters, notebooks, post cards and papers charting the life of one of the world's greatest ever scientists. A mammoth collection of 5,000 searchable documents from Albert Einstein's earlier years is being made freely available to the public on the internet. The archive ranges from charming letters to his future wife Mileva Marić after the birth of their first child to his battle to come to terms with fame and his stance as a pacifist in the wake of the First World War. Scroll down for video. An online collection of 5,000 Albert Einstein documents includes letters to his future wife Mileva Marić. The pair are pictured together. But it also highlights his prolific output as a physicist as well as lecture notes, extensive workings and a a telegram informing him he had won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for the photoelectric effect. It includes documents about his most famous equation E=mc2, which said that the energy 'stored' in objects is equal to their mass multiplied by the speed of light squared. The transcribed and translated Digital Einstein Papers take readers on a journey through the life of the genius from 1879 to 1923, when he turned 44 - and anyone with an internet connection can now browse through the archive. It includes letters from a 22-year-old Einstein to his former classmate Marić, sent to her from Berne in Switzerland, in February 1902. It reveals his joy at learning of the birth of his daughter. Writing to his 'beloved sweetheart', he asks of baby Lieserl: 'Is she healthy and does she already cry properly? What kind of little eyes does she have? Whom of us two does she resemble more? Who is giving her milk? Is she hungry? And so she is completely bald. I love her so much and I don't even know her yet! 'Couldn't she be photographed once you are totally healthy again? Will she soon be able to turn her eyes toward something?' The archive includes love letters Einstein (right) wrote to Elsa Löwenthal (left). The pair married after his first wife granted a divorce. In 1903, he wrote to his friend Michele Besso that he was living a 'very pleasant, cozy life with my wife'. 'She takes excellent care of everything, cooks well, and is always cheerful,' he wrote. The pair would go on to have two sons but Einstein later began an affair with his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal. In one letter to her on May 7 1912, he writes: 'Both of us are poor devils, each shackled to his unrelenting duties. I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you, and how much I would like to be something to you. 'But if we give in to our affection for each other, only confusion and misfortune will result. You know this only too well. He continues: 'I love you. I would be happy if I were allowed to walk a few steps at your side even if only from time to time, or if I could otherwise rejoice in being close to you.' He later married Löwenthal, who had children of her own, after Marić granted a divorce. In other letters Einstein describes how fame was affecting his personal life, writing that 'The postman is my archenemy, I cannot shake myself loose from his slavery' The transcribed and translated collection shows how Einstein was a prolific writer of letters and postcards. Pictured above is a post card, from a separate archive, that he once wrote to his wife Elsa. In other letters he describes how fame was affecting his personal life, writing that 'The postman is my archenemy, I cannot shake myself loose from his slavery'. And the scientist, who died at the age of 76, sets out his pacifist stance following the horrors of the First World War writing to hi friend Carl Herman Unthan: 'I must admit that it always pains me when the few little blossoms that grew in my flowerbed must suffer by being used to decorate the banner of nationalism. Revealing his excitement about the birth of his first child in 1902, he wrote to Mileva Marić:. ‘I love her so much and I don’t even know her yet! Couldn’t she be photographed once you are totally healthy again? In a 1912 love letter to Elsa Lowenthal, the woman he was having an affair with, he wrote:. ‘Both of us are poor devils, each shackled to his unrelenting duties. I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you, and how much I would like to be something to you. Explaining his hopes for peace after the First World War in a letter in April 1920, he said:. ‘I am a pacifist and, in these times of hate, am steadily intent on encouraging reconciliation’ 'For I am a pacifist and, in these times of hate, am steadily intent on encouraging reconciliation.' Having documented the first 44 years of his life, the team behind the project plans to add more volumes to the archive as they are compiled and printed. The 14th volume, with more than 1,000 documents, is set to be released in January and will be digitised at a later date. The website is a collaboration involving the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Princeton University Press and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It includes both the German originals and the English translations. Diana Kormos-Buchwald, director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech is quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying: 'This is an ongoing project. We have reached his 44th birthday.

Article: Tracy Caulkins is known as the first American to set an American record and win an American title in each of four swimming strokes : breaststroke, butterfly, backstroke, freestyle. Tracy Caulkins was born in Minnesota and lived in Iowa until she was six. She began swimming when she was eight, after the family had moved to Nashville, Tennessee. While unwilling at first to swim in cold water or get her face wet, she began to train in earnest   as her talent became clear. Though her father worked for the public schools, the family sent her to a private school when the public schools could not accommodate   her training schedule. At age 13, Tracy Caulkins took part in the trials  for the 1976 Olympics, but did not make the team. She continued to win national and international titles, and was disappointed in 1980 when the U.S. didn't attend the Moscow Olympics. She continued to train and compete. In 1981, Tracy Caulkins began college, graduating in 1985. In college, she continued competing and training, though she had slowed down from her peak   years. Caulkins trained especially hard for the 1984 Olympics, and not only made the team, but was captain of the swim team and at Los Angeles, won three gold medals and was named Sportswoman of the Year by the U.S. Olympic Committee. After that she retired from swimming, and was a commentator   for swimming events as well as taking advantage of her fame to do business. Tracy Caulkins married Australian swimmer, Mark Stockwell, in 1991, their romance having begun at the 1984 Olympics when he jumped into a warm-up pool to introduce himself. They married in Nashville and moved to Australia, where they had three children. Caulkins continued to be professionally involved in sports. Question: When was Tracy Caulkins born?

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order p, a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups Zp. Groups of order p2 can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order p3, as the non-abelian group D4 of order 8 = 23 above shows.

Families of theater shooting victims plan goodbyes While suspect James Holmes sits in a solitary confinement cell, the families and survivors of the Colorado theater massacre are beginning the heartbreaking task of planning funerals and trying to repair their lives. The city of Aurora has been the focus of the nation since Holmes allegedly went on a shooting rampage in a Cineplex there, killing 12 and injuring 58 at a midnight showing of the latest Batman movie early Friday. Thousands gathered for a memorial vigil for the dead. Denver Broncos players visited victims in the hospital. United Airlines has offered families of the deceased free roundtrip tickets to Denver. Now the string of memorial services and funerals begins. Some of those killed in the shootings will be buried back in their hometowns. Jessica Ghawi, 24, a blogger and aspiring sportscaster, will be buried Saturday in San Antonio. Her brother, Jordan, has been blogging constantly since the shootings. According to his blog, Jessica will be cremated in Denver and the family will fly her remains back home. A full military funeral and burial is planned for Aug. 3 in Reno for Jonathan Blunk, 26, who served three tours in the Middle East and planned to re-enlist with the goal of becoming a Navy SEAL. Blunk, a father of two, died after shielding his girlfriend from bullets by lying on top of her. Visitation for Matt McQuinn, 27, is scheduled for Friday at Maiden Lane Church of God in Springfield, Ohio. The funeral is set for Saturday morning. McQuinn will be buried at Lawrenceville Cemetery in Clark County. McQuinn went to the movie with his girlfriend and was hit by bullets in the chest and leg. He grew up in the suburbs of Dayton, Ohio, and moved from Ohio to the Denver area in September. Funeral services for Rebecca Wingo, a 32-year-old mother and veteran of the Air Force, will be held Friday in Colorado, according to KHON-TV in Honolulu. Alex Teves, 24, who dove to protect his girlfriend in the shooting, was born in New Jersey and later moved to Arizona where he graduated from high school. His family is planning to have memorial services in Phoenix and New Jersey, The (Newark) Star-Ledger reported. At least three services have been planned in Aurora. One of the first will be for Micayla Medek, 23, on Wednesday at the Newcomer Funeral Home & Crematory. Two days later Alexander \\"A.J.\\" Boik, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate, will be remembered. The family has asked that news media stay away from the service. Gordon Cowden, 51, the oldest person to be killed in the shooting, will be buried later this week with services at the Colorado Community Church in Aurora, according to the Denver Post. \\"This is a national event which may be helpful for (the families) because it's a shared experience,\\" said George Bonanno, professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University. \\"It was an event that a lot of people recognized and shared with them. They are part of the community that cares. … It's going to be hard as the dust settles and everyone goes back to their business.\\" Columbine students who survived what in 1999 was the worst school massacre in U.S. history are reaching out to help those who witnessed and survived the attack in Aurora. \\"Similar to the graduating senior class from Columbine, they may soon find themselves surrounded by people who have no clue that they were involved in a traumatic event,\\" Columbine survivor Ben Lausten wrote on a Facebook page for survivors of school shootings. \\"These victims have a challenging path ahead of them,\\" he said. Holmes is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, and he could face additional counts of aggravated assault and weapons violations. He won't be formally charged until next Monday. Police expect months of working with behavioral analysts and scrutinizing Holmes' relationships to establish a motive. As for a trial, that could take more than a year, said prosecutor Carol Chambers. She said her office is considering the death penalty, but that a decision will be made in consultation with the victims' families. David Sanchez said that would be the appropriate punishment if Holmes is convicted. His pregnant daughter escaped without injury but her husband remains in critical condition with a shotgun wound to the head. Sanchez's daughter, Katie Medley, 21, delivered Hugo Jackson Medley at 7:11 a.m. local time Tuesday. The University of Colorado hospital in Aurora says both the mother and baby are doing great. \\"When it's your own daughter and she escaped death by mere seconds, I want to say it makes you angry,\\" Sanchez said.

One way to learn multiplication with ease is to recognize specific rules and patterns in the multiplication tables, which can save you time and effort in solving various problems. In this article, we will be discussing some of these fundamental multiplication rules that can simplify your understanding and enhance your math skills. Rule 1: Multiplication by 0 Recall that any number multiplied by 0 will always be 0. This rule applies to any integer, fraction or decimal you come across. No matter how large or small the number, the result remains the same: zero. This rule can be directly attributed to the mathematical definition of multiplication, which states that multiplying a number is equivalent to adding it a specific number of times. For example: 3 x 0 = 0 -7 x 0 = 0 1000 x 0 = 0 Rule 2: Multiplication by 1 Just as with the rule of 0, there is a similar rule for the multiplication of any number by 1. When a number is multiplied by 1, it will remain unchanged, resulting in the original number. This rule is known as the identity property of multiplication. For example: 3 x 1 = 3 -7 x 1 = -7 1000 x 1 = 1000 Rule 3: The 2 Table When multiplying any number by 2, the result is equal to adding the number to itself. This rule is an effortless way to calculate products in the 2 table and quickly solve problems involving multiplication by 2. For example: 3 x 2 = 3 + 3 = 6 -7 x 2 = -7 - 7 = -14 1000 x 2 = 1000 + 1000 = 2000 Rule 4: The 5 Table The remarkable pattern in the 5 table can make it simple to multiply numbers by 5. Whenever a number is multiplied by 5, the result will always end with either a 0 or a 5. For example: 3 x 5 = 15 6 x 5 = 30 9 x 5 = 45 Rule 5: The 6 Table Pattern with Even Numbers In the 6 table, there is a peculiar pattern when multiplying even numbers. When you multiply an even number by 6, the final digit of the product will be the same as the original even number. Utilizing this rule can be advantageous in speeding up calculations involving multiplication by 6. For example: 2 x 6 = 12 4 x 6 = 24 6 x 6 = 36 Rule 6: The 9 Multiplication Facts When multiplying a number by 9, the most straightforward method to find the product is to multiply the original number by 10 and then subtract the original number from the resulting product. This technique enables you to quickly solve multiplication problems involving the number 9. For example: 3 x 9 = (3 x 10) - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 6 x 9 = (6 x 10) - 6 = 60 - 6 = 54 8 x 9 = (8 x 10) - 8 = 80 - 8 = 72 Rule 7: The 11 Multiplication Facts Multiplying a single-digit number by 11 follows a specific pattern: the digit is repeated in the result. This rule applies to any single-digit number, which simplifies multiplication problems involving 11. For example: 3 x 11 = 33 5 x 11 = 55 9 x 11 = 99 Conclusion Understanding and recognizing these basic multiplication patterns make the process of multiplying numbers much more comfortable and less time-consuming. By mastering these rules, you'll be well on your way to becoming more confident in your math abilities and being able to tackle more complex problems with ease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it?

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? any puppies that can’t get food from the mother. If the mother dog has too many puppies and not enough nipples, quick action is needed. You must hand feed this puppy right away and it should be done every 2 hours. No children below the age of 12 should feed, or even hold, the puppies before their eyes have opened, as puppies can be fragile. The mother should stay in the whelping box for at least 5 days before leaving her puppies for a short while. During this time, she will either be caring for her puppies, eating, or resting. The only exception to this is if she needs to go outside to go to the bathroom. If the mother tries to leave the whelping box, coax her back to her puppies with a treat or encouragement. If the mother is doing her job, you won't have to do much care for several weeks, other than to monitor the puppies' development. Make sure that the puppies have opened their eyes at about 2 weeks of age. They should grow in size every day and movement should increase daily as well. If any of the puppies are falling behind in development, contact your veterinarian.  Use your scale to weigh the puppies every day. Make sure they are gaining weight. If there is a puppy that is not gaining at the same rate, give it some formula to help it grow in size. When a puppy opens its eyes depends on the breed of your dog and puppies, as some puppies’ eyes can open as late as 3 weeks after birth. The larger the litter, the smaller the pups will be.

And besides, he is usually too careless to plant and look after new trees. So the forests slowly disappear. This does not only mean that man will have fewer trees. The results are even more serious: for where there are trees, their roots break up soil allowing the rain to sink in and also bind the soil, thus preventing it from being washed away easily;but where there are no trees, the rain falls on hard ground and flows away, causing floods and carrying away the rich top-soil. When the top-soil is gone, nothing remains but worthless desert. Two thousand years ago,a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire .It set up the empire, but, without its trees, its soil became poor and grew weak.

Place a washer and a wing nut onto the bolt inside the bucket to tighten.. Explanation: Starting with a bolt and washer on the bottom of the saucer, will provide a more stable connection as the bolt's head, along with the washer, evenly distribute the force against the bottom of the saucer. This helps prevent the bolt from tearing through the material of the saucer when the wing nut is tightened. The other option, \\"--Place a washer and a bolt through the top of the saucer and place the bucket with the hole on top of it...\\", is not as effective because it may cause instability. With the bolt and washer placed at the top of the saucer, there is no stability at the base where the saucer meets the ground. Hence, such a structure may end up being unstable and wobble easily. Therefore, the bucket should be placed on top of the saucer after the washer and bolt are properly fixed at the bottom of the saucer.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge.  I am facing a new situation today: Jim's dad is a scientist. While his dad is out working he goes to the lab in the basement and find an electroscope. The electroscope is currently in a neutral state. He then grabs a nearby rod that is positively charged and moves it near the knob of the electroscope. Fascinated he sees the leaves of the electroscope move apart from each other.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Given the rod was negatively charged when it touched the neutral electroscope, would the electroscope have a positive or negative charge? A:","output":"In the new situation, you mentioned that Jim's dad's electroscope is initially in a neutral state and a negatively charged rod is brought near the knob. Based on the background article, when a positively charged rod is brought near a neutral electroscope, it attracts electrons from the leaves and causes them to be positively charged. However, in this new situation, the rod is negatively charged. When a negatively charged rod is brought near the neutral electroscope's knob, it will repel the electrons in the knob towards the leaves. This causes the leaves to be negatively charged (excess electrons), which results in the leaves diverging. Now, if the negatively charged rod touches the knob of the electroscope, it would transfer some of its excess electrons to the electroscope. When the negatively charged rod is removed, the electroscope will retain this additional negative charge. Thus, the electroscope would have a negative charge after being touched by the negatively charged rod."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Luzzatti was born of Jewish parents in Venice on 11 March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. He was minister of agriculture in the second Sonnino Cabinet (December 2, 1909 - March 21, 1910), and on the resignation of the latter was called upon to form a cabinet himself. His administration, which lasted until March 18, 1911, was not very successful and fell over a proposed electoral reform. Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty and wide culture, he had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular. Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, as it was then constituted, he only held office at Giolitti's good pleasure.  During the First World War, he was consistently pro-Ally and strongly supported Italian intervention, but his tone was on the whole pessimistic. Although he did not take office while the war lasted, he was always consulted on all financial matters, and his sound advice was generally followed.  He became treasury minister in the second incarnation of the Nitti cabinet (March 12 - May 10, 1920), but did not resume office in the third. At the general elections of May 1921, he decided not to stand for parliament again, and was made a senator. In spite of his advanced age, he continued to write on economic and financial problems with his accustomed lucidity and soundness of judgment, insisting on the necessity for Italy to return to free trade and to reduce government interference in business matters to a minimum. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he have any other problems while he was in office?","output":"Yes, Luzzatti had some problems while he was in office.

Question: Where would child's work be on the wall? Options: - labyrinth - china - corner - art show - classroom  The answer is \\"classroom\\" because The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Classroom\\". There are several reasons why a child's work would be on the wall in a classroom. To start, classrooms are typically the primary locations where children engage in learning activities, including various forms of artwork. The classroom serves as a foundational platform for students to express their creativity and illustrate their understanding of different subjects. When children create artwork or complete assignments in class, teachers often display the best or most noteworthy pieces on the classroom walls. This practice serves multiple purposes. For one, it recognizes and applauds students' efforts, which can help boost their self-esteem and motivation. Kids feel proud when they see their work on display, and it gives them a sense of accomplishment.  Having children's work on the classroom walls also creates a conducive learning environment. It personalizes the space, making it feel more comfortable and welcoming to the students. The display of colorful artwork and engaging projects can be visually stimulating for children, promoting their creativity and helping to make the classroom an inspiring place for learning. Additionally, displaying children's work on the classroom walls is an effective teaching strategy. It provides visual cues that can support students' learning as they can refer to these pieces of work during lessons. For example, a teacher might display a chart with sentence structures, or art pieces related to a particular course subject. Seeing peer work can also motivate other students to try harder, as a form of positive competition. Furthermore, children's work on classroom walls also serves as an assessment tool. Through observing student work, teachers can gauge a child's progress over the academic year, determine the effectiveness of teaching methods, and identify areas of improvement or where further support is needed. By comparison, the other options listed in the question don't usually serve as a place where a child's work would be displayed. A labyrinth is a complex network of pathways or passages, typically seen in puzzle games or certain architecture designs—not a common place to display child’s work. China, while a valid geographical location, is too broad and not specific enough to be considered an appropriate context for the display of child's work. A corner is merely a sectional space, not specific enough to reliably present a child’s creation.  An \\"art show\\" could potentially display a child's work, but this implies a formal event or exhibit that showcases art pieces usually from a collection of artists. While a student's artwork could indeed make its way into an art show - particularly if it's a school-hosted event or a competition - this is a less common and routine occurrence compared to the continual display of children's work in a classroom setting. Hence, as per the context of the question, the most suitable answer would certainly be \\"classroom\\". It is in classrooms where children's work is typically displayed proudly on the walls, serving a multitude of educational and motivational purposes in their learning journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Most musical instruments use resonance to amplify the sound waves and make the sounds louder. Resonance occurs when an object vibrates in response to sound waves of a certain frequency. In a musical instrument such as a guitar, the whole instrument and the air inside it may vibrate when a single string is plucked. This causes constructive interference with the sound waves, which increases their amplitude.   Q: What happens do the sound during a resonance?   Choices:  - it becomes quieter  - it dissipates  - it echoes  - amplified, it becomes louder  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"amplified, it becomes louder The paragraph states that resonance is used in musical instruments to amplify sound waves, making the sound louder.

There are three types of muscle in the human body: Skeletal, Smooth and which other????","output":"The third type of muscle tissue in the human body is Cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle, also known as myocardium, is an involuntary, highly specialized muscle tissue that is found exclusively in the heart. It has unique characteristics that set it apart from the other two types of muscle tissues, Skeletal and Smooth muscles, granting it the ability to function optimally for the heart's vital roles in circulation and regulation of blood pressure. 1. Characteristics of Cardiac Muscle: a. Striated Appearance: Similar to skeletal muscles, cardiac muscle exhibits cross-striations due to the presence of sarcomeres, the structural and functional units of myofibrils. This feature is a result of the parallel organization of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) protein filaments. b. Intercalated Discs: Unique to cardiac muscle, these specialized structures interconnect adjacent cardiomyocytes (cardiac muscle cells), allowing efficient electrical and mechanical coupling between cells. Intercalated discs are composed of three types of cell junctions - gap junctions, desmosomes, and adherens junctions. These junctions ensure synchronized contraction and prevent separation of fibers during intense contractions. c. Branched Architecture: Unlike the long, unbranched fibers of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscle fibers are short and branched, allowing them to form a functional network throughout the heart. This branching structure facilitates coordinated contractions and efficient distribution of electrical signals across the heart. d. Autorhythmicity: Cardiac muscles possess intrinsic automaticity, meaning they can generate their own electrical impulses (action potentials) without requiring external stimulation. Specialized pacemaker cells within the sinoatrial (SA) node initiate these impulses, which then spread throughout the heart, triggering contraction. e. High Mitochondrial Density: Cardiac muscles have a high density of mitochondria, the energy-generating powerhouses of the cell. This high density allows cardiac muscles to produce a large amount of energy (ATP), which is vital for continuous contraction and relaxation cycles to maintain blood circulation. 2. Functions of Cardiac Muscle: a. Pumping Blood: The primary function of cardiac muscle is to pump blood throughout the body. The contraction of the heart's atrial and ventricular walls propels blood into the circulation, ensuring the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and waste removal for every cell in the body. b. Regulating Circulation: The synchronized contractions of cardiac muscle, along with the heart's anatomical structure, help regulate the flow of blood between the pulmonary and systemic circuits. This balance allows for efficient gas exchange and the maintenance of optimal blood pressure. c. Responding to Neural and Hormonal Signals: Cardiac muscle responds to external signals from the nervous and hormonal systems to modulate its heart rate and contractility. These adjustments help maintain homeostasis in the body under various conditions, such as exercise or stress. In summary, the three types of muscle tissues in the human body are Skeletal, Smooth, and Cardiac muscles. Each plays a unique and vital role in maintaining overall bodily function. The distinguishing features of cardiac muscle, such as striated appearance, the presence of intercalated discs, branched architecture, autorhythmicity, and high mitochondrial density, enable it to perform its critical role in circulatory function and blood pressure regulation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, we'll take the 2014 percentage of Bulgarians, which is: Bulgarians: 51,867/126,010 (Gagauz) = 0.414 or 41.4% Now, let's calculate the total percentage of these four groups in 2004: Total percentage (2004) = Ukrainians (8.4%) + Russians (5.9%) + Gagauz people (4.4%) + Bulgarians (41.4%) Total percentage (2004) = 60.1% Since we have the total percentage of these four groups in 2004, we can now calculate the percentage of people who were not Gagauz: Not Gagauz (2004) = Total percentage (2004) - Gagauz people (4.4%) Not Gagauz (2004) = 60.1% - 4.4% Not Gagauz (2004) = 55.7% Therefore, approximately 55.7% of the people were not Gagauz in 2004. This calculation is based on the percentages and information of the four ethnic groups given. It's important to note that this estimation doesn't account for other ethnicities or the total population of the region, which could affect the final percentage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Flotsam and Jetsam is an American thrash metal and progressive metal band that formed in Phoenix, Arizona in 1981. The band currently consists of vocalist Eric A. Knutson, guitarists Michael Gilbert and Steve Conley, bassist Michael Spencer and drummer Ken Mary. Flotsam and Jetsam went through several lineup changes over the years, and Knutson has been the only constant member of the band. They are also notable for featuring bassist Jason Newsted, who left the band shortly after the release of their debut album to join Metallica as Cliff Burton's replacement. The live DVD Live in Japan was released in February 2006 and shows their concert in front of hundreds of screaming Japanese fans at the Citta Club in Tokyo 2004.  Doomsday for the Deceiver was re-released in November 2006 by Metal Blade Records to celebrate the album's twentieth anniversary. This set (2 CD and DVD) includes the original recording of Doomsday and a re-mixed and re-mastered(Digitized)version and also the two Flotsam and Jetsam demos. The bonus DVD includes rare live material, an interview filmed at Kelly's High School and a photo slide-show.  In Spring 2008 Metal Mind Productions remastered and re-released the albums When the Storm Comes Down, Cuatro (including 5 bonus tracks), Drift (including 3 bonus tracks) and Dreams of Death. Unfortunately for the fans No Place for Disgrace could not be remastered due to existing legal issues between the band and their former label Elektra Records.  In March 2008 Flotsam and Jetsam toured in Europe and played at the Metalmania Festival in Poland. This show was filmed and released as DVD Once in a Deathtime in July. Midyear 2008 the band were signed to Driven Music Group, founded by former KORN guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch.  After a tour in Europe with support act Neurasthenia in April 2010 Flotsam and Jetsam finished their album The Cold. It was released on September 14, 2010. It was the last album with Mark Simpson on guitar. He left the band in friendship and was replaced by returning guitarist Ed Carlson, who had quit the band in March 2010, to be replaced by Michael Gilbert.","output":"This text is about the American thrash metal and progressive metal band Flotsam and Jetsam.

The principal islands are about east of South America's southern Patagonian coast, at a latitude of about 52°S. The archipelago, with an area of , comprises East Falkland, West Falkland and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland.  - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay.  - The Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of the mainland of Antarctica, located at the base of the Southern Hemisphere. At the surface, it is the biggest, most prominent peninsula in Antarctica as it extends from a line between Cape Adams (Weddell Sea) and a point on the mainland south of Eklund Islands. Beneath the ice sheet which covers it, the Antarctic Peninsula consists of a string of bedrock islands; these are separated by deep channels whose bottoms lie at depths considerably below current sea level. They are joined together by a grounded ice sheet. Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of South America, lies only about away across the Drake Passage.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - West Falkland is the second largest of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. It is a hilly island, separated from East Falkland by the Falkland Sound. Its area is , 37% of the total area of the islands. Its coastline is long.  - The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \\"ear\\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - The Subantarctic is a region in the southern hemisphere, located immediately north of the Antarctic region. This translates roughly to a latitude of between 46°  60° south of the Equator. The subantarctic region includes many islands in the southern parts of the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, especially those situated north of the Antarctic Convergence. Subantarctic glaciers are, by definition, located on islands within the subantarctic region. All glaciers located on the continent of Antarctica are by definition considered to be Antarctic glaciers.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - The ostrich or common ostrich (\\"Struthio camelus\\") is either one or two species of large flightless birds native to Africa, the only living member(s) of the genus \\"Struthio\\", which is in the ratite family. In 2014, the Somali ostrich (\\"Struthio molybdophanes\\") was recognized as a distinct species.  - East Falkland is the largest island of the Falklands in the South Atlantic having an area of or 54% of the total area of the Falklands. The island consists of two main land masses, the more southerly of which is known as Lafonia, joined by a narrow isthmus that was the scene of the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War.  - Hummingbirds are birds from the Americas that constitute the family Trochilidae. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring . Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5-cm bee hummingbird weighing less than a U.S. penny (2.5 g).  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - Tierra del Fuego (; Spanish for \\"Land of Fire\\") is an archipelago off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland, across the Strait of Magellan. The archipelago consists of the main island, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, with an area of , and a group of many islands, including Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands. Tierra del Fuego is divided between Chile and Argentina, with the latter controlling the eastern half of the main island and the former the western half plus the islands south of Beagle Channel. The southernmost extent of the archipelago is at about latitude 55 S.  - The snowy sheathbill (\\"Chionis albus\\"), also known as the greater sheathbill, pale-faced sheathbill, and paddy, is one of two species of sheathbill. It is usually found on the ground. It is the only land bird native to Antarctica.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - The bee hummingbird, zunzuncito or Helena hummingbird (\\"Mellisuga helenae\\") is a species of hummingbird.  - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - Patagonia is a sparsely populated region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. The region comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes. Patagonia has two coasts; a western one towards the Pacific Ocean and an eastern one towards the Atlantic Ocean.  - A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \\"oscen\\", \\"a songbird\\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - The Weddell Sea is part of the Southern Ocean and contains the Weddell Gyre. Its land boundaries are defined by the bay formed from the coasts of Coats Land and the Antarctic Peninsula. The easternmost point is Cape Norvegia at Princess Martha Coast, Queen Maud Land. To the east of Cape Norvegia is the King Haakon VII Sea. Much of the southern part of the sea is covered by a permanent, massive ice shelf field, the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (not pack ice). The sea is contained within the two overlapping Antarctic territorial claims of Argentina, (Argentine Antarctica) and Britain (British Antarctic Territory), and also resides partially within the territorial claim of Chile (Antarctic Chilean Territory). At its widest the sea is around across, and its area is around . Various ice shelves, including the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, fringe the Weddell sea. Some of the ice shelves on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula, which formerly covered roughly of the Weddell Sea, had completely disappeared by 2002; see \\"Antarctica\\" at Retreat of glaciers since 1850. Whilst a dramatic event, the area that disappeared was far smaller than the total area of ice shelf that remains.  - The Antarctic Convergence is a curve continuously encircling Antarctica, varying in latitude seasonally, where cold, northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the subantarctic. Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and upwelling create a zone very high in marine productivity, especially for Antarctic krill. This line, like the Arctic tree line, is a natural boundary rather than an artificial one like a line of latitude. It not only separates two hydrological regions, but also separates areas of distinctive marine life associations and of different climates. There is no Arctic equivalent, due to the amount of land surrounding the northern polar region.  - An endotherm (from Greek  \\"endon\\" \\"within\\" and  \\"therm\\" \\"heat\\") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue. Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals. Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic.  - The sheathbills are a family of birds , Chionidae . Classified in the wader order Charadriiformes , the family contains one genus , Chionis , with only two species . They breed on subantarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula , and the snowy sheathbill migrates to the Falkland Islands and coastal southern South America in the southern winter ; they are the only bird family endemic as breeders to the Antarctic region . They are also the only Antarctic birds without webbed feet .  - The sheathbills are a family of birds, Chionididae. Classified in the wader order Charadriiformes, the family contains one genus, \\"Chionis\\", with only two species. They breed on subantarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, and the snowy sheathbill migrates to the Falkland Islands and coastal southern South America in the southern winter; they are the only bird family endemic as breeders to the Antarctic region. They are also the only Antarctic birds without webbed feet.  - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface.  - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.

In some areas, it is because of fire management. Fire is a natural event, so managing fire correctly is very important. In other areas, fisherman have taken too many fish from one area. This places the species at risk of extinction. It also affects other living things that may rely on these fish for food. The image below shows a picture of a mine. Mining changes the Earths surface. This area may once have been a forest or a prairie. Think about how many plants and animals may once have lived here. Now it is a giant hole in the ground. Pollution is also a major factor in habitat loss and change.  Question: \\"How can living organisms affect their ecosystems?\\" Response: \\"Fire, over fishing, mining, pollution\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question by listing ways living organisms can affect their ecosystems, like fire, over fishing, mining, and pollution. However, I'll provide an explanation suitable for a five-year-old. Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs and you have built a wonderful world with lots of animals, trees, and houses. Living organisms affect their ecosystems, which is like their LEGO world, in different ways.  Sometimes, a fire might happen in the forest, and if we don't take care, it can burn many trees, making it hard for animals to live there. Other times, people may catch too many fish from a river or ocean, which leaves fewer fish for other animals to eat. Big machines can dig big holes in the ground called mines, and it can change the place where animals and plants used to live. Also, if we don't keep our world clean, pollution can happen, and it can make it harder for animals and plants to be healthy and happy because the air and water might not be clean.

Answer:","output":"Yes, both Cynodon and Claytonia are species of plants. Cynodon is a genus of plants in the grass family (Poaceae), commonly known as Bermuda grass or dog's tooth grass. Native to Africa, Cynodon species are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They are perennial grasses, typically found in lawns, sports fields, golf courses, and pastures due to their hardy nature and ability to grow in various soil types. Cynodon dactylon is the most common species in this genus and is known for its drought tolerance, rapid growth, and ability to withstand heavy foot traffic. Claytonia, on the other hand, is a genus in the plant family Montiaceae, with species commonly referred to as spring beauty or miner's lettuce. Most species are native to North America, particularly in the western and north-central parts. Claytonia species are annual or perennial herbaceous plants, characterized by small, succulent leaves and showy, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or yellow. They usually grow in moist, shady environments, such as woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Claytonia perfoliata and Claytonia virginica are two well-known species within this genus.

Snow Patrol are a Northern Irish rock band formed in 1993, consisting of Gary Lightbody (vocals, guitar), Nathan Connolly (guitar, backing vocals), Paul Wilson (bass guitar, backing vocals), Jonny Quinn (drums), and Johnny McDaid (piano, guitar, backing vocals). Initially an indie rock band, the band rose to prominence in the early-mid 2000s as part of the post-Britpop movement. The band were founded at the University of Dundee in 1993 by Lightbody, Michael Morrison, and Mark McClelland as Shrug. After briefly using the name Polarbear and released the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up. Snow Patrol said they would enter its \\"next phase\\" with their sixth album. The band took a new musical direction, and Connolly advised fans to keep an open mind regarding the new material. On 12 January 2011, Lightbody launched a blog to give details about the progress of the next release from the band.  Snow Patrol released the single \\"Called Out in the Dark\\" (remixed by Fatboy Slim) for radio airplay on Thursday 21 July 2011 on BBC Radio 1 on Zane Lowe's radio show. According to official sources, the single itself would be released independently and as part of an EP later on and the UK release date was said to be 4 September. More details on the EP were announced on 3 August, when the group's website revealed the artwork and track list contents. Along with the new single, the release contained three new tracks entitled \\"My Brothers\\", \\"I'm Ready\\", and \\"Fallen Empires\\". In addition, it was revealed that the EP was intended to be a digital release limited to the UK and Ireland.  Shortly after the premiere of the new lead single, the quintet's official website confirmed the news that the name of the new album would be Fallen Empires. Fallen Empires was released on 14 November 2011 in the UK and was launched at O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire. Singer-songwriter Johnny McDaid joined the band during the recording of the album.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where does the wife of the person Leslie shoots live?  On a moonlit, tropical night, the native workers are asleep in their outdoor barracks. A shot is heard; the door of a house opens and a man stumbles out of it, followed by a woman who calmly shoots him several more times, the last few while standing over his body. The woman is Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a British rubber plantation manager in Malaya; the man whom she shot is recognized by her manservant as Geoff Hammond, a well-regarded member of the European community. Leslie tells the servant to send for her husband Robert, who is working at one of the plantations. Her husband returns, having summoned his attorney and a British police inspector. Leslie tells them that Geoff Hammond \\"tried to make love to me\\" and that she killed him to save her honor.  Leslie is placed under arrest and put in jail in Singapore to await trial for murder; that she killed a man makes such a trial inevitable, but her eventual acquittal seems a foregone conclusion, as the white community accepts her story and believes she acted heroically.  Only her attorney, Howard Joyce, is rather suspicious. Howard's suspicions seem justified when his clerk, Ong Chi Seng, shows him a copy of a letter Leslie wrote to Hammond the day she killed him, telling him that her husband would be away that evening, and pleading with him to come—implicitly threatening him if he did not come. Ong Chi Seng tells Howard that the original letter is in the possession of Hammond's widow, a Eurasian woman who lives in the Chinese quarter of town.  The letter is for sale, and Ong himself, whom Howard had believed to be impeccable, stands to receive a substantial cut of the price.  Howard then confronts Leslie with the damning evidence and she breaks down and confesses to having written it, though she stands by her claim of having killed Hammond in self-defence.  Yet Leslie cleverly manipulates the attorney into agreeing to buy back the letter, even though in doing so he will risk his own freedom and career.

This location could be in various settings, such as a tourist site, transportation hub, or city center. The primary purpose of this performance could be to entertain guests, promote local culture, or provide background music for the center.  On the other hand, the proposed statement, \\"A band performs a song in a theater,\\" suggests a different scenario. In this case, the band might be performing a concert, participating in a larger event, or even be part of a theatrical production. The theater typically implies a venue designed for performances, artistic events, or presentations, showcasing on a stage. When comparing these two statements, a few observations can be made: 1. There is a clear difference in the venue - one is a visitor's information center, and the other is a theater. These locations could potentially be nearby or completely unrelated in terms of space or geography. 2. The nature of the performances may differ. The band performing in a visitor's information center might be doing so as background music or as part of an ongoing cultural showcase. Meanwhile, the band playing in a theater could be the primary attraction of the night, and the performance might be more formal or part of a grander event. 3. There is no direct indication that both statements refer to the same band or that one event leads to the other. It is not specified that the band performing in the visitor's information center will later perform in a theater, or vice versa.

Q:Title: Ugly Mess Product review: Movies like this are ugly and not entertaining. In the 1940s, noir movies had a manner to separate the good/bad guys from the bad/bad guys, and keep us from leaving. For example, in 1947s Kiss of Death, Victor Mature is a crook who eventually goes good, while Richard Widmark, as the notorious Tommy Udo, was not only bad, but probably created a role that dogged him his entire career. (Just check out how Tommy Udo deals with \\"Rat fink\\" grandmothers in wheelchairs.) In Contraband, a vile drama, much like The Departed, Man on Fire, and 52 Pickup, we must endure enormous cruelty and gratuitous violence merely for the sake of a self-indulgent director and badly written script.

Conrad/The New York Times Eva Zeisel at the Museum of Modern Art in 1997, with a piece from a porcelain table service introduced in 1946; behind her is a chair she designed. Eva Zeisel, a ceramic artist whose elegant, eccentric designs for dinnerware in the 1940s and ’50s helped to revolutionize the way Americans set their tables, died on Friday in New City, N.Y. She was 105. Her death was confirmed by her daughter, Jean Richards. Ms. Zeisel (pronounced ZY-sel), along with designers like Mary and Russel Wright and Charles and Ray Eames, brought the clean, casual shapes of modernist design into middle-class American homes with furnishings that encouraged a postwar desire for fresh, less formal styles of living. “Museum,” the porcelain table service that brought Ms. Zeisel national notice, was commissioned by its manufacturer, Castleton China, in conjunction with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which introduced it in an exhibition in 1946, its first show devoted to a female designer. Ms. Zeisel’s work, which ultimately spanned nine decades, was at the heart of what the museum promoted as “good design”: domestic objects that were beautiful as well as useful and whose beauty lent pleasure to daily life. “She brought form to the organicism and elegance and fluidity that we expect of ceramics today, reaching as many people as possible,” said Paola Antonelli, a curator of architecture and design at the museum. “It’s easy to do something stunning that stays in a collector’s cabinet. But her designs reached people at the table, where they gather.” Born Eva Amalia Striker in Budapest on Nov. 13, 1906, she was the daughter of Laura Polanyi Striker and Alexander Striker. Her father owned a textile factory. Her mother was a historian, feminist and political activist. In 1923, Ms. Zeisel entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest to study painting. She withdrew three semesters later, inspired by an aunt’s Hungarian peasant pottery collection to become a ceramist. She apprenticed to Jakob Karapancsik, a member of the guild of chimney sweepers, oven makers, roof tilers, well diggers and potters, and graduated as a journeyman. During a summer trip to Paris in 1925, she visited the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes — the source of the term Art Deco — which exhibited work by leading new designers like Le Corbusier and which introduced Ms. Zeisel to modern movements like the Bauhaus and the International style. She later wrote that she thought modernist design “too cold,” a quality she spent much of her professional life trying to keep out of her own work with humane, humorous versions of it. Back in Budapest, Ms. Zeisel’s exhibition at local trade fairs brought her to the attention of Hungarian ceramic manufacturers, who commissioned several collections. In 1926, her work was displayed at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial. In 1928, a ceramics manufacturer in Schramberg, Germany, hired her to design tableware. The job transformed her from a studio artist who threw pots on a wheel into an industrial designer. She now drafted designs whose success would be based, in addition to their aesthetic appeal, on their ability to be mass-manufactured and merchandised effectively. Ms. Zeisel moved to Berlin in 1930, immersing herself in the vibrant cafe society of the Weimar Republic. A visit to Ukraine in 1932 opened Ms. Zeisel’s eyes to a new realm of possibilities as a designer. Taking work at the former imperial porcelain factory in Leningrad, she realized through exposure to its archives of 18th-century tableware that “the clean lines of modern design could be successfully combined with sensuous, classic shapes,” as she later wrote. Ms. Zeisel’s signature became just that: forms that were at once contemporary and lyrical. By 1935, she was working in Moscow as the artistic director of the Russian republic’s china and glass industry. On May 28, 1936, she was arrested, falsely accused by a colleague of conspiring to assassinate Stalin. She was imprisoned for 16 months, mostly in solitary confinement, an experience that Arthur Koestler, a childhood friend, drew upon in writing his celebrated 1941 novel, “Darkness at Noon.” Again, Ms. Zeisel’s eyes were opened. “You feel the difference first in the way you see colors,” she wrote later of the deprivations of prison. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Eva Zeisel, a famous ceramic artist and designer who passed away at 105 years old. She was very talented in creating beautiful and useful dinnerware designs for people's homes in the 1940s and '50s. Her work was special because it made everyday life more enjoyable for many people with its lovely designs.

The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Before any other sentient beings existed in the universe, a race of beings calling themselves the Guardians of the Universe harnessed the power of the green element, the greatest power in the universe, to create the Green Lantern battery. However, the battery was vulnerable to the color yellow, the one part of the light spectrum that could resist green. The Guardians hid the most concentrated source of yellow energy, the yellow element, to prevent others from using it against them. After the death of Abin Sur, several Green Lanterns arrive to take Ferris Aircraft's test pilot Hal Jordan (Christopher Meloni) to the Green Lantern Corps on Oa. He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer Sinestro (Victor Garber), who is investigating Abin's murder. While undercover on the ship of Kanjar Ro (Kurtwood Smith) searching for the whereabouts of the stolen yellow element, Abin had come under attack. Fleeing to Earth, he had his ring find his successor and died of his injury shortly after. Unbeknownst to the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro had provided Kanjar with the location of the element in order to have it fashioned into a weapon of comparable power to the Green Lantern battery. Jordan quickly comes to understand that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line with those of the Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking up the messes criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan. As punishment, the Guardians strip Jordan of his ring.

Process:  - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose There is a substance that can alter the nucleus happens, how will it affect the water freezes less.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The given process describes the phenomenon of freeze-thaw weathering, which primarily involves the expansion and contraction of water within rocks due to freezing and thawing cycles. This process can lead to the formation of cracks in rocks and ultimately their breakdown over time. Let us first delve into the main aspects of this process before discussing the implications of the Perturbation Hypothesis. 1. Water seeps into rocks: The process begins when water infiltrates the pores or cracks in rocks. This could be due to natural occurrences such as erosion, precipitation or capillary action. 2. The water freezes and thaws: As temperatures fluctuate, the water within the rocks undergoes freezing and thawing cycles. When the temperature drops, the water inside the rock freezes, expanding its volume by approximately 9%. The expansion of frozen water exerts considerable pressure on the surrounding rock material, leading to cracks. 3. Cracks form in the rocks: As a result of the repeated freeze-thaw cycles, the cracks within the rock get wider and deeper, compromising the structural integrity of the rock. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up: Apart from freeze-thaw cycles, rocks can also develop cracks as a result of heating. Due to differential expansion caused by variations in mineral composition, uneven heating across a rock surface can also induce stress and lead to the formation of cracks. 5. The rocks slowly break down: Over time, the combined effects of freeze-thaw weathering and thermal stress weaken the rock structure. Eventually, the rocks break down into smaller fragments, contributing to processes such as erosion, sedimentation, and soil formation. Now, considering the Perturbation Hypothesis stating that there is a substance that can alter the nucleus and result in water freezing less: This hypothesis implies that the substance would directly affect the molecular structure of water, leading to a reduction in its freezing capabilities. The outcome of such a perturbation could significantly impact the freeze-thaw weathering process. If the water within the rocks were to freeze less often, the expansion pressure exerted on the rock material would decrease in frequency, slowing down the process of crack formation and the subsequent widening and deepening of these cracks. As a result, the overall weathering process would be lessened, with rocks retaining their structural integrity for a longer period. However, this perturbation might not entirely eliminate the effects of freeze-thaw weathering. The process could still occur, albeit at a reduced rate, since even small-scale expansion and contraction could contribute to crack formation over a more extended period. Moreover, the perturbation would not directly influence thermal stress caused by heating, which also contributes to rock breakdown.   In conclusion, if a substance were introduced that directly perturbed the nucleus and altered the freezing properties of water, the freeze-thaw weathering process would be affected. Although the overall process would likely proceed at a slower pace, rock breakdown would still occur over time due to the reduced frequency of freeze-thaw cycles and the ongoing effects of thermal stress induced by heating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Antarctica is a place with fantastic views. However, life there is very hard. Food is one of the biggest problems. Frozen food which can be heated easily is people's daily food. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, scientists often eat dried or canned vegetables. Sleep is also troublesome. In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March.

But the mirror falls down the mountain and lands on the trolls' flying machine where it shatters into pieces. Two of the pieces hit Tom in the eye and the heart that he falls into an evil curse. The Snow Queen sends her bats to retrieve the pieces. As they cannot take the two that are inside Tom, the Queen goes out to kidnap him.

Peeps tricks the witch's cat, Cuddles, into chasing after him and knocking over the elixir of life, and uses the confusion to unlocks Ellie's cell. Ellie and Peeps escape and trap the witch in the basement.

Coming off their home win over the Chiefs, the Jets flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for a Week 9 AFC East duel with the Buffalo Bills.  In the first quarter, New York took flight early as kicker Jay Feely getting a 37-yard field goal.  The Bills answered with QB Trent Edwards completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Derek Fine.  Afterwards, the Jets regained the lead as Feely got a 26-yard field goal, along with safety Abram Elam returning an interception 92 yards for a touchdown.  After a scoreless second quarter, New York kicked off the third quarter with Feely making a 20-yard field goal.  Buffalo would respond with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 53-yard field goal, yet New York replied with RB Thomas Jones getting a 7-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Bills tried to rally as CB Jabari Greer returned QB Brett Favre's 300th career interception 42 yards for a touchdown.  Favre subsequently led the Jets downfield on a seven-minute drive, resulting in a 31-yard field goal from Feely to put the game out of reach for Buffalo.

It highlights the continuing issue of intimidation and violence by paramilitary groups in the region. The severity of such threats is addressed by Supt Norman Haslett in an interview on the Stephen Nolan Show. Although the exact details of the threats aren't specified, the mention that the family felt compelled to leave their home exhibits the frightening reality many citizens are living in.  This incident sparked comments from Trevor Lunn, the Alliance party's justice spokesperson. His reaction is one of disappointment and concern. This incident, to him, is an undeniable proof that despite various claims, paramilitary organizations are unfortunately still active in Belfast and other parts of Northern Ireland. He considers the continued existence of such groups and their blatant displays of power as a deeply saddening state of affairs.  Lunn also criticized the audacity of these organizations to take law enforcement matters into their own hands. The unjustified threats made by these groups are not only terrorizing innocent individuals but also blatantly challenging the authority of legitimate law enforcement agencies. Lunn calls the situation 'disgraceful', expressing his strong disapproval of the paramilitary activities. Overall, the article puts forward a serious issue affecting Northern Ireland, painting a grim picture of the ongoing violence and intimidation from paramilitary organizations. It seeks to call attention to this problem and stimulate a discussion on how to address this issue effectively. It underscores the need for further action to be taken by legitimate authorities to curb such threats and provide peace and security for its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Where are they now: 'Gremlins' star Zach Galligan hopes he's in the movie remake LOS ANGELES – It has been almost three decades since 1984’s Steven Spielberg-produced “Gremlins” creeped into theaters and earned cult status, spawning a mammoth merchandising campaign hawking everything from video games and Gizmo dolls to breakfast cereals and trading cards. So what became of the film’s star, Zach Galligan, who won America’s heart as Billy Peltzer when he was just 17? “When ‘Gremlins’ first came out, it was mind-blowing. As a kid, you had everything you can imagine thrown at you all at once… club invites, dates, agency offers,” Galligan told FOX411 Pop Tarts column. “But it’s not easy to always make the right decisions, even people with a lot of industry experience don’t always get it right. [Hollywood] is wildly fickle.” Galligan, now 49, admits that in hindsight, he should have moved to Los Angeles instead of staying in his native New York. “When you’re out of sight, you’re out of mind,” he explained. “My parents wanted me to go to Columbia University and get my degree, which I did… but in Hollywood, you have to strike when the iron is hot.” But Galligan’s passion for acting has never waned, and over the years he has gotten several parts on TV shows like “7th Heaven” and “Law & Order” and films such as “Point Doom” and “Cut.” And this weekend, he'll be back on the big screen again when the final installment of action/horror/comedy trilogy “Hatchet III” hits theaters. He's also hoping he'll get the call for the rumored \\"Gremlins\\" re-boot. Last month it was reported Warner Bros. and producer Jeffrey Katzenberg were making progress on the project. While Warner Bros. did not respond to a request for comment, Galligan said he'd love to return, maybe as Peltzer’s school teacher. “Fans like to see the originals come back,” he said. Galligan also suggests the filmmakers opt for an “edgier” Billy – perhaps Dane DeHaan (Jesse in HBO’s “In Treatment”) or Joel Courtney of “Super 8” fame. He also advised that the ending of the potential remake be changed. “In this first one, I was supposed to save the day. But they changed it to the Gizmo and I didn’t know until the first screening,\\" he said. \\"I was sitting there all excited, only to discover I wasn’t the hero. I was so annoyed.

It's the kind of European night that Liverpool fans have been craving for years. Anfield will be rocking when Real Madrid come to town, but can Brendan Rodgers’ side topple the European champions? Sportsmail’s top pundits give their verdicts... Raheem Sterling and Cristiano Ronaldo go head-to-head as Liverpool take on Real Madrid at Anfield. Sportsmail's Three Wise Men give their verdicts ahead of Liverpool's Champions League clash with Liverpool. How do you stop Madrid? MARTIN KEOWN: Madrid are lethal on the break and Brendan Rodgers will have looked at how they destroyed Bayern last season. Without Bale and Di Maria, they have lost some of that speed, but then there’s Ronaldo. Him running at Lovren and Skrtel is a recipe for disaster. It will be interesting to see if Liverpool stay with a diamond or maybe use two deep midfielders to offer more protection. Cristiano Ronaldo and his Real Madrid team-mates braved adverse weather during Tuesday's training session. JAMIE CARRAGHER: It is essential that Liverpool’s full backs only go forward when it is absolutely necessary. You have to guard against the way Madrid counter attack at blistering pace and they can’t be given opportunities to speed forward. JAMIE REDKNAPP: We all know about Madrid’s speed on the counter but they are a big, powerful side and so dangerous at set-pieces. They scored two in the semi-final against Bayern Munich last season and again against Atletico Madrid in the final. Sergio Ramos being out will help that but it will be very difficult for Liverpool. They must stay strong and Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen have to look after that midfield. Ronaldo gives a thumbs up to his  fans who waited to catch a glimpse of the frontman outside the Hilton hotel. So, how can Liverpool win? REDKNAPP: You have to look at Sterling because he is the stand-out player. If Liverpool can get him on the ball, he will frighten any defender. But the way Liverpool have been defending this season, I don’t think they will keep a clean sheet. The only way they can beat Madrid is to match them in attack and out-score them. KEOWN: They should be licking their lips at the prospect of playing Madrid. Of course it’s a tough game but they should relish the challenge. They have to work the ball well, moving it on quickly and accurately when they are in possession, and a lot depends on the speed of Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho. But the players must enjoy the occasion and draw from it, not be fearful of it. CARRAGHER: By getting back to how they were last season. They need to be aggressive and intense in their play, start quick and get Madrid on the back foot. If they do that, they will have another weapon to use - the Anfield crowd. Liverpool must use the pace and power of Raheem Sterling to frighten the Real Madrid defence on Wednesday. Should Rodgers play Mario Balotelli? KEOWN: Absolutely. If you invest £16million in a player and aren’t prepared to play him after a few games it reflects badly on you. He has to be given the chance to continue the club’s tradition of great strikers. But to do so tonight has to be his greatest night in a Liverpool shirt. CARRAGHER: No. I would go for Sterling as the main striker with Adam Lallana and Coutinho supporting him. Sterling can get in behind a defence but he will also press. Mario Balotelli isn’t doing either at the minute. Sportsmail's Three Wise Men are split on whether Mario Balotelli should start for Liverpool against Madrid. REDKNAPP: I’ve never really taken to him - he acts like a genius but he doesn’t play like one - but I would probably still start him. I can’t see Sterling working as a central striker and though Rickie Lambert would work his socks of, he’s not match-fit. Balotelli has to pray he turns it on, otherwise it could be the end of his relationship with the fans. They won’t tolerate much more. The Liverpool squad appeared in good spirits on Tuesday as they prepare for the visit of mighty Real Madrid. What's your prediction? CARRAGHER: 1-1. Real Madrid might be favourites but there is no chance Liverpool will lie down at home. REDKNAPP: I agree with Jamie. I’ve played enough times at Anfield to know how much the crowd can lift the team. Madrid will win the home game but I’ve got a feeling Liverpool can sneak a draw on Wednesday night. 1-1. KEOWN: The electric Anfield atmosphere could power Liverpool to a special performance, so we could be in for a thriller. But I still feel Madrid are too strong. A 2-1 away win for the Spaniards. VIDEO Liverpool host Real in European epic. Write highlights for this article.","output":"- Liverpool faces Real Madrid in a crucial Champions League clash at Anfield - Liverpool must be cautious of Madrid's lethal counter-attacks - Raheem Sterling could be key for Liverpool's chances of victory - Opinion is split on whether Mario Balotelli should start for Liverpool - Sportsmail's Three Wise Men offer varying predictions: two draws and one Real Madrid win"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I heard that Robin had a long talk with their ex. Robin got back together with them.  And I was wondering How would Robin feel afterwards? Available choices: [+] like they had if figured out; [+] like they needed a break; [+] like they needed space; Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the given information and analyze each available choice in relation to this information. Given: Robin had a long talk with their ex and they ended up getting back together.  Choices:  1) Like they had it figured out: This choice could potentially match with the situation. If Robin decided to get back together with their ex, it might mean that they were confident in this decision after their talk. They might believe they have understood their past mistakes or issues and know how to avoid them in the future. They have come to a conclusion after their talk and made a decision, so this could lead to feelings of having 'figured it out'.  2) Like they needed a break: This choice seems less likely in the given context. Robin just made a decision to reconnect with their ex, so wanting a break usually doesn't align straight after such a decision. A break from a relationship is typically associated with wanting time apart, which contrasts with their decision to reconcile.  3) Like they needed space: This choice is similar to the second one. After choosing to get back together, it would be contradictory for Robin to feel that they need space. Needing space would imply a need for distance or separation, which would usually not follow the decision to reconnect in a relationship. So by analyzing each choice and justifying its relevance or lack thereof to the given situation, it is most likely that Robin would feel like they had it figured out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence from a movie review: ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the preceding review, it seems that the movie was seen positively. The reviewer highlights a few aspects that contribute to the positive outlook of the film. Firstly, the mention of the movie being a \\"ride for the kiddies\\" suggests that the movie is entertaining and enjoyable for children. It appears to be a fun and engaging experience designed specifically for a younger audience, making it a hit for kids. Secondly, the use of the term \\"eye candy\\" indicates that the movie features appealing visuals and is visually stimulating. This aspect is likely to captivate the audience and keep them interested throughout the film's duration. Good visual elements in a movie heighten the overall experience, and in this case, it seems to be a significant positive point. Thirdly, the reviewer mentions \\"cheeky wit,\\" which suggests that the movie contains clever humor, likely delivered in a playful or subtly sarcastic manner. The humor plays a crucial role in keeping the adult audience engaged, possibly with references or jokes that cater to their tastes. Lastly, the added note that parents were kept \\"away from the concession stand\\" implies that the film was engaging enough for adults to remain seated and focused on the movie, rather than seeking snacks or other distractions during its runtime. It means that the movie was able to hold the interest of both children and their parents, making it a family-friendly and enjoyable experience. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in the movie review appears to be positive. The film offers entertainment for kids, visually appealing scenes, cheeky wit for adults, and an overall engaging experience for the entire family."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.  After reading the above, is \\"Narrow\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What do blood vessels do to retain body heat?\\"? Select from:  --no;  --yes;","output":"Yes, that's right!

Translate to English","output":"The divided Germany into two was the most tangible symbol of the absurdity and inhuman nature of a bipolar world. Throughout the course of history, few events have been as significant as the division of Germany following the Second World War. This event effectively solidified the separation of the global community into two major factions: the Western Bloc, led by the United States and its allies, and the Eastern Bloc, led by the Soviet Union and its satellite states. As a result, Germany became a symbol of the intense ideological and political divide that gripped the world between the years 1945 and 1989. Following the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the victorious Allied powers (the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and France) divided the country into four occupied zones. This was initially meant to be a temporary arrangement, as the hope was that Germany would eventually reunify and become a democratic and peaceful nation. However, due to the growing tensions and distrust between the Soviet Union and Western powers, Germany remained divided - and eventually, this division became official with the formation of the two separate countries: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The division of Germany was not only about the physical partition, but also its human impact: millions of families were separated, with countless individuals forcibly prevented from contacting their loved ones on the other side of the border. This was especially true after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, which intensified the sense of isolation for those living in East Germany. The existence of the wall was a physical reminder of the ideological divide between the East and West, the inevitability of suffering due to the power struggle between the two superpowers. Beyond the consequences for the German people, the divided Germany also served as a metaphor for the state of the world during the Cold War era. The global political landscape was dominated by an intense rivalry between two competing ideologies: capitalism, represented by the United States and its Western allies, and communism, represented by the Soviet Union and its satellites. This bipolar world ultimately influenced countless aspects of life, from foreign policy and military strategy to economics, culture, and even sporting events. In essence, the division of Germany into East and West, along with the construction of the Berlin Wall, represented a powerful symbol of the political, ideological, and economic struggles that characterized the era of the Cold War. It serves as a stark reminder of the human costs of global conflict and political ideology, as well as the importance of striving for a world united by mutual understanding and cooperation, rather than defined by division and animosity. History has since proven that a world rooted in dialogue and collaboration is far more stable and beneficial for humanity as a whole, and that the lessons of the divided Germany must never be forgotten."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gramophone record Terms such as \\"long-play\\" (LP) and \\"extended-play\\" (EP) describe multi-track records that play much longer than the single-item-per-side records, which typically do not go much past four minutes per side. An LP can play for up to 30 minutes per side, though most played for about 22 minutes per side, bringing the total playing time of a typical LP recording to about forty-five minutes. Many pre-1952 LPs, however, played for about 15 minutes per side. The 7-inch 45 rpm format normally contains one item per side but a 7-inch EP could achieve recording times of 10 to 15 minutes at the expense of attenuating and compressing the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were generally used to make available tracks not on singles including tracks on LPs albums in a smaller, less expensive format for those who had only 45 rpm players. The large center hole on 7-inch 45 rpm records allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. The term \\"album\\", originally used to mean a \\"book\\" with liner notes, holding several 78 rpm records each in its own \\"page\\" or sleeve, no longer has any relation to the physical format: a single LP record, or nowadays more typically a compact disc. Q: What terms are used for recording with more than one track?","output":"A: The terms used for recordings with more than one track are \\"long-play\\" (LP) and \\"extended-play\\" (EP). LPs can play for up to 30 minutes per side, while EPs have a shorter playing time but still longer than a single-item-per-side record.

My husband and I planned to eat at Spoon as our one fancy meal during a recent trip to Pittsburgh, and we were not disappointed.

I started with the blue cheese gorgonzola souffle, which right now is being served with a stone fruit salad.  (Mine was almost all peaches with a few plum slices.)

He started with the prawns and cantaloupe, which he liked very much (although he was a little freaked out that the prawns were served entire).  Next, he had the barbecued brisket, which was served with white cheddar mac 'n cheese and coleslaw.  He thought the coleslaw, which contained red peppers and several other unusual vegetables, was a little strange, but he ate it all, and he thought the other components of the entree were very good.

Often, \\"flipping\\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \\"increase\\" to \\"decrease.\\" Background Paragraph: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Story: Two brothers loved geology. Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location. A:","output":"What type of plate boundary would likely be responsible for an earthquake that Dan studies, given the elastic rebound theory and the relationship between plate movement and earthquake occurrence?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The parents bought him bigger and bigger clothing. Available options: *yes; *it is not possible to tell; *no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the content of both sentences. Sentence 1 states that his parents are buying him smaller clothes and are happy because their son fulfilled their desire for a grandson. Sentence 2 states that the parents are buying him bigger clothing. Step 2: Compare the information in both sentences. The first sentence states that the parents are buying smaller clothes, while the second sentence states the opposite - that the parents are buying bigger clothes. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Since the information in both sentences is contradictory (smaller clothes vs. bigger clothes), the second sentence cannot be entailed by the first sentence.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body - The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth.  suppose more plants are planted happens, how will it affect more air moves into the lungs.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Answer: indirectly impacting a step of the process Explanation: When more plants are planted, they contribute to an increase in oxygen levels in the atmosphere due to photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. This causes an increase in the overall volume of breathable air, which could indirectly impact a step of the process mentioned. The process mentioned in the question is mostly related to the human respiratory system. Here's the correct version of that process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth or nose - The air goes down the trachea, not the esophagus (which is for food) - The air moves into the lungs (specifically, the bronchi and alveoli) - Oxygen from the air diffuses in the capillaries surrounding the alveoli and binds to hemoglobin in the red blood cells, while carbon dioxide is released from the cells and moves into the alveoli - The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart and is pumped to the rest of the body - The carbon dioxide in the alveoli is expelled through the trachea and out the mouth or nose as we exhale. The indirect effect of planting more plants is that there would be a higher concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere. This could lead to the lungs getting slightly more oxygen with each breath, which could potentially improve the efficiency of the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs. However, this will not directly impact any specific step in the process, as the human respiratory system stays the same regardless of the amount of oxygen in the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
