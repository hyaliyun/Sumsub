If Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals., can we conclude that \\"The generals and admirals imposed nationalism because they had to, not because they wanted to.\\"?","output":"To determine the validity of the statement \\"The generals and admirals imposed nationalism because they had to, not because they wanted to,\\" we need to delve into the historical context in which these actions took place and explore the motivations behind them. In the 1930s, Japan's political landscape was characterized by a delicate balance between civilian government institutions and the military's influence. The rise of nationalism during this period can be attributed to various factors, including Japan's rapid industrialization and modernization, the worldwide depression of the 1930s, and the perception of Japan as a counterweight to the Western powers' influence in Asia. As Japan's economy grew, so did its military power. By the time of the London Naval Treaty in 1930, the Japanese navy was the third-largest in the world, and its army was also expanding. Due to Japan's economic and geopolitical situation at the time, the military saw nationalism as a means to mobilize public opinion and garner support for their agenda, which centered on territorial expansion and a greater Japanese presence in global affairs. Now, let's look at some of the reasons why Japanese generals and admirals might have felt compelled to impose nationalism on the government: 1. Military influence in politics: Owing to the Meiji Constitution (enacted in 1890), the military wielded a significant amount of power within the government. Both the Army and Navy Ministers had to be active-duty officers, enabling military factions to veto decisions they disagreed with. Thus, the military's promotion of nationalism may not have been solely out of personal conviction but rather as a means to maintain and consolidate their power over civilian political institutions. 2. Perceived threats from other nations: The Washington Naval Treaty (1922) and the London Naval Treaty (1930) placed limits on Japanese naval expansion, which was seen by some military leaders as an attempt by Western powers to limit Japan's ability to protect its interests. This led to the belief that Japan needed to assert itself more assertively on the international stage to protect its sovereignty and interests. 3. Economic hardships: The global depression of the 1930s severely impacted Japan's economy, resulting in unemployment, low agricultural prices, and labor unrest. Military leaders saw the promotion of nationalism as a means to revitalize domestic industries, particularly the heavy industries critical to military strength, and to create a united front against external threats. 4. Desire for territorial expansion: Military leaders saw territorial expansion, particularly into resource-rich Manchuria and China, as vital for ensuring Japan's continued economic growth and securing its place as a dominant force in East Asia. Promoting nationalism would rally public support for aggressive foreign policies and justify expansionist goals. While it is undeniable that the rise of nationalism in Japan during the 1930s served the interests of military leaders, it would be overly simplistic to conclude that the generals and admirals imposed nationalism solely because they \\"had to\\" and not out of personal conviction. It is likely that the palpable effects of international pressures, economic downturns, and a push for territorial expansion combined with the military's vested interests in maintaining power and influence, contributed to the promotion of nationalism. In conclusion, the imposition of nationalism by the generals and admirals during the 1930s can be viewed as both a strategic move to advance their interests and as a response to external and internal challenges faced by Japan at the time. It is essential to acknowledge the complex interactions and motivations behind their actions to gain a comprehensive understanding of this period in Japan's history."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

They are called canines  , and they are there only for the purpose of eating meat. When it comes to satisfying this kind of desire, soy   food can never match a well-prepared tri-tip (also know as triangle beef steak ). Just the thought of the beef, burning on the grill   with the smell of wood smoke gets the mouth watering and brings back memories of summer barbecues. When the knife cuts through the tri- tip, exposing the red meat bursting with juices, it's more than just cooking. It's a cultural event, showing we are at the top of the food chain, like no other food can. Nutritionally speaking, the tri-tip is one of the better cuts of beef. It is lower in fat than many other cuts, and the proteins   you get from eating meat are more complete than those that come from vegetables, making meat a better choice for building and keeping up your muscle tissue healthy. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, one thing to be aware of with soy products in general is that while they are high in iron, a necessary mineral for the body, they also contain something that blocks the body's absorption of iron. We can cook them in various ways to make them tasty. Anyway, the tri-tip goes a lot better with ice-cold beer than a large piece of bean-curd cheese would, no matter how you cook it.

Regrettably, in recent years, the state has also become known for something far less desirable—wildfires. Throughout this fire season, Californian firefighters are tirelessly working to combat the spread of major wildfires across the state. As the flames continue to rage, these brave men and women go up against extraordinary challenges in their attempt to protect lives and property. Step 1: Elaborate on the scale and impact of the wildfires: California has seen an unprecedented increase in wildfire frequency and intensity, largely as a result of climate change and prolonged drought. These fires have caused loss of life, destroyed countless acres of valuable land, and forced many people to evacuate from their homes. The economic impact and emotional toll of these disasters have soared, with millions of Californians grappling with the effects for years to come. Step 2: Discuss the roles of firefighters and the response measures: During these most trying times, firefighters play a critical role in mitigating the spread of wildfires. Working relentlessly on the front lines, they use an array of specialized equipment, techniques, and strategies to combat the fires. These include deploying firetrucks, helicopters, and other essential vehicles, as well as using controlled burns to prevent the fire's spread and save crucial infrastructure. Step 3: Highlight the challenges faced by the firefighters: The burgeoning wildfires create formidable obstacles for the firefighters. These obstacles include, but are not limited to, unpredictable weather conditions, hazardous materials, and dangerous topography. The men and women fighting these fires face both physical and mental exhaustion, with many remaining on the front lines for extended periods. The challenges posed by these wildfires necessitate seamless teamwork, exhaustive training, and immense personal sacrifice in completing their mission—the protection of California's citizens and resources. Step 4: Discuss preventative measures and future implications: In addition to battling existing wildfires, efforts are being put into research and development for new technologies and strategies focused on preventing future occurrences. The implementation of these measures remains crucial for the long-term safety of California's citizens and preservation of the state's cherished ecosystems. Furthermore, policymakers must craft legislation that addresses the root causes of these fires, primarily climate change, and other contributing factors. Conclusion: The firefighting efforts of California's heroes will continue until the last ember has been extinguished, but their work should not go unrecognized. The bravery and commitment they display as they struggle against the elements to protect their communities demonstrate the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of unity in the face of adversity. It is imperative that we continue to stand behind and support these individuals, while also striving to implement innovative prevention measures and policies to mitigate the effects of wildfires, not just in California, but around the globe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Police in Florida are on the hunt for a suspect in a hit-and-ran crash involving a pregnant woman who was left injured. Sheriff’s deputies in Holiday say Crystal Lynn Noordhuizen, 32, who is seven months pregnant, was struck by a car Monday afternoon. According to investigators, the driver of the vehicle has been identified as 33-year-old Justin Lee Colby, who is believed to be her half-brother. Scroll down for video Hit and run: Police in Florida are searching for 33-year-old Justin Lee Colby (left), who is suspected of running over his pregnant sister, 32-year-old Crystal Lynn Noordhuizen (right) with his car At the time, Justin Colby denied striking his sibling on purpose and claimed that","output":"the incident was an accident. However, witnesses at the scene reported seeing the two arguing just moments before the crash, leading police to believe the act was intentional. Step 1: Investigation and gathering evidence As the investigation progressed, police gathered evidence from the scene of the crime, including security camera footage, witness statements, and physical evidence from Justin Colby's vehicle, such as paint transfer and any damage consistent with the hit and run. Step 2: Arrest and interrogation After compiling enough evidence, law enforcement officers located and arrested Justin Colby. During his interrogation, detectives attempted to uncover further details about the motivation behind the attack and get a confession. Despite his initial denial, confronted with the overwhelming evidence, Colby admitted to intentionally hitting his half-sister with his car. Step 3: Formal charges and trial Following his confession, Justin Colby was charged with attempted murder and leaving the scene of an accident involving injury. The case went to trial, during which the prosecution presented the evidence and witness statements supporting the charge that Colby intentionally tried to kill his pregnant half-sister. Step 4: Verdict and sentencing The jury, after considering the presented evidence and hearing testimonies from both sides, found Justin Lee Colby guilty on both charges. The presiding judge sentenced him to a lengthy prison term, taking into account the severity of the crime, as well as accounting for the additional element of the victim's pregnancy.

She also gave birth to a healthy baby, and the local community showed their support and strength by offering both emotional and financial assistance during this difficult time. In conclusion, the story ends with Justin Lee Colby being brought to justice and serving a lengthy prison sentence for his crimes.

Summarize this article: An alliance of regional parties took 178 seats out of 243. The BJP won 58. Mr Modi won a convincing victory in last year's national elections, but this poll was seen as a referendum on his economic programme. Defeat is a major setback for the prime minister, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder, in Delhi. However, a spokesman for the Hindu-led nationalist BJP rejected suggestions the result was a personal blow for Mr Modi, saying the party \\"managed a creditable performance\\". The prime minister had been hoping a victory in Bihar would boost his party's strength in India's upper house of parliament, which is made up of representatives of state legislatures and where he lacks a majority. With a population of 100 million, Bihar is one of India's largest states and one of the poorest. The BJP's defeat in Bihar is the second consecutive setback for Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party since it swept to power in Delhi last year. Earlier this year the BJP suffered a drubbing at the hands of an upstart anti-corruption party in Delhi. Now a \\"grand alliance\\" of powerful regional parties has handed out a defeat in what is one of India's most politically crucial states. Despite what his defenders say, Sunday's defeat is another blow to the charismatic Mr Modi, who is arguably the party's biggest vote-getter and who attended 26 campaign rallies in Bihar ahead of the vote. The results make it clear that Mr Modi's vote-catching abilities are on the wane and voters are already holding him to the promises he made to them last year. For India's bedraggled opposition, the Bihar victory is a major shot in the arm. They will now be emboldened to challenge Mr Modi by forging alliances and change the narrative of Indian politics.

Does it follow that \\"The DSM praises the victims by giving them courage to speak out against the injustices done to them.\\"? Possible answers:  (a). yes.  (b). it is not possible to tell.  (c). no.","output":"(c). No. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) that provides a common language, standard criteria, and classification of mental disorders for use by mental health professionals. It is important to note that the DSM is a diagnostic tool and not a commentary on individuals' experiences or the societal injustices they face. The original statement argues that the DSM insults victims of traumas and societal injustice by labeling their problems as mental disorders, which could lead to the perception that these individuals are \\"wacko\\" or responsible for their own suffering. This interpretation of the DSM sees it as further stigmatizing individuals who are already facing trauma and social inequalities. On the other hand, the proposal that the DSM praises victims by encouraging them to speak out about injustices they have experienced is not a direct or accurate interpretation of the DSM's function or intent. The primary goal of the DSM is to provide mental health professionals with a comprehensive, evidence-based system for diagnosing mental disorders. While providing a diagnosis can potentially help individuals understand their experiences and seek appropriate treatment, the DSM does not inherently encourage or praise victims for speaking out against injustices. Furthermore, while some argue that the DSM may inadvertently contribute to the stigmatization of certain individuals or groups, many mental health professionals and advocates believe that the DSM's diagnostic framework can contribute to better understanding, treatment, and support for those experiencing mental health challenges. However, this potential benefit does not guarantee the empowerment of individuals to speak out against societal injustice, as that is not the core function of the DSM. In conclusion, the answer is \\"no\\" because the DSM does not inherently praise or encourage victims of trauma or societal injustice to speak out, as its main purpose is to serve as a diagnostic resource for mental health professionals. While there may be benefits and drawbacks related to the DSM, relating it directly to praising or empowering victims to discuss injustices is not a direct or accurate representation of its purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize: The BBC has learned that despite having \\"direct oversight\\" of Network Rail, and pledging extra electrification in the election campaign, ministers were kept in the dark about the rail operator's plans. Sources at the Department for Transport said a Network Rail minute revealing a decision would have to be taken soon after polling day was not sent to the government until 22 May. The sources said neither ministers nor officials were informed. It means Conservatives made a rail manifesto pledge to electrify rail routes in ignorance of Network Rail's plans. However, Labour insisted the news showed ministers must have known rail electrification projects would be paused in June, and that they had misled voters. The Conservatives pledged to electrify rail routes in their manifesto, only to put plans for electrifying two lines on hold shortly after polling day. Minutes of a Network Rail board meeting from March show the board agreed to a plan that included making \\"decisions required jointly with the DfT re enhancement deferrals from June\\". \\"Enhancement\\" is industry jargon for upgrade. \\"Enhancement deferral\\" refers to delaying upgrades. It is understood rail executives had judged that taking any longer to pause struggling projects would incur extra costs. The government has had \\"direct oversight\\" of Network Rail since September last year. One senior rail executive has told me further delays are expected of major projects in the north of England. Network Rail's plans there had become a \\"standing joke\\" the executive said. Rail schemes were at the heart of George Osborne's election promise to create a \\"northern powerhouse\\". Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said: \\"This revelation shows ministers must have known before the general election that vital rail electrification projects would be shelved. \\"It is becoming increasingly apparent ministers deliberately decided to cynically mislead people during the general election campaign that key rail lines would be electrified in the Midlands and the North, knowing full well that they would then renege on these commitments after the election. \\" Minutes from Network Rail board meetings as early as November reveal there were concerns about the \\"deliverability\\" and affordability of upgrades.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Cook batted for almost 10 hours, his eventual dismissal prompting England's declaration at 514-8. Dawid Malan, looking to secure a place at number five, scored 65, his maiden Test half-century. West Indies had reached 44-1, 470 behind, when rain forced the players off with 26 overs left to bowl. That was a decent effort from the tourists, who spent a day and a half in the field and were facing the pink ball in cold, cloudy conditions. Still, West Indies, who have not won a Test in the UK since 2000, face a huge task simply to avoid the follow-on. Play will start half an hour earlier than scheduled at 13:30 BST on the remaining three days Saturday to make up for the lost overs. Cook was in good touch in the 3-1 series win over South Africa, but did not make the big score he seemed capable of. That continued a trend in the former captain's batting that dates back for four years - in his previous 98 innings he had converted only five of his 31 half-centuries into hundreds. Here, he picked up from his overnight 153 and methodically gorged himself on a tame West Indies attack that at least showed some improvement from the first day. Whereas Cook played uncharacteristic cover drives on Thursday, his Friday accumulation was with more familiar cuts and clips off the pads. He barely scored a run down the ground. He looked to up the pace after lunch, an England plan that saw Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali fall cheaply. Cook finally made a misjudgement to play across the line to Roston Chase, the off-spinner earning an lbw decision on review for figures of 4-113. Middlesex's Malan managed only 35 runs in two Tests against South Africa and was in need of a score to press his claim for a place on this winter's Ashes tour to Australia. He survived against the second new ball and under lights on day one, albeit after being dropped on two, and resumed on 28 when England started the day on 348-3. The left-hander played attractive drives both through and over cover, as well as collecting runs behind square on the leg side. Malan extended his partnership with Cook to 162 and had the opportunity for a Test century when he edged a good delivery from Chase to slip. Three figures would perhaps have guaranteed him a trip down under but, as it is, he may well need another score in this three-match series. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special: \\"Malan will be delighted, but today was a perfect opportunity for him to get a big score. There were runs for the taking.\\" England declared just as the clouds began to close in and fears that West Indies could capitulate were enhanced when Kraigg Brathwaite edged James Anderson behind without a run on the board. However, Kieran Powell and debutant Kyle Hope found a way to survive, although both needed some good fortune. Powell was reprieved by Stokes at gully on two and Hope survived a tough chance that barely carried to Moeen at third slip, both off Stuart Broad. Rain had been forecast for earlier in the day, but when it arrived just before 19:30 it quickly became apparent that no further play would be possible. Not that it dampened the spirits of a large group who gathered at the back of the Hollies Stand, singing the loudest songs of the day even after the abandonment came at 20:10. Media playback is not supported on this device Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS: \\"Today was all about Alastair Cook and the way in which he occupied the crease. When you have players of his quality, they never miss out. \\"Full credit to West Indies' batsmen - they coped with Anderson. Broad didn't find his rhythm - he bowled short and wide.\\" West Indies all-rounder Roston Chase: \\"Yesterday we weren't at our best - we were a little ill-disciplined with our bowling. We had a chat about it and we made a better effort today. \\"The guys were batting well. We were confident they would have taken us to the end of the play.\\" Former West Indies fast bowler Sir Curtly Ambrose on TMS: \\"The West Indies bowlers weren't penetrative enough on day one. I didn't see any aggression. They ran into a road block in Root and Cook. \\"It's not going to be easy for West Indies. They will have to bat well and try to avoid the follow-on - that will be key. If they don't, they will be in trouble.\\"","output":"In a cricket game, Cook played really well and batted for almost 10 hours. He helped England declare at 514-8. Dawid Malan also did well, scoring 65 points. West Indies got a little bit closer with 44-1, but then rain stopped the game. They still have a big challenge to avoid falling behind. The game will start a little earlier on the next three days to make up for lost time. Everyone is excited to see how it will turn out, and players from both teams are focused on doing their best."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Argentina in the late nineteenth century was an exciting place. Around 1870,it was experiencing an economic  boom, and the capital, Buenos Aires, attracted many people. Farmers, as well as a flood of foreigners from Spain and Italy, came to Buenos Aires seeking jobs. These jobs didn't pay well, and the people felt lonely and disappointed with their new life in the city. As the unhappy newcomers mixed together in the poor parts of the city, the dance known an the tango  came into being. At the beginning the tango was a dance of the lower classes. It was danced in the bars and streets. At that time there many fewer women the men, so if a man didn't want to be left out, his only choice was to dance with another man so that he could attract the attention of the few available women. Gradually, the dance spread into the upper classes of Argentinean society and became more respectable. In Europe at this time, strong interest in dance from around the world was beginning. This interest in international dance was especially evident in Paris. Every kind of dance from ballet  to belly dancing could be found on the stages of the Paris theaters of the Paris theaters. After tango dances from Argentina arrive in Europe, they began to draw the interest of the public as they performed their exciting dance in cafes. Though not everyone approved of the new dance, saying it was a little too shocking, the dance did find enough supporters to make it popular. The popularity  of the tango continued to grow in many other parts of the world. Soldiers who returned to the United States from World War I brought the tango to North America. It reached Japan in 1926, and in 2003 the Argentinean embassy in Seoul hired a local tango dancer to act an a kind of dance ambassador, and promote tango dancing throughout South Korea.

Q: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Determine the source of your negative thinking. Think of the worst possible outcome that could happen.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Overcoming Negative Thoughts: A Guide to Nurturing a Positive Mindset Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it's quite common for individuals to experience negative thoughts and emotions. Overwhelmed by life's adversities, we often find ourselves caught up in a vicious cycle of negative thinking. However, it's essential to understand that negative thoughts can significantly impact our mental health, overall well-being, and the way we navigate our lives. To promote a more positive mindset, let's delve into various techniques that can help us acknowledge, release, and transform our negative thought patterns. Step 1: Acknowledge your negative thoughts The first step in overcoming negative thoughts is to acknowledge their presence. Instead of ignoring or suppressing these thoughts, accept them as part of your current mental state. This step's significance lies in developing self-awareness, as denial can only exacerbate the situation. Being honest with yourself and recognizing negative thoughts will set the stage for subsequent steps. Step 2: Release your negative thoughts Once you've acknowledged your negative thoughts, it's time to let them go. The act of releasing these thoughts helps to reduce their power and influence over you. There are various techniques you can employ for this purpose, such as deep breathing exercises, visualization, or journaling. Find a method that works best for you and practice it regularly to create a habit of releasing negative thoughts. Step 3: Have concerns without dwelling on them It's natural to have concerns about various aspects of our lives, such as work, finances, or relationships. However, it's essential to differentiate between having concerns and dwelling on those concerns. Continuously ruminating on negative thoughts can have an adverse impact on our mental health and daily functioning. Focus on identifying any genuine concerns, creating a plan to address them, and then moving forward without letting them dominate your thoughts. Step 4: Don't buy into the negative thinking Negative thoughts can be deceptive, masquerading as the truth. It's crucial not to buy into the negative thinking. This step involves developing a healthy skepticism towards your thoughts and questioning their validity. By employing critical thinking skills and challenging your thoughts, you can disrupt the negative cycle and gain better control over your emotions. Step 5: Determine the source of your negative thinking To manage your negative thoughts effectively, it's helpful to identify their root cause. This requires a deep understanding and self-reflection about your beliefs, upbringing, experiences, and influences that have shaped your thought patterns. By identifying and resolving the underlying factors contributing to negative thoughts, you can work towards fostering a more optimistic mindset. Step 6: Think of the worst possible outcome that could happen One of the most powerful strategies for transforming negative thoughts into more constructive ones is to imagine the worst possible outcome of a situation. This exercise helps in putting things into perspective and makes you realize that your fears may be irrational or exaggerated. As you become more aware of the unrealistic nature of your negative thoughts, you can start replacing them with more balanced and positive ones. Conclusion Overcoming negative thoughts is an ongoing process that requires commitment, self-awareness, and consistent practice. By acknowledging, releasing, and transforming negative thinking, we can actively cultivate a positive mindset and reshape our lives. Embrace these techniques to nurture a healthier, happier outlook and promote a more fulfilling life experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: ABC News’ Jonathan Karl reports: Senior House Democratic aides say that House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel is negotiating terms with Democratic leaders to step down temporarily from his post atop the powerful tax-writing committee, pending the completion of several ethics committee investigations into his conduct.      But while aides say he is temporarily negotiating to step down, Rangel remained publicly defiant and emerged from a meeting with Democratic leaders tonight saying he would hold on to the chairman’s gavel.      According to aides, Rangel was in the Democratic cloakroom Tuesday evening, working out the details of a temporary resignation with House parliamentarian and Democratic leaders.      But upon leaving the meeting, Rangel was asked by reporters if he would remain chairman, and he replied, “You bet your life.” Pelosi, who was at the meeting, declined to comment.      Rangel also said he was still the chairman, and denied that he was stepping down as chairman.      Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., is next in line in seniority and would be the most likely person to take over at least temporarily.      ABC News' Dean Norland contributed to this report. ||||| Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel is still clinging to his gavel, but it is no longer a question of if – but when, how and to whom – he will give it up, according to Democratic insiders.      With his ethics problems becoming an albatross around the necks of his party’s most politically vulnerable members, the venerable New York Democrat was pushed deep into a corner Tuesday night – meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a covey of aides in her ceremonial office in the southeast corner of the Capitol.      He insisted he that he is still chairman of the powerful tax-writing committee but couldn’t guarantee that would still be the case by the end of today.      “I can’t make all those promises at my age,” he said as he left the meeting with Pelosi late Tuesday.      Republicans are ready to a force a floor vote on whether he should be stripped of his chairmanship, and that’s a lose-lose proposition for Rangel. For him to win that kind of vote, some Democrats in tough swing districts – including those in his home state of New York – would have to put themselves in further electoral jeopardy by backing him up.      Last week’s ethics committee judgment that Rangel violated House gift rules by accepting travel to the Caribbean appeared to be the last straw for many of his rank-and-file colleagues. Even as House Democratic leaders said over the weekend that they would await the outcome of the committee’s work on several other allegations against Rangel, so-called Frontline Democrats – those the party has identified as most vulnerable to defeat in November – began making their decisions to dump Rangel.      If all House members vote and all 178 Republicans favor removing Rangel, the GOP would need 39 Democrats to help oust him.      The public list of Democratic defectors was still less than half that Tuesday night, but Democratic lawmakers and aides said the ranks were swelling quickly behind closed doors.      The group that has publicly abandoned Rangel includes not just members who are in danger of losing their seats but also at least three – Artur Davis who is running for governor of Alabama and Reps. Brad Ellsworth and Paul Hodes, who are seeking Senate seats in Indiana and New Hampshire, respectively.      Those camps could easily be joined by “good government” liberals who are uncomfortable not only with the first judgment against Rangel but also the scope and nature of the allegations against him: that he failed to pay taxes on a Dominican rental property, that he improperly solicited funds for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York, that he broke New York City rules by maintaining multiple rent-regulated apartments and that he omitted hundreds of thousands of dollars of income and assets from financial disclosure forms that lawmakers are required to file with the House.      As the defections mounted, press aides were quick to send out releases to reporters working on the story – or at least make sure their bosses were included on lists of those who would not support Rangel in a floor vote. ||||| New York Rep. Charles Rangel temporarily stepped aside as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday as he struggled with mounting ethics woes that left his political future uncertain at best.      Rangel's decision cheered Democrats who feared political fallout affecting their own futures, but did little to satisfy Republicans who had been seeking a formal vote bringing about his temporary removal from the chairmanship.      The 20-term congressman has played a key role in President Barack Obama's attempts to win passage of historic health care legislation. Veteran Rep. Fortney \\"Pete\\" Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the panel, will serve as acting chairman.      First elected in 1970, Rangel is among the longest-serving African-American members of Congress, ranking just behind Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in seniority, and he was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Rep. Barbara Lee of California, the caucus chairman, said, \\"We look forward to the conclusion of the investigation and to him resuming his position as chairman.\\"      A number of questions have been raised about the 79-year-old Rangel's conduct. Ethics investigators are looking into his use of his official position to raise money for a New York college center to be named after him and his belated disclosure of at least hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets and his use of rent-controlled apartments in New York.      Republicans had been calling for Rangel to step aside since last year, and these demands multiplied after the House ethics panel last Friday released a report accusing him of violating House gift rules in connection with a series of trips he took to the Caribbean.      The panel said that he had violated standards of conduct by accepting 2007 and 2008 trips to Caribbean conferences that were financed by corporations. It said it could not prove whether Rangel knew of the corporate payments but concluded that members of his staff knew about them — and the congressman was responsible for their actions.      For his part, Rangel said he didn't even have \\"constructive knowledge\\" of the corporate sponsorship of the trips and couldn't be held responsible for something staff members may have known but which he didn't.      His political problems were compounded by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's promise to drain the swamp of ethics problems after Democrats took over the House — following a 2006 campaign accusing Republicans of fostering a culture of corruption.      Rangel called his news conference Wednesday on short notice, telling reporters, \\"My chairmanship is bringing so much attention to the press, and in order to avoid my colleagues having to defend me during their elections, I have this morning sent a letter\\" asking to be granted \\"a leave of absence until such time as the ethics committee completes its work.\\"      Rangel said later Wednesday that his stepping aside \\"should take care of the political problem\\" that other Democrats have as a result of his ethics problems.      \\"It just seems to me that I should not do anything that would impede the success of other Democrats,\\" he told reporters.      Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said Rangel told a party meeting \\"There are things that are bigger than yourself,\\" including his love for his city and state and the important matters before Congress.      \\"I think he stands taller in the minds of many people in our caucus for doing it,\\" Larson said.      Pelosi met with Rangel Tuesday night and declined to endorse his continuing on as chairman. She said Wednesday in a statement, \\"I commend Chairman Rangel for his decades of leadership on jobs, health care, and the most significant economic issues of the day.\\"      Fundraising power      Rangel has raised considerable money for fellow Democrats. His leadership political action committee raised 2.2 million in the 2008 election cycle and spent 2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He also raises money through a Rangel Victory Fund.      Republican campaign officials have started criticizing individual Democrats for holding on to chunks of campaign contributions that resulted from Rangel's fundraising.      As an example of his eroding support, several Democratic House members said they were giving campaign donations affiliated with Rangel away to charity.      Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona is giving up 14,000; Debbie Halvorson of Illinois, 16,000; and Jim Himes of Connecticut, 16,000.      Rangel set up the Rangel Victory Fund, to raise cash for his House campaign and for the political action committee. In 2009, most of its fundraising benefited Rangel's campaign. The Rangel Victory Fund steered at least 479,000 to Rangel's House campaign and roughly 70,000 to his National Leadership PAC last year.      The National Leadership PAC directed 10,000 to Democratic congressional candidates: 2,000 to Senate candidate Michael Capuano of Massachusetts and 1,000 each to New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Reps. Jim Himes of Connecticut, Debbie Halvorson of Illinois and Gary Peters of Michigan and New York Reps. Michael McMahon, Carolyn Maloney, Dan Maffei and Eric Massa. The fund spent at least 60,000 last year on a birthday gala fundraiser Rangel held at the historic Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named Charles Rangel, who is very important in making decisions about taxes, is having some trouble.

For some unknown reason , her red blood cells were attacking each other . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What may be the reason that Remy ’s red blood cells start attacking each other ?","output":"I'm not a veterinarian, but there could be several potential reasons that Remy's red blood cells were attacking each other, leading to her not feeling well. Here are some possible causes: 1. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA): This is a condition where the dog's immune system mistakenly identifies its own red blood cells as foreign substances and attacks them. This results in a rapid decrease in the number of red blood cells, leading to anemia. IMHA can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary, where it is triggered by an underlying condition such as an infection, cancer, or reaction to a drug. 2. Parasite infection: Certain parasites, such as Babesia species, can invade and destroy red blood cells, leading to anemia. These parasites are often transmitted through tick bites, and diagnosing the infection usually involves testing the blood for the presence of the parasite. 3. Toxic exposure: Ingestion of certain chemicals, toxins, or drugs can cause oxidative damage to red blood cells and lead to their destruction. Common examples include ingestion of zinc (commonly found in pennies and other metal objects), onions or garlic (toxic to dogs), and certain medications, including over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. 4. Genetic disorders: Some dogs might be predisposed to red blood cell abnormalities due to genetic factors. Hereditary spherocytosis, for instance, is a rare congenital disorder that affects the stability and shape of red blood cells, making them more susceptible to rupturing. Certain breeds, such as Cocker Spaniels and Basenjis, may be more prone to these types of genetic conditions. 5. Underlying illness: In some cases, red blood cell destruction could be a result of an underlying disease or condition, such as cancer (e.g., lymphoma or leukemia), liver or kidney failure, or autoimmune disorders. In such instances, the reason for red blood cells attacking each other is a consequence of the primary illness affecting the body. In summary, there are various potential reasons that Remy's red blood cells started attacking each other, ranging from immune-mediated hemolytic anemia to toxic exposure or an underlying illness.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Problem:Paragraph: Virus attachment to host cells is mediated by dedicated virion proteins, which specifically recognize one or, at most, a limited number of cell surface molecules. Receptor binding often involves protein-protein interactions, but carbohydrates may serve as receptor determinants as well. In fact, many different viruses use members of the sialic acid family either as their main receptor or as an initial attachment factor. Sialic acids (Sias) are 9-carbon negativelycharged monosaccharides commonly occurring as terminal residues of glycoconjugates. They come in a large variety and are differentially expressed in cells and tissues. By targeting specific Sia subtypes, viruses achieve host cell selectivity, but only to a certain extent. The Sia of choice might still be abundantly present on non-cell associated molecules, on non-target cells (including cells already infected) and even on virus particles themselves. This poses a hazard, as high-affinity virion binding to any of such \\"false\\" receptors would result in loss of infectivity. Some enveloped RNA viruses deal with this problem by encoding virionassociated receptor-destroying enzymes (RDEs). These enzymes make the attachment to Sia reversible, thus providing the virus with an escape ticket. RDEs occur in two types: neuraminidases and sialate-O-acetylesterases. The latter, originally discovered in influenza C virus, are also found in certain nidoviruses, namely in group 2 coronaviruses and in toroviruses, as well as in infectious salmon anemia virus, an orthomyxovirus of teleosts. Here, the structure, function and evolution of viral sialate-O-acetylesterases is re-R.J.d.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: A runner’s high is a subjective sense of well-being some humans experience after prolonged exercise. For decades, it was hypothesized that exercise-induced endorphin release is solely responsible for a runner’s high, but recent evidence has suggested that endocannabinoids also may play a role. Here, we demonstrate that wheel running increases endocannabinoids and reduces both anxiety and sensation of pain in mice. Ablation of cannabinoid receptor 1 receptors on GABAergic neurons inhibits running-induced anxiolysis, and pharmacological blockage of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors inhibits analgesia. We thus show for the first time to our knowledge that cannabinoid receptors are crucial for main aspects of a runner’s high.      Abstract      Exercise is rewarding, and long-distance runners have described a runner’s high as a sudden pleasant feeling of euphoria, anxiolysis, sedation, and analgesia. A popular belief has been that endogenous endorphins mediate these beneficial effects. However, running exercise increases blood levels of both β-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid). Using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic, and behavioral studies in mice, we demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors mediate acute anxiolysis and analgesia after running. We show that anxiolysis depends on intact cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) receptors on forebrain GABAergic neurons and pain reduction on activation of peripheral CB1 and CB2 receptors. We thus demonstrate that the endocannabinoid system is crucial for two main aspects of a runner's high. Sedation, in contrast, was not influenced by cannabinoid or opioid receptor blockage, and euphoria cannot be studied in mouse models. ||||| ALTANTA (CBS Atlanta)– The “high” you get after running may be linked to the same high you get from smoking weed, according to a new study.      Researchers found the post-exercise feeling of euphoria provides a similar effect as smoking marijuana due to the brain’s cannabinoid receptors that relieve pain, as reported by Daily Mail.      University of Hamburg and University of Heidelberg researchers studied cannabinoid receptors in mice after they ran. Previous research indicates that the pleasant feeling associated with a runner’s high is due to raised levels of beta-endorphins.      However, the new findings suggest that these endorphins are actually too large to get through the blood-brain barrier and that it’s more likely the feeling is associated with the cannabinoid receptors. These receptors can affect appetite, pain, mood, and memory.      “Running exercise increases blood levels of both beta-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid),” the researchers wrote.      Researchers tested the theory by conditioning a group of mice to run on a treadmill, they were then separated into two groups. One group ran on the treadmill for five hours while the other group stayed inactive.      Both groups were then evaluated for reduced anxiety by seeing how the mice behaved in the dark and by testing their tolerance for pain.      A second experiment used all the same factors, but also gave the mice endocannabinoid and endorphin antagonists that blocked the effects. This time the mice who ran showed no results of a runner’s high.      “[This shows] for the first time to our knowledge that cannabinoid receptors are crucial for main aspects of a runner’s high,” study authors note. ||||| Photo      Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.      We’ve probably all heard someone exclaim, “Ah, my endorphins are kicking in!” at the end of a good run. Endorphins are famous for supposedly producing “runner’s high,” that fleeting sense of calm and euphoria that engulfs many of us after a satisfying workout.      But in fact, endorphins may be unfairly hogging the credit for making workouts enjoyable, according to an enlightening new experiment with animals. The findings suggest that endorphins have little to do with runner’s high. Instead, that euphoric feeling may be the product of a completely different but oddly familiar substance — the body’s own endocannabinoids, the chemicals that, like the cannabinoids in marijuana, lighten mood.      Endorphins first became a household word in the 1980s, when researchers found that blood levels increased after prolonged exercise. This finding made sense. Exercise can cause discomfort or pain, and endorphins are the body’s self-produced opiates, with pain-relieving properties much like morphine.      From that discovery, it was a short step to believing that endorphins must also produce the pleasurable mental sensations that many people feel after exercise.      But there is a substantial problem with that idea, and it involves the substantial-ness of endorphins. They are large molecules, too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier. They might staunch pain in the muscles, but they wouldn’t have effects directly inside the brain, where any high would originate.      So for the past decade or so, scientists have been looking for other substances that might be involved in making exercisers feel high, which led them, perhaps unsurprisingly, to endocannabinoids.      Endocannabinoids are, essentially, internally produced marijuana, or cannabis. Cannabis contains cannabinoid molecules, which are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier and attach there to receptors, producing a floaty, hey-dude high.      In recent years, scientists have found that exercise raises the levels of endocannabinoids in the bloodstreams of people and animals, making these molecules good candidates to underlie the runner’s high.      But few studies have directly compared the effects of endorphins and endocannabinoids to determine which really makes exercise mildly intoxicating.      So for the new study, which was published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers with the Central Institute of Mental Health at the University of Heidelberg medical school in Mannheim, Germany, rounded up healthy lab mice, tested their anxiety levels by putting them in cages with pockets of darkness and light (anxious animals stick to the shadows), and then gave them running wheels.      Mice generally like running, engaging in the activity even when they are not being pursued. That suggests, researchers believe, that they gain some kind of mental satisfaction or reward from it, experiencing the mouse version of a runner’s high.      That possibility was borne out in an early portion of the new experiment, when the scientists noted elevated levels of both endorphins and endocannabinoids in the animals’ bloodstreams after running. The scientists also found that the animals were more tranquil after running, spending longer periods of time in lighted areas within their cages — something that anxious, twitchy animals won’t do — and that they were more pain tolerant when exposed to slight physical discomfort.      In general, these post-running mice were more chill than before.      But when the researchers used drugs to block the workings of some of the animals’ endocannabinoid system, so that receptors in the animals’ brains couldn’t take up the molecules, their post-run cool disappeared. The animals proved to be as anxious then after running as they had been before and very sensitive to pain.      Without a working endocannabinoid system, they developed no runner’s high.      However, when the researchers similarly blocked the animals’ response to endorphins, while leaving their endocannabinoid system unchanged, the mice enjoyed all of the soothing effects of running. They were calmer in their cages afterward and seemed to experience less sensitivity to pain.      Even without the ability to respond to endorphins, in other words, they experienced the rodent version of a runner’s high, strongly suggesting that endorphins do not contribute to the high, but endocannabinoids do.      The practical implications of these results are somewhat limited, of course, because they involve mice, not people, and tell us only what goes into creating a runner’s high and not how to ensure that we will feel that same post-run serenity.      One possible if slightly disheartening lesson of the study could be, in fact, that we may need to cover considerable mileage in order to experience a runner’s high; the mice in the study, small as they are, averaged more than three miles every day on their wheels.      More broadly encouraging, though, the results should remind us that, like mice, we were built through evolution to be in motion. Our ancestors ran to avoid danger and hunt food. For them, “reduced sensations of pain and less anxiety through long-distance running would have been a benefit,” says Johannes Fuss, now a professor at the University of Hamburg, who led the new study.      To survive as a species, we seem to have needed to run, and nature obligingly found ways to make this strenuous movement pleasurable by providing us with a runner’s high.      So the subtle upshot of the new study may be that we should run. And if we don’t feel a high, perhaps try running more, until eventually a gentle euphoria may settle in and we can turn to our running companion and say, “Ah, my endocannabinoids are kicking in at last!”      Related: ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Sure, I can explain this in a simpler way. You know how when you play a lot and run around, sometimes you feel really, really happy afterward? That's called a runner's high. Scientists used to think this happy feeling only came from something inside us called endorphins. But this article is talking about a new study that says something else inside us might also make us feel happy after running. This something else is called endocannabinoids, which work in a similar way as a substance in the plant that makes people feel relaxed, called marijuana. To understand better, these scientists made mice run a lot and saw that not only did the mice seem happier and less scared, but they also didn't feel as much pain. But, if the scientists made it so the mice's bodies couldn't use endocannabinoids, the mice didn't get that happy, relaxed feeling after running. So, they think endocannabinoids might be an important part of that happy feeling we get after lots of exercise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: EPA estimates on drilling pollution unreliable, report says WASHINGTON – Limited data and unreliable estimates on air pollution from oil and natural gas production is hindering the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to police the drilling boom, the agency's internal watchdog said in a report released Thursday. Inspector General Arthur Elkins Jr. said the EPA has failed to directly measure emissions from some pieces of equipment and processes, and some estimates it does have are of \\"questionable quality.\\" \\"With limited data, human health risks are uncertain, states may design incorrect or ineffective emission control strategies, and EPA's decisions about regulating industry may be misinformed,\\" Elkins said. The EPA, under President Barack Obama, has stepped up regulation of natural gas drilling, which has been booming thanks to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. About 25,000 wells a year are being fracked, a process in which water, chemicals and sand are injected at high pressure underground to release trapped natural gas. Obama also wants to expand natural gas production, as long as it doesn't damage the environment. Oil and gas production, from the well site to processing plants to storage tanks and transmission lines, releases toxic and cancer-causing air pollutants, smog-forming gases and methane, a potent greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. The oil and gas industry has said the EPA has overestimated emissions of methane and argued that they already were working to reduce pollution, without the agency's intervention. The EPA last year issued the first-ever standards to control smog- and soot-forming gases from gas wells site, and updated existing rules to reduce cancer-causing pollution, such as benzene, from other equipment. The agency, in response to the report, agreed to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve its pollution figures. An industry association, America's Natural Gas Alliance, had not seen the report and had no comment late Thursday.","output":"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is having trouble keeping an eye on air pollution from oil and natural gas production. They don't have enough information and some of the information they have is not very good. This makes it hard for them to protect people's health and make good decisions about rules for the industry. President Obama wants more natural gas production, but only if it doesn't hurt the environment.

The pilots of Northwest Flight 188 did not fall asleep when they overflew their destination by more than 100 miles in October, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight. The two pilots \\"became distracted by a conversation\\" about the airline's new work schedule system and by laptop computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about 1 hour and 17 minutes while they cruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, destination at 37,000 feet, the NTSB said. The safety board also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings. The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errant flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U.S. military in cases where the FAA loses contact with commercial aircraft. According to the account, the flight from San Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region. There, air traffic controllers directed the crew of the Airbus A-320 to change their radio frequency. The co-pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency. However, neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controllers directed the crew to contact Minneapolis. The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132.125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132.17) it is \\"likely the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change by pushing an activation button. Nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller.\\" The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner. \\"These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,\\" the NTSB said. Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot's actions. When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer tutored the captain using their computers, the NTSB said. \\"The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,\\" the board said. \\"Both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188.\\" The laptop computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatchers and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane's primary flight display, the NTSB said. Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the laptops, the NTSB said. Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time. The captain \\"looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Eau Claire [Wisconsin] to his right,\\" the board said. The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmitters. The NTSB faulted the FAA for not catching the pilots' errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change. \\"Neither sector controller's relief briefing included information that communication had not been established\\" with the plane, the NTSB said. The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic radar handoffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next. \\"Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact,\\" the safety board said. Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector's controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls, the board said. Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatchers, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as \\"emergency\\" or \\"mayday\\" that may have helped capture the pilots' attention, the NTSB said. The pilots did not respond. As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents. Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the licenses of Capt. Timothy Bryan Cheney and First Officer Richard Irwin Cole, saying their lack of awareness that they had overflown the Minneapolis airport was \\"completely unacceptable\\" and \\"put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy.\\" But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to reapply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed. A spokesman for Delta Airlines, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines' internal investigation is continuing. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that the pilots of Northwest Flight 188 did not fall asleep when they missed their destination by over 100 miles. Instead, the two pilots were distracted by a conversation about the airline's new work schedule system and using laptop computers against company policy. Communication with air traffic control was lost for around 1 hour and 17 minutes, which led the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, suspend them from flying, and adopt new contact procedures. The NTSB also criticized the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for air traffic control shortcomings, as the pilots failed to establish radio contact in two sectors. As a result of the investigation, the safety board recommended measures to prevent similar incidents. In a settlement, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA allowed them to reapply for their licenses earlier than usual."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 16:37 EST, 17 January 2013 | UPDATED: 19:30 EST, 17 January 2013 A 12-year-old boy described today how he watched his twin brother slowly die of dehydration, but was too scared of his step-mother to give him water. Joseph James said he knew something was wrong with his fraternal twin brother Johnathan James in August 2011, but he was terrified of doing anything. Joseph's step-mother Tina Alberson and his father Michael James, of both Dallas, Texas, face life in prison over charges that they caused 10-year-old Jonathan's death by depriving him of water. Devastated: Joseph James, 12, (left) testified about watching his fraternal twin brother Jonathan slowly die of dehydration after he was deprived of water He described the moment Alberson told him","output":"that his brother was being punished for theft by having his water intake restricted. Joseph recounted that Johnathan was severely punished and confined to a room without water for days. Joseph knew his brother was in tremendous pain and desperate for water, but the fear of his step-mother and the potential consequences prevented him from intervening. In the days that followed, Joseph continued to watch helplessly as Johnathan's condition worsened. He described seeing his brother's lips go dry, his energy fade, and him becoming increasingly weak as his body succumbed to the effects of dehydration. One fateful evening, Joseph heard a thud from the room where Johnathan was kept. He found his brother passed out and called out for help, but despite his parents attempting CPR, Johnathan could not be revived. Authorities were informed, and an investigation was launched into Johnathan's tragic and untimely death. Medical examiners confirmed that Johnathan had died due to severe dehydration, and the gruesome details of his unfathomable suffering emerged during the trial. As the case against Joseph's step-mother Tina Alberson and his father Michael James unraveled in court, details of their abusive behavior began to surface, utterly shocking the community. Both parents were portrayed as cruel and heartless individuals who subjected their son to a barbaric form of punishment - one that ultimately ended in his death.  After all the evidence was presented, the jury found the parents, Tina Alberson and Michael James, guilty of first-degree murder for causing Johnathan's death. They were both sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  As for Joseph, following the harrowing loss of his beloved twin brother, and having to testify against his own parents in court at such a young age, he was taken into the care of Child Protective Services and placed in a foster home. Throughout the years, he received significant support from a loving foster family, therapy to heal from the trauma, and community resources that helped him rebuild a life beyond those tragic events. Joseph was determined not to become a product of his upbringing; instead, he channeled his pain and emotions into advocacy. As he grew older, he dedicated his life to raising awareness about child abuse and neglect and played an active role in helping other children who had faced similar circumstances. Ultimately, the tragic story of Johnathan's untimely death brought the horrors of child abuse and neglect to light. Joseph's resilience and strength gave hope to countless others, and his efforts led to the implementation of stricter laws and regulations, ensuring that the welfare and safety of children would be a top priority for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - Childrens Hospital (originally titled Children's Hospital as webisodes) is a satirical American comedy television series and web series that parodies the medical drama genre, created by and starring actor/comedian Rob Corddry.

The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river.

Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON--A baby born with the virus that causes AIDS appears to have been cured, scientists announced Sunday, describing the case of a child from Mississippi who's now 2.5 and has been off medication for about a year with no signs of infection. There's no evidence that shows that the child will remain healthy, although complex testing uncovered just traces of the virus' genetic material still lingering . If so, it would mark only the world' s second reported cure. Specialists say Sunday's announcement, at a major AIDS meeting in Atlanta, offers promising clues for efforts to remove HIV infection in children, especially in African countries where too many babies are born with the virus. \\"You could call this about as close to a cure,\\" Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, who is familiar with the findings, told The Associated Press.     A doctor gave this baby faster and stronger treatment than usual, starting a three-drug mixture within 30 hours of birth. That was before tests confirmed the infant was infected and not just at risk from a mother whose HIV wasn't diagnosed until she was in labor . \\"I just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,\\" Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi, said in an interview. That fast action apparently knocked out HIV in the baby's blood before it could form hideouts in the body. Those so-called reservoirs of dormant cells usually rapidly reinfect anyone who stops medication, said Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins Children's Center. Next, Persaud's team is planning a study to try to prove that, with more aggressive treatment of other high-risk babies. \\"Maybe we'll be able to block this reservoir seeding.\\" Persaud said. No one should stop anti-AIDS drugs as a result of this case, Fauci warned. Which of the following is NOT true? A) The doctor treated the baby with a three-drug mixture. B) The baby got unusual treatment within 30 hours of birth. C) Tests before birth showed the baby was infected with HIV. D) The mother was diagnosed with HIV when she gave birth.

Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation.  Question: suppose isotope has less protons happens, how will it affect isotope loses more atomic particles.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. Step 1: Consider the isotope with less protons. Step 2: Analyze how this will impact the isotope's instability. Since the isotope has fewer protons, its instability may be lessened. Step 3: Examine the relationship between instability and the emission of radiation. A less unstable isotope will emit less radiation than a more unstable one. Step 4: Reflect on the decay process. An isotope that emits less radiation will also experience a slower decay process. Step 5: Consider the loss of atomic particles. Given that the isotope's decay process is slower, it will lose atomic particles at a reduced rate. Step 6: The reduced rate of losing atomic particles will result in a smaller change in the isotope's overall makeup. Step 7: The isotope turning into a different element may be less pronounced or take longer to occur, due to the slower decay process. Step 8: Given the overall slower decay and fewer particle losses, the influence of the supposed perturbation of having less protons has a lessened effect on the second effect mentioned (isotope losing more atomic particles)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish were almost all Roman Catholics and had fought en masse for the Stuart dynasty in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 1640s, in the hope of securing religious toleration and political self-government. They had been defeated by 1652 and were punished by the English Commonwealth regime with land confiscations and penal legislation. They were largely disappointed with the failure of King Charles II to completely reverse this situation in the Act of Settlement 1662. The majority of Irish people were \\"Jacobites\\" and supported James II due to his 1687 Declaration of Indulgence or, as it is also known, the Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination. James had given them some concrete concessions in the 1680s by appointing an Irish Catholic, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell as Lord Deputy of Ireland, and by re-admitting Catholics as Army officers and into other public offices. When James fled England in 1688 he looked to Ireland to muster support for a re-conquest of his Three Kingdoms. In 1689 he held what became known as the \\"Patriot Parliament\\" in Dublin, which reversed the confiscations of the 1650s and confirmed his support from most of the Irish landed gentry. Ironically, while Irish Catholics supported King James en masse, the Papal States had joined the League of Augsburg. Pope Innocent XI had lent William of Orange 150,000 Scudi for war purposes through his family's bank before his death in 1689. What happened first William of Orange's death, or the Declaration of Indulgence?","output":"The Declaration of Indulgence happened first. James II issued the Declaration of Indulgence, also known as the Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, in 1687. This declaration granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland. On the other hand, William of Orange (William III) died later, on March 8, 1702. The Declaration of Indulgence was one of the reasons Irish Catholics supported James II, while William of Orange received financial support from Pope Innocent XI to aid in his fight against James II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Scan the poem for words that jump out at you or feel important. You may notice certain words are repeated several times or referring to throughout the poem. Select 1-2 keywords to create a title that provides the reader with a glimpse of what the poem is about. For example, you may choose keywords like “good” and “sister,” creating a title like “The Good Sister” or “Be good, Sister.” You can also look up the keywords in the poem and find other words that mean the same thing, but have a better sound or ring to them. For example, you may use a synonym for “good” to create a title like, “The Excellent Sister” or “My Precious Sister.” If the poem has a main character or characters who are named, use their names in the title. If there is a main setting or place referred to in the poem, use it in the title to help ground the reader. For example, if your poem focuses on a girl named Eva and her pet swan, you may use a title like “Eva and the Swan.” If your poem is about a Denny’s in your hometown of Sturgis, you may use a title like “Denny’s in Sturgis” or “Denny’s, Sturgis.” Focus on any verbs or adjectives that stand out to you in the poem and highlight them in the title. Find 1 verb or 1-2 adjectives and place them together. For example, you may choose a verb like “beating” and create a title like, “Beating” or “I Beat.” Or you may pick adjectives like “blue,” “dying,” and “stunning” to create a title like, “Dying Blue” or “Stunning Blue.” If your poem has lines that repeat or a verse that appears several times in the poem, use it as the title. Often, lines or verse that repeats are important and worth highlighting for the reader. For example, you may take a repeating line like “she jumped high in track and field” to create a title like “High in Track and Field” or “She Jumped.” Draw the reader in and engage them with an image that is memorable, strange, or interesting. Find an image that feels important in the poem and use it in the title so your reader is encouraged to keep reading.  >  Avoid picking an image that might give away the crux or turn in the poem. The image should provide some context for the reader but not give any revelations in the poem away. For example, you may use an image of a woman leaping over hurdle on the field, red dirt flying in her wake in the poem, and create a title like, “Red Dirt Flys” or “Woman Leaps.” The last line usually contains key details about the subject matter in the poem. Pick out an image or words in the last line and use them in the title. For example, if you have a last line like, “She ran off the field, in victory,” you may create a title like, “In Victory.”","output":"To create a fitting title for a poem, analyze it for important keywords, characters, or settings. Consider using synonyms for keywords or focusing on verbs and adjectives that stand out. Repeated lines can serve as a title, as can memorable or intriguing images from the poem. Avoid revealing the poem's main twist using an image or words from the last line to give some context without spoiling the content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"She has kissed she,\\" I will analyze it using grammar rules and syntactic structure.  Step 1: Determining the parts of speech \\"She\\" is a pronoun that typically stands for a female subject in a sentence. The verb \\"has kissed\\" is a present perfect tense verb which indicates that the action of kissing has occurred in the past and may have relevance to the present. Step 2: Analyzing the sentence structure  The sentence structure appears to follow Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. However, there is an issue with the object pronoun \\"she.\\" In this structure, it is grammatically correct to use an object pronoun, such as \\"her,\\" instead of the subject pronoun \\"she.\\" Step 3: Correcting the sentence To maintain linguistic integrity, the sentence should be corrected to \\"She has kissed her.\\" This change ensures that the correct object pronoun is used, and the sentence now follows proper SVO order and grammar rules. In conclusion, the original sentence \\"She has kissed she\\" has a low linguistic integrity due to the use of an incorrect object pronoun. By correcting the sentence to \\"She has kissed her,\\" the linguistic integrity is significantly improved, resulting in a grammatically correct and coherent statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Arthur succeeds as King of Britain? ?  Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again.

Review: emerge dazed , confused as to whether you 've seen pornography or documentary  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as predominantly negative, with some undertones of ambiguity.  First and foremost, the use of words like \\"dazed\\" and \\"confused\\" suggests a sense of disorientation and bewilderment, which is usually not a positive reaction one would expect from a movie review. These words indicate that the viewer experienced difficulty in understanding the movie's content or purpose, with the possibility that the film failed to convey a clear message or theme. Additionally, the comparison of the movie's content to \\"pornography or documentary\\" raises uncertainty about the quality and intention of the film. By mentioning these two contrasting genres, the reviewer seems to question the direction and focus of the movie. In general, the audiences typically expect well-defined and structured narratives in movies, and this apparent confusion about the film's genre could imply that the film may have lacked coherent storytelling. However, the mention of \\"pornography or documentary\\" might also add a certain degree of ambiguity and intrigue to the review. Some readers might argue that the reviewer's comparison demonstrates the film's unique or challenging nature, pushing the boundaries of conventional storytelling. As a result, some readers who seek unusual or disruptive film experiences might interpret this unexpected comparison as an indication that the movie may be a hidden gem or a daring work that pushes the viewer out of their comfort zone. In conclusion, the review mainly projects a negative outlook on the movie, but the choice of words might generate ambiguity and curiosity for specific readers. This sentence suggests that the movie failed to deliver a clear-cut experience, which could potentially be a result of ineffective storytelling or unconventional narrative structures, deterring the general audience and raising questions about the film's quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Anchovy\\" said in Finnish?","output":"In Finnish, the word \\"anchovy\\" is translated as \\"sardelli.\\" Finnish, like other languages, has its unique set of rules and vocabulary, which makes it distinct from English and many other languages. The anchovy is a small fish, typically found in the Mediterranean region, and it is widely used in various cuisines worldwide, including Finnish cuisine. Although Finnish and English are unrelated languages, there might be some similarities in the translation of words, as various languages can borrow words from each other over time. For instance, in some European languages, the word anchovy is relatively similar to its English equivalent, like \\"anchois\\" in French and \\"anchoa\\" in Spanish. However, when it comes to the Finnish language, which belongs to the Uralic family, loanwords aren't as common.

The first part of the tweet, \\"Hospitals are the lowest point,\\" clearly depicts a negative sentiment. It indicates that the individual is going through a rough time, probably due to illness, injury or some distress related to hospitals. It could also be something concerning a loved one. This statement exhibits frustration, bitterness, or sadness, none of which carry a positive connotation. However, the second part of the tweet, \\"... Tuesday will be better right?\\" offers a glimmer of hope and optimism, indicating a small positive sentiment. The person seems to be trying to look forward to a better day or situation, signaling an attempt to move past the negativity, probably looking for affirmation or encouragement.  It's important to note though that this positive sentiment is also tinged with uncertainty and insecurity, evident in the \\"right?\\" at the end of the statement. Other than expressing hope for a better future, the user seems to be seeking validation or assurance that things will indeed get better. In summary, while the tweet does contain elements of both negative and positive sentiments, the overall tone could be considered negative, given the stronger emphasis on the challenging circumstances related to hospitals and the struggle the individual appears to be going through.

Mr Bertrand said he wanted a new deal in which migrants hoping to claim asylum in the UK would be able to do so at a \\"hotspot\\" in France. Those who failed would be deported directly to their country of origin. Calais has become the focal point of France's refugee crisis. The Jungle camp is expanding and almost every night people there try to hide inside vehicles entering the port and the Channel Tunnel to get to Britain. Mr Bertrand wants changes to the bilateral agreement between France and the UK called the Treaty of Le Touquet. Under the treaty, British immigration officials check passports in Calais and their French counterparts do this in Dover. Mr Bertrand does not have the power to change the treaty but two of the candidates thought most likely to win next year's French presidential election support his idea that it be either reformed or annulled. It is understood Home Secretary Amber Rudd will go to Paris this week to discuss the treaty.

Earlier this month, local councils in the UK said they should be involved in assessing the needs of child migrants in Calais before they arrive in the UK.

Can you tell me the answer to where does the water in whitewater ca come from??","output":"Whitewater, California is a small community located in Riverside County, near Palm Springs. The water supply in Whitewater comes from various sources, including local groundwater, imported water, and the Whitewater River. A detailed explanation of each source is provided below. 1. Local Groundwater: Whitewater, like many communities in Riverside County, relies on local groundwater as a major source of its water supply. The groundwater comes from underground aquifers, which are natural reservoirs of water stored in permeable rock formations beneath the Earth's surface. These aquifers are replenished through a process called groundwater recharge, where water from precipitation, snowmelt, and runoff percolates through the soil and collects in the aquifer. In Whitewater, the primary aquifers are located in the San Gorgonio Pass Groundwater Basin and the Upper Coachella Valley Groundwater Basin. Through wells and pumping stations, water is extracted from these aquifers and transported to the community for their drinking, sanitation, and irrigation needs. 2. Imported Water: In addition to relying on local groundwater, Whitewater also receives imported water from other sources. This imported water is primarily sourced from the State Water Project (SWP) and the Colorado River Aqueduct (CRA).  The SWP is a network of reservoirs, aqueducts, and pumping stations that deliver water from Northern California to Southern California. Whitewater receives a portion of its water supply from Lake Perris, a major reservoir in the SWP, which is managed by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) and the Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD). The CRA is a 242-mile-long aqueduct system that transports water from the Colorado River to Southern California. Managed by the MWDSC, the CRA provides water to Whitewater as part of the desert region's water allocation. The imported water from both the SWP and CRA is used to supplement local groundwater resources, ensuring a reliable water supply for the community. 3. Whitewater River: The Whitewater River also serves as a vital water source for the community. Originating from the San Gorgonio Wilderness, the river flows southwest through the San Gorgonio Pass, passing through the community of Whitewater before eventually joining the Coachella Valley Stormwater Channel.  The Whitewater River helps recharge local groundwater basins through natural percolation as well as a process called \\"spreading,\\" where water from the river is diverted to recharge basins to infiltrate the ground and replenish the aquifers. The local water agencies, like the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) and the Desert Water Agency (DWA), operate these spreading facilities along the Whitewater River for groundwater replenishment purposes. In summary, the water supply in Whitewater, California comes from a combination of local groundwater, imported water from the State Water Project and the Colorado River Aqueduct, and the Whitewater River. All these sources work together to ensure a reliable water supply for the community's needs while maintaining the health and sustainability of the local environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lily is almost fourteen years old and has an abusive father and no mother. In the first scene, a woman in a dress wanders around a room and goes back and forth in a closet. A marble rolls on the ground and a little girl is playing with a clear glass shooter marble and a mirror. The mother, Deborah Owens (Hilarie Burton) is taking clothes from the closet and putting them into a suitcase. Suddenly a man barges in and starts to rage at her, saying that she isn't going to leave him. He throws the suitcase onto the ground and grabs her roughly. The woman reaches for a gun in the closet and points it at the man, telling him that she just wants to go. The man wrestles the gun out of her hand and it falls on the ground. The child's hand goes to pick up the gun. The gun goes off and the scene fades to an older Lily lying in bed, her eyes open.\\"I killed my mother when I was four years old.

Given the question: Information:  - Amoraim (Aramaic: plural  , singular Amora  ; \\"those who say\\" or \\"those who speak over the people\\", or \\"spokesmen\\") refers to the Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE, who \\"said\\" or \\"told over\\" the teachings of the Oral Torah. They were concentrated in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The \\"Amoraim\\" followed the \\"Tannaim\\" in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The \\"Tannaim\\" were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the \\"Amoraim\\" expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification.  - Jose the Galilean ( Hebrew :   , Yose HaGelili ) , d. 15 Av , was a Jewish sage who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era . He was one of the Tannaim , the rabbis whose work was compiled in the Mishna . Jose was a contemporary and colleague of Rabbis Akiva , Tarfon , and Eleazar ben Azariah . Neither the name of his father nor the circumstances of his youth are known , though his name ( \`\` HaGelili '' ) indicates that he was a native of Galilee . He suffered from the prejudice commonly held against the Galileans by the Judeans ; on one occasion a woman who wanted to make a point with him began by calling him a \`\` stupid Galilean '' . When he entered the academy at Yavne , he was entirely unknown . It is also noted that he was extremely modest and addressed Tarfon as \`\` my master '' . He was , nevertheless , a thorough scholar even then , and his arguments nonplused both Tarfon and Akiva . His first appearance at Yavne thus obtained for him general recognition , and the two rabbis considered him not as a pupil , but as a colleague . Akiva was obliged to endure more than one sharp criticism from Jose , who once said to him : \`\` Though thou expound the whole day I shall not listen to thee '' . Tarfon expressed his high esteem of Jose by interpreting Daniel viii. 4 - 7 as though it contained an allusion to him : \`\` I saw the ram , that is , Akiva , and saw that no beast might stand before him ; and I beheld the he - goat , that is , Jose the Galilean , come , and cast him down to the ground . '' As a matter of fact , Jose was the only one who opposed Akiva successfully , and the latter frequently abandoned his own interpretation in favor of his opponent 's . Jose frequently showed a tendency to revert to the older Halakha , explaining the text according to its literal meaning Generally , though , his halakic exegesis differed little from that of Akiva , and both often employed the same rules of interpretation He taught that poultry may be cooked in milk and eaten , as was done in his own native...  - Av (\\"Av\\" \\"\\" \\"Abba\\"; from Akkadian \\"abu\\"; \\"father\\") is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin and appeared in the Talmud around the 3rd century. This is the only month which is not named in the Bible. It is a summer month of 30 days. Av usually occurs in JulyAugust on the Gregorian calendar.  - Tannaim (, singular , \\"Tanna\\" \\"repeaters\\", \\"teachers\\") were the Rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10-220 CE. The period of the \\"Tannaim\\", also referred to as the Mishnaic period, lasted about 210 years. It came after the period of the \\"Zugot\\" (\\"pairs\\"), and was immediately followed by the period of the \\"Amoraim\\" (\\"interpreters\\").  - Rabban Gamaliel II (also spelled Gamliel) was the first person to lead the Sanhedrin as Nasi after the fall of the second temple, which occurred in 70 CE. Gamliel was appointed nasi approximately 10 years later. Gamaliel II was the son of Shimon ben Gamaliel, one of Jerusalem's foremost men in the war against the Romans, and grandson of Gamaliel I. To distinguish him from the latter he is also called Gamliel of Yavne.  - The Sanhedrin (Hebrew: \\"sanhedrîn\\", Greek: , \\"synedrion\\", \\"sitting together,\\" hence \\"assembly\\" or \\"council\\") was an assembly of twenty-three to seventy-one men appointed in every city in the Land of Israel. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges who were given full authority over the people of Israel, who were commanded by God to obey every word the judges instructed and every law they established. Judges in ancient Israel were the religious leaders and Teachers of the nation of Israel. The Mishnah arrives at the number twenty-three based on an exegetical derivation: it must be possible for a \\"community\\" to vote for both conviction and exoneration. The minimum size of a \\"community\\" is 10 men (10 vs 10). One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs 10), but a simple majority cannot convict, and so an additional judge is required (12 vs 10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 (12 vs 10 and 1). This court dealt with only religious matters.  - The Gregorian calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582.  - Halakha (; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 \\"mitzvot\\" (\\"commandments\\"), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" (literally \\"Prepared Table\\", but more commonly known as the \\"Code of Jewish Law\\").  - Ezra ('; fl. 480440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe  and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe and a priest. According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah (Ezra 7:1) the last high priest to serve in the first temple (kings 2 25:18), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the second temple (chronicles 1 5:40-41. see also Ezra 3:2). He returned from the Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem (Ezra 710 and Neh 8). According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a high priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was only a common priest.   - The Shulchan Aruch (, literally: \\"Set Table\\") also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \\"the Code of Jewish Law.\\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written.  - Eleazar ben Azariah, was a 1st-century CE Jewish tanna, i.e. Mishnaic sage. He was of the second generation and a junior contemporary of Gamaliel II, Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, and Joshua b. Hananiah, and senior of Akiva. He was a kohen and traced his pedigree for ten generations back to Ezra, and was very wealthy. These circumstances, added to his erudition, gained for him great popularity. When Gamaliel II, in consequence of his provoking demeanor, was temporarily deposed from the patriarchate, Eleazar, though still very young, was elevated to that office by the deliberate choice of his colleagues. He did not, however, occupy it for any length of time, for the Sanhedrin reinstated Gamaliel. He was retained as vice-president (\\"ab bet din\\"), nevertheless, and it was arranged that Gamaliel should lecture three (some say two) Sabbaths, and Eleazar every fourth (or third) Sabbath.  - Zugot \\"Pairs\\" (\\"tqufath hazzughoth\\") refers to the hundred-year period during the time of the Second Temple (515 BCE  70 CE), in which the spiritual leadership of the Jews was in the hands of five successive generations of \\"zugoth\\" (\\"pairs\\") of religious teachers.

Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullam, Brad's mother, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fiancÃ©e Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullam, looking at nearby houses, having dinner.

Later in the first quarter after Jeff Feagles punted inside the one-yard line, LaVar Arrington sacked Drew Bledsoe in the endzone for a safety. In the second quarter, Giants kicker Jay Feely kicked a 31-yard field goal.  Dallas would score before halftime as Bledsoe ran 1-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak.  Bledsoe also threw a costly interception just before halftime that would have given the Cowboys a 14-12 lead at the break.

Not much had changed for the Giants in the third quarter as Manning threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey and Brandon Jacobs got a 3-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, the Romo completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens, and Romo ran into the endzone for a two-point conversion.

Write the answer: What fictional family has a gigantic, ominous butler named Lurch?","output":"The fictional family that has a gigantic, ominous butler named Lurch is the Addams Family. The Addams Family is a creation of American cartoonist Charles Addams, who introduced this peculiar and macabre household in a series of cartoons beginning in 1938, which were later published in The New Yorker magazine. Over the years, the Addams Family has been adapted into various forms of media, including television series, movies, and stage productions, making them a prominent part of popular culture. The Addams Family is composed of characters with eccentric personalities and sinister, yet endearing qualities. They embrace an unconventional and gothic lifestyle, which sets them apart from societal norms. The primary family members include Gomez Addams, the passionate and wealthy patriarch; Morticia Addams, the elegant and sophisticated matriarch; Wednesday Addams, the intelligent and morbid daughter; Pugsley Addams, the mischievous and macabre son; Uncle Fester, Gomez's oddball brother; Grandmama, the wise and mystical elderly relative; and Cousin Itt, a small, mysterious, and hairy creature. Lurch serves as the family's loyal butler and resembles a large, looming figure - often likened to Frankenstein's monster, both in terms of physical appearance and his stoic demeanor. Standing well over six feet tall, Lurch possesses superhuman strength and is almost entirely mute, save for his distinctive resonant groaning or occasional one-word responses. Despite his intimidating and ominous appearance, Lurch possesses a tender heart, and often shows great affection and concern for the members of the Addams family. Lurch dutifully attends to the needs of the family, often assisting with the children's dangerous and bizarre pursuits, undertaking tasks that cater to the family's peculiar tastes, and helping Gomez and Morticia execute their extravagant and sometimes macabre parties and events. He is also known to play the harpsichord, providing live musical accompaniment for the family's various activities. Throughout the various adaptations of the Addams Family, Lurch has been portrayed by several actors, most notably by Ted Cassidy in the original 1960s television series and Carel Struycken in the popular 1990s feature films. Regardless of the adaptation, Lurch continues to play a pivotal role in the Addams Family saga, faithfully carrying out his duties as the family's devoted butler while endearing himself to audiences with his unique blend of strength, silence, and steadfast loyalty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \\"Fort of Eidyn,\\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005–1034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. <sep>Where is the city of Edinburgh located?

Quezon City is not located in and should not be confused with Quezon Province, which was also named after the president. It is the largest city in Metro Manila in terms of land area and most populated local government unit in the country.  - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - The Ateneo de Manila University Law School (often referred to as Ateneo Law School) is the law school of the Ateneo de Manila University, a private Jesuit university in the Philippines. It was founded in 1936, in the Padre Faura St., Ermita, Manila campus of the Ateneo, where it remained even after the college, graduate school, and basic education units moved to Loyola Heights, Quezon City in the 1950s. In 1977, it moved to Salcedo Village in Makati, and in 1998, transferred to its present location in Makati's Rockwell Center. Its current Dean is alumnus Sedfrey Candelaria who succeeded Cesar L. Villanueva. Its patron saint is Thomas More.  - Metropolitan Manila, commonly known as Metro Manila or simply Manila, is the capital region of the Philippines, is the seat of government, the 2nd most populous and the most densely populated region of the country. The National Capital Region (NCR) is composed of Manila, the capital city of the country, Quezon City, the country's most populous city, and the cities of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, Pasig, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela, including the only remaining municipality of Pateros.  - Valedictorian is an academic title of success used in the United States, Canada, Central America, and the Philippines for the student who delivers the closing or farewell statement at a graduation ceremony (called a valedictory). The chosen valedictorian is often the student with the highest ranking among his/her graduating class. The term is an Anglicised derivation of the Latin \\"vale dicere\\" (\\"to say farewell\\"), historically rooted in the valedictorian's traditional role as the final speaker at the graduation ceremony before the students receive their diplomas. So the valedictory address generally is considered a final farewell to classmates, before they disperse to pursue their individual paths after graduating.  - A law school (also known as a law centre or college of law) is an institution specializing in legal education, usually involved as part of a process for becoming a lawyer within a given jurisdiction.  - Sedfrey M. Candelaria, is the incumbent Dean of the Ateneo Law School in Makati City, Philippines.  - Graduation is getting a diploma or academic degree or the ceremony that is sometimes associated, in which students become graduates. Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands. The date of graduation is often called graduation day. The graduation ceremony itself is also called commencement, convocation or invocation. In the United States and Canada, the term is additionally increasingly being used to refer to the advancement from a primary or secondary school level. When ceremonies are associated, they usually include a procession of the academic staff and candidates and a valediction. At the college and university level the faculty will usually wear academic dress at the formal ceremonies, as will the trustees and degree candidates.  - Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is the ideal mean radiant temperature Suggested answer: Thermal comfort is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"Yes, you should validate this answer, as it reasonably addresses the concept of mean radiant temperature and its relation to thermal comfort. However, it is essential to provide a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the ideal mean radiant temperature and its context in order to better understand the subject matter. Mean radiant temperature (MRT) is an essential factor in assessing human thermal comfort in various environments, and it represents the combined effect of direct and reflected radiation from surrounding surfaces on a person's heat exchange with the environment. It is a weighted average of the temperatures of the surfaces that an individual can see, taking into account the viewing angle of each surface, surface temperature, and relative size. When considering the ideal mean radiant temperature, it is important to note that it depends on the specific situation and individual factors, such as the activity level, clothing, and personal preferences of the person involved. Nevertheless, some general guidelines can be applied to determine appropriate MRT values for specific scenarios. The ideal MRT should facilitate a balance between a person's metabolic heat production and their heat transfer with the surrounding environment to achieve a comfortable thermal equilibrium. The context of thermal comfort plays a crucial role in understanding the ideal MRT. Thermal comfort is affected by various factors, including air temperature, humidity, air movement, and MRT. It is the combined effect of these factors, along with personal factors such as activity and clothing level, that contribute to determining an individual's thermal comfort. ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers) Standard 55-2017 provides guidelines for thermal comfort, and it specifies the ranges of indoor environmental conditions that are acceptable for most people in terms of thermal comfort. These guidelines state that an optimal MRT depends on the combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and air speed in a specific environment. In conclusion, although the suggested answer you provided does express the importance of maintaining thermal equilibrium for individual comfort, it would be more appropriate to expand upon the concept of mean radiant temperature and its connection to other factors contributing to thermal comfort. Additionally, the ideal MRT would vary depending on multiple factors, and it ultimately aims to achieve a balance between an individual's heat generation and heat dissipation in the surrounding environment. Acknowledging the influence of ASHRAE guidelines also provides a more in-depth understanding of determining the ideal MRT for various scenarios and environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of, was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger? , can you please find it?   After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

A:","output":"The feelings of others in this context would depend on various factors such as their relationship with Sasha, the environment they are in, their understanding of Sasha's intentions, and their individual personalities. Given that we do not have a complete understanding of these factors, we can explore several potential ways in which others might feel as a result of Sasha's actions. 1. Empathy: Some individuals might empathize with Sasha's need for relaxation and her choice of going to the bathroom to achieve it. They might understand that people have unique preferences and methods for unwinding, and attempting to destress in the bathroom might be comforting for Sasha. Therefore, these individuals would feel understanding and supportive of Sasha's actions. 2. Concern: Other individuals might feel concerned about Sasha's well-being, especially if her behavior appears odd or out-of-character. They might wonder if something is bothering her or if she is feeling unwell. If Sasha is typically relaxed and open, observing her seeking solace in the bathroom might trigger feelings of worry or unease in those around her. 3. Confusion: If people around Sasha are not familiar with the concept of utilizing the bathroom as a spot for relaxation, they might feel confused by her actions. They could fail to understand her motives, causing feelings of perplexity and bewilderment. 4. Ignorance: In some cases, others might not pay attention to Sasha's actions at all, or they might not be affected by her decision to relax in the bathroom. People who are preoccupied with their own activities or thoughts would be indifferent to Sasha's choice of retreat. 5. Annoyance: On the off chance that the bathroom is shared or located in a public area with limited access, other individuals might feel annoyed or inconvenienced by Sasha's prolonged stay in there. These people might desire equal access to the bathroom for their own needs, and they could feel frustrated by the lack of availability. In summary, the emotions of others in response to Sasha going for a walk all the way to the bathroom to relax would differ based on their relationships with Sasha, the context of the situation, and their ability to comprehend her aim. Feelings could range from empathy and support, worry and concern, confusion, ignorance, to even annoyance in some cases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

No matter what type of amp you have, something is supposed to change when you hit the on switch and turn up the volume. A lot of amps have power lights that activate when the amp is live. Also, listen for any noises the amp makes, since that could also help you determine the source of the problem. Car amps, for example, often have a green power LED light and a red “protect” light. The protect light often means a blown fuse, so you know to check the wiring when you see it. Go over all the wires, double-checking that they are plugged in correctly. If the amp doesn’t activate at all when you turn it on, the problem could have to do with the power supply. Sometimes you have to contend with a loose cord, which is a very easy fix to make. Wiggle the wires, testing them to see if they are in place and cause the amp to activate at all.  Car amps, for instance, often have a red power wire and a black ground wire. It also has a blue remote turn-on wire that powers the amp when you turn on your vehicle. If your amp plugs into the wall, test the power cord. Also, make sure your guitar, speakers, subwoofers, and other devices are connected to the amp if you’re using them. So your amp turns on, which is a plus, but it doesn’t sound right. Sound distortion can be caused by a few different issues depending on what kind of amp you have. It is often from loose wires, but it could also be your overall setup. Sometimes replacing the wires, fixing the amp’s components, or changing your setup suddenly makes everything better. If you don’t hear any sound but know your amp is on, the wiring is likely the culprit. Moving the wires may give you a burst of sound. You may also need to detach speakers or other devices overpowering the amp.","output":"To summarize, the process of troubleshooting an amplifier involves several steps to identify potential issues and rectify them. Firstly, turn on the amp and observe any lights, sounds, or indicators that may point to the source of the problem. Power lights and protect lights can provide valuable information, such as potential blown fuses or power supply issues. Next, carefully inspect all wires and connections, making sure they are plugged in correctly. Loose cords can often cause issues and are simple to fix. In the case of car amps, pay particular attention to the red power wire, the black ground wire, and the blue remote turn-on wire. Ensure that any connected devices, such as guitars, speakers, and subwoofers, are properly linked to the amp. If your amplifier turns on but produces distorted sound or no sound at all, first examine the wiring for any loose connections. Adjusting or replacing the wires, fixing the amp's components, or modifying your setup may address the issue. Additionally, consider detaching any speakers or devices that could be overpowering the amp. By following these steps and examining specific aspects of your amplifier and its connections, you can effectively troubleshoot and identify the source of the problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: If your bank closed your account, you may have negative information on your ChexSystems report. However, not all banks use ChexSystems. There also are some that review all applications on a case-by-case basis.  Likewise, if your bank used a different service, you should look for banks that don't use that service. These banks will be more likely to open an account for you because they won't know about what happened between you and the bank that closed your account. You may be able to find this information on the bank's website. If not, you can always call the toll-free customer service line and ask. Many branches also have the logo of the service they use on their doors. Smaller community banks are far more likely to review applications on a case-by-case basis, and typically are more forgiving if you had your account closed because you over-drafted or made a mistake.  If you apply for an account at a small community bank, go into the branch in person rather than applying online (many of these small banks don't even accept applications online). Dress presentably in clean, neat clothing so you make a good impression with the banker. Be as open and honest as possible about your past relationship with your old bank and the reason you want to open an account. This can prevent you from having problems again with this bank if they discover you lied on your application or failed to disclose important information. Since credit unions are owned by their members, they tend to be more forgiving of past mistakes. Credit unions also typically offer more assistance with budgeting and financial responsibility, if that has been a problem for you in the past.  Credit unions typically only allow certain types of people to be members. For example, they may only accept employees of certain companies, people who live in a certain community, or people who fit other criteria. Check the credit union's website to find out if you meet their membership criteria before you apply. You also might ask your employer if there are any credit unions you qualify for because you work there. In the United States and some other countries, a number of large banks offer second chance checking accounts for people who have a history of troubled banking relationships.  Use these accounts as a last resort. They typically have annual fees and may require you to maintain a fairly substantial minimum balance at all times. They also may have other requirements that you would have difficulty meeting. If you do get a second chance checking account, you typically have the option of converting it to a regular account after you maintain it responsibly for a year or longer.","output":"The article highlights several strategies for individuals with a negative ChexSystems report or a history of problematic banking relationships, helping them find ways to open new bank accounts.

What would be a realistic plan to lose weight? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To lose weight, there are several steps that you need to follow. Here's a realistic plan for weight loss including a step-by-step approach: Step 1: Setting a goal Determine how much weight you want to lose and set a realistic time frame for achieving your goal. Make sure that your goal follows the SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. Step 2: Analyzing your current lifestyle Take a close look at your current lifestyle and diet. Track your daily caloric intake, exercise habits, and any other factors that might influence your weight. Step 3: Creating a calorie deficit A calorie deficit is necessary for weight loss. You can create this deficit by either consuming fewer calories or increasing your physical activity, or a combination of both. A safe and sustainable calorie deficit is typically around 500 calories per day, which can result in a weight loss of about 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week. Step 4: Choosing a healthier diet Replace high-calorie, processed foods with nutrient-dense, whole foods. Incorporate more lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats into your diet. Don't forget to control portion sizes and drink plenty of water. Step 5: Increasing physical activity Include regular exercise in your daily routine. Aim for a combination of both cardiovascular exercise and strength training. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. Step 6: Tracking your progress Regularly monitor your weight and measurements, as well as other health markers such as body fat percentage. Adjust your diet and exercise routine as necessary. It can be helpful to take pictures or maintain a journal to document your progress. Step 7: Seeking support Having social support from friends, family, or support groups can be beneficial in maintaining motivation and accountability throughout your weight loss journey. As for your second question, \\"How do I lose weight?\\" and \\"What would be a realistic plan to lose weight?\\" are similar but not exactly the same.

The steps provided above address both questions, with an emphasis on creating a realistic plan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -5*d + 0*d - 1238 = -1268 for d.","output":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step, like we're telling a story to a five-year-old. So, we have a problem that looks like this: -5*d + 0*d - 1238 = -1268 1. First, we know that if you have \\"0\\" of something, it means you have none of it. So \\"0*d\\" is the same as having \\"0\\". Our equation now looks like this: -5*d - 1238 = -1268 2. Now, let's isolate \\"d\\" (which means we want to get it all by itself). We'll start by adding 1238 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the \\"-1238\\" on the left side: -5*d - 1238 + 1238 = -1268 + 1238 This will change our equation to: -5*d = -30 3. Our last step is to get \\"d\\" all by itself. Right now, there is a \\"-5\\" that is multiplied by \\"d\\"- so we need to divide both sides by \\"-5\\" to cancel it out: -5*d / -5 = -30 / -5 By doing this, we now have: d = 6 And that's it! Our answer is d = 6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Goal: how do you transfer unpolished steel tubings for your project? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To determine which method is more reasonable for transferring unpolished steel tubings for your project, I am going to outline a few potential methods and then compare their advantages and disadvantages. After that, we should be able to identify the most reasonable option based on your specific project requirements. Method 1: Truck transportation This is one of the most common methods used to transport steel tubing. Trucks can easily accommodate the length and weight of steel tubing, making it straightforward to load, transport, and unload the material. Advantages: - Accessible and common transportation method - Can accommodate a wide range of cargo sizes - Suitable for short to long distances, depending on the type of truck Disadvantages: - May be limited by weight restrictions and truck availability - Traffic and road condition might affect delivery times Method 2: Rail transportation For large quantities of steel tubing, rail transportation can be a viable option. Railcars are capable of handling huge loads, making them ideal for transporting significant amounts of steel tubing. Advantages: - Capable of handling large quantities of steel tubing - Can travel over long distances in a relatively short amount of time - Time efficient and generally on-schedule travel Disadvantages: - Limited availability of rail networks can result in transit to inconvenient drop-off points - May be difficult to arrange transport for a smaller project or for small amounts of material Method 3: Intermodal transportation Intermodal transportation combines different modes of transport, like trucking and rail, to complete a single shipment. This method offers flexibility in dealing with potential issues like weight restrictions, distance, and accessibility. Advantages: - Provides a combination of the best features of truck and rail transportation - Allows for flexibility in meeting project-specific requirements - Can be more cost-effective for longer distances Disadvantages: - Requires additional coordination and management between different transportation modes - May result in longer transit times due to transfers between modes Method 4: Non-conventional transportation methods This category includes any other transportation methods not covered by the previous options. Examples include shipping via air or using specialized vehicles, like cranes or flatbed trailers, to handle oversized loads. Advantages: - Offers specialized solutions for challenging transportation requirements - Can overcome obstacles posed by site access, weight restrictions, and other issues Disadvantages: - Often more expensive than other transportation methods - May be more complicated to organize and manage To conclude, the most reasonable method for transferring unpolished steel tubings depends on several factors such as the quantity of steel tubing, the distance it needs to be transported, site accessibility, and budget constraints. If your project requires a small to moderate quantity of unpolished steel tubing to be transported within a short to moderate distance, truck transportation would be the most reasonable option. If your project requires a large quantity of steel tubing, or if the distance is quite long, intermodal transportation or rail transportation could be more appropriate. And finally, for unique scenarios that don't fit within the parameters of the previously mentioned options, non-conventional transportation methods might be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Add spaces between the words in the following text: Thekitchenisfullyequippedwitheverythingyouneedtoprepareyourownfood.","output":"The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need to prepare your own food.  This sentence, when broken down into its individual words, clearly communicates that the kitchen being described is well-stocked and has all the necessary tools and utensils to allow someone to cook their meals. Here's a more detailed elaboration on this sentence: The kitchen, which is the central part of any home and a space where families and friends typically gather to enjoy food and conversations, has a complete variety of items, appliances, and utensils that one would require to make any type of dish from scratch. This includes general necessities such as a stove, oven, microwave, refrigerator, and dishwasher, as well as a range of smaller appliances like a toaster, blender, coffee maker, and electric kettle. Furthermore, it also implies that the kitchen is equipped with a wide assortment of cooking accessories, for example, pots and pans with various sizes and designs, sharp and efficient knives for cutting, chopping, and dicing, different types of spoons, spatulas, and ladles to stir, mix, and serve the food, and other essential tools like graters, peelers, can openers, and measuring cups. Besides these items, the kitchen also contains a well-stocked pantry filled with staple ingredients, spices, and condiments. In addition, it is likely that it has a variety of cooking oils, vinegars, sauces, and seasonings that can be used to add depth and flavor to the dishes being prepared. Moreover, the phrase \\"fully equipped\\" might even encompass more specialized cooking tools, such as a food processor, mixer, or even a slow cooker, which can come in handy when preparing more complex recipes or pursuing culinary projects. The presence of a fully equipped kitchen is often much appreciated by those who favor home-cooked meals over dining out or ordering takeout. It allows individuals and families to have full control over the ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional content of their meals. Additionally, having a well-stocked kitchen can save time and money, as it eliminates the need to purchase new equipment or ingredients every time one wishes to try out a new recipe. In summary, the sentence \\"The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need to prepare your own food\\" paints a clear picture of a well-organized and complete kitchen that caters to the cooking needs and preferences of its users, enabling them to create a wide range of appetizing and wholesome dishes in the comfort of their own home."},{"instruction":"Q: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. Question: How did the facebook exec try to justify the Ugly memo? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The Facebook exec tried to justify the Ugly Memo by stating that they believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows them to connect more people more often is considered good, even if it results in negative consequences such as bullying or terrorism. Essentially, the executive was arguing that the potential social benefits of increased connectivity outweigh the potential risks and harms that may arise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same information, but they do so with slight differences in structure and phrasing.  To break down each sentence: (1) The Edmonton Oilers became the first National Hockey League team in Alberta as they were absorbed by the NHL when the WHA folded. This sentence implies that the Edmonton Oilers turned into the first NHL team in Alberta due to the absorption of the Oilers into the NHL as a result of the WHA's folding. The key point here is the transformation of the team's status and the cause: the folding of the WHA. (2) The Edmonton Oilers were the first National Hockey League team in Alberta when they were absorbed by the NHL as the WHA Fold. Similar to the first sentence, this one also states that the Edmonton Oilers were the first NHL team in Alberta. However, the structure here focuses more on their status (being the first) at the moment when they were incorporated into the NHL because the WHA folded. In summary, both sentences assert that the Edmonton Oilers became the first NHL team in Alberta due to the NHL's absorption of the team and the WHA's folding. The primary difference between the two sentences lies in the sentence structure and the way the information is presented, but neither difference significantly alters the meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Combine like terms On the left side, we have two terms that both contain the variable k: -104*k and 455*k. -104*k + 455*k = 351*k The left side of the equation now becomes 351*k - 6331. On the right side, we have two constants: -3994 and 12405. -3994 + 12405 = 8411 The right side of the equation now is 8411. So, the equation now is: 351*k - 6331 = 8411 Step 2: Isolate the variable k To isolate k, we need to get rid of the constant term -6331 on the left side of the equation. To do this, we add 6331 to both sides of the equation. 351*k - 6331 + 6331 = 8411 + 6331 351*k = 14742 Now, to completely isolate k, we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of k, which in this case is 351. 351*k / 351 = 14742 / 351 k = 42 So, the solution for the given equation is k = 42."},{"instruction":"Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Creatures of the Night.

Most gyms have personal trainers on staff, so ask about these services at your gym. Make sure you inform a personal trainer about your diabetes. This will help him design workouts that will work best for you. It is also important for safety, because your trainer can monitor you for signs of hypoglycemia or other complications. When working with weights, aim to do two or three sets of 8-12 repetitions within each set. Let your body rest for about a minute in between sets. When lifting, breathe out when you perform the lift or exertion, and breathe in when returning to your start position. You can apply these general guidelines to any weight-based workout. This focus will give you faster results over your whole body. The major areas you should concentrate on are the back, chest, arms, and legs. There are several workouts you can do to train each of these areas and increase your overall muscle mass. While beginners to weight training often overlook the back, it is important for balanced upper body strength. There are large muscles here that can be strengthened and toned with several good workouts.  Pull-ups. This simple exercise can be performed with only a bar and no other equipment. It trains the muscles of your upper and mid back. Grasp the bar with your hands roughly shoulder-width apart, then pull your chin over the bar. Make sure you keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure that you are keeping the workout focused on your back muscles. As an added bonus, pull-ups will strengthen your biceps as well. See Do Pullups for a more detailed description of performing pull-ups. Lat Pull-down. This workout is similar to a pull-up, except it is done sitting down with a machine. Grab the bar with your hands a bit wider than shoulder-width apart. Then pull the bar down to your chest and smoothly raise it again. Cable row. With this workout, you'll sit down on a bench and pull a weighted handle towards you. This workout trains the middle back, as well as the biceps. Click here for a video description of this workout. Shrugs. This workout will train your trapezius, the muscle between your neck and shoulders. To perform a shrug, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a barbell, or a dumbbell in each hand. Then raise your shoulders to your ears. The chest contains the pectoralis major and minor muscles. These are large muscles that can add a lot of mass if trained properly. Try the following workouts to increase the size and strength of your chest.  Pushups. You don't need any equipment for this workout, just the floor. It will train your chest, as well as your triceps. Read Do a Push Up for a detailed description of proper technique and variations of this workout. Pushups are also a good way to warm up before lifting heavier weights. Dumbbell press. This is similar to a pushup, except it is done on a bench with dumbbells. Lay back on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand. For your starting position, hold the dumbbells just above your shoulders. Then press your hands up and have the dumbbells touch above your chest before returning to the start position. Pectoral Flyes. This workout is done with a machine. You sit upright on a bench and place your hands on the pads or handles that will be on each side of you. Then you push forward and have your hands meet in front of you. This exercise isolates the chest more than pushups or the dumbbell press, so use it if you want to focus on the chest. The two major muscle groups in your arms are the biceps and triceps. You should train both groups to strengthen your arms and build muscle mass. Several of the exercises already mentioned will also train your arms: pullups and pull downs will train your biceps, and pushups and dumbbell presses will train your triceps. In addition, there are other exercises that will isolate the arm muscles and train them specifically.  Bicep curls. With this exercise, you will isolate the biceps. You can perform this exercise standing or sitting. Take a dumbbell in each hand and start with your arms at your sides. Then bend your arms at the elbows, bringing your hands up to your shoulders. Click here for an instructional video demonstrating a proper curl. Tricep push downs. This exercise isolates the triceps and is done with a machine. Grab either a bar or rope attached to a weight. Your starting position should be with your hands in front of you about chest-height. Then, using only your elbows, push the bar down to your hips before returning to the start position. Some of the biggest muscles in your body are in your legs, so training this area will give you a big increase in muscle mass. There are numerous workouts you can choose from, all of which will train your legs in different ways.  Squats. This workout primarily trains the quads and glutes, but it also works the entire leg and lower back. Read Do a Squat and watch this video to learn the proper technique before trying this. It would also be a good idea to consult a trainer at the gym to instruct you- it is a great workout, but you can seriously hurt your knees, back, and neck if you don't use proper form. Leg extensions. This workout trains the quads. It involves placing your feet into a machine. Then you extend your legs forward, which will lift a weight attached to a cable.  Lunges. This workout will train your hamstrings, on the back of your leg. To perform the workout, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Then stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your arms at your sides. Take a big step forward with one leg, then bring your other leg forward so you are standing with your feet shoulder-width again. Read Do a Front Lunge Exercise for more details on this workout.  Calf raises. This workout will train your calves, which are on the lower part of your leg. They can be done either with a machine or by just holding a weight. To perform the workout, place your feet halfway onto a ledge so your heels dangle off the back. Then, either holding a weight or using a machine, shift your weight to the balls of your feet and lift your heels up. Then return to the starting position with your heels dangling off the side of the ledge. When you workout with the same exercises for several weeks, your muscles start to adjust, and the exercises won't give you great results anymore. This is called a plateau. To avoid this, don't let your muscles get used to the workout. Perform only one or two of these suggested workouts per muscle group at a time. Then in a few weeks, replace the exercises with a new one. By keeping your muscles guessing, you'll ensure that you see maximum results from your workout regimen.

Article: For grown-ups,an afternoon snooze  is often easier said than done.But many of us have probably experienced just how simple it can be to catch some sleep in a gently rocking hammock .By examining brain waves in sleeping adults,researchers reported in the June 21issue of Current Biology,a Cell Press publication,that they now have evidence to explain why that is. \\"It is a common belief that rocking causes sleep:we fall asleep in a rocking chair soon and,since ancient times,we cradle our babies to sleep,\\"said Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva.\\"Yet,how this works had remained a mystery.The goal of our study was made up of two parts:to test whether rocking does indeed improve sleep,and to understand how this might work at the brain level.\\" Schwartz,Michel Muhlethaler,and their colleagues Laurence Bayer and Irina Constantinescu asked twelve adult volunteers to nap on a custom-made bed or\\"experimental hammock\\"that could either remain still or rock gently.All participants were good sleepers who didn't typically nap and did not suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day.Each participant took two 45-minute afternoon naps,one with the bed still and one with the bed in motion,while their brain activity was monitored. \\"We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swinging condition,\\"Muhlethaler said.\\"Surprisingly,we also observed a dramatic boosting of certain types of sleep-related brain waves.\\" More specifically,rocking increased the length of stage N2sleep,a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep that normally occupies about half of a good night's sleep.The rocking bed also had a lasting effect on brain activity,increasing slow brain waves and bursts of activity known as sleep spindles . Schwartz and Muhlethaler say the next step is to find out whether rocking can improve longer periods of sleep and to find out whether it may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders,such as insomnia . Question: What can we learn from Sophie Schwartz's words? Answer: Possible answers:  A). Her team aimed to answer two questions.  B). The study is going to benefit babies a lot.  C).

Two Utah men removed from their Boy Scout leadership positions after a viral video showed them toppling an ancient rock formation pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges Tuesday and avoided jail time. Initially, the two men were charged with felonies. Glenn Taylor, 45, and David Hall, 42, appeared in Utah's 7th District Court to enter their pleas under a deal with prosecutors. The two men from Highland were sentenced to a year of probation and ordered to pay fines and restitution, which has not yet been determined. State prosecutors are still trying to put a price on the amount of damage caused last October to the mushroom-shaped sandstone pillar in Goblin Valley State Park, which park officials said had been standing for much of human history, if not longer. The formation was estimated to be about 170 million years old. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Guilty: Boy Scout leaders Glenn Taylor (left) and Benjamin Hall each received probation for destroying an ancient rock formation in Utah. Freedom: David Hall (left) and Glenn Taylor (right) avoided jail time for destroying an ancient rock formation in Utah. Deal: Attorney Scott Card (left) brokered the deal for the two former Boy Scout leaders that will is likely to also include a hefty fine. A video shot by Hall and posted on YouTube shows Taylor dislodging the formation at Goblin Valley State Park in central Utah that's filled with thousands of the pillars called 'hoodoos.' Hall, Taylor and a third man were seen cheering and high-fiving after the formation toppled. The men claimed it might have been ready to fall and kill a visitor. Both were later stripped of their Boy Scout positions. Scott Card, an attorney for Taylor, told the Salt Lake City Tribune that the restitution will be thousands of dollars and will go toward putting up signs in the park to warn others against damaging the formations. Both men were originally facing felony mischief charges. If Taylor and Hall meet the requirements of their probation, the offenses will later be removed from their records.

Blackwell. said any defense asserting the goblin-shaped rock was ready to tip over 'would need to have a lot of expert testimony, and it would probably go. both ways.' The round-shaped rock, which was pushed off a natural pedestal, weighed thousands of pounds, he said. 'I. understand why the state brought felony charges - it's a definite. deterrent effect,' Taylor's lawyer, Scott Card, said when his client initially was charged with a felony, 'but I believe it's. an overcharge. We will be defending Mr. Taylor in court.' The two men faced up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 5,000.

The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily.

A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who insults Leticia? Movie plot title: Monster's Ball Movie plot: Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a widower, and his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), are corrections officers in a prison in Louisiana. They reside with Hank's ailing father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a racist retired corrections officer whose wife committed suicide. Hank is a deputy warden. He oversees the execution of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs). As explained to Sonny by Hank, at the diner bar the night before, a \\"Monster's Ball\\" is what the execution team calls that night's get-together. The proceedings prove too intense for Sonny, who begins to vomit and then collapses as he is leading Lawrence to the electric chair. Hank confronts Sonny in the jail's bathroom afterwards and slaps him for being so \\"soft\\" and ruining a man's last walk. At home, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed and tells him to get out of the house. Sonny grabs a gun, and threatens his father, who backs off. The confrontation ends in their living room with Hank at gunpoint, lying on the carpet, and Sonny in Buck's customary chair. Sonny asks his father if he hates him. After his father calmly confirms that he does and always has, Sonny responds, \\"Well I always loved you,\\" and then shoots himself in the chest, dying instantly. Hank buries Sonny in the back garden with no real funeral because, as Buck observes, \\"He was weak.\\" Hank subsequently quits his job, burns his uniform in the backyard, and locks the door of Sonny's room. During the years of Lawrence's imprisonment, his wife, Leticia (Halle Berry), has been struggling while raising their son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), who has inherited his father's artistic talent. She abusively berates the boy regarding his obesity. Along with her domestic problems, Leticia struggles financially, leading to the loss of the family car and, worse, an eviction notice on her house. In desperate need of money, Leticia takes a job at a diner frequented by Hank. One rainy night, Leticia and Tyrell are walking down a soaked highway when Tyrell is struck by a car.

Q: Text: so this actually happened last year about this time. remembered it since final exams are coming up soon. some background, i am a college student. i was a freshman at some university in a tropical place at the time. not detailing which one, but its mostly engineering. so calculus is the course like everyone has to take. i've taken this course in high school before, but some people have not. i am passing this course with about a solid b. many people are not passing this course. such as my friend cole. so we have a graded homework packet due monday. (my professor gives us questions from the book lesson's section to do as practice, and then gives one or two different problems from the book's review section as graded homework. he does not want to grade massive amounts of homework.) being college students, we all procrastinate. i start it sunday morning, mind you we have had this for 5 days by now. plenty of time. i get it done, and cole asks me for help. its graded homework so we are not supposed to work together because the professor wants to see how we do, not how other people can tell us how to do it. but he does allow us to use our notes we take in class, to encourage us to come to class and take notes. so yes me helping him would be cheating in a way. but hey its not cheating if you don't get caught right? and come'on we all know what happens when we think of a bad situation. \\"it'll never happen to me.\\" logic comes out. yeah that logic noped the hell out of my brain since then! being the great person i am, i decide to help him with the problem. i don't give him the answers, but rather step by step walk him through how to do it. i figure, hey if we can use our notes, if i do it the way in the notes, the professor shouldn't be that suspicious, and he can't prove anything. turn in the homework, a week later he hands the papers back. (normal time frame for him to get things done.) mine has no grade, and a note to see him after class. (not typically how its done) at this point i was like well this has no possible good outcomes. i go up and ask him whats up with it and he starts explaining how it was weird cole and i got the same step on the problem, that nobody else got. so he asks me \\"did you two work on it together?\\" me being me, i was like thinking i can get out of this. so i was like \\"nope!\\" and then the professor explained to me how we both magically got the same wrong step! i also sit near cole in class, so he knows i talk to him. to get the same wrong step... at this point i knew his question was not asking for an answer, but a confession. the professor knew the answer already. so i owned up to it. as a result got kicked out of the course for academic dishonesty, and had to retake it in the spring. this was in very early december. i only had like 7 more lectures and i would have been out of there. i had to retake the whole course, for practically the third time. the kicker part of the story. cole was failing that class even before this homework. he had no chance of passing. so he got kicked out too, but it did not matter to him because he was retaking it anyway. so i lost my back for trying to help him for no good reason. i could have technically been dismissed from the school for something like that, but rather got lucky and only had to retake a class. so it was not too much of a fuck up, but one worth noting. after note: i passed calc 1 fine the second time and now am going to pass calc 2 soon. so its all good in the end, but i learned to say no to helping other people with things i should not be.

I visited with high expectations after hearing a fair amount of praise from friends, but those expectations were far from met. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the uncleanliness of the venue. The floors were sticky and littered with debris, as if they had not been cleaned for days. The poor lighting only served to accentuate the grime and heightened the overall sense of neglect. I hoped that the staff would be more attentive, but I was sorely mistaken.  We were greeted with glacial indifference by a bored employee who seemed to be more focused on her phone than on providing us with any helpful information or welcoming pleasantries. It took a whopping 30 minutes just to get seated, despite numerous empty tables around us. This was a telltale sign that our overall experience could prove disappointing. To our dismay, the food did not fare any better. My meal was served cold – the exact opposite of what I had hoped for. An attempt to inform the staff about the issue, gave way to eye rolls and exasperated sighs. A replacement dish would have gone a long way in remedying the situation, but apparently, that was too much to ask for. Moreover, the menu variety was underwhelming, with a lack of options catering to different dietary preferences, such as vegetarian or gluten-free. For a place that had been praised for offering diverse options to cater to its patrons, it utterly failed to deliver on that count. As we tried to make the best of our experience, we couldn't help but feel suffocated by the noise level within the establishment. The music was painfully loud, making it impossible to carry a conversation without shouting. We ended up surrendering to the cacophony and focused on hoping our food would offer some modicum of comfort. Alas, it did not. Lastly, to end our unfortunate experience, we were presented with a bill that made us question whether we had dined at a different venue altogether. The exorbitant prices did not match the quality of the service or food we received.  In conclusion, my overall experience at this place was a letdown through and through. From subpar customer service to dismal cleanliness, insufficient menu options, excessive noise, and unreasonable pricing, my visit ticked off all the markers of a negative experience. I genuinely hope that the establishment heeds this feedback and considers making improvements. Until then, I cannot recommend this place, and I urge potential patrons to look elsewhere for a positive and more enjoyable experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A former party-lover has given up cocktails, cigarettes and burlesque dancing and converted to Islam after falling for a Muslim man nine years her junior. Mother-of-three Claire Birkill, 37, from Nottingham, overhauled her lifestyle after a trip to Gambia in January where she met fiance, Sarif Jallow, 28. In her days of burlesque dancing, she would parade around in nothing but knickers and nipple tassels. Claire Birkill, left, now Jameela, has changed her ways as well her her name after converting to Islam, right. Ashamed: The mother-of-three now regrets pictures like this from her days as a burlesque dancer. But since converting, she now covers up in a hijab and says she is ashamed she was once such an exhibitionist. She's also changed her name by deed poll to Jameela. She said: 'Before I enjoyed weekly burlesque classes. I would strip down to silky corsets and do sexy dances. Now I'm so ashamed of my past, I can barely look at old photos. I feel like I've been reborn.' Jameela, who has three children aged six, 16, and 18, met her fiance, Sarif, following the breakdown of her first marriage and said it was love at first sight. She explained: 'My eight-year marriage broke down in 2013 around the time I decided to study tourism at college.' As part of the course last January, she travelled to the Gambia, West Africa, where she met Sarif. 'He was a teacher and nine years younger than me but it was love at first sight,' Jameela said. 'He was so intelligent and kind. On the last day of the trip in March he told me he loved me. 'As I left the airport I cried and cried for three hours straight.' Party animal: Jameela used to love going out drinking before converting to Islam. Changed her life: Now she's happier and healthier after meeting Sarif, right, who proposed in March. Back home, Jameela, then still Claire, spoke to Sarif on the phone every night and he proposed weeks later. She used to be a Methodist but after listening to Sarif talk about his religion, she decided to research it on the internet and 'immediately felt a connection'. She said. 'It's about peace, empathy, love and kindness, all things I believe in. I realised I needed to become a Muslim.' She converted in a special ceremony in June and changed her name to one that's traditionally Muslim. She has not asked her children to convert, leaving them to make their own decisions on whether they want to follow a path of religion. She also began observing Ramadan, explaining: 'It's a month-long period of prayer, fasting, charity-giving and self accountability for Muslims. It was difficult but incredibly fulfilling. Romantic thoughts are forbidden during Ramadan, so I banned myself from talking to Sarif in daylight hours because I got too turned on by his voice.' It's a far cry from her former hedonistic lifestyle. As a young woman, she had a weakness for cigarettes and alcohol and was often promiscuous. She said: 'Before becoming a mum I'd think nothing about bringing a man home after a night out. Normally it was alcohol-induced but I'd never do it now. Long distance love: The couple will initially live apart as Sarif works as a teacher in Gambia and Jameela doesn't want to pull her youngest son out of school in the UK. 'I used to smoke 40-a-day too. I was like a chimney and nearly always had a cigarette in my hand. I can't imagine smoking now, ruining my body.' She added: 'I used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week too. I was a huge G&T fan and would relax with a few in the evenings. That was just a normal week. 'If I went out with the girls, I'd drink more. I loved cocktails and would work my way through the menus in bars. 'The next morning I'd feel terrible and would waste the day feeling sorry for myself. When I think of how I behaved, I'm so ashamed.' She's also now given up her hobby of burlesque dancing, which she started in 2012 after signing up for classes at a local dance studio. 'I wanted to improve my body confidence. I would perform routines, starting off fully dressed and ending up in just silky pants and nipple tassels,' she explained. 'I'd never dream of doing it now. 'Looking at pictures of me in a pink silk basque I see it is very un-Islamic. Islam believes a woman's body is just for her husband.' Mocked: Not everyone has been supportive of Jameela's decision to chance religion. The way she eats and dresses on a daily basis has changed dramatically too. 'I travel ten miles to ensure I only buy Halal meat from a specialist butcher. I used to joke \\"don't wake me up in the morning unless bringing me a bacon butty and coffee\\" – I'd never say that now. 'Giving up bacon has been the hardest thing but Halal prohibits it. 'I always cover my legs as requested to by Islam. I found the headscarf quite restrictive at first. But now I wear it tighter because I want to.' Jameela said Sarif was 'heartbroken' when she told him about her past but she said: 'He knows how committed I am now and believes I've changed.' Sarif is still living in Gambia and the couple will continue to have a long distance relationship after they marry because Jameela does not want to disrupt her youngest son's education. Given up alcohol: The mother used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week. 'After the wedding we will live apart. Because of the age of my youngest son, I won't take him out of school, so I can't leave the UK,' she said. Jameela said she's never been happier since meeting Sarif and changing her religion but the decision has cost her a number of friends. She is often mocked or abused when she goes out in public wearing a hijab. She said: 'Some friends don't want to know me anymore and others are refusing to call me by my new name. 'In the street one person asked why I wasn't wearing a letterbox, meaning a burkha. It's so disrespectful. I've heard sniggering in the playground when I've picked my son up from school and laughed at in Primark by teenage girls. Jameela said friends who knew her as Claire refuse to call her by her new name and she's been laughed at for wearing a hijab but she's never been happier. 'People I know locally are pulling coats over their head and running round with them, shouting, \\"I'm Jameela\\". I've also been called a terrorist by strangers and even former friends.' But she said for all the friendships she has lost, she has also gained new ones. 'The Muslim community is very welcoming. I've been invited into their homes and made to feel more welcome by them then I ever was as a Methodist. 'I've never been happier or healthier than now. And that's all thanks to meeting Sarif.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Claire Birkill, a 37-year-old mother of three from Nottingham, has transformed her life after converting to Islam for her fiance, Sarif Jallow, whom she met during a trip to Gambia in January. Claire, who used to enjoy burlesque dancing, cocktails, and cigarettes, now covers herself in a hijab and has changed her name to Jameela. She has also given up her previous hobbies and habits, opting for a healthier and more spiritual lifestyle in line with Islamic principles. Jameela's conversion to Islam was a result of her in-depth research into the religion after she and Sarif, a teacher, became close during her trip. She found that Islam aligned with her personal beliefs, such as peace, empathy, love, and kindness. She then decided to convert in a special ceremony in June and adopted a traditionally Muslim name. However, she has left the decision regarding religion to her children, allowing them to choose their own path. Jameela has embraced the Islamic practices of observing Ramadan, dressing modestly, and eating only Halal food. She has given up her previous vices, such as smoking and drinking alcohol, and stopped engaging in burlesque dancing. She has also made efforts to maintain her long-distance relationship with Sarif, who remains in Gambia as a teacher. Despite the challenges Jameela has faced due to her conversion, such as losing friends and experiencing mockery and abuse in public, she asserts that she has never felt happier and healthier in her life. She credits the supportive and welcoming Muslim community, as well as her love and commitment to Sarif, for her newfound contentment and sense of belonging. Jameela's story is an inspiring example of the power of love and spirituality in helping individuals overcome their past and embrace a new, fulfilling lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Your starting position on the chart is listed in a coordinate system of horizontal and vertical values.  Instead of an X and Y coordinate, this might be listed as a number of steps Left or Right (on either side of the 50 yard line) and a number of steps in front of or behind the hash line that runs parallel to the Visitor-Home sidelines.  Drill charts are read from the viewpoint of the director. If the chart says “in front of” it means toward the director. If the chart says “behind” it means away from the director's viewpoint. In order for the marching band to look uniform, it's important that everybody moves about the same distance with each step they take. Drill chart instructions will be listed in steps.  The standard marching style is called 8-to-5, which means there are 8 steps for every 5 yards. Since there will be 5-yard lines on a standard football field, it creates a grid marchers can follow, counting 8 steps between each line. You can also think of each step as being an average of 22.5 inches, since there should be 8 steps in 5 yards. This measurement is often used as a standard. More important than knowing the average size of a standard step while you're marching is to be moving at the same pace as those around you. Each position in a drill chart corresponds to a count in the music. As the song progresses, you will move across the field into a new position. You will start on the count of 0 and generally move in increments of 8. Summary:","output":"A drill chart helps marching band members know where to stand on a field.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does Marisol have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Chien? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, Marisol has a lower chance of acid rain than Chien.

Embracing her natural hair and the inevitable signs of aging, the Duchess seemed unfazed by the visible silver roots. It is, after all, a natural part of life, and the Duchess appears to appreciate the beauty in it. This change in hairstyle sends a powerful message about aging gracefully and embracing changes in appearance. Society often pressures women to maintain a certain standard of beauty, and the Duchess's choice to proudly display her silvery strands could inspire others to similarly embrace their aging process. Indeed, the Duchess's decision to stray from the usual side parting may have been a conscious one – a decision to take ownership of her changing appearance and to debunk the myth that aging should be hidden or feared. By stepping out with a new style that doesn't conceal the signs of aging, the Duchess uses her influence and public platform to encourage women everywhere to accept and celebrate the natural progression of life. Moreover, the Duchess's elegant attire and poised demeanor prove that having silver roots does not equate to diminished beauty or sophistication. Instead, her choice of hairstyle could represent a gentle reminder to refocus on the more important aspects of life – such as her involvement with charitable causes like London Poppy Day and the military supporters, servicemen and women she met. In conclusion, the Duchess of Cambridge's choice to showcase her silver roots with a flat, middle-parted hairstyle is an empowering move. It not only breaks the mold of traditional beauty expectations but also highlights the importance of honoring the aging process and maintaining a healthy perspective on personal appearances.

(Associated Press)      Busch was suspended by NASCAR indefinitely Friday after a judge said the 2004 former champion almost surely choked and beat a former girlfriend last fall and there was a \\"substantial likelihood\\" of more domestic violence from him in the future.      The suspension came two days before the season-opening Daytona 500, and Busch immediately said he'd appeal.      Although an appeal can be heard as early as Saturday, Stewart-Haas Racing has already decided to use Regan Smith in the Daytona 500.      The move to Smith by SHR, perhaps spurred by Chevrolet's decision to suspend its affiliation with Busch on Friday, is a blow to the Busch camp.      \\"We ask everyone's patience as this case continues in the court of law and are confident that when the truth is known Mr. Busch will be fully vindicated and back in the driver's seat,\\" Busch attorney Rusty Hardin said in a statement, adding the assault allegation has led to \\"a travesty of justice\\" that will become clear as Busch continues to defend himself.      Busch is the first driver suspended by NASCAR for domestic violence. Chairman Brian France had maintained the series would let the process play out before ruling on Busch's eligibility — and the series came down hard in finding that he committed actions detrimental to stock car racing and broke the series' behavioral rules.      Travis Kvapil, who qualified second for Friday night's Truck Series race, was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013. NASCAR took no action against Kvapil.      But it's a different time in sports since former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's own case of domestic violence forced leagues to take a harsh stance against participants accused of assault.      After the suspension was announced, on the glass outside of Busch's garage stall at Daytona, someone had scrawled in black marker \\"#41 Ray Rice.\\" Busch drives the No. 41 Chevrolet.      In a 25-page opinion explaining why he issued the no-contact order this week, Family Court Commissioner David Jones of Delaware concluded that it was more likely than not that Busch abused Patricia Driscoll by \\"manually strangling\\" her and smashing her head into a wall inside his motorhome at Dover International Speedway last September.      The 36-year-old Busch has denied the alleged assault, which is the subject of a separate criminal investigation, but the judge said Driscoll's version of the incident was more credible than Busch's.      Driscoll said she was never motivated to have Busch punished by NASCAR.      \\"I reported a crime, just like anybody else who has been abused should do, because no one is above the law,\\" Driscoll said. \\"I'm very encouraged that NASCAR is taking steps to recognize that domestic violence is a serious issue, and I hope that we see them develop a very clear policy on it.\\"      It is Busch's third career suspension. He was suspended in 2012 by NASCAR for threatening a reporter, and parked for the final two races of the 2005 season by Roush-Fenway Racing after he was pulled over by police in Arizona.      He now races for SHR. Busch has 25 career wins but only one since 2011. It came last year, his first season with SHR, the team that helped resurrect his career.      Team co-owner Gene Haas hand-picked Busch to drive a car paid for out of pocket by Haas because the machine tool manufacturer wanted to see a driver take his company to victory lane. Busch was fired at the end of 2011 by Roger Penske for a series of on- and off-track incidents, and he spent two seasons driving for low-budget teams before Haas extended the olive branch.      Busch had been on a resurgence of sorts at SHR, which allowed him to compete in both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day last year. He finished sixth at Indianapolis last May and was named rookie of the race.      But his season began to unravel late last summer as his performance tailed off. Although he made the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship, he was eliminated after the first round.      It was the weekend of the first elimination race, at Dover, where Driscoll alleged Busch assaulted her in his motorhome.      She said she drove to the track out of concern for Busch, who sent her alarming text messages following a poor qualifying effort. She said the two argued in the bedroom section of the motorhome before he slammed her head against a wall three times.      Driscoll did not file charges until November, and the Delaware attorney general has not decided if Busch will be charged.      But Driscoll sought a no-contact order, and the couple spent four days over December and January in a Delaware court presenting their sides. At one point, he accused of her of being a trained assassin.      SHR said only that Smith, who filled in on short notice for Tony Stewart at Watkins Glen last August, would race Sunday. No plans were announced for next week's race at Atlanta, but since Haas pays for that car specifically for Busch, the team co-owner could conceivably park it if Busch does not win his appeal. ||||| DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- NASCAR suspended Sprint Cup driver Kurt Busch indefinitely Friday, two days before the Daytona 500, for actions detrimental to stock car racing after a judge ruled he almost surely choked and beat a former girlfriend last fall.      Earlier Friday it was ruled that Busch smashed his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll's head against his motor home wall Sept. 26 at Dover International Speedway, according to the conclusions of a Kent County (Del.) family court commissioner who granted Driscoll's request for a protective order Monday.      \\"Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately,\\" NASCAR said in a statement. \\"He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice.      Editor's Picks Oreovicz: NASCAR had no choice The report issued Friday in the Delaware Family Court case between Kurt Busch and ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll left NASCAR no choice but to suspend the former Sprint Cup champion.      \\"Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made. We will continue to respect the process and timetable of the authorities involved.\\"      Busch on Friday night filed paperwork for an appeal on his suspension, which will be heard at noon ET Saturday in Daytona, NASCAR spokesman David Higdon said.      \\"We are extremely disappointed that NASCAR has suspended Kurt Busch,\\" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in a statement Friday afternoon. \\"We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold.\\"      Hardin, who cannot represent Busch in the NASCAR appeal because the appeal process does not allow for lawyers to represent NASCAR members, reiterated his hope that the family court commissioner reconsiders his opinion based on additional evidence that would show Driscoll is not credible.      \\"It is important for everyone to remember that the commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch,\\" Hardin said. \\"We ask everyone's patience as this case continues in the court of law and are confident that when the truth is known Mr. Busch will be fully vindicated and back in the driver's seat.\\"      NASCAR has suspended Stewart-Haas driver Kurt Busch indefinitely after a judge detailed concerns about domestic violence in a ruling Friday. Chris Trotman/NASCAR/Getty Images      NASCAR appeals are heard by a three-member panel selected from a list of former drivers, racing promoters and racing executives in the NASCAR rule book.      During the appeal, NASCAR will present its evidence, Busch will make his argument and then they both are permitted opportunities for rebuttal. Both sides can bring witnesses but not legal counsel, and the panelists can summon any NASCAR member from whom they want to hear.      If Busch loses the appeal, he can make one last appeal to former Gulfstream president Bryan Moss, NASCAR's final appeals officer. NASCAR chairman Brian France also has the ability to lift the suspension at any time.      It wasn't immediately clear if Busch wins his appeal whether he could still drive for SHR, which gets a significant amount of financial support from Chevrolet.      In her statement, Driscoll said she did not consider this a \\"victory.\\"      \\"For victims of domestic violence there are no victories,\\" she said. \\"My only hope is that the pain and trauma I suffered through this process will help other victims find their voice.      \\"Unfortunately we live in a culture where stories like mine are often swept under the rug out of fear and with the knowledge that for every person who shows empathy many more will seek to disparage the victim. It is bad enough to endure the actual physical abuse, but the verbal attacks that follow when a victim speaks up are sometimes just as painful.\\"      NASCAR executive vice president Steve O'Donnell did not take questions from the media during Friday's brief news conference.      \\"As we stated last year, NASCAR fully recognized the serious nature of the specific situation involving Kurt Busch and really the broader issue of domestic violence. Based on our review of the available details, including the court's findings that were released earlier today, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch.\\" NASCAR executive VP Steve O'Donnell      \\"As we stated last year, NASCAR fully recognized the serious nature of the specific situation involving Kurt Busch and really the broader issue of domestic violence,\\" O'Donnell said. \\"Based on our review of the available details, including the court's findings that were released earlier today, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch.\\"      O'Donnell, who resigned his spot on the board of Driscoll's Armed Forces Foundation late last year, disputed comments from Driscoll that indicated that other women in the NASCAR industry have been abused by others in the NASCAR community.      \\"NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership and the broader industry that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated in the industry,\\" O'Donnell said. \\"We want to make it clear that any inference that there is a culture or tolerance for this type of behavior is patently false.\\"      Busch will be replaced for the Daytona 500 by 31-year-old Regan Smith, who has one win in 172 career starts and competes full time in the Nationwide Series for JR Motorsports. Smith replaced SHR driver/co-owner Tony Stewart at Watkins Glen last August, the day after Stewart's sprint car struck and killed Kevin Ward Jr. at Canandaigua Motorsports Park.      Smith will be able to practice during the 85-minute Sprint Cup practice session Saturday. Although Busch would have started 24th Sunday, Smith will have to move to the rear of the field at the start of the Daytona 500 because of the driver change.      SHR, in a news release, said that it has not determined who will drive the car beyond Daytona.      \\"We understand NASCAR's position regarding Kurt Busch and accept their decision,\\" Stewart-Haas Racing executive vice president Joe Custer said in a statement.      Chevrolet was quick to suspend ties with Busch following NASCAR's announcement.      \\"Chevrolet has suspended its relationship with Kurt Busch indefinitely,\\" said Jim Campbell, Chevrolet vice president of Motorsports and Performance Vehicles in a statement. \\"We will continue to monitor the events surrounding Mr. Busch and are prepared to take additional action if necessary.\\"      Busch is the first driver suspended by NASCAR for domestic violence. Travis Kvapil, who qualified second for Friday night's Truck Series race, was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013. NASCAR took no action against Kvapil.      A short time after the suspension was announced, on the glass outside of Busch's garage stall at Daytona, someone had scrawled in black marker \\"#41 Ray Rice,\\" a reference to the former Baltimore Ravens running back whose own case of domestic violence dominated much of last year. Busch drives the No. 41 Chevrolet.      It is Busch's third career suspension. He was suspended in 2012 by NASCAR for threatening a reporter, and parked for the final two races of the 2005 season by Roush-Fenway Racing after he was pulled over by police in Arizona.      \\"The Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that, on September 26, 2014, Respondent [Busch] committed an act of domestic violence against Petitioner [Driscoll] by manually strangling her by placing his left hand on her throat, while placing his right hand on her chin and face and smashing her head into the wall of his motor home,\\" commissioner David Jones wrote in his findings and conclusions.      Regan Smith, who competes full time in the Xfinity Series for JR Motorsports, will fill in for Kurt Busch in Sunday's Daytona 500. Todd Warshaw/Getty Images      As part of his decision, Jones will require Busch \\"to be evaluated by a licensed mental health professional\\" and complete any further steps for treatment that person recommends. Jones wrote that he would not require Busch to enter into a \\"batterer's intervention program,\\" because in his opinion, Busch did not profile as a habitual \\"power and control batterer.\\" Jones characterized the incident of domestic violence as \\"likely situational in nature.\\"      Busch claims Driscoll entered his motor home uninvited -- the couple had broken up a week earlier -- and he cupped her face with his hands while repeatedly asking her to leave.      In his opinion released Friday, Jones wrote that Driscoll's version of the events that night was more credible, citing, among other things, her demeanor when she recalled and described the events of that night.      \\"[Busch's] version of the events is implausible, does not make sense and is unlikely to be true given the totality of the other evidence admitted at trial,\\" Jones wrote.      Busch has asked Jones to reconsider the ruling, and Jones has still not decided whether to reopen the case.      \\"We are confident that if the Commissioner agrees to hear newly available evidence that contradicts the testimony of Ms. Driscoll, he will be able understand the actions of that night as well as Ms. Driscoll's character and motivations and reconsider his judgment\\" Hardin said in Friday's statement. \\"He has already found that Ms. Driscoll lied under oath at least once. Our newly available evidence will make it clear that much more of her testimony was untruthful and was purposefully kept from the Commissioner by Ms. Driscoll's attempts to intimidate and threaten witnesses.\\"      Busch told ESPN.com on Wednesday that he was \\"focused on racing\\" and declined further comment.      \\"It's a matter of just knowing that the truth has been told, and we'll see how things unfold,\\" Busch said Feb. 12, the day before practice began at Daytona.      Both sides tried to shed doubt and attacked each other's credibility during the family court hearing, which at times took bizarre turns.      Driscoll characterized Busch, the 2004 Cup champion, as battling alcoholism and depression leading up to the alleged assault. Busch testified he was afraid of Driscoll, whom he believed was a trained assassin because of the stories and photos she had shared with him.      \\"The assertion that [Busch] would be chastened from assaulting [Driscoll] for fear of the possibility of physical injury is further discredited, in the Court's view, by the fact that [Busch] makes his living risking his life on an almost daily basis by aggressively driving a race car at speeds often approaching 200 miles per hour in close contact with others driving in the same manner, at the same speed,\\" Jones wrote.      Busch opted to get his side of the story out in court over two days of Delaware family court hearings in December and two more days in January.      Busch is basing his request for reconsideration on the protective order on new evidence his attorneys claim shed more doubt on Driscoll's claims and reinforce their argument that Driscoll is a spurned lover looking to ruin the NASCAR driver's career. Included in that evidence, according to the motion for reconsideration, is Beverly Young, whom Driscoll considers her mother although they are not biologically related, stating that she did not believe Driscoll's claims.      Busch, the 2004 NASCAR champion, has 25 career wins but only one since 2011. It came last year, his first season with SHR, the team that helped resurrect his career.

Commissioner David Jones in a written opinion filed Friday wrote that evidence presented during the four-day protection order hearing was enough to convince him that Busch had used his left hand to manually strangle his ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, while placing his right hand against her chin and face, causing her head to \\"forcefully strike the interior wall\\" of Busch's motorhome. The alleged incident happened during raceweek in Busch's motorhome at Dover International Speedway.      Busch's attorneys deny Driscoll's allegations of abuse.      Jones also wrote that there could be future acts of abuse against intimate partners because of his \\"propensity to lose control of his behavior and act out violently in response to stressful, disappointing and/or frustrating situations involving his racing.\\"      Jones said the incident was \\"likely situational in nature\\" where the \\"stressors of the situation\\" overwhelmed Busch's ability to \\"cope and control his tendency to act out violently in response to stress and frustration, causing him to 'snap' and assault\\" Driscoll.      Friday evening NASCAR announced it would suspend Busch indefinitely for \\"actions detrimental to stock car racing,\\" according to a statement. Busch, the 2004 Sprint Cup champion, was scheduled to participate in Sunday's Daytona 500.      \\"Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately. He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice,\\" the e-mailed release said. \\"Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made. We will continue to respect the process and timetable of the authorities involved.\\"      Carolyn McNeice, Driscoll's attorney, said in an email that she was very pleased with the opinion's contents.      In a statement, Driscoll said she hopes what she went through will help other women.      \\"For victims of domestic violence there are no 'victories.' My only hope is that the pain and trauma I suffered through this process will help other victims find their voice. Unfortunately we live in a culture where stories like mine are often swept under the rug out of fear and with the knowledge that for every person who shows empathy many more will seek to disparage the victim. It is bad enough to endure the actual physical abuse but the verbal attacks that follow when a victim speaks up are sometimes just as painful.      \\"Today NASCAR took an important step and deserves to be commended. The next steps are to develop a thorough process and policies that reenforce the organization's position it took today: Domestic violence will not be tolerated in NASCAR.\\"      Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in an e-mailed statement that his team was \\"extremely disappointed\\" that NASCAR suspended the driver. He said he plans an immediate appeal and is confident that Busch will be vindicated and back in the driver's seat once the truth is known.      \\"We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold,\\" Hardin said in the e-mailed statement.      \\"We are confident that if the Commissioner agrees to hear newly available evidence that contradicts the testimony of Ms. Driscoll, he will be able understand the actions of that night as well as Ms. Driscoll's character and motivations and reconsider his judgment. He has already found that Ms. Driscoll lied under oath at least once,\\" he added. \\"Our newly available evidence will make it clear that much more of her testimony was untruthful and was purposefully kept from the Commissioner by Ms. Driscoll's attempts to intimidate and threaten witnesses.\\"      Jones's opinion comes after he issued a protection order against Busch on Monday. The civil order, good until 2016, said Busch has to stay 100 yards away from Driscoll, her home and workplace. At NASCAR races he has to maintain the maximum \\"practicable\\" distance from her and not attempt to contact her, according to the order. Driscoll is the president of the Armed Forces Foundation, which holds events at NASCAR races across the country.      Busch is also not allowed to contact Driscoll by phone, email or any other means and has to be evaluated for mental health problems related to anger control and impulse control. He also may not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition.      Busch's attorneys filed a motion Thursday to re-open the protection order hearing. They claim that multiple witnesses have come forward since the hearing's conclusion and provided information that contradicts versions of the events, and asked Jones to delay his opinion until ruling on his motion.      In a letter to attorneys, Jones did not discount that motion and wrote he decided to publish the opinion, as scheduled, because his reasoning may offer some clarity regarding the motion to reopen.      Busch's attorneys said that Driscoll had repeatedly lied on the stand and committed perjury. In his opinion, Jones wrote that he could not find that any conflict or contradiction that constituted perjury. Discrepancies in testimony were likely the result of a misunderstanding or misremembering by Driscoll because of her emotional state, rather than intentional falsehood, Jones wrote.      Rusty Hardin, Busch's attorney, requested the Delaware Attorney General's Office to investigate separate allegations that Driscoll had tampered with witnesses. A spokesman from the Attorney General's office confirmed an email from Busch's attorneys and referred it to the Dover Police Department.      The Attorney General's office has yet to rule on the criminal charges filed against Busch last year.      In an e-mail, a spokesman said they had no comment on the court opinion or Busch's suspension.

Busch has appealed against the suspension, which came two days before the Daytona 500 race. The judge stated there was a \\"substantial likelihood\\" of further domestic violence from Busch in the future, and part of the indefinite suspension includes that he will not be allowed to race or participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice. Busch has denied the alleged assault, but the judge found his former girlfriend's version of the incident more credible.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A controversial gun measure won't become law in Missouri after a push to override the governor's veto fell one vote short of approval in the state's Senate on Wednesday. The measure, HB 436, would have essentially nullified federal gun laws in the state. Senators voted 22-12 in favor of overriding Gov. Jay Nixon's veto, but the vote fell just short of the two thirds majority required to pass. Earlier Wednesday, the state's House of Representatives voted 109-49 in favor of overriding the veto. If it had passed, the law would have technically not only let residents own a machine gun but also arrested federal agents if they tried to take it away. The bill also would have made it illegal for anyone to publish any information about a gun owner. The legislation passed earlier this year in Missouri's Republican-led House and Senate but vetoed by Nixon, a Democrat. Nixon argued that the legislation violated a provision in the U.S. Constitution called the Supremacy Clause. The Supremacy Clause gives preference to federal laws over state laws. Lawmakers had argued that what they were proposing was not only constitutional but essential to protect the rights of gun owners. \\"There are people saying this is the same as seceding from the Union,\\" said gun owner Kevin Jamison. \\"Missouri did not secede from the Union in 1862, and it does not do so by passing this law.\\" Colorado recall a proxy in national gun control debate. What the bill said. \\"This bill doesn't put one new gun on the street,\\" said State Rep. Doug Funderburk, a Republican. \\"It strictly says that Missouri is going to protect the Second Amendment rights of Missourians.\\" By superseding federal regulations, House Bill 436 would have made it a criminal offense to enforce background checks or to publish the name and address of a gun owner in the state. It would also have technically allowed citizens to own a machine gun, which is banned under federal regulations, according to the governor's office. And it would have nullified federal gun laws and allowed citizens to take legal action against officers who try to enforce them. Gun permits for the blind? Iowa grants them, stirs debate. Opponents worry. Ohio, Minnesota and Texas have pursued similar bills in recent months in reaction to attempts at federal gun control legislation after the December shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Opponents worry such laws could all but end any joint operations between local and federal law enforcement agencies when it comes to taking guns off the streets. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson has been one of its most vocal opponents. \\"(We are) basically saying to criminals, 'OK criminals, it's OK to come to Missouri. We won't prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,' \\" he said. CNN's George Howell reported from Kearney, Missouri; Leslie Bentz from Washington.

The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other., Now Is the Time is the second studio album by Alanis Morissette, released only in Canada on August 1, 1992. It was the final album for MCA Records Canada. Morissette recorded the album with Leslie Howe, who produced her debut album, \\"Alanis\\" (1991)., Leslie Howe is a Canadian musician and record producer based in Ottawa, Ontario. He has been a member of the bands One to One, Sal's Birdland and Artificial Joy Club, and produced Alanis Morissette's early pop music albums, \\"Alanis\\" (1991) and \\"Now Is the Time\\" (1992)., Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk)., \`\` An Emotion Away '' is a pop - dance song co-written by Alanis Morissette , Leslie Howe and Serge Côté , and produced by Howe for Morissette 's second album Now Is the Time ( 1992 ) . Its protagonist tells someone who \`\` completely took ( her ) heart by surprise '' that \`\` love is just an emotion away '' . It was released as the album 's first single in 1992 ( see 1992 in music ) and reached number twenty - four on the Canadian singles chart . \`\` An Emotion Away '' was the most successful single from Now Is the Time , which sold moderately . Leslie Howe engineered and mixed the song . The B - side on the cassette single was \`\` When We Meet Again '' , another track from Now Is the Time . The song , along with \`\` Too Hot '' and \`\` Feel Your Love '' ( from Morissette 's 1991 debut album Alanis ) , was used on the soundtrack of the 1993 film Just One of the Girls , in which Morissette appeared ., Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began work on her next album after moving from her hometown, Ottawa, to Toronto; she did not make much progress until she traveled to Los Angeles, where she met Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection, and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds., A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. , Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998., Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions., Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material.  - Europa-Park is a theme park and the largest in Germany, and the second most popular theme park resort in Europe, following Disneyland Paris.  - Asphalt (, occasionally ), also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek  \\"ásphaltos\\".  - Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world, used as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and most non-speciality grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder produced by heating materials in a kiln to form what is called clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. Several types of Portland cement are available, with the most common being called ordinary Portland cement (OPC) which is grey in color, but a white Portland cement is also available.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping section of track on a roller coaster on which the roller coaster train is mechanically lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills.  - Polymer concretes are a type of concrete that use polymers to replace lime-type cements as a binder. In some cases the polymer is used in addition to portland cement to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971.  - Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and tarmac or bitumen macadam in Great Britain and Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, and airports. It consists of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt, laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant Edward de Smedt. It is increasingly being used as the core of embankment dams.  - Temple of the Night Hawk is an enclosed roller coaster located at Phantasialand . Founded in 1988 after 18 months of construction , the ride was originally called \`\` ' Space Center ' '' . The ride led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light to resemble stars . Due to the construction of the neighbouring Wurze Town in 2001 , the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and was renamed as the Temple of the Night Hawk . The roller coaster is now completely dark . Until 2006 there were some green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lifthill , still present today , but not operational . In 2008 the Lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broke down and have never been repaired since then . Till 2010 there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk and until June 2012 , there were some red strobe - lights at the final brakerun . In 2011 , the park installed new strobe lights in the first lifthill , which broke down after about two months , and were never repaired since then . The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs each with seven cars . Each car has two rows of seats each holding two people . During the four - minute ride time the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains , 1.174 metres of track . The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the World , slightly beaten by \`\` Mindbender '' in Galaxyland Amusement Park , Canada . The hall in which the track is located is around 120,000m³ in size and rests on 180 concrete pillars which are 12 metres deep in the ground . In the basement of the hall is the \`\` ' Hollywood Tour '' ' darkride . The total investment for the ride was around 15 million DM . With the redevelopment of the ride in 2001 the park tried greening the roof of the hall by installing an irrigation system , however the results were n't as good as expected .

The park was opened in 1967 by Gottlieb Löffelhardt and Richard Schmidt. Although starting as a family-oriented park, Phantasialand has also added thrill rides, especially during recent years. Furthermore, following the example of Europa-Park, they have decided to attract business customers beside the regular ones, calling it \\"Business der neuen Dimension\\" (\\"business of a new dimension\\").  - Road surface or pavement is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, such as a road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways.  - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.  - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.

Vice-President Nicolas Maduro told mourners Mr Chavez, who led Venezuela for 14 years, remained \\"undefeated, pure, living for all time\\". Mr Maduro was due to be sworn in as acting president later on Friday. He has to call elections within 30 days. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles condemned Mr Maduro's imminent inauguration as \\"fraudulent\\". He said that \\"nobody elected\\" Maduro president and that the government was \\"abusing\\" its powers. Opposition parties are boycotting Mr Maduro's swearing-in, arguing that under the constitution the speaker of the National Assembly should be the one to take over as acting president. But, in a decision made public as the funeral went ahead, Venezuela's Supreme Court ruled in Mr Maduro's favour. In pictures: Hugo Chavez funeral Hugo Chavez, 58, died on Tuesday after a two-year battle with cancer. The vice-president began the funeral ceremony by presenting Mr Chavez's coffin with the sword of Simon Bolivar - the 19th-Century independence leader he claimed as his inspiration. In his eulogy, Mr Maduro said no other leader had been as vilified as Mr Chavez, but no-one had been able to stop him or his socialist \\"revolution\\". \\"The humble, the poor, the oppressed - we are his living testimony\\", Mr Maduro said. He also praised Mr Chavez's work for Latin American unity, and said he worked for \\"a world without empires\\". More than 30 world leaders attended the ceremony, including Cuban President Raul Castro, Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. A message was read out from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. By Irene CaselliBBC News, Caracas People lined up outside the military academy for the second consecutive day to see Hugo Chavez's body. The atmosphere was festive, with live music blasting through speakers. At the same time, foreign dignitaries from more than 30 countries, including Cuba's Raul Castro and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, started arriving for the state funeral. The ceremony started with the national anthem played by Venezuela's famous Simon Bolivar National Youth Orchestra, directed by Gustavo Dudamel, director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Vice-President Nicolas Maduro placed a replica of the sword used by Simon Bolivar, the 19th-Century revolutionary, on top of Mr Chavez's coffin. All presidents were then called one by one to stand by the coffin in groups of eight for a minute of silence. Mr Castro went first. Mr Ahmadinejad kissed the coffin. The ceremony ended with a speech by Mr Maduro on Mr Chavez's legacy. \\"Chavez lives. The fight goes on,\\" he said. Honour guards were made up of prominent Venezuelans, including student leaders and baseball players, Formula One driver Pastor Maldonado and conductor Carlos Dudamel. Mourners inside the venue chanted \\"Chavez did not die, he multiplied!\\" Ecumenical prayers were led by three religious leaders, including the American civil rights activist, Rev Jesse Jackson, who called for reconciliation between Venezuela and the US. \\"We share the same hemisphere, we play ball together, we trade resources together, we share dreams together,\\" he said. Outside, huge crowds dressed in the red sang \\"Chavez lives!\\" and \\"The struggle continues!\\" More than two million people have filed past Mr Chavez's coffin, and his body is to be put on permanent display. On Thursday, Mr Maduro said that Mr Chavez's body would be embalmed \\"like Lenin and Mao Zedong\\". The body will be moved to the Caracas military museum where in 1992 Mr Chavez - as an army officer - was captured after leading a failed coup. The building will be converted into a new \\"museum of the revolution\\", Mr Maduro said. Supporters want him eventually interred in Venezuela's national Pantheon alongside Simon Bolivar. However, under Venezuela's constitution, people may only be admitted to the Pantheon 25 years after their death. Mr Chavez, 58, was re-elected for a fourth term as president last October after saying he had recovered from his illness. He named Mr Maduro as his preferred successor following the recurrence of his cancer. The vice-president is to be sworn in as acting president after the funeral in a special session of the National Assembly. Under Venezuela's constitution, elections must be called within 30 days and the government has said it will abide by this. Mr Maduro will be the candidate for the governing United Socialist Party (PSUV).

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which island experienced more environmental degradation?  Two islands of identical size with similar ecosystems experienced different destinies. Caribu island, inhabited by more natives, hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few. People from Hiji island, were pescotarian, and hardly ever fished.  Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Caribu Island experienced more environmental degradation. The inhabitants of Caribu Island hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few, while people from Hiji Island were pescotarians and hardly ever fished, implying a lesser impact on the ecosystem. The paragraph also emphasizes the importance of biodiversity and how even minor changes can have significant effects on food webs and overall ecosystem health.

Article: ORLANDO -- The Orlando Police Department on Monday released audio from the 911 calls made by Omar Mateen the night he went on a rampage at Pulse nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring more than 50 others.      Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber on Monday ordered that calls made by Mateen, who died during the massacre, be made public immediately.      The city previously released a transcript of the calls.      In the first call, made at at 2:48 a.m. on June 12, Mateen can be heard calmly pledging allegiance to ISIS. His voice rises in anger when he talks about the bombings in Iraq and Syria.      Mateen emphatically tells a police negotiator that he needs to tell the U.S. government to stop bombings in Syria and Iraq.      “Who am I speaking with, please?” the negotiator from the Orlando police asks.      “You are speaking with the person who pledges allegiance to the Islamic State of (inaudible),” Mateen responds.      The negotiator then asks Mateen to tell him where he is located.      “No. Because you have to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq,” Mateen says quickly. “They are killing a lot of innocent people. So what am I to do here? When my people are getting killed over there. You get what I’m saying?”      “I do. I completely get what you’re saying,” the negotiator answers. “What I am trying to do is prevent anyone else from getting ...”      “You need to stop the U.S. airstrikes,” Mateen interrupts. “They need to stop the U.S. airstrikes, okay?”      Later in the call, the dispatcher asks Mateen to tell him what he did.      “You already know what I did,” Mateen answers.      The negotiator tells Mateen he is trying to keep him safe, and get this situation resolved peacefully. Mateen responds by saying there are vehicles outside with bombs in them.      “Your people are going to get it and I’m going to ignite it if they try to do anything stupid,” Mateen says.      The negotiator asks what vehicle, “Because I don’t want to see anybody get hurt.”      “No. But I’ll tell you this, they can take out a whole city block almost,” Mateen responds.      In the call, Mateen also calls the Boston Marathon bomber his “homeboy.” He refers to himself as an Islamic soldier, and a Soldier of the God.      Mateen also indicates that he is wearing a vest, “It’s what they used in France,” he says. But later, he tells the dispatcher he is not wearing a vest after all.      The call continues with Mateen ranting about Iraq and Syria, and demanding the bombings stop. At one point, he seems to hang up the call.      The judge who ordered the release of the tapes said Monday she can’t make a decision on whether 232 other calls can be released until she has heard them.            Media groups want the calls released so the public can evaluate the police response to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.            The city of Orlando says the calls depict suffering and shouldn’t be made public.      The calls made by Mateen can be heard below, via CBS affiliate WKMG. ||||| The man on the phone said he was the person who had just opened fire June 12 inside Pulse nightclub, but Orlando police could not be sure.      The caller, later identified as Omar Mateen, repeatedly hung up on the Orlando police negotiator who had to call him back more than a dozen times.      From about 3:15 a.m. to about 3:20 a.m., officers could be heard in the background trying to pinpoint where Mateen might be. The background noise was \\"sterile,\\" said one officer, as if he were in an office. Or a bathroom, said another.      \\"I'm still not convinced this guy's in there,\\" the negotiator said as Mateen's phone rang. Law enforcement officers were going to Mateen's address in Fort Pierce to check whether he was home, and Orlando police pinged his cellphone to establish his location.      Despite his misgivings, the negotiator, who identified himself as Andy, treated Mateen seriously when they talked.      He spoke calmly but with a sense of urgency as he tried to pry information from Mateen: where in the club he was, whether there were injured people with him, whether he had explosives or accomplices, what would get him to surrender.      At the Orange County Regional History Center's private warehouse, archival specialists work on restoration, preservation and cataloguing items collected from the various memorials honoring the victims of the Pulse nightclub massacre, Friday, Sept. 1, 2016. (Joe Burbank) (Joe Burbank)      The nearly 30 minutes of audio of Omar Mateen's 911 calls were released Monday. The written transcripts of the calls were made public in September.      The attack on the LGBTQ nightclub left 49 people dead and at least 68 injured. Orlando police and Orange County deputies killed Mateen during a shootout just after 5 a.m.      Mateen was the one who first made contact with police, calling 911 and pledging his allegiance to the Islamic State. He recited part of a prayer in Arabic before telling the dispatcher in English that he \\"did the shooting.\\"      Throughout the calls, Mateen repeatedly said he committed the attack to \\"stop the U.S. airstrikes\\" on Iraq and Syria.

Police reached Mateen again just before 3:25 a.m.      \\"You're annoying me with these phone calls, and I don't really appreciate it,\\" Mateen said.      \\"Well, I understand that, but the fact that you appreciate it or not doesn't matter at this point,\\" the negotiator said. \\"We need to talk, and we need to stay in open communication.\\"      Mateen told the negotiator not to \\"talk to me like that.\\"      The negotiator said he had been passing along the message about the airstrikes but suggested that Mateen come outside unarmed and tell the police himself. Mateen hung up and did not pick up his phone again.

They marched to music as other troops sat on horses for the annual ceremony, known as Trooping the Color. It took place on the Horse Guards Parade, the marching ground within sight of the queen's residence at Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth, wearing a lilac outfit and hat decorated with bow of pink and green, sat front and center to watch what many consider the most celebrated event on the British royal calendar. The queen, who turned 84 this year, was born on April 21 but celebrates her birthday on a Saturday in June when the weather is better. Trooping the Color dates at least to the early 18th century, when the colors -- or flags -- of the battalion were \\"trooped\\" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by all the soldiers, according to Buckingham Palace and the British Army. Since 1748, the ceremony has also marked the sovereign's official birthday, the palace said. Queen Elizabeth has attended it every year except for 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace said. A limited number of tickets are available to the public to watch the event at the Horse Guards Parade. It is also shown live on TV, and others can watch the troops go by on The Mall, which leads from the palace to the parade. The ceremony is carried out by fully operational troops from the Household Division of the British Army. Only one color can be trooped at a time, and the five Household Regiments -- Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish, and Welsh Guards -- take their turn each year. This year it was the turn of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, who recently returned from Afghanistan. At the end of the ceremony, the queen climbed into an open-top horse-drawn carriage for the ride back to Buckingham Palace. The crowds along The Mall, lined with Union Jacks, cheered as she went past. The queen then stood on the palace balcony to watch a military fly-past that ended with aircraft trailing red, white, and blue, the colors of the British flag. She waved to the crowds and was joined by other members of the royal family, including her husband, Prince Philip; her son, Prince Charles; and her grandson, Prince William.

Identify the sentiment of each phrase:     a) \\"give his audience a single character worth rooting for\\": This phrase carries a positive sentiment, as it suggests that the creator should provide a character that the audience can support and relate to.    b) \\"worth rooting against, for that matter\\": This phrase carries a negative sentiment, highlighting that there isn't even a character to root against. 3. Combine the sentiment values: As there is both a positive and negative sentiment in the sentence, it can be considered a mixed sentiment. 4. Determine the overall sentiment: Given the context, the overall sentiment leans more towards negative since the main message seems to imply the lack of engaging character development in the movie.

Given the question: Information:  - The guanaco (\\"Lama guanicoe\\"), a camelid native to South America, stands between at the shoulder and weighs . Its color varies very little (unlike the domestic llama), ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small, straight ears.  - Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos.  - Vicugna is a genus containing two South American camelids , the vicuña and the alpaca . Previously thought to be descended from the llama , the alpaca was reclassified as part of Vicugna after a 2001 paper on alpaca DNA . The paper showed that the alpaca is descended from the vicuña , not the guanaco .  - An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance.  - The vicuña (\\"Vicugna vicugna\\") or vicugna (both ) is one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicuñas produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicuña's wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicuñas highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicuña garments; today the vicuña is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms.  - The llama (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \\"humps\\" on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (\\"C. dromedarius\\"), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (\\"C. bactrianus\\"), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (\\"C. ferus\\") that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia. Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015). Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.

Question: Process:  - They expand to take the air in  - The cells of the lung hold the air - They take in the air and remove the Oxygen - They inflate and all the bad air leaves through the mouth - They do it all over again.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate improves happens, how will it affect oxygen in the air is absorbed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process of respiration and the absorption of oxygen in the lungs is primarily based on a well-established mechanism within the human body. The process, as described in the prompt, involves the expansion of lungs, holding air, extracting oxygen, and expelling bad air. However, the perturbation hypothesis raises a thought-provoking question about the potential effects that an improved climate might pose on this process. In this context, we must first understand what an improved climate entails and then examine its direct or indirect effects on oxygen absorption. An improved climate can be interpreted in a few different ways. Generally, it could refer to reduced air pollution, decreased carbon dioxide concentrations, increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere, or a combination of these factors. Assuming this interpretation, we can then examine how these changes might affect the oxygen absorption process in the lungs. 1. Reduced air pollution: Air pollution consists of harmful particulate matter and gases that can pose health risks when inhaled. One potential benefit of reduced air pollution is that the lungs can efficiently perform their role in oxygen absorption. The presence of particulate matter, such as PM2.5 and PM10, can hinder the process by embedding themselves in lung tissues, which may cause inflammation, obstruct the airways, and impair the alveoli's ability to absorb oxygen effectively. Therefore, in an improved climate with reduced air pollution, the lungs may function more effectively, leading to improved oxygen absorption without direct changes to the process itself. 2. Decreased carbon dioxide concentrations: High levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere can not only contribute to climate change but also impact human health by causing a build-up of CO2 in the blood. When CO2 concentrations in the blood rise, it affects the delicate balance between oxygen and CO2 exchange in the lungs. An improved climate with lower CO2 concentrations can help maintain that balance, thus indirectly supporting the proper functioning of the oxygen absorption process in the lungs. 3. Increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere: An improved climate may also lead to increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere due to higher photosynthesis rates, particularly in forests and oceans. Higher levels of oxygen availability can contribute to improved lung function and oxygen absorption. However, it is essential to note that the atmosphere already contains a sufficient amount of oxygen (around 21%) for healthy breathing, so any increase may not necessarily have a significant impact on the human respiratory system. The oxygen absorption process itself may remain consistent, with no direct changes to the mechanism. In conclusion, an improved climate can have several positive effects on human health and the efficiency of the lungs in terms of oxygen absorption. While these improvements may not directly alter the process of respiration itself, they could contribute to an enhanced environment for the lungs to function, ultimately leading to better oxygen absorption and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: by Fox News | September 26, 2011      If Mitt Romney was in New York City Monday to kiss the ring of business mogul Donald Trump, he didn't seem to want the press to capture his reaction afterwards.      According to Fox News producer Nicole Busch, Romney's director of operations stood with the media the entire time they waited to catch a glimpse of the former Massachusetts Governor...only to tell reporters and cameras after an hour that Romney had already come and went.      \\"Chicken Mitt!!\\" DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse wrote in a rapid fire email to reporters upon learning the Romney aide had misled the press while the candidate departed another exit. \\"Bwok-Bwok!\\" he continued.      But in contrast to the DNC's caricature of Romney's actions, Donald Trump told Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto afterwards that he and Romney had a \\"really had a great hour together\\" and that he was \\"impressed by certain things\\" Romney said during their meeting.      \\"I thought he was very good at the debate, I think he did a good job, I did tell him that,\\" Trump said, although he has yet to endorse a candidate.      Mitt Romney requested the one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump, their first since Romney declared a run for the Oval Office; fellow Republican hopefuls Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry have already met with the reality television host. Herman Cain has a meeting scheduled next week.      In the interview with Cavuto, Trump walked back from less than flattering comments he has made about Romney in the past.      \\"Mitt Romney is a basically small business guy, if you really think about it,\\" Trump said of his potential rival in April as he pondered the idea of a presidential run. \\"He was a hedge fund. He was a fund guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create it.\\"      The hither-to lack of fuzzy feelings between the two men did not stop the DNC from trying to lump the two men together in a web video released Monday morning, entitled \\"Trump, Romney: You're Fired!\\" You can watch the DNC web video here. ||||| Fresh off a victory in the Michigan straw poll, Mitt Romney will be reaching out to another sizable part of the Republican base Monday -- Donald Trump Romney will be meeting with His Trumpness in New York on Monday afternoon, becoming the latest GOP presidential aspirant to court the developer/TV host/former potential candidate/birth certificate investigator. Rick Perry dined with Trump earlier this month at pricey, exclusive Jean-Georges in Manhattan. (You might recall that in June, Trump and Sarah Palin shared some slices of pizza in Times Square . Read into that what you will.) Michele Bachmann has also met with the Donald and plans to do so again.Why court the blessings of Trump? That’s a good question. Well, for one thing, there are still those out there who believe Trump should be president of the United States. There’s a whole website and everything. (It includes items such as “Trump Answers Boy’s Prayer for New Bike.”) For another, say what you will about the man, but he has a platform. He can pretty much show up on Piers Morgan ’s CNN show or Fox News just about whenever he likes. (And don’t forget “Celebrity Apprentice” on NBC . Don’t worry. He’s not going to let you forget it.) Third, he has money. And he knows other people with money. Presidential candidates like money.But Democrats are just as eager to associate Trump with the GOP, as the candidates seem to be to meet with him. Part of it is that it makes Perry, Romney and the like look a little less, well, serious. The other is that Trump is sort of the epitome of the fatcatness that Democrats argue the GOP protects. (This is what GOP calls \\"class warfare.\\")The Democratic National Committee, in fact, has released a video in advance of the Romney-Trump summit, imaginatively titled “You’re Fired” that paints both men as uber-capitalists who care little about the middle-class, education, Medicare or Social Security.Romney is on a small roll. He was widely viewed as handily winning the Fox News- Google debate Thursday night while his top rival, Perry, turned in a shaky performance. Then Perry lost a Florida straw poll he had been expected to win to Herman Cain . On Sunday, Romney trounced Perry and all others in a straw poll in his home state of Michigan.But can he win the coveted Trump endorsement? If there’s one thing to be sure of, it’s that Trump will keep America in suspense as long as possible before answering that question. ||||| Summary:","output":"In September 2011, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney met with business mogul Donald Trump in New York City.

Write a summary based on this article: Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter      / Updated By Lisa Flam      Enormous flat-screens are in millions of homes, but come with a risk that many parents may not realize: children can be seriously hurt in a TV tip-over.      The number of kids injured by a TV falling on them grew 125 percent between 1990 and 2011, according to a new study of emergency room records that calls for greater prevention efforts. Overall, more than 17,000 children under age 18 were treated each year for various TV-related injuries in ERs across the United States – that’s one child every half hour – during that time period, the study released Monday in the journal Pediatrics found.      Between 2000 and 2011, 215 children died from injuries caused by a falling TV.            “This is a serious problem,�? said the study’s senior author, Dr. Gary Smith, a pediatrician at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told NBC News. “A child’s dying once every three weeks from a TV tip-over. The numbers are going up. This is a call to action. These are 100 percent preventable injuries.�?      The increase is from a combination of more TVs in homes and a growing number of injuries from televisions falling from furniture that was not designed to hold them, Smith said. Forty-six percent of the tip-overs involved a TV falling off a dresser or armoire, while 31 percent were due to a TV falling from an entertainment center or TV stand, according to the study.      The rising number of injuries “dispels that myth that as flat-screens came onto the market, we would see a decline in TV tip-overs,\\" Smith said. \\"We’re seeing the opposite.�?            The new research used national data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, tracked from 1990 to 2011.      The lighter, top-heavy design of flat-screens could actually make them easier for a child to pull over, the study found.      The number of kids under age 18 who were injured specifically in a TV tip-over rose to 12,300 in 2011, a 125 percent increase in 22 years. The rate of injury from TV tip-overs increased 95 percent.            Children under the age of 5 were the most at risk -- accounting for 64 percent of the injuries -- because young kids can’t get out of the way as quickly as older children, Smith said. Almost 61 percent of the injured children were boys. Other than falling TVs, children were also hurt by striking or hitting the TV.      The head and neck were the most commonly injured body parts, Smith said, noting that injuries ranged from bruising to death. Other injuries included lacerations, fractures and sprains.      Some injuries are minor, but, “I have seen kids with major traumatic brain injuries as a result of this,�? said Smith, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance.      The study did not differentiate between injuries caused by falling flat-screen televisions and the older, heavier cathode ray tube sets. But Smith speculated that injuries may be increasing as families buy new TVs, and move older ones onto unsuitable furniture.            “What we think is going on is as families purchase a new flat-screen TV, the older TV is being displaced to other parts of the home where it’s placed in a less-safe position, such as on top of dresser, chest of drawers or armoire,�? Smith said.      The study, he said, is a call for parents to secure their televisions and for a strengthening of stability standards for TVs. There are various products to make TVs safer – straps, Velcro, L braces and mounts for flat-screens.            “The overriding recommendation is that all TVs, whether it’s a flat-screen or CRT, must be anchored to the wall to prevent tip-overs and if it’s on a piece of furniture, the furniture needs to be anchored to the wall as well,�? Smith said.            Parents are urged against putting the remote control or toys on top of the television or the furniture it sits on, so kids won’t try to climb up after them.            The Pediatrics study backs up previous research on the dangers of TV tip-overs. But the continued rise in injured children suggests many parents simply aren’t getting the message.      “I think a lot of people think it’s not going to happen to them,�? said Dr. Ryan Stanton, an emergency physician at MESA Medical Group in Lexington, Ky., and spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians.            Stanton, a father of two kids ages 3 and 5, said his own flat-screen TV is bolted to the wall and other televisions are secured as well.      “Everybody knows that after kids get to be 2 ½ years old, there’s nothing too high,�? he said. “You have to look at it from the point of a child. Just grab it and pull, if it starts to tip over and is unstable, your kid’s going to do that, too.�?      Tips from SafeKids.org on how to stabilize any TV in your home:            Mount flat-screen TVs to the wall to prevent them from toppling off stands. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure that you have a secure fit.      If you have a large, heavy, old-style cathode ray tube (CRT) TV, place it on a low, stable piece of furniture.      Use brackets, braces or wall straps      The Consumer Electronics Association has also developed a flyer on TV placement safety to be included in TV instruction manuals, according to its website.      NBC News associate producer Stacey Naggiar andsenior writer JoNel Alecciacontributed to this report ||||| More US children injured by falling televisions - study      Most US households own at least one television set      Falling television sets have injured nearly 200,000 children in the US over 20 years, a study has found.      Most injuries were not serious, and only 2.6% required hospital admission, the study in the journal Pediatrics says.      But the injury rate has climbed substantially for these accidents, it says.      Researchers say changes in the location of TV sets in the home may be responsible for the figure.      Most injuries occur in children under five, with head and neck wounds the most common.      The researchers looked at national figures for non-fatal television-related injuries to children in the period from 1990 to 2011.      In 2011, 12,300 children nationwide received emergency treatment for TV-related injuries, compared with 5,455 in 1990, the study said.      According to the study, 99% of US households own at least one television, and 55% have three or more.      Researchers say the number of TV sets may not be the only reason for the increasing number of injuries.      \\"We speculate that changes in the location of TV placement in the home may be responsible,\\" said the study.      \\"Older TVs may be relegated to less safe locations in the home, such as on dressers or other unsuitable furniture.\\"      The increasing popularity of flat-screen TVs may be another key factor.      \\"Lighter weights coupled with a less bulky design may make flat panels more easily tipped than CRTs (cathode ray tube) and may be contributing to the observed increase in the rate of injuries associated with falling TVs,\\" the study said. |||||","output":"A study published in the journal Pediatrics has revealed that the presence of large flat-screen TVs in homes poses a significant risk of injury to children in the event of a TV tip-over. Between 1990 and 2011, the rate of children injured by a falling TV grew by 125 percent, with more than 17,000 children under the age of 18 being treated annually for TV-related injuries in emergency rooms during this time. The study also showed that between 2000 and 2011, 215 children died from injuries due to a falling TV. Dr. Gary Smith, a pediatrician at Nationwide Children's Hospital and the study’s senior author, described this as a \\"serious problem\\" and a \\"call to action,\\" pointing out that these accidents are entirely preventable. The increase is attributed to a rise in the number of TVs in homes, coupled with more injuries from TVs falling from furniture not intended to bear their weight. According to the study's findings, 46% of these tip-overs involved a TV falling off a dresser or armoire, while 31% resulted from a TV falling from an entertainment center or TV stand.  Contrary to the belief that the influx of flat-screen TVs would reduce the incidence of TV tip-overs, Smith pointed out that the opposite is happening. The lighter, top-heavy design of flat-screens can indeed make them more prone to tipping over when pulled by a child. By 2011, the number of children under 18 who were injured specifically by a falling TV rose to 12,300.  Kids under the age of 5 were found to be most at risk, accounting for 64 percent of these injuries. These children might not be able to avoid the falling object as effectively as older children, and almost 61 percent of the injured children were boys. Besides falling TVs, children also got hurt when striking or hitting the TV. Smith recommended anchoring all TVs to the wall, regardless of their type, to prevent tip-overs. If a TV stands on a piece of furniture, that furniture should also be secured. Devices such as straps, Velcro, L braces, and mounts for flat-screens can help ensure TV safety.  Furthermore, parents should avoid placing toys or remote controls on top of the TV or the furniture it rests on to discourage children from trying to reach for them, reducing the risk of a tip-over. Despite studies highlighting the risks of TV tip-overs, the continuing rise in the number of injured children implies that the message isn't reaching all parents. The study used national data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, covering the period from 1990 to 2011. It did not differentiate between injuries caused by falling flat-screen TVs and older, bulkier cathode ray tube sets, but Smith speculated that the number of injuries might be increasing as families buy new TVs and place older ones on unsuitable furniture. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of parents securing their televisions and bringing about a reinforcement of stability standards for TVs to ensure child safety. This is aligned with the recommendations from SafeKids.org: secure flat-screen TVs to the wall as per the manufacturer’s instructions and put heavy, old-style CRT TVs on low, stable furniture. The Consumer Electronics Association also provides a flyer addressing TV placement safety instructions, further emphasizing the importance of this issue."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two things that effect the force of the fall?\\" is \\"Height and weight of object that is falling\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two things that affect the force of the fall?\\" is \\"Height and weight of the object that is falling.\\"  The paragraph explains that gravitational potential energy depends on both the weight of the object, as a heavier object (like a rock) can cause more damage when falling compared to a lighter object (like a leaf), and on the height of the object above the ground, which influences the speed and impact of the fall (as illustrated by the skateboarder example)."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Summarize the following: If you begin to experience pain associated with back labor, ask your partner, birthing coach, or anyone else who may be in the room with you to give you a back massage. This can help ease some of the pain associated with back labor.  Have your partner apply counter pressure to your lower back with a balled up fist. Rolling something along the back, like a tennis ball, can also help.  The double hip squeeze is a massage position that many women find helpful during back labor. Lean forward and have two people apply pressure to your hips. Moving during labor can help ease the pain of back labor. This could also improve fetal position, making back labor less acute. Most hospitals will let you walk in the hallways during labor, provided there are no specific complications related to your pregnancy that would make walking difficult. Shifting how you are sitting during labor can help shift fetal position and ease the pain of back labor.  If possible, try straddling a chair and leaning forward slightly. You could also kneel against a pile of pillows or, if available, a birthing ball.  You can also get on your hands and knees temporarily as this eases pressure on the spine, a major contributor to the pains and discomforts of back labor.  Try lying on your side instead of your back when lying down as this can help change your baby's position and ease pains of back labor. Applying heat to the back, hips, and sides can help soothe pains associated with back labor.  You can use a heating pad, as long as your hospital allows this and there is somewhere in the labor room to plug it in.  You can also bring in a homemade hot compress. You can usually just apply warm water to a towel until it's damp and apply it to the area that's experiencing pain. A nurse may be able to provide a compress for you.  Cold also helps ease the pain. If applying heat is not working, try an ice pack or a cold, damp towel.","output":"If you have back pain during labor, you can try a few things to feel better.

Plot title: Evil Dead II Movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw.

Paul Starks speaks to the media in the parking lot outside the Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, Md., Friday, May 6, 2016. A woman was killed and three people... (Associated Press)      SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — The shooting spree began with a domestic slaying in an unusually public place. According to police, Eulalio Tordil, a federal security officer, shot and killed his estranged wife as she waited to pick up her children in the parking lot of a suburban Washington high school on Thursday afternoon. He also shot and wounded a bystander who tried to intervene, police said.      Detectives worked through the night, trying to use cellphone technology to pinpoint Tordil's location. But they weren't able to catch him. The next day, according to police, he struck again, this time apparently choosing his victims at random.      On Friday morning, police said, Tordil shot three people outside an upscale mall in Bethesda, 15 miles away from the high school. One man died and two others were wounded, one of them critically. Then, he drove to a supermarket five miles away in Silver Spring, where he fatally shot a woman who was sitting in her car, police said.      The attacks were reminiscent of the D.C. sniper shootings, which paralyzed the nation's capital and its suburbs in 2002. In an eerie coincidence, the supermarket slaying occurred just a few hundred feet from where the snipers fired their first shots.      Unlike with the snipers, however, police had an idea about who was responsible. Plainclothes officers spotted Tordil's car at a strip mall across the street from the supermarket, and they watched him for more than an hour as he moved from store to store, eating at Boston Market and getting coffee at Dunkin' Donuts, police said. Fearing that he wanted to provoke officers into shooting him, police waited him out until he returned to his car. Then they boxed him in and drew their guns. He emerged from the car with his hands up.      \\"We did not want to endanger anyone and have a shootout when we took him into custody,\\" Montgomery County Police Chief Thomas Manger said. \\"That may have been what he wanted.\\"      Instead, Tordil will have to answer in court for the string of carnage attributed to him: three people dead and another three wounded in roughly 20 hours. He was charged Friday evening with murder in the death of his wife, Gladys, a high school chemistry teacher. Charges are pending in the other shootings, and he'll likely face his first court appearance Monday.      Hank Stawinski, the police chief in neighboring Prince George's County, where the school shooting took place, lamented that his detectives couldn't find Tordil sooner.      \\"It's tragic that we were not able to intervene prior to additional individuals being harmed,\\" Stawinski said.      Tordil worked for the Federal Protective Service, which provides security at federal properties. He was put on administrative duties in March after a protective order was issued against him when his wife said he had threatened to harm her if she left him, The Washington Post reported (http://wapo.st/1WOrwyg). Tordil subjected their children to \\"intense-military-like discipline,\\" like pushups and detention in a dark closet, according to the order.      The protective service said Tordil's weapon, badge and credentials were taken when he was placed on leave. Police found a weapon in his car but did not describe it.      The arrest occurred in full view of dozens of witnesses who were working, shopping, eating lunch or getting their nails done.      \\"They had a bunch of guns pointed at him, and he was coming out of the car with his hands up,\\" said Dominique Lee, who was walking out of the flower shop where she works when Tordil was arrested.      \\"He just got out of his car. He gave up,\\" said Jason Palmer, a private investigator who lives nearby and had started to search for the gunman himself. \\"They pinned him in.\\"      The arrest took place just steps away from a Michaels craft store that was the first target of D.C. sniper John Allen Muhammad. Muhammad's shot into the store did not hit anyone, but he killed a man about a mile away less than an hour later, kicking off a three-week killing spree that left 10 dead.      Tordil ate at the same Boston Market as Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, who was also convicted in the sniper attacks.      \\"They ate in the same restaurant where we were having the surveillance here today, which was an irony that was not lost on me,\\" said Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy, who prosecuted Muhammad. \\"I think it's a coincidence.\\"      ___      Associated Press contributors include Jessica Gresko, Sarah Brumfield and Alex Brandon.      ___      Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols.

(Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)      A string of deadly shootings in suburban Maryland led police to the same man. Here's what we know about the investigation. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)      When Gladys Tordil went to court in March to plead for protection against her husband, she portrayed him as a man who had menaced her and her two daughters for at least a decade.      Eulalio “Leo” Tordil, 62, a career law enforcement officer and former Army reservist with a black belt in aikido, subjected his stepdaughters to “intense-military-like discipline — push ups, detention in dark closet” and used violence against his wife, Gladys Tordil said in a petition for a restraining order filed in Prince George’s County District Court.      During one fight in 2010, she told the court, “He slapped me so hard during our altercation, my glasses broke on my face.” On March 2 of this year, she said, “He threatened to harm me if I leave him.”      The protective order was granted. Eulalio Tordil’s superiors at the Federal Protective Service took his gun and badge as a result of the complaint and put him on administrative duty. But that didn’t save Gladys, a 44-year-old chemistry teacher at Parkdale High School.      Instead, it allegedly set off a two-day rampage of violence across suburban Maryland that left her and two others dead and drove her daughters into hiding until Eulalio Tordil was taken into custody at a Boston Market on Friday afternoon.      1 of 13 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Photos from the scene of shooting at Beltsville, Md. high school View Photos Prince George’s County police said the shooting at High Point High School, which left a woman dead and a man injured, appeared to be domestic-related.

[Suspect in custody in string of shootings in suburban Maryland]      He may have meant to be the final fatality, allegedly telling colleagues that he wanted to commit “suicide by cop,” according to two people in law enforcement.      In the hours after the first shooting, a picture of the twice-divorced Tordil emerged of a longtime — and well-armed — police officer with a history of domestic turmoil. The recent protective order included allegations that Tordil physically abused his two stepdaughters and his wife over the course of a decade. It detailed a personal arsenal that included a .40-caliber handgun, a .45-caliber handgun, an M4, a revolver and a “hunting gun” at home.      His favorite quote, according to his Facebook page, is the misspelled: “You can ran, but you can’t hide.”      Tordil created a Youtube channel where he posted videos of his stepdaughters performing concerts in Arizona and he also made a playlist of his favorite songs including musicians playing covers of Nowhere Man by the Beatles, Green Day’s Time of Your Life and Poison’s “Every Rose Has Its Thorn.”      Tordil is originally from the Philippines, and he still has ties there. Gladys Tordil moved her daughters to Maryland from the Philippines in 2006, according to the protective order.      Surveillance footage recorded Maryland shooting suspect Eulalio Tordil, 62, a federal police officer as he was barricaded by authorities after leaving a Boston Market restaurant. Tordil was quickly arrested. (WUSA9)      Tordil served 15 years in the Army reserve, according to the database Nexis. Montgomery police said he was an Adelphi resident. He began his federal employment in October 1987 as a police officer with the General Services Administration, according to a federal employee database. Later, he joined the Department of Homeland Security and was paid a salary of more than 90,000.      Almost a decade ago, Tordil was accused of misusing a housing program that aimed to help law enforcement officers. Tordil obtained a 26,500 discount on HUD-owned property in Hyattsville, Md., under a Good Neighbor program but didn’t live at the residence, according to a 2008 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General. The report said that Tordil agreed to pay HUD 15,900 as part of a civil settlement.      At least once in 1995, he helped teach a women’s self-defense course to staffers at the National Institutes of Health, Md., one of the agencies that was put on lockdown during the manhunt for Tordil.      Tordil was working in Phoenix in 2005 when Stephen Jeckel met him at a martial-arts studio where both were students. Tordil, who was more advanced in the craft, became a second teacher to Jeckel, who is now an aikido instructor himself. He described Tordil as kind and family-oriented.      “The man I knew wouldn’t hurt a fly,” said Jeckel, who remained in touch with Tordil after he returned to the Washington area.      But Thursday night, police said, Tordil went to the Beltsville, Md., high school where he knew his estranged wife was picking up her daughters. Gladys Tordil was a popular chemistry teacher known to dote on her children and her students alike. Chris Mejia, a friend of Tordil’s two daughters at High Point High, remembers her paying for bowling and pizza for students who couldn’t afford to pay their own way.      “She was always happy, always singing, always dancing,” said ­Mejia, the school’s senior class president, who has started a ­GoFundMe page to raise scholarship money for the two daughters, both seniors preparing to start college in the fall.      One of the daughters was leaving the school’s band room Thursday night just as her mother was shot, according to Mejia, who has talked with a student who was with her at the time. The other student had to pull the girl back from the scene, he said.      “That’s when the whole school panicked,” Mejia said.      The violence continued Friday when Tordil allegedly opened fire outside the Macy’s at Westfield Montgomery Mall, killing one man and wounding two other people. Then he allegedly drove to a nearby Giant in Aspen Hill and shot a woman sitting in her car. Police said they have no evidence Tordil knew any of Friday’s victims.      Tordil ended his alleged killing spree with a strangely calm visit to a shopping plaza. According to Montgomery State’s Attorney John McCarthy, Tordil parked, bought a cup of coffee at Dunkin’ Donuts, went to a Michaels craft store to “browse around,” and then ordered lunch at Boston Market.      Whatever plans he might have had to go out with further violence were interrupted by as many as 100 police officers who were waiting as he left the restaurant. Officers rammed his car and surrounded him.      Asked why the suspect didn’t shoot himself or the police, McCarthy said, “That was the fear everyone had. He didn’t.”      Theresa Vargas, Michael S. Rosenwald, John Woodrow Cox, Alice Crites, Martin Weil and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"A shooting spree took place in suburban Washington D.C., beginning with Eulalio Tordil, a federal security officer, killing his estranged wife in the parking lot of a high school.

First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and reversed what he saw as his father's laxness by cracking down on unorthodox sects and by decapitating an anti-Manchu writer his father had pardoned. In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \\"money to nourish honesty\\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence.

Celia Crowson and her family go on holiday to the south coast of England in the summer of 1939. Soon afterwards the Second World War breaks out and Celia's father joins what was to become the Home Guard and her more confident sister Phyllis joins the Auxiliary Territorial Service.  Fearing her father's disapproval if she moves away from home, Celia hesitates about joining up but eventually her call-up papers arrive. Hoping to join the WAAF or one of the other services, Celia instead gets posted to a factory making aircraft components, where she meets her co-workers, including her Welsh room-mate Gwen Price and the vain upper middle class Jennifer Knowles. Knowles dislikes the work they have to do at the factory, causing friction with their supervisor Charlie Forbes which eventually blossoms into a verbally combative romance. A nearby RAF bomber station sends some of its men to a staff dance at the factory, during which Celia meets and falls in love with an equally shy young Scottish flight sergeant Fred Blake. Their relationship encounters a crisis when Fred refuses to tell Celia when he is sent out on his first mission, but soon afterwards they meet and make up, with Fred asking Celia to marry him. After the wedding they spend their honeymoon at the same south coast resort as the Crowsons went to in 1939, finding it much changed with minefields and barbed wire defending against the expected German invasion.

Given the question: Bob just came from a hot air balloon ride. On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would balloon B have higher or lower inside pressure than balloon A?  Hint: Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off. The answer is:","output":"Balloon B would have higher inside pressure than balloon A. Step 1: Identify relevant information from the paragraph. The paragraph states that at the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. Step 2: Apply the information to the question. Bob saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, and balloon B was inflated. Since balloon B is inflated, it is likely that the air inside it has been heated and has higher pressure compared to the flat balloon A, which has its inside pressure equal to the outside pressure. Step 3: Conclude the answer based on the analysis. Given the increased pressure inside the inflated balloon B due to the heated air, balloon B would have higher inside pressure than balloon A."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The man tells Fletcher that Barret has swindled him and his son out of money for some non-existent land. The bitter altercation ends with the man shot dead right in front of his son. As the killer laughs sadistically, the little boy picks up his father's gun and shoots Fletcher dead. Impassively, the boy mounts Fletcher's horse, claiming it along with its ornate silver-trimmed saddle, and rides off.Several years later, the young boy has grown up into a rugged bounty hunter named Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma) who rides into the Texan town of Cerriotts on his silver-saddled horse, accompanied by Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), an amusing but treacherous man he recently met. Snake tells Roy that many have heard the story of the Silver Saddle, and its owner, the boy who avenged his father. He also knows that Roy Blood seems to leave a trail of dead men in his wake.

Question: What did Derek use to hold his brain in place?

They find the town has been overrun by space aliens disguised as humans. Barry kills one of the aliens and is attacked by others weilding sledge hammers. After Derek notifies Frank and Ozzy (whom are traveling on the road towards Kaihoro), he begins torturing Robert, an alien they captured earlier. Robert's screaming attracts a number of aliens in the area. Derek kills the would-be rescuers, but he is attacked by Robert and falls over a cliff, to his presumed death.Meanwhile, a charity bill collector named Giles is passing through Kaihoro. He is attacked by Robert, who has been eating the brains of the alien killed earlier by Barry. Giles escapes in his car and stops at a nearby house for help. Another alien (dressed as a chef) answers the door and captures Giles. He later wakes up in a tub of water and is told he is about to be eaten. Derek also wakes up to find that he landed in a seagull's nest. He also finds that his brain is leaking out the back of his head, so he stuffs it back in and uses a hat to hold it in place.That night, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry sneak into the aliens' house and find a room filled with bloody cardboard boxes. They kidnap an alien and Frank wears its shirt to infiltrate an alien meeting. He finds out that the residents of Kaihoro have been harvested for alien fast food for this intergalatic fast food chain called 'Crum's Country Delights'. Robert vomits into a bowl, which the aliens dine on, including the disguised (and disgusted) Frank. He escapes and tells the team members of the plan. They sneak out to save Giles as the aliens sleep.At sunrise, they try to leave but are attacked by the aliens.

After the defeat of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng. Neglecting the importance of the capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city. The Jin assault commenced in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued to sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later. Qinzong, the former emperor Huizong, and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages. They were taken north to Huining , where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners. The former emperors were humiliated by their captors. They were mocked with disparaging titles like \\"Muddled Virtue\\" and \\"Double Muddled\\". In 1128 the Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals. The harsh treatment of the Song royalty softened after the death of Huizong in 1135. Titles were granted to the deceased monarch, and his son Qinzong was promoted to Duke, a position with a salary.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother.

Before writing what I did and what he did please let me tell you I was just a teenagerand it all seemed new, so kindly don't judge me. Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook. It will be hard and awkward to attend his marriage. I love him. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the author feel like a rebel?

Pleased with Andrea's ability to \\"follow my mind and keep his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal,\\" Borgia selects Andrea to accomplish an intrigue: arrange the marriage of his widowed sister, Lucrezia (whose husband he has just had assassinated for the purpose), to Alfonso d'Este, the son of the Duke Ercole d'Este of Ferrara. By doing so, Borgia will remove Ferrara as an impediment to conquest of central Italy. In being selected, however, Andrea earns the enmity of Don Esteban Ramirez (Leslie Bradley), an ambitious mercenary captain and rival. Andrea travels to Venice to sell some of his paintings to raise money for expenses. He meets the lovely Camilla di la Baglione (Wanda Hendrix), young wife of the elderly Count Marc Antonio Verano of Citta del Monte, and smitten with her, gallantly gives her a painting he was haggling to sell for a hundred ducats. Soon after, an assassin attempts to kill Andrea, but he thwarts the attack and spares the assassin to learn who hired him: the Duke Ercole d'Este. He hires the assassin, Mario Belli (Everett Sloane), as part of his own entourage. Resuming the mission, Andrea stops to visit the farm of a blacksmith's widow, reputed to be hiding gold stolen by her bandit son. She is actually his mother (Katina Paxinou), and he is in fact Andrea Zoppo, not the noble Orsini he pretends to be. The reunion is a rocky one, because the mother does not approve of her son's evil ways. Belli spies on them through a window. Andrea continues to Ferrara, where he succeeds in arranging the marriage by intimidating the duke and flattering Alfonso.

With ongoing advancements in technology, the Chinese government has adopted innovative measures to ensure that rural inhabitants receive proper social security benefits and services. As part of this initiative, China has implemented a trial of the Rural Social Security Computer System, aiming to revolutionize the way rural communities access and benefit from social security. Rural social security in China: In China, the rural population constitutes a significant percentage of the country's total population. With the urban-rural income gap expanding over the years, delivering adequate social security benefits to rural residents has become a critical area of focus for the government. The primary goals include eradicating poverty, ensuring healthcare access, providing old-age security, increasing employment, and offering other essential social services, thereby enhancing the quality of life for millions of rural inhabitants. The inception of the Rural Social Security Computer System: Understanding the dire need to reform its social security framework, the Chinese government has launched the Rural Social Security Computer System. This new approach centers around using advanced technology to improve the delivery and efficiency of social security services in rural regions. The Rural Social Security Computer System will integrate various databases and management systems related to rural social security, such as healthcare, employment, and pension funds. Moreover, this integrated system will provide a single platform catering to multiple functions, enabling a seamless and streamlined process for rural inhabitants to avail social security services. Benefits and features of the Rural Social Security Computer System: The Rural Social Security Computer System comes with numerous benefits and features designed to revolutionize the social security landscape in rural China. Some of these benefits include: 1. Enhancing efficiency: By consolidating multiple databases and systems under one unified platform, the Rural Social Security Computer System will significantly improve the efficiency at which social security services are delivered to rural residents, reducing delays and bureaucratic hurdles. 2. Improving access and convenience: With the Rural Social Security Computer System, rural inhabitants will no longer need to visit multiple government offices to access social security services. The computer system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, enabling residents to avail benefits from the comfort of their homes or local community centers. 3. Promoting transparency and accountability: The Rural Social Security Computer System streamlines the process of tracking the allocation and distribution of government funds. This transparent system will allow both officials and recipients to monitor the utilization of social security resources, promoting accountability and eliminating potential corruption. 4. Facilitating data-driven decisions: With the ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data, the Rural Social Security Computer System will empower policymakers with valuable insights to inform and shape future social security policies, benefiting rural Chinese citizens in the long run. Challenges and future prospects: The implementation of the Rural Social Security Computer System is not without challenges. As it is a pilot program, there may be teething issues during implementation, such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of digital literacy among rural residents, and potential cyber threats. However, the Chinese government is committed to addressing these concerns, providing training to local officials, and investing in rural digital infrastructure to ensure the successful deployment of the system. In conclusion, the Rural Social Security Computer System is a pioneering initiative that holds great promise in transforming social security services in rural China. By embracing technology and striving for innovation, China is taking a significant step towards bridging the urban-rural divide and improving the lives of millions of rural inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.

Movie title: The Whales of August Context: The Whales of August tells the story of two elderly widowed sisters near the end of their lives, spending a summer in a seaside house in Maine. The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the elder and the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is the younger sister, a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Ironically, Gish was actually 15 years older than Davis. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with. Tisha (Sothern) is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters' conversations and revelations. In flashbacks, actresses Margaret Ladd, Mary Steenburgen and Tisha Sterling (Sothern's real-life daughter) play respectively Libby, Sarah, and Tisha as young women.

Write a title for this article: Another woman has come forward to accuse Donald Trump of touching her inappropriately. Kristin Anderson alleged to The Washington Post on Friday that Trump reached his hand up her skirt, uninvited, during a night at a Manhattan club in the early 1990s. She said that she was in her 20s at the time, and was sitting with friends on a red velvet couch when she allegedly felt Trump’s fingers graze her inner thigh and touch her vagina through her underwear. She claimed that she immediately pushed the hand away and left the couch before turning back to allegedly see Trump. “He was so distinctive looking — with the hair and the eyebrows,” she told the Post. “I mean, nobody else has those eyebrows.” The incident, she said, left her “very grossed out and weirded out.” Multiple friends confirmed Anderson’s story to the Post, but one said they laughed off the alleged encounter at the time. “It wasn’t a sexual come-on,” Anderson alleged. “I don’t know why he did it. It was like just to prove that he could do it, and nothing would happen. There was zero conversation. We didn’t even really look at each other. It was very random, very nonchalant on his part.” Anderson, now 46, joins the growing list of women who have accused the GOP nominee of sexual misconduct. Trump has strongly denied all of the allegations, asserting during a Florida speech on Thursday that the claims are “fabricated” and “absolutely false.” In response to Anderson’s claims, Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement, “Mr. Trump strongly denies this phony allegation by someone looking to get some free publicity. It is totally ridiculous.” Anderson only told the story to the Post after being approached by a reporter who heard of her allegations from another person, the newspaper said. She said she decided to speak out after reading the accounts shared in The New York Times by two women who claimed Trump also groped them, and a story by a PEOPLE writer who alleged the businessman sexually assaulted her. RELATED VIDEO: Here’s Every Current Accusation of Sexual Misconduct Against Donald Trump “I’ve always kept quiet,” Anderson said. “And why should I keep quiet?

Given the question: Process:  - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose eat more healthy food happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of eating more healthy food can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver's functioning process. Let me explain step-by-step: 1. Consuming healthy foods can lead to better nutrient absorption: Eating a balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients can assist in improving the overall function of the liver. This is because the liver can more effectively process these nutrients into forms that the body can use. 2. Reduced exposure to toxins: By consuming healthier food options and avoiding unhealthy, processed, and fried foods, the number of toxins entering the body is minimized. This results in the liver not having to work as hard to remove these harmful substances from the blood. Consequently, it may allow the liver to function more efficiently and softer. 3. Better fat processing: Eating healthy fats, such as those found in fish, nuts, and olive oil, can protect the liver from damage and help process fat more effectively. The liver can then produce bile more efficiently, which aids in the absorption of fat into the bloodstream. 4. Improved glycogen storage: Eating a diet rich in complex carbohydrates and avoiding excessive simple sugars can help maintain stable blood sugar levels. This allows the liver to store extra carbohydrates as glycogen more efficiently, providing the body with the fuel it requires when needed. Therefore, the perturbation of eating more healthy food will likely have a positive effect on the liver, allowing it to work more efficiently and softly while performing its essential functions. This improvement in liver function can directly contribute to overall better health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A lean-to is a simple outdoor construction, and only requires something for branches or a tarp to “lean” against. Long boulders or fallen trees can be ideal for acting as a horizontal brace to lean other sticks or brush against. Any large, immobile object can work. If you have a tarp and some rope, you can make a lean-to between two trees. These sticks should be somewhat sturdy, as they will form a side of the shelter.  Be sure that there is enough room between them, the brace, and the ground for you to crawl inside comfortably.  You should have just enough space under your brace for you and anyone else with you to crawl into. The more extra space you have there, the harder it will be to keep yourself warm.  If you can, keep the lean-to’s profile low to ground. This will help keep you further out of the line of wind, and won’t attract attention. This is helpful if you are trying to avoid detection, or otherwise stay out of sight. You can use leaves, grass, and moss to build a wall on the outside of your lean-to. These will provide further insulation and protection from the elements.  Nearly any small forest debris will work. Just make sure to pack it tightly on the wall frame so it won't blow away readily. You can pile more of this debris on the floor and interior of your lean-to to provide extra insulation. Another way to help keep warm under your lean-to is to build a fire. Dig a small hole for your fire on the open side of your lean-to. Be sure to keep it a safe distance from any underbrush and your shelter.  If you do build a fire, keep an eye on it at all times. If you want to go to sleep, make sure someone will be able to stay up to watch it, or just put it out completely. Put a ring of stones around the fire pit to help rein it in.

The governor of Novgorod Paletsky sent Nikita Kuzmin to Stockholm to ask for an explanation, but the Russian representative was imprisoned. In response Russia mounted an organized attack with up to 20,000 soldiers in March 1555. With its initially 1,000 men, Finland could not stand against the invading troops, but soon, reinforcements consisting of 3,700 infantrymen and 250 cavalrymen arrived from Sweden. The Finnish nobility had also been engaged in the war, contributing with its cavalry. The goal of the Swedish-Finnish troops was to conquer Oreshek, Korela and Koporye. The siege of Oreshek was badly planned by the Swedish side and failed since the Russians had destroyed the areas surrounding the town and the Swedish troops had insufficient supplies to be able to maintain the siege until the town surrendered. While admiral Johan Brigge besieged and bombarded Oreshek,  the Swedish diplomats tried to find support for their cause in Livonia, Poland-Lithuania and England. Early the following year, 1556, Russia made a new attack, this time with an army almost 20,000 men strong. The attack was aimed at the town of Viborg , and the Swedish troops were unlikely to withstand an army of that considerable size. However, after a few days of pillaging in the area around Viborg, the Russian forces left. The reason for this has not been made clear. Conceivable reasons might be bad discipline or a raging disease among the Russian soldiers.

There is no direct passenger access between the mainland and Taiwan by air or sea at the moment. Experts say that it is better to start research sooner rather than later,although there is a lack of government funding .There  are no technical problems t0 build a Taiwan tunnel.But it will require an improved political relationship across the Straits. A professor of TsinghHa University said,\\"A special feature of  huge projects is that the period of preparation is longer than the  period of construction.\\" For example,he said,the English channel Tunnel took 14 years of planning and had been discussed for two centuries.And preparations for the huge Three Corges dam on the Yangze River began in the 1950s.

EBC) unites autonomous Roman Catholic Benedictine communities of monks and nuns and is technically among the oldest of the 18 congregations that are affiliated in the Benedictine Confederation (the oldest being the Camaldolese).  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - A tithe (from Old English: \\"teogoþa\\" \\"tenth\\") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government. Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques, or stocks, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.  - Downside School is a co-educational Catholic independent school for children aged 11 to 18, located in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, between Westfield and Shepton Mallet in Somerset, south west England, attached to Downside Abbey.

The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - The Church of the Holy Ghost , Midsomer Norton , Somerset , England is a Roman Catholic parish church housed in a converted tithe barn .

In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented.  - The Mendip Hills (commonly called the Mendips) is a range of limestone hills to the south of Bristol and Bath in Somerset, England. Running east to west between Weston-super-Mare and Frome, the hills overlook the Somerset Levels to the south and the Chew Valley and other tributaries of the Avon to the north. The hills give their name to the local government district of Mendip, which administers most of the area. The higher, western part of the hills, covering has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), which gives it a level of protection comparable to a national park.  - Norton Radstock is the former name of the small conurbation covering Midsomer Norton, Radstock and Westfield, in the English ceremonial county of Somerset. It was formerly a large civil parish in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, south west of Bath, and the same distance north west of Frome.

Vaughan, one of the most influential guitarists in the revival of blues in the 1980s, was just 35 years old at the time of his death. Born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas, Stevie Ray Vaughan had become an iconic figure in the music industry. He was widely known for his expressive singing and impressive guitar playing, which were profoundly infused with jazz, rock, and country musical idioms, yet firmly rooted in the blues. Stevie Ray Vaughan and his backing band Double Trouble had just finished their concert performance at the Alpine Valley Music Theater alongside Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, and his older brother, Jimmie Vaughan. Stevie was part of a group that was boarding the helicopter for a short-hop flight to their next tour location in Chicago. In the wee hours of August 27, 1990, the helicopter carrying Vaughan and four others struck concern when it did not reach its destination. They departed in dense fog and limited visibility, and sadly, the aircraft collided with a ski slope. All aboard were killed instantly, including the pilot, Jeffrey Browne; Vaughan's agent, Bobby Brooks; bodyguard, Nigel Browne; and tour manager, Colin Smythe, in addition to Vaughan himself. It was later determined that the pilot was not certified to navigate solely by the helicopter’s instruments, an essential competency in low-visibility conditions like those they were operating under that dreadful night. Vaughan's death was a massive shock for the music world. He was just beginning to find mainstream success after years of hard work. His death was met with tremendous sorrow from fans and fellow musicians alike. Stevie Ray Vaughan will always be remembered as one of the great pioneers of blues music.    Vaughan and his contributions to music were honored with varied awards and recognitions, including induction into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000, and then in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. He was also named the 12th greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. His music continues to inspire and influence countless musicians and has left an indelible mark on the world of blues and rock music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: National Review columnist John Derbyshire doesn't write the most racist stuff on the Internet -- not even close! But Derbyshire does effectively demonstrate, year after year, exactly how racist you can be and still get published by people who consider themselves intellectuals. Derbyshire has shocked the internet -- even the conservative internet -- with an essay for Taki's Magazine about how he had a talk with his children warning them about the danger of running into black people in public places and the necessity of befriending the few nice ones out there for the public relations benefits. Gawker's Maureen O'Connor asks, \\"How can John Derbyshire even have a career?\\" The reason is because John Derbyshire is very valuable.      [Update: On Saturday evening, National Review editor Rich Lowry announced that the publication was severing its relationship with Derbyshire. \\"His latest provocation, in a webzine, lurches from the politically incorrect to the nasty and indefensible. We never would have published it, but the main reason that people noticed it is that it is by a National Review writer,\\" he writes. \\"Derb has long danced around the line on these issues, but this column is so outlandish it constitutes a kind of letter of resignation. It’s a free country, and Derb can write whatever he wants, wherever he wants. Just not in the pages of NR or NRO, or as someone associated with NR any longer.\\"]      Or at least up to now he has been. On Friday, fellow National Review contributor Josh Barro, writing for Forbes, is shocked that Derbyshire hasn't been fired yet. In the last hour or so, more of his National Review colleagues have been criticizing the piece. Responding to The Atlantic's Matt O'Brien's question on Twitter, \\"Does @NRO want to be associated with someone who publishes racist trash like this?\\" senior editor Ramesh Ponnuru responded, \\"I know I don't.\\" And Jonah Goldberg, the editor of National Review Online, tweeted, \\"For the record, I find my colleague John Derbyshire's piece fundamentally indefensible and offensive. I wish he hadn't written it.\\"      But that has not been the case with Derbyshire's body of work up to now. And we have a theory why: The truth about intellectual magazines is that not all of their readers are as enlightened and forward-thinking and clear-eyed as the people who produce them imagine themselves to be. So the trick to pull off is how to give what those less enlightened readers want -- and thereby secure their money either through subscriptions or contributions -- while still maintaining an air of respectability. Think of how your PBS station always trots out the stars-of-the-1970s concerts and River Dance whenever pledge drive comes around. That's where Derbyshire comes in.      You're probably familiar with the phrase, \\"No offense, but…\\" which always precedes something offensive wrapped in an \\"I'm just telling it like it is\\" attitude. In certain parts of the country, there's a similar use of the phrase, \\"I'm not racist, but…\\" which always signifies that the speaker is about to say something racist. Derbyshire's specialty is the fancy-pants version of \\"I'm not racist, but…\\" In his latest essay, \\"The Talk: Nonblack Version,\\" Derbyshire lists several key \\"fact\\"s that he thinks his kid should know. Among them:      (9) A small cohort of blacks—in my experience, around five percent—is ferociously hostile to whites and will go to great lengths to inconvenience or harm us. A much larger cohort of blacks—around half—will go along passively if the five percent take leadership in some event. They will do this out of racial solidarity, the natural willingness of most human beings to be led, and a vague feeling that whites have it coming. (10) Thus, while always attentive to the particular qualities of individuals, on the many occasions where you have nothing to guide you but knowledge of those mean differences, use statistical common sense: (10a) Avoid concentrations of blacks not all known to you personally. (10b) Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods. (10c) If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date (neglect of that one got me the closest I have ever gotten to death by gunshot). (10d) Do not attend events likely to draw a lot of blacks. (10e) If you are at some public event at which the number of blacks suddenly swells, leave as quickly as possible.      To present himself as a cool social scientist, every single bullet point contains a link to some sort of source based in facts. The one about not going to a theme park where there's a ton of black people is a New York Times story from 1987. The implication is that Derbyshire was close by when a shooting occurred. (Obviously he was not actually injured, or we'd never hear the end of it.) This is how he's able to give the most dated racial stereotypes the veneer of respectability.      Derbyshire doesn't do the really obvious racist stuff -- the stuff that goes up at FreeRepublic.com, for example -- like post photos Obama in stereotypical tribal garb with a bone through his nose. Instead, he talks about how his East African parentage means he might be suspect to some black voters, who are more likely to be of West African heritage. From June 19, 2008:      Obama’s East African origins don’t help. Most black Americans take their African descent from West Africa. The distribution of physical types in East Africa is considerably different... There is of course a lot of overlap, but enough difference in physical types to give Obama a tinge of strangeness. The minds of many nonblack voters — and perhaps some black ones, too — will contain, at some level well below the surface, a thought like: He’s a black guy, but is he one of OUR black guys?      Derbyshire doesn't say that black people, especially women, are pathetically stupid people doomed to live on the dole (For a good example of that, check out the 1941 Looney Tunes cartoon Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarfs.) Instead, he says that the black women who work at the DMV are mean and stupid because they're genetically destined to be so. From his recent essay:      The mean intelligence of blacks is much lower than for whites. The least intelligent ten percent of whites have IQs below 81; forty percent of blacks have IQs that low... There is a magnifying effect here, too, caused by affirmative action. In a pure meritocracy there would be very low proportions of blacks in cognitively demanding jobs. Because of affirmative action, the proportions are higher. In government work, they are very high... “The DMV lady“ is a statistical truth, not a myth.      Derbyshire does not call Obama a hustler who has hoodwinked gullible whites. Instead, when he implies Obama is a product of Affirmative Action, he presents it as a sendup of uppity liberals consumed by white guilt. On Obama's background, November 5, 2008:      He was a red-diaper baby, offspring of a love-the-world, hate-America sixties gal and an African socialist in the Mugabe mould, raised by leftish grandparents addled with “Uncle Tim” racial guilt, and mentored by a hard-Left labor radical.      On how far you can go if you're black and smart, from this week's essay:      Unfortunately the demand is greater than the supply, so IWSBs are something of a luxury good, like antique furniture or corporate jets: boasted of by upper-class whites and wealthy organizations, coveted by the less prosperous. To be an IWSB in present-day US society is a height of felicity rarely before attained by any group of human beings in history.      \\"Height of felicity\\" links to Obama's page at WhiteHouse.gov, naturally. On how white folks' silly political correctness means you can't study racial theory anymore, from May 24, 2004:      Whole areas of academic inquiry are now out of bounds in America, for fear of what they might uncover about human nature. The human sciences are nowadays radioactive, like history or philosophy in a Communist country. Entire disciplines have ceased to exist. Physical anthropology, for example: An informative and interesting book like Carleton Coon's Races of Man could not be published nowadays. The topic is too \\"dangerous\\" and \\"insensitive.\\" Safer to go into a solid, non-controversial field: Women's Studies, perhaps, or Queer Legal Theory.      And on how some easily-influenced whites will vote for a black president because the movies have conditioned them to want one. From June 19, 2008:      Working in combination with other factors that I’ll get to, Obama’s négritude will help him with a lot of politically vague types who are neither black nor distinctively liberal, but who have been oriented the Obama way by decades of watching Numinous Negro types saving the world, or defying it with a supernatural level of dignity and gravitas, in the movies and on TV: characters played by Will Smith, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Michael Clarke Duncan, Denzel Washington, and of course the numinousest of them all, Morgan Freeman. There is probably now an entire demographic cohort of young Americans whose mental image of God is Morgan Freeman.      But most important, Derbyshire lends credibility to the sense of white grievance -- that white people are the real victims of racism. He doesn't use the language Ron Paul did in his racist old newsletters, which painted a vivid picture of packs of black thugs marauding cities and infecting white women with HIV for the sheer fun of it. That was specifically to appeal to rednecks. Derbyshire is classier than that. On how we're really paying slavery reparations already -- with welfare, on August 11, 2011:      Following the black riots of the 1960s, non-blacks have seen these concessions as an implicit contract or treaty—as non-black America saying to black America: “We’ll give you this stuff if you promise not to break our windows.”      Or from this week's essay:      These differences are magnified by the hostility many blacks feel toward whites. Thus, while black-on-black behavior is more antisocial in the average than is white-on-white behavior, average black-on-white behavior is a degree more antisocial yet.      Race-baiting is getting harder and harder to do while holding onto your job. So, who knows, maybe this will be the piece that finally costs Derbyshire his. If it is, he will no doubt be surprised after such a long career of writing outrageously racist things. He's served, for all the aspiring race-baiters out there, as the model for how it's done.

Elspeth Reeve |||||             There is much talk about “the talk.”      “Sean O’Reilly was 16 when his mother gave him the talk that most black parents give their teenage sons,” Denisa R. Superville of the Hackensack (NJ) Record tells us. Meanwhile, down in Atlanta: “Her sons were 12 and 8 when Marlyn Tillman realized it was time for her to have the talk,” Gracie Bonds Staples writes in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.      Leonard Greene talks about the talk in the New York Post. Someone bylined as KJ Dell’Antonia talks about the talk in The New York Times. Darryl Owens talks about the talk in the Orlando Sentinel.      Yes, talk about the talk is all over.      There is a talk that nonblack Americans have with their kids, too. My own kids, now 19 and 16, have had it in bits and pieces as subtopics have arisen. If I were to assemble it into a single talk, it would look something like the following.      * * * * * * * * * * * * *      (1) Among your fellow citizens are forty million who identify as black, and whom I shall refer to as black. The cumbersome (and MLK-noncompliant) term “African-American” seems to be in decline, thank goodness. “Colored“ and “Negro“ are archaisms. What you must call “the “N” word” is used freely among blacks but is taboo to nonblacks.      “There is a talk that nonblack Americans have with their kids, too.”      (2) American blacks are descended from West African populations, with some white and aboriginal-American admixture. The overall average of non-African admixture is 20-25 percent. The admixture distribution is nonlinear, though: “It seems that around 10 percent of the African American population is more than half European in ancestry.” (Same link.)      (3) Your own ancestry is mixed north-European and northeast-Asian, but blacks will take you to be white.      (4) The default principle in everyday personal encounters is, that as a fellow citizen, with the same rights and obligations as yourself, any individual black is entitled to the same courtesies you would extend to a nonblack citizen. That is basic good manners and good citizenship. In some unusual circumstances, however”e.g., paragraph (10h) below”this default principle should be overridden by considerations of personal safety.      (5) As with any population of such a size, there is great variation among blacks in every human trait (except, obviously, the trait of identifying oneself as black). They come fat, thin, tall, short, dumb, smart, introverted, extroverted, honest, crooked, athletic, sedentary, fastidious, sloppy, amiable, and obnoxious. There are black geniuses and black morons. There are black saints and black psychopaths. In a population of forty million, you will find almost any human type. Only at the far, far extremes of certain traits are there absences. There are, for example, no black Fields Medal winners. While this is civilizationally consequential, it will not likely ever be important to you personally. Most people live and die without ever meeting (or wishing to meet) a Fields Medal winner.      (6) As you go through life, however, you will experience an ever larger number of encounters with black Americans. Assuming your encounters are random”for example, not restricted only to black convicted murderers or to black investment bankers”the Law of Large Numbers will inevitably kick in. You will observe that the means”the averages”of many traits are very different for black and white Americans, as has been confirmed by methodical inquiries in the human sciences.      (7) Of most importance to your personal safety are the very different means for antisocial behavior, which you will see reflected in, for instance, school disciplinary measures, political corruption, and criminal convictions.

And on Monday, he complained that some people had called him a bigot for writing the column. (Note: I have contributed periodically to National Review and National Review Online.)      I disagree with Lowry’s piece, but I certainly don’t think it’s bigoted. Here, I originally had a few hundred words about why, but that’s not really the core point of this post; I’ve appended my discussion of the Lowry column at the bottom if you’re interested. It suffices to say that Lowry ought to be able to make these points without being called a bigot, even though I think he’s wrong.      But Lowry is running into the problem I discussed last week: he’s probably getting called a bigot because of the company he keeps. Providing a great example, this week National Review writer John Derbyshire published a kind of unbelievably racist piece for Taki’s Magazine, describing “the talk” he gives to his children.      In the wake of the Trayvon Martin’s shooting, many black parents have discussed the advice they give to their male children about not getting themselves shot in a misunderstanding with a white authority figure. Derbyshire’s talk, on the other hand, is about how to avoid being harmed by a black person. He gives such advice as “If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date,” and “If you are at some public event at which the number of blacks suddenly swells, leave as quickly as possible.”      Derbyshire also recommends befriending some “intelligent and well-socialized blacks” (IWSBs, for short) so that you can deflect charges of racism by noting that some of your best friends are black. Alas, he adds “the demand is greater than the supply, so IWSBs are something of a luxury good, like antique furniture or corporate jets: boasted of by upper-class whites and wealthy organizations, coveted by the less prosperous.”      So, while Lowry is advising blacks not to worry so much about the systematic profiling of blacks as criminals due to their race, his colleague Derbyshire is writing a piece specifically urging white people to engage in such profiling, among various other racist nonsense.      And this is the problem for Lowry and other conservatives who want to be taken seriously by broad audiences when they write about racial issues. Lowry wrote a column containing advice for black Americans. Why should black Americans take him seriously while he’s employing Derbyshire? If Lowry wants NR to be credible on race, he should start by firing John Derbyshire.      As for my substantive take on Lowry’s column? It isn’t bigoted, though it does set up a false dichotomy. Why shouldn’t black Americans concern themselves with black-on-black crime and also with the mistreatment of innocent black men by authorities? Indeed, I think if you look closely at the politics of heavily black jurisdictions in America today, voters do care about both of those things.      Lowry’s first example in his column is a young black man shot for no reason in his Detroit home in February. He complains that there is no national outrage over this, but he doesn’t note that the Detroit Police Department under Mayor Dave Bing’s administration has brought in outside experts to import policing best practices from places like New York in an effort to reduce violent crime.      Reducing violent crime is absolutely high on the political agenda in Detroit. It’s just that different problems have different solutions. The problem in Sanford was that the police department wasn’t properly handling the investigation of Martin’s death, and public pressure was a useful tool to bring about intervention from the state and federal governments to improve the case’s handling. Fixing Detroit’s crime problems will require a more bottom-up solution, and the fact that there isn’t a national outcry doesn’t mean that the problem isn’t being taken seriously.      Indeed, while the sharp drop in violent crime over the last two decades has had many causes, it partly reflects the fact that voters and politicians have placed greater emphasis on fighting crime than they used to. In large American cities, that very often means black elected officials and black voters.      Lowry also ends the piece with this:      [George] Zimmerman could be arrested, convicted, and hanged tomorrow, and it will have no effect on the lives of young black people in communities beset by social disorder. Whatever happens to Zimmerman, the drip-drip of spilled blood will continue, all but ignored except in the police blotter. In America, the lives of young black people are cheap, unless they happen to fit the right agenda.      This is missing the point. The broader complaint in the Martin case is that young black men are suspected of crimes for no reason other than their race, leading to unwarranted seizures and arrests and, in some rare cases like this one, tragic deaths. And a further problem is that the non-investigation of Zimmerman (whose clothes were not even retained as evidence by the Sanford Police) sends the message that there is no consequence for killing a young black man due to a misunderstanding. It’s a perfectly valid complaint about the rule of law, and doesn’t negate Lowry’s point that black-on-black violence is an important problem. ||||| Summary:","output":"There is a journalist named John Derbyshire who wrote some articles that people think are racist.

For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home.

Title: Is It Stupid Or Ingenious Review: I must let people know first that I knew absolutely nothing about this stories past or history so this was the first time I heard of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy but no disrespect I'm just a little young. The film is a bit long but as a newcomer to this story it's very hard for you to get bored of it because it has so much imagination. It's a movie that will definitely make you use your brain but it's something that isn't for everybody. I like that it was not the same old movie you always see and can't stand. Though it is good the first time I think a third or fourth time would be a little heavy on your brain. I thought it was pretty good and the visuals are very nice. It can get stupid at times but it's stays in a good blend of inteligence and comedy. I can't compare it to it's original novel so for the people that are just hearing about it it's worth at least one watch.

Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner.

Answer the following question: In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievements and confident that their degree would help them to find a good job.   However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs.   Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(\\"dot com\\") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, \\"Times have changed. It's a new market,\\" according to an officer of the university.   The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing.   Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher. He thinks college teaching could be a good career even in a bad economy.   In conclusion, these days a college degree does not automatically lead to a good job with a high salary. Some students can only hope that the value of their degree will increase in the future. What did a college degree mean to people in the past? A) It was a proof of their professional skills. B) It would guarantee their quick promotion . C) It built up their confidence in the job market. D) It would help them to start an academic career.

Because each kernel has a hard outer layer to protect the soft endosperm, it is likened to being hard as flint; hence the name.  - The Andropogoneae, sometimes called the sorghum tribe, are a large tribe of grasses (family Poaceae) with roughly 1,200 species in 90 genera, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. They include such important crops as maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum. All species in this tribe use C carbon fixation, which makes them competitive under warm, high-light conditions.  - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.  - Dent corn also known as yellow dent corn, Reid's yellow dent corn, white dent corn, or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It received its name because of the small indentation (\\"dent\\") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as \\"Johnny Hopkins\\", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair.  - Panicoideae is the second - largest subfamily of the grasses with over 3,500 species , mainly distributed in warm temperate and tropical regions . It comprises some important agricultural crops , including sugarcane , maize ( or corn ) , sorghum , and switchgrass . C4 photosynthesis evolved independently a number of times in the subfamily , which presumably had a C3 ancestor .  - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.  - Sorghum is a genus of plants in the grass family. Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  - Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples, native peoples, or autochthonous peoples, are ethnic groups who are descended from and identify with the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share such characteristics. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given locale/region or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world.  - Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus \\"Saccharum\\", tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - Flour corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"amylacea\\") is a variety of corn with a soft starchy endosperm and a thin pericarp. It is primarily used to make corn flour.  - Popcorn is a type of corn that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. Popcorn is able to pop like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet. When heated, pressure builds within the kernel, and a small explosion (or \\"pop\\") is the end result. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns.  - Sucrose is a common, naturally occurring saccharide found in many plants and plant parts. Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula CHO.  - Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family.  - Sweet corn (\\"Zea mays\\" convar. \\"saccharata\\" var. \\"rugosa\\"; also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy. History. Sweet corn occurs as a spontaneous mutation in field corn and was grown by several Native American tribes. The Iroquois gave the first recorded sweet corn (called 'Papoon') to European settlers in 1779. It soon became a popular food in southern and central regions of the United States. Open pollinated cultivars of white sweet corn started to become widely available in the United States in the 19th century. Two of the most enduring cultivars, still available today, are 'Country Gentleman' (a Shoepeg corn with small kernels in irregular rows) and 'Stowell's Evergreen'.

The townspeople, although initially resenting her presence, begin to accept Naseem, and it seems that the bad parts of their lives have faded away until night when both Naseem and Gian suffer from tortured visions of their past. These visions ultimately unite the two and they get married and have a son they call Vijay. In love, the world seems perfect until Margaret shows up on Gian's doorstep with news that Naseem's family has been found in Pakistan. Naseem leaves to see them in Pakistan. She is to return in a month but does not arrive. Her two brothers, discovering her marriage to a Sikh, lock her up in her room and forbid her to ever return to India. Akbar, the eldest, is particularly stubborn, and vows to keep her away from her husband at all costs. Gian, tired of waiting, sets off on a trip to Pakistan to retrieve Naseem. He disguises himself as a Muslim, cutting off his hair and donning a Kofi. Even with the disguise he has to sneak across the border as his papers are not sufficient. Gian meets with Walter and Margaret, who barely recognise him without his turban, and leaves Vijay with them while he goes to get Naseem. When he arrives, still dressed as a Muslim, Naseem immediately recognizes him. As they run toward one another they are stopped by her brothers and Akbar beats Gian.

Article: South Africa hosted the fifth BRICS Summit in March 2013,which completed the first cycle of BRICS summits,BRICS is an acronym for the powerful grouping of the world's leading up-and-coming economies,namely Brazil,Russia,India,China and South Africa.The BRICS aims to achieve peace,security,development and cooperation.It also seeks to contribute to the development of humanity and build a more stable and fairer world. The industry leaders from the business communities of the five countries agreed that the BRICS countries will actively support industrialization on the African continent in order to contribute significantly to its development and to expand trade links between Africa and  BRICS.The global economic situation,though improving,continues to remain uncertain with the Euro-crisis a major concern.The task ahead is to build on these developments and BRICS countries remain committed to the cause of promoting sustainable growth.Greater economic cooperation among BRICS countries can be significantly important,which will prove beneficial for global economic growth. According to Dr.Rob Davies,South African Minister of Trade and Industry,the African continent is recognized as the second fastest growing continent after Asia.There are four drivers of the economic growth in African continent.These are the boom in mineral products in the African continent,the development of the service industries,the benefit of not having the financial crisis,and infrastructure development.Davies also adds that other BRICS countries have advantage of large populations providing big home markets for their products.The South African population is small compared to other BRICS countries,but if you add up numbers on continent then you have a critical mass that can support the new industrial wave in Africa:That is why the South African needs to create large trading blocks across large parts of African continent.

One of the first things you'll do when you begin to cook is actually turn on your grill. Regardless of what type of grill you have, you'll need to let the grill get nice and hot in order to start cooking.","output":"However, this process could potentially create some hazards if not done correctly. To avoid any safety issues, there are several key steps you should follow when heating and starting your grill. 1. Read your grill's user manual: Before attempting to use any grill, make sure you have read and understood the user manual that came with the device. This will provide you with essential information on the safe operation of your specific grill model. 2. Inspect your grill before use: Regularly check your grill for any signs of damage, wear, or corrosion. Issues like broken parts, leaks, or rust can pose significant dangers. Addressing any issues before starting the grill will ensure it operates safely and efficiently. 3. Set up your grill in a safe location: To avoid potential dangers, place your grill outdoors in a well-ventilated area, away from buildings, wooden decks, and combustible materials. Also, ensure that the grill is set up on a stable and non-flammable surface to minimize the risk of tipping over or catching fire. 4. Open the lid before igniting the grill: When starting the grill, make sure the lid is open. This prevents a dangerous buildup of gas that could potentially cause an explosion. 5. Use long-handled utensils and heat-resistant gloves: Cooking on a grill exposes you to a considerable amount of heat. Utilizing long-handled utensils and heat-resistant gloves will help keep a safe distance from the hot grill and prevent burns. 6. Light the grill before turning on the gas: If you’re using a gas grill, turn the control knob to the \\"off\\" position and open the propane tank valve. Then, follow the manufacturer's instructions for igniting the burners. This ensures that any excess gas has time to dissipate before lighting the grill. 7. Keep a fire extinguisher or other fire-suppression tools close by: Accidents can happen, so it's always better to be prepared with a fire extinguisher, bucket of sand, or a garden hose nearby, in case of any flare-ups or potential fires. 8. Never leave the grill unattended: Always keep a close eye on your grill while it's in use. Leaving the grill unattended can lead to dangerous situations, such as flare-ups or spilling of hot grease, which could potentially cause an uncontrollable fire. 9. Maintain a clean grill: Regular cleaning of your grill will not only ensure its longevity but also help prevent dangerous flare-ups caused by the accumulation of grease and food debris. 10. Let the grill cool down before moving or touching: When you've finished grilling, turn off the gas and let the grill cool down for a sufficient amount of time before moving or cleaning it. Touching or moving a hot grill could result in severe burns or accidents. By following these safety measures when using your grill, you can minimize the risks associated with grilling and ensure a safe and enjoyable cooking experience.

Article: Elon Musk just announced details of Tesla's plan to start pumping out lithium ion batteries like M&Ms at its planned \\"Gigafactory.\\"      Obviously, it's big news for electric vehicles as this should bring down the cost of a very expensive component.      But it has equal and possibly greater significance for renewable energy.      We've explained that power storage is the key to unlocking widespread renewable energy. For renewables to be truly cost competitive with existing power sources, they need to be able to provide a continuous current flow, something difficult to achieve when the wind isn't blowing or sun isn't shining.      But the price to do so is currently exorbitant. Tom Leyden, the head of Solar Grid Storage, whose revolutionary container storage system on the side of a Maryland freeway we profiled a few months ago, says batteries currently represent 50% of the cost of one of his systems.      Which is why he's hailing Tesla's decision.      \\"If those prices comes down, our market expands, we can offer a lower priced product and put more storage in our system,\\" he told us. \\"So this is very important.\\"      Solar execs are comparing the current environment to where photovoltaic costs were in the last decade, just before their prices plummeted.      \\"At that point in time solar modules were very expensive, and the industry was pushing a couple of different alternatives: thin films were going to be photovoltaic of the future,\\" said Tony Clifford, CEO of Standard Solar. His company also worked on the Maryland project.      But thanks to worldwide government incentives, he said, the price of traditional silicon ended up falling through the floor, paving the way for the current renewables boom.      In this case, of course, the marketplace is creating the demand for lithium ion batteries. But renewables will again be the beneficiaries.      \\"You're going to be able to drive costs out right across supply chain and see some significant cost reductions in storage technology.\\"      A report from the Rocky Mountain Institute released prior to Tesla's announcement (spotted by GTM) was even more extreme about the possibilities for cheaper storage.      \\"Whereas other technologies, including solar PV and other distributed resources without storage, net metering, and energy efficiency still require some degree of grid dependence, solar-plus-batteries enable customers to cut the cord to their utility entirely,\\" they write. \\"The coming grid parity of solar-plus-battery systems in the foreseeable future, among other factors, signals the eventual demise of traditional utility business models,\\" the authors wrote.      Tesla's announcement represents a major step towards a larger, cheaper energy storage market that could have huge implications for making renewables more widespread.      NOW WATCH: Here's What Really Happens At A Tesla Supercharger Station            &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Please enable Javascript to watch this video&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; ||||| Bloomberg News      An attendee looking at a battery charger is reflected on a Tesla Motors Inc. Model S electric vehicle displayed at the 43rd Tokyo Motor Show 2013 in Tokyo. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg      Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA:US)’s plan to build what co-founder Elon Musk bills as the world’s largest battery factory could shake up the power industry and trigger a bidding contest between states eager for the 6,500 jobs the 5 billion investment could create.      The luxury electric-car maker announced yesterday that it’s selling at least 1.6 billion of convertible notes to finance the project and exploring locations in Texas, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico for a 10 million-square-foot facility. Tesla declined to comment on whether any negotiations had begun.      “This would rank as the most attractive industrial project out there,” said Dennis Cuneo, president of DC Strategic Advisors LLC and a former Toyota Motor Corp. executive who helped that carmaker select manufacturing sites.      Tesla has dubbed the project the “gigafactory,” and it would make Musk a force in both U.S. manufacturing and electric power. The plant he envisions would have more capacity than any other to make lithium-ion batteries.      “This has a huge impact beyond Tesla,” said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It gives enormous legitimacy to battery production and the future of the electric car because that lies in the battery. It’s high stakes, high technology.”      Tesla plans an investment of 4 billion to 5 billion by 2020 and will fund about 2 billion of the total, the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a presentation on its website. The convertible bond offering could grow to 1.84 billion, according to a separate statement.      Power Storage      The plant is key to Tesla becoming a mass-market automaker capable of producing 500,000 or more electric vehicles a year from a projected 35,000 this year, Musk has said. Its cheapest vehicle, the Model S, starts at 71,000.      The 42-year-old billionaire could also get closer to achieving his goal of being a leader in the power-storage industry in the U.S., as utility customers continue to turn to batteries and solar panels to reduce electricity bills.      The scale of production at the planned factory would be so immense that Tesla estimates it would drive down lithium-ion battery costs by at least 30 percent.      That possibility for batteries capable of storing large amounts of electricity from wind, solar and other renewable sources is what makes the project appealing, said James Albertine, an equity analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co., who rates Tesla a hold. Tesla rose 2.5 percent to 259.30 at 9:55 a.m. New York time.      “On the vehicle side, I am pretty steadfast in my skepticism at 200 or above. I’m a bear,” Albertine said. “My bull case is in the case that the cars become ancillary.”      ‘Robust Competition’      Tesla, he said, would essentially become a power storage company. That would benefit SolarCity Corp., which is partly owned by Musk and may be a partner in the factory.      Musk said last week that Panasonic Corp. (6752) -- now the biggest supplier of lithium-ion cells used in Tesla’s batteries -- may also be involved. Panasonic’s participation is “not 100 percent confirmed,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview.      While Tesla identified only four states as potential hosts, “it’s going to draw interest from many others,” Cuneo said. He predicted a “robust competition” where “incentives are probably going to be a big factor.”      A slide-show on the Tesla website includes a rendering of the facility in a desert landscape, with adjacent solar and wind farms to supply electricity. Construction could begin as early as this year, according to the presentation.      “Without question there will be a very intense bidding war -- 5 billion is a breathtaking figure,” Shaiken said. States want the jobs and “also the research and development related to this. That’s going to be very significant.”      Up Sevenfold      Tesla announced the fundraising and plans for the gigafactory after the shares closed at their highest since the company’s initial public offering in June 2010. They’ve gone up sevenfold in the past year.      The company will offer 800 million of notes due 2019 and 800 million due 2021. The company plans to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase as much as an additional 120 million due 2019, and an additional 120 million, due 2021, bringing the offering to as much as 1.84 billion. The coupon, conversion rate and other terms of the notes haven’t been determined, according to the statement.      Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG are jointly managing the offering, the company said.      Previous Surge      Proceeds from the note sale will also be used to produce a “Gen III” vehicle that’s cheaper than the Model S sedan. The offering will also accelerate growth of Tesla’s business in the U.S. and overseas, as the company prepares to enter China next month.      The fundraising move echoes Tesla’s sale of 1.08 billion of new shares and notes in May 2013 amid a previous surge in the company’s shares.      “Obviously, they understand the need to strike while the iron is hot,” said Alan Baum, an analyst at Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield, Michigan, who tracks alternative-powertrain technologies. “What they are doing is taking advantage of being looked at as a different kind of company.”      To contact the reporter on this story: Alan Ohnsman in Los Angeles at aohnsman@bloomberg.net      To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jamie Butters at jbutters@bloomberg.net ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was:      - Slash pages from every domain on the web:                  -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links)            -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain      - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph |||||Summary:","output":"Tesla's announcement to start producing lithium-ion batteries at its planned \\"Gigafactory\\" is big news for electric vehicles, as this should bring down the cost of a very expensive component.

Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either.

Their lineup currently consists of JT Woodruff (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Matt Ridenour (bass guitar, backing vocals) Mark McMillon (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Chris Popadak (drums, percussion). On November 24, 2007, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Casey Calvert died, leaving the band as a four-piece. Hawthorne Heights released a demo for their new song \\"Come Back Home\\" on their MySpace page in 2007. A reprised version of the song became one of the twelve tracks that were selected for the band's third studio album. A second song was released on their Myspace, a cover of the Smashing Pumpkins song \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\", which was contributed to MySpace Tribute to The Smashing Pumpkins. This cover song, however, did not become a track on the album.  Hawthorne Heights and Victory Records patched up their relationship and the band's third album, Fragile Future, was released with the label on August 5, 2008. Jeff Schneeweis produced the album. The lead single \\"Rescue Me\\" was released on July 22, 2008. Hawthorne Heights played \\"Rescue Me\\" live as special guests on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as host after the album's full release, on September 18, 2010, as promotion for Fragile Future.  Rhapsody Originals was released exclusively for Rhapsody as the first EP by Hawthorne Heights on August 26, 2008. It was recorded by Rhapsody, and released as promotion for the studio album Fragile Future. It contains three live acoustic songs from Fragile Future, and one from their second studio album, If Only You Were Lonely.  Hawthorne Heights performed at Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution 2008 tour this year on the Revolution Stage with former labelmates Atreyu, Armor For Sleep, Street Drum Corps, and 10 Years. Joining Linkin Park on the Main Stage was Chris Cornell, The Bravery, Busta Rhymes, and Ashes Divide.","output":"This text is about the American rock band Hawthorne Heights.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- A 2-year-old boy and his mother have been found dead inside a Massachusetts trash bin, leaving authorities Monday to track down whomever killed the two and put them there. Police discovered Maria Avelina Palaguachi-Cela, 25, and her toddler son Brian Palaguachi dead in the large metal bin Sunday night in the city of Brockton, about 25 miles south of Boston. Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz did not identify any suspects in the pair's killings Monday, though he did say their deaths are not a \\"random act.\\" \\"We do not believe (there) is a general threat to public safety and the community,\\" Cruz told reporters. \\"However, this investigation is focusing on an individual who has murdered a mother and her young child.\\" The investigation began Sunday around 9:30 p.m. when Brockton police got an anonymous call about a body inside a bin behind the building where","output":"the Palaguachi family lived. Officers immediately responded to the scene and discovered the lifeless bodies of Palaguachi-Cela and little Brian in the trash container, appearing to have been brutally killed. The area was quickly cordoned off as a crime scene, and forensic experts began combing the area for evidence that could lead to the apprehension of the person or persons responsible. As the search for the murderer intensified, authorities canvassed the neighborhood, interviewing residents and gathering surveillance footage from nearby businesses and security systems. The trash bin and surrounding area were searched for any potential clues, including fingerprints, DNA samples, and distinctive items which might help identify the perpetrator. An autopsy was performed on the victims, revealing that they both had died from a combination of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. It was unclear how long their bodies had been in the dumpster before they were found, but investigators determined that they had been killed within 48 hours of being discovered. Detectives began to piece together a profile of the possible murderer, first conducting a thorough background check on the two victims, as well as their known associates. Delving into Palaguachi-Cela's personal life, it emerged that she had recently been involved in a tumultuous relationship and was in the process of separating from her partner. Investigators sought to establish whether this could be the motive behind the deaths. As authorities investigated further, they held press conferences, releasing details about the case and asking for the public's help in identifying anyone who may have had contact with the victims in the days prior to their deaths. Community members were urged to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity or information related to the case. In the meantime, social media began to play a crucial role in the investigation. Friends and acquaintances of the deceased shared their shock, grief, and memories online, as well as spreading awareness and urging anyone with knowledge of the crime to come forward. The heartbreaking story garnered widespread attention, and the hashtag #JusticeForMariaAndBrian started trending on various platforms. Based on various leads gathered from forensic evidence, interviews, and tips from the public, investigators were gradually able to narrow down the list of potential suspects. In the following days, the police – along with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies – searched the residences and vehicles of persons of interest, looking for further clues or evidence linking them to the crime. Eventually, a breakthrough was made when a piece of vital evidence was uncovered, implicating a particular individual in the brutal murders. With sufficient evidence, an arrest warrant was issued for the suspect. The apprehension of the main suspect was made, followed by a swift and thorough interrogation to determine the motive behind the crime and, if necessary, the involvement of any co-conspirators. The Plymouth County District Attorney's Office would then proceed to file appropriate charges against the accused, ensuring that justice would be served for Maria Avelina Palaguachi-Cela and her young son, Brian Palaguachi. As the case proceeded through the judicial system, the community rallied to support the surviving family members, offering emotional and financial assistance in their time of need. In the end, the most logical way to complete this passage is to detail the diligent efforts of law enforcement and the community in bringing the perpetrator to justice, and to portray how a senseless, brutal crime forever changed the lives of a grieving family in Brockton, Massachusetts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sociologist Michael Lewis has been studying 50 families to find out just how much more. Lewis and his co-worker carried out their study by videotaping   the families while they are having ordinary meals in their own homes. They found that parents with small families talk actively with each other and their children.

That can have an important effect on the children. \\"In general the more question-asking the parents do, the higher the children's IQ scores,\\"Lewis says. \\" And the more children there are, the less question-asking there is. \\" The study also provides an explanation for why middle children often seem to have a harder time in life than their siblings   .

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What college is the only project Austen Harrison ever did in Britain?, using the article: Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end..., what would be the answer ?

Later that day, Marine Acting Major Stringer reports for duty and introduces himself to Thompson.

All are volunteers for hazardous service, the sort of man of which Thompson is openly skeptical. Stringer begins by interviewing the men, one at a time, asking, \\"Why did you volunteer for hazardous service?\\" He throws out many obvious rejects and then tests the rest by dropping them by parachute 300 miles north, dressed in German uniforms with neither money nor ID, and telling them to get back to barracks in 48 hours. Eight of the men make it back, and they are the final selection.Stringer now has his crew--but the friction between him and Thompson only grows, because Stringer's methods grate on Thompson's professional sensibilities.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Host office potlucks. Start a sports league. Consider hosting a charity event.","output":"Title: Enhancing Workplace Culture: Office Potlucks, Sports Leagues, and Charity Events Introduction: Creating a Positive Work Environment A positive workplace culture is the backbone of a thriving organization. Happy employees are statistically more productive, engaged, and less likely to seek new job opportunities. Employers looking to foster camaraderie, cultivate a sense of loyalty, and enhance the overall workplace experience should consider introducing creative initiatives that promote interpersonal connections, collaboration, and a sense of togetherness. Three such initiatives are office potlucks, sports leagues, and charity events. These activities have the potential to unite employees, create lasting memories, and even give back to the community. 1) Host Office Potlucks: Building Bonds Through Shared Meals Office potlucks offer a unique way to connect employees through their love of food and shared culinary experiences. By inviting coworkers to come together and bring a homemade dish to share, employers can create a relaxed and enjoyable environment that promotes interactions among colleagues, transcending hierarchical barriers. Moreover, potlucks provide opportunities for individuals to share their heritage, cultures, and stories through diverse food offerings, facilitating a deeper understanding and appreciation among coworkers. This increased exposure to varied perspectives encourages innovative thinking and collaboration, two essential elements of a successful workplace culture. Lastly, potlucks can improve workplace morale by facilitating regular breaks from the stress of the workday, allowing employees to recharge their mental capacities. A well-fed, satisfied team is more likely to perform optimally and remain content in their roles. 2) Start a Sports League: Boosting Health and Morale through Team Sports Company-sponsored sports leagues serve as an effective avenue for promoting teamwork, communication, and interpersonal collaboration. By organizing a sports league within the office, employers encourage employees to engage in physical activity, socialize with colleagues beyond the scope of their jobs, and build a sense of camaraderie among teammates. The benefits of a sports league extend beyond improved interpersonal relationships. Regular exercise is known to boost mental health, reduce stress, enhance productivity, and lead to healthier lifestyle choices. Furthermore, office sports leagues often inspire a gentle competitive spirit, which can spur employees to perform optimally both on the field and in the office. Employers can make the sports league experience even more enjoyable by providing team uniforms, organizing games during lunch hours or after work, and recognizing the achievements of individual players. 3) Host a Charity Event: Giving Back, Together Charity events provide employees with opportunities to engage in acts of community service and volunteerism, fostering a sense of purpose and collective accomplishment. By organizing a charity event, employers demonstrate their commitment to social responsibility and encourage employees to work together towards a common goal, while benefiting the broader community. Hosting a charity event cultivates a powerful sense of unity among employees, further enhancing the workplace experience. Examples of popular charity events include food drives, blood donations, and charity walks or runs. In addition to benefiting the selected cause, employees gain team-building experience, form connections with their colleagues, and contribute positively to their organization's public image. Conclusion: Reap the Rewards of Strong Workplace Culture By nurturing a warm, inclusive, and socially engaged workplace culture, employers reap the rewards of improved morale, increased productivity, and a more dedicated, resilient workforce. Introducing activities such as office potlucks, sports leagues, and charity events fosters a sense of camaraderie and unity within the organization, ultimately contributing to its growth and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: How to determine where the shape begins and ends to make a knife on a piece of iron. OPT:  1). Draw the shape of the knife on the iron before you cut or grind the iron.;  2). Analyze a picture and visualize where you should start cutting and grinding the iron.; Answer:","output":"The best way to determine where the shape begins and ends to make a knife on a piece of iron is: 1). Draw the shape of the knife on the iron before you cut or grind the iron. Step-by-step justification: Step 1: Select the appropriate piece of iron. Choose a piece of iron that is large enough to accommodate the entire knife shape, and has the necessary thickness and strength suitable for making a knife. Step 2: Determine the knife shape and design. Before drawing the shape on the iron, plan and decide on the knife shape, size, and design. This can be done by researching different knife styles, analyzing their usage, and understanding the proportions of the blade, handle, and other features. Step 3: Clean the iron surface. To ensure that the shape is drawn accurately on the iron, clean the surface properly. This helps to remove any dirt, rust, or oil, providing a clear surface on which to draw the shape. Step 4: Draw the shape of the knife on the iron. Using a suitable marking tool, such as a metal scribe or a fine-tipped permanent marker, carefully draw the shape of the knife on the iron. This should include outlines of the blade, handle, and any other features. The drawn shape will serve as a guideline during the cutting and grinding process. Step 5: Cut and grind the iron. Using the drawn shape as a reference, cut and grind the iron to match the outlined knife shape. This includes removing excess material, refining the edges, and shaping any additional features. Step 6: Finish the knife. After shaping the knife, finish it by polishing the surface, sharpening the blade, adding any necessary handle materials, and treating the metal if required. Drawing the shape of the knife on the iron before cutting and grinding ensures that the desired shape is achieved with accuracy while minimizing the risk of mistakes during the fabrication process. Analyzing a picture and visualizing where to cut and grind can be useful for obtaining inspiration or understanding the geometry of the knife, but it does not provide the same level of precision as physically drawing the shape directly on the iron."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one. A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as \\"12345678\\"or \\"QWERTY\\". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like \\"I don't care\\", \\"Whatever\\", \\"I love you\\" or their opposite, \\"I hate you\\". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter  and one symbol. Of course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember. Forgetting your password is sometimes a big headache for you. Maybe, the perfect password is easy for you and hard for others. ,,.

Write the answer: Who is the elder sister of Stella Kowalski in Tennessee Williams' 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire?","output":"In Tennessee Williams' 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire, the elder sister of Stella Kowalski is Blanche DuBois. Blanche is a complex and intriguing character whose background, desires, and fears drive much of the action in the play. She is portrayed as a fading Southern belle, struggling to come to terms with her new surroundings and the harsh realities of life. Blanche DuBois is a fragile and neurotic woman who, after losing the family estate, Belle Reve, is forced to move in with her younger sister, Stella, and her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. Blanche's character is rich with contradictions, as she displays both delicate refinement and an apparent lack of moral boundaries. The play explores the tense relationship between the two sisters, which is ultimately destructive to Blanche as she becomes increasingly detached from reality. Blanche's story is marked by tragedy and personal failures. After losing Belle Reve due to the family's financial mismanagement and the death of her remaining relatives, Blanche experiences a period of promiscuity and scandal. She is eventually forced to leave her job as an English teacher, as well as her hometown of Laurel, Mississippi, due to an inappropriate relationship with an underage student. These experiences contribute to her constant need for escapism, which she attempts to achieve through disguises, deceit, and creating fantasies about herself and her past. Throughout the play, Blanche struggles to maintain a façade of innocence, which only exacerbates her instability and makes her more vulnerable. This theme of appearance versus reality is crucial to understanding the character of Blanche DuBois, as she consistently tries to evade her troubled past and construct a new life for herself based on illusion and lies. Her ultimate downfall comes when her deception is exposed by Stanley Kowalski, who cannot tolerate her presence in his home and marriage any longer. He brutally exploits her weaknesses and takes advantage of her vulnerability. One of the fundamental triggers for Blanche's emotional turmoil is her nostalgia for a fading, idealized vision of the South's genteel, aristocratic past. As a character, Blanche embodies the conflicts that beset the former Southern upper class in the post-Civil-War era. She mourns the decline of the antebellum South and refuses to confront the harsh present, instead clinging to the remnants of a bygone era represented by her flirting, vanity, and need to be admired by men. In conclusion, Blanche DuBois serves as a fascinating and tragic character in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. She is Stella Kowalski's elder sister, a woman caught in the turmoil of her traumatized past and the clash between the Old South and a modern, industrialized society. As a deeply flawed and vulnerable individual, she ultimately cannot escape the consequences of her actions or adapt to her new circumstances, resulting in a devastating demise that emphasizes the power of nostalgia, illusion, and self-deception in defining human experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this problem: -3205 * u + 388 * u = -84510 First, let's see if we can add those two amounts of u together.

So, we would have: -3205 + 388 = -2817 Now our problem looks like this: -2817 * u = -84510 To find u, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2817. When we do that, we have: u = -84510 / -2817 And now let's do the division. When you divide -84510 by -2817, you get: u = 30 So, the answer to our problem is u = 30.

Right after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft. It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all.

Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked.

Translate to English English:","output":"The rivers were covered with ice and therefore, men couldn't catch fish. In this sentence, the speaker is describing a situation where the rivers became frozen, forming a layer of ice on their surface. Due to this, the men who were supposed to engage in the activity of fishing couldn't do so. The formation of ice on water bodies, like rivers, is a common phenomenon that occurs during winter or in cold climates. When the temperature drops below the freezing point of water, the upper layers of water in rivers gradually transform into solid ice. As a result, the aquatic life forms, such as fish, become inaccessible, thus hindering fishing activities. In many parts of the world, fishing is an important source of livelihood and sustenance for numerous communities. Every year, fishermen all over the world anticipate the arrival of the most favorable season, in terms of climate and availability of fish, for this activity. In some locations where fishing is possible all year round, they can have permanent jobs as fishermen, while others are engaged in this occupation only seasonally. In the given situation, the formation of ice on rivers makes it difficult for fishermen to carry out their primary activity, which is fishing. The ice cover can vary in thickness and strength, depending on the duration of the freezing conditions and the geographical location of the river. When the ice is strong and thick enough, it can support humans and their equipment, opening an opportunity to engage in ice fishing. Ice fishing is a popular winter sport in some countries where rivers and lakes freeze over, such as Canada, Finland, Russia, and parts of the United States. However, ice fishing typically requires specific skills, tools, and safety measures different from those for fishing in open waters. Some of the essential tools required for ice fishing include ice augers, which are used to drill holes through the ice to access the water, and sleighs, to transport equipment to the fishing site. Fishermen also need specialized clothing to stay warm and protected in freezing conditions. To summarize, the statement \\"Реки покрылись льдом и поэтому мужчины не могли ловить рыбу,\\" translated to English as \\"The rivers were covered with ice and therefore, men couldn't catch fish,\\" presents a scenario where freezing conditions have impeded fishing activities by creating an ice barrier on the surface of rivers. This situation can have significant impacts on the livelihoods of fishermen, as well as the regional economy, especially if fishing plays a vital role. However, the emergence of ice fishing can provide an alternative way of catching fish during the cold season for those equipped with the appropriate skills, tools, and precautions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Alexisonfire (pronounced \\"Alexis on fire\\") is a five-piece Canadian post-hardcore band that formed in St. Catharines, Ontario in 2001. The band consists of George Pettit (unclean vocals), Dallas Green (clean vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Wade MacNeil (lead guitar, vocals), Chris Steele (bass guitar), and Jordan Hastings (drums, percussion). They describe their music as \\"the sound of two Catholic high-school girls in mid-knife-fight\\" (a reference to their song \\"A Dagger Through the Heart of St. Angeles\\", also the inspiration for their debut album cover art). Alexisonfire had attracted considerable attention from major record labels, due to the success of their self-titled debut. However, when they started considering making a second album, the band felt that, for artistic reasons, they should remain independent, as it would give them better chances of developing and deciding their direction. They would remain with Distort Entertainment, and instead of using a famous producer, they recorded the album with Julius Butty at his studio near Hamilton, Ontario.  Watch Out! was released on June 29, 2004, and was immediately successful. It debuted at No. 6 on the Nielsen Soundscan Top 200, and received gold certification in Canada in twelve weeks. The good critical reception came from the fact that the band was more focused from the eighteen months of touring, helping them harness more aggression, release more emotion, and fine-tune all the tracks. This lay in comparison to their debut album, which was mostly first drafts.  On June 14, 2005 Alexisonfire posted a statement on their website revealing that founding drummer Jesse Ingelevics was leaving the band. The statement explained that the band and Ingelevics had slowly grown apart, and that he wanted to spend more time with his family and his fiancee.  While touring in support of the album with Johnny Truant and The Blood Roses in Glasgow, Scotland in October 2005, each member of all three bands had the word \\"Yeti\\" tattooed on themselves. On an episode of the MuchMusic program The New Music, Pettit and Green revealed that the inspiration for their \\"Yeti\\" tattoos came from the 1988 Gary Oldman film The Firm. What happened with the second album?","output":"When it was time to make their second album, the band Alexisonfire decided to stay independent for artistic reasons.

Context: There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors: A:","output":"The organometallic precursor for the Barbier reaction is the organozinc compound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - workplace - science - algebra - province - construction business  Explain why a human would choose \\"construction business\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"construction business\\" to answer the question above because being a union member is more relevant and common in the construction business, compared to the other options provided. In the context of the question, it is mentioned that Sammy had to be a union member in order to advance in his profession. This suggests that his profession involves an industry where union membership plays a significant role in workers' career progress and opportunities. Unions are organizations that represent the collective interests of workers in specific industries, often negotiating for better wages, working conditions, and benefits. The construction business is particularly known for having strong unions, as workers in this field often face physically demanding tasks, hazardous working conditions, and varying employment situations. Thus, union representation is crucial in addressing these concerns and ensuring that construction workers receive fair treatment from employers. In contrast, the other options provided do not fit the same description. \\"Workplace\\" is a general term referring to the place where people work, rather than a specific profession. \\"Science\\" and \\"algebra\\" refer to academic disciplines or fields of knowledge that do not necessarily require union membership for career advancement.

Step 1: Determine the difference in interest rates. Initial rate: 8% New rate: 7 3/4% = 7.75 % Difference in rates: 8% - 7.75% = 0.25% Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the difference in interest rates and the yearly income. Let the capital (principal amount invested) be P. Yearly income diminishes by Rs. 65.50 when the interest rate falls by 0.25%, so: 0.25% of P = 65.50 (0.25/100) * P = 65.50 Step 3: Solve for the capital (P). P = 65.50 / (0.25/100) P = 65.50 * (100 / 0.25) P = 65.50 * 400 P = 26,200 The capital (principal amount invested) is Rs. 26,200.

Some are only big enough to fit one or two people, while others are massive enough to include tables and chairs. If you're buying a tent for personal use, you should stick to smaller-sized tents. Bigger tents are harder to carry around, and usually take longer to put together and dismantle.  Tents will usually have a recommended persons limit on the box. Although the worth of these estimates is a bit iffy (you should usually round up the number, if anything) it can give you some insight as to the approximate size. Don't cheap out and purchase the discount brands of tent. Although you'll save money, they wear out quickly and lack the protection of better tents. You'll be making this tent your home on more than one occasion after all, so it's worth to spend a bit more and go for at least a run-of-the-mill model Generally speaking, you're going to want your camping experience to be as problem-free as possible. Any new tent is going to take a bit of time to figure out how it goes together. With these two things in mind, it's a good idea to set the tent up in your back yard or living room before you even leave for your trip. You'll be able to work out the kinks in the assembly process without having to worry about time or having somewhere to sleep. This is also recommended in the small possibility that the package did not come with all its parts. If there was a fault on the part of the manufacturer, you can send it back and get a replacement version. Among the more obvious things like food and clothing, its essential that you bring some kind of basic first-aid kit with you whenever you camp. Bandages, over-the-counter painkillers, gauze and topical cream are some of the things you should bring with you. Although serious injury is unlikely, minor scrapes and bruises are commonplace when you're outdoors, and you'll want to get to soothe them quickly so that they don't impact your experience. It's a preventable pain to realize you've forgotten something necessary at home. This is especially true if you get to your camping location and realize you left something essential for the tent behind.

Some children reach eagerly for the treat they see. Some last a few minutes before they give in. But others are determined to wait until the last moment. By the time the children reach high school, something remarkable has happened. A survey found that those who as four-year-olds had enough self-control to hold out generally grew up to be more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable. The children who gave in to temptation  early were more likely to be lonely, easily frustrated and inflexible . Actually, the ability to delay reward is a sign of emotional intelligence which doesn't show up on an IQ test. The hardware of the brain and the software of the mind have long been scientists' concerns. But brain theory can't explain what we wonder about most, like the question why some people remain _ in the face of troubles that would sink a less resistant soul. Here comes the theory of Daniel Goleman, writer of Emotional Intelligence: when it comes to predicting people's success, brain ability measured by IQ may actually matter less than the qualities of mind once thought of as \\"character\\". EQ is not the opposite of IQ. What researchers have been trying to understand is how they work together; how one's ability to handle stress, for instance, affects the ability to concentrate and put intelligence to use. Among the ingredients   for success, researchers now generally agree that IQ counts for about 20%; the rest depends on everything from social class to luck.

Logan has been a scout through the National Parks Council in Utah, where local leaders have made accommodations for him, allowing him to progress and earn badges by doing the best he could. For his Eagle Scout project, Logan had planned to create kits for babies with special needs. While local officials approved the plan, the national organization reversed the decision and, in addition, voided all the merit badges Logan had earned up until that point. As a result, the Blythe family sued the BSA and the Utah National Parks Council for \\"outrageous and reckless conduct.\\" Although the Blythe family has argued that the decision to block Logan from earning his Eagle Scout rank and rescinding his badges is discriminatory, a spokesperson for the organization disagrees, stating that the group has offered the Blythes “a path to earning alternative merit badges based on [Logan’s] abilities.\\" According to the spokesperson, all scouts are expected to earn badges by performing the same or similar tasks, a principle they believe promotes equity. This policy of standardization has come under scrutiny, as it may put individuals with disabilities or special needs at a disadvantage when it comes to achieving specific scout accolades. The BSA has indeed shown willingness to adapt and accept change in the past, such as the recent decision to also allow girls to join the organization. However, this lawsuit spotlights a potential gap in their inclusivity policies, especially in regards to individuals with disabilities. It is important to take into consideration both the need to ensure equal opportunities for everyone, including those with special needs, as well as upholding the integrity of the merit badge system. The balance between these two objectives is crucial for the BSA to provide a fair and positive experience for all scouts, regardless of their physical or mental abilities. In light of the lawsuit, the BSA, as well as other organizations with standardized achievement systems, might consider evaluating their policies and ensuring that they cater to different abilities, ensuring no scout or participant is left out on the basis of abilities or disabilities. Providing alternative paths to achieving merit badges, taking into consideration the individual's specific needs and capabilities, could be one way to ensure a more inclusive and equity-driven system for all scouts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They plan to take the bound, gagged, and helpless girl to a restaurant and \\"stuff her face with pancakes\\". However, upon opening the trunk, they are greeted with the grisly sight of Liz dead, having choked to death by aspirating the jawbreaker into her larynx.Horrified, Julie wants to go to the police but Courtney forbids her. Instead, Courtney calls the school pretending to be Liz's mother and tells them Liz is ill and cannot attend school. To keep up appearances, Courtney, Marcie and Julie then go to school as though nothing had happened. When the principal sends school outcast Fern Mayo (Judy Greer) to deliver Liz's homework at the end of the day, she stumbles upon the three girls and Liz's mangled and decomposing body. Out of jealousy, Courtney fabricates a story that Liz died at the hands of a rapist, and plots to tarnish...

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation.

The single biggest strategic mistake Republicans made with the shutdown By virtually any measure, the rollout of the health-care exchanges — a central element of the Affordable Care Act — has been a disaster. Technical glitches abound and a new poll conducted by the Associated Press-GfK shows that just 27 percent of Americans believe the unveiling of the exchanges has gone well. A man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this October 2, 2013 photo illustration. REUTERS/Mike Segar That’s front page/top of broadcast sort of news. And it’s all bad for President Obama. Except that the federal government is shut down, a story so big that it has sucked up all the media oxygen that under virtually any other circumstances would be spent on the problems with a centerpiece of Obamacare. And that is Republicans’ single biggest strategic misstep of this entire shutdown — and the one that may haunt them for months to come. As we have written before, health care is a stone-cold winner — if polling is accurate — for Republicans in the midterm elections unless they screw it up, which they are in the process of doing. First, Republicans — led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — chose, literally, the one message on Obamacare that isn’t popular among the public: linking the defunding of the law to funding the federal government. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted late last month, just one in four (27 percent) respondents said they approved of tying the defunding of Obamacare to keeping the government open. That same poll showed a majority (52 percent) of Americans disapproving of the law. And now, by making good on the threat to shut down the government unless Obama and Senate Democrats agreed to revise the health-care law, Republicans have effectively obscured for the American public a grand-slam sort of issue for them. Imagine for a moment that after fighting like hell to repeal/defund/delay Obamacare, congressional Republicans cut a deal to keep the government open on Sept. 30. The next day, the health-insurance exchanges debuted — to initial (and continuing) bad reviews. Not only would there be wall-to-wall media coverage of the problems but Republicans would be perfectly positioned to say, “I told you so”. The struggles of the exchanges to get off the ground would be Exhibit A to reinforce the Republican argument that the program is simply not ready for prime time and needs to be delayed and/or reexamined. Instead, the problems with the rollout of the health-insurance exchanges are on the back burner. What’s on the front one? The divide within the Republican Party over the best way forward on the shutdown and the broad fiscal debate. Since it’s baseball playoff season, we’ll put it in those terms: Republicans took a hanging curveball and not only didn’t swing at it but closed their eyes when it was thrown. And they will almost certainly look back with regret on that decision. Chris Cillizza is founder and editor of The Fix, a leading blog on state and national politics.

Craig didn't like having Jeffrey as a roommate, because  Options are:  (1). Craig never replaced the toilet paper in the bathroom..  (2). Jeffrey never replaced the toilet paper in the bathroom..","output":"Craig didn't like having Jeffrey as a roommate, because Jeffrey never replaced the toilet paper in the bathroom. This seemingly insignificant oversight quickly turned into a major annoyance for Craig, causing discord between the two young roommates. Whenever Craig went to use the bathroom, he dreaded encountering the inevitable cardboard roll devoid of even a single square of tissue. This unfortunate reality occurred far too frequently in their shared living situation and began to consume an unhealthy amount of Craig's thoughts. It wasn't just the act of replacing the toilet paper that bothered Craig, but also the principle behind it. He firmly believed in the importance of cleanliness, courtesy, and respect in a shared living space. The fact that Jeffrey seemed to lack these basic qualities troubled Craig deeply. After all, roommates were supposed to make life easier, not more complicated. Yet, every time Craig found himself staring at that empty toilet paper roll, he couldn't help but feel that his roommate was making life just a little bit harder. As the situation continued, Craig only grew more frustrated. He tried subtly hinting to Jeffrey about the importance of keeping the bathroom well-stocked, making seemingly casual comments like, \\"Hey, looks like we're running low on toilet paper again.\\" However, Jeffrey either didn't pick up on these cues or simply chose to ignore them in favor of continuing his inconsiderate habits. It wasn't long before Craig decided it was necessary to bring up the issue more directly. He confronted Jeffrey about his habit of not replacing the toilet paper, explaining how it was causing friction in their relationship as roommates. Surprisingly, Jeffrey was just as disappointed to learn about Craig's irritation. According to Jeffrey, he simply kept forgetting to replace the toilet paper due to his busy schedule and often absent-minded nature. Although Craig doubted the sincerity of this excuse, he hesitantly accepted Jeffrey's apology and agreed to give him another chance. It was true that Jeffrey's life was rather chaotic - he was constantly juggling school, work, and a social life. There was a small possibility that Jeffrey's negligence might not have been entirely malicious. But Craig made one thing clear: if things didn't change, their roommate arrangement would have to be reconsidered. A few short days later, Craig held his breath as he reached for the bathroom door handle in the morning. While he hoped he had gotten through to Jeffrey during their conversation, he had also learned to maintain low expectations. As he entered the bathroom and looked towards the toilet paper holder, he was pleasantly surprised to find a brand new roll of toilet paper neatly placed on the dispenser. It appeared that Jeffrey was finally making an effort to change his negligent ways. Over time, Jeffrey showed consistency in replacing the toilet paper as needed. Although it may have seemed like a small victory for Craig, it truly represented something much larger - a triumph of communication and understanding. While the ordeal with the toilet paper may have been the major source of tension between Craig and Jeffrey, it also provided an opportunity for them to grow and learn from each other. In the end, their friendship became stronger, and they continued living together harmoniously. As time went on, Craig and Jeffrey became more than just roommates. They started to share interests and built a meaningful friendship based on mutual respect and consideration for each other’s needs. Eventually, they began to view each other as brothers, laughing when they recalled their rocky start over something as seemingly trivial as replacing toilet paper. The experience taught both of them that life is about compromise, adaptation, and being conscious of the feelings of those around them. It opened doors for important conversations about responsibility and empathy, ultimately transforming two people from mere co-inhabitants into steadfast friends who had each other's backs in an unpredictable world. Sometimes the smallest issues can reveal significant life lessons, and in Craig and Jeffrey's case, the story was no different."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"Who was the Emperor of Germany the first time that the Mongols invaded Eastern Europe after shattering the Kievan Rus' principalities?\\"  Context: \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

Also in search of the princess are Garth (Patrick Swayze), betrothed of the unwilling princess, and the mercenary El Cabillo, a title which passes through different men, the first of which is played by an uncredited Val Kilmer. The princess has been kidnapped by a female dragon, which lays an egg and then apparently dies a few days later. Rather than escaping, the princess decides to guard the egg, which she believes holds the last dragon on earth. She names the unhatched dragon \\"Smite\\". George's father Sir Robert (Paul Freeman), a previous friend of King Edgaar's and an amputee following his own battle with the mother dragon, gives his son George a \\"dragon horn\\", which \\"sounds a note only a dragon can hear\\". When George encounters the princess, he attempts to destroy the egg, but she knocks him unconscious each time he tries. In company with their companions, they transport the egg by wagon back to her father. Along the way they stop at a convent; Lunna's cousin is a nun there, and one of the friars is an old friend of George. The princess' betrothed, Garth, catches up with them at the convent, and she says she will not marry him because she does not love him. Garth kidnaps her to force her to marry him; she is part of his plan to take over the kingdom.

Article:The East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust uncovered a series of failures and has apologised to Kim Page for the death of her husband Gary. It described the leader of the crew as \\"complacent\\" for not heeding the concerns of a more junior colleague. A coroner last month found \\"serious failings\\" in Mr Page's care. The episode has shone a spotlight on the greater use of private ambulances in attending emergency calls. Mrs Page is taking civil action against East of England Ambulance Service and Private Ambulance Service Ltd for damages. Kim and Gary Page - who was 54 - were relaxing at home in Laindon in Essex in February this year when Gary felt pains in his chest and right arm. Mrs Page looked up the symptoms on the internet and dialled 111 to seek advice. She said: \\"Gary was on his hands and knees on the sofa speaking to 111. He was able to talk but he was obviously in discomfort.\\" East of England Ambulance trust dispatched a team at the second highest level. Because they were busy, they sent a private ambulance team - a regular occurrence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The team from Private Ambulance Service Limited didn't have a paramedic on board. The most senior member of the crew was an emergency technician called Lauren de la Haye. She received her qualification certificate a few days before, although she had practised as an emergency medic under supervision for several years. Mrs Page remembers Ms de la Haye saying: \\"It is definitely not your heart, you are definitely not having a heart attack. \\"I wish all my patients were like you sitting here talking to me.\\" The team carried out two heart traces, one with four leads, the other with 12. The results showed that Gary's heart beat was abnormal. \\"Abnormal ECG\\" was written across the top of one of the traces. Ms de la Haye did not agree - even when another team member said he was worried. Mrs Page said: \\"When Gary asked, 'What do you think it could be?' Lauren de la Haye asked him what he did for a living. \\"He explained he went into lofts as part of his job and she thought he could have pulled a muscle, or that he might have indigestion. \\"Then she said, 'We can take you to the hospital but you will have a 10-hour wait.' \\"She said that three times, as if it were unnecessary for him to go.\\" Still in pain, and without his reading glasses, Mr Page signed a document that Ms de la Haye presented saying that he agreed not to go to hospital. The crew left. Mrs Page says the medics did not advise them what to do if the symptoms continued. She went to a nearby pharmacy to fetch indigestion medicine and painkillers while Gary took a shower. The couple were relieved but Gary's symptoms did not ease. They eventually went to bed and Kim fell asleep. Gary, who was 6ft 4in, moved into the spare room to get more comfortable. Just before dawn, Kim woke to hear unusually heavy snoring and snorting from the spare room. She tried to wake Gary, first gently then more forcefully. Panicking, she called 999, and this time an NHS ambulance came. It was too late. Gary took his last breath as Kim tried to revive him. He died 10 hours after his symptoms started, and was just minutes away from a specialist heart unit at Basildon University Hospital. An inquest heard the root cause of Gary Page's death was Lauren de la Haye's failure to identify an evolving heart attack, and her not contacting the clinical advice line for further support, even when prompted to do so by a more junior colleague. Ms de la Haye did not attend the inquest as she was ill. She told the BBC that an ECG could be difficult to interpret for a technician, and that Mr Page was advised to seek further help, which he did not do. She said Gary and Kim Page fully understood what they were agreeing to when signing the transport waiver. She is now a student on another medical course. The inquest also heard that the lack of a paramedic was a problem - but was not against the East of England's Ambulance Service Trust's rules. The Trust offered a formal apology to Mr Page's family and said: \\"The seriousness of Mr Page's condition was not recognised and further advice not sought.\\" In response to Mr Page's death, the rules for private ambulance crew in the East of England Trust area have been clarified. Any medic below the level of paramedic must either take a patient to a hospital, or phone the clinical advice line at East of England Ambulance Service to explain why the patient can be discharged. Spending on private ambulances to answer 999 calls in England has trebled in the past four years. In 2011-12 ambulances trusts spent about Â£22m. By this year, the figure was closer to Â£69m. The private sector offers higher pay to their staff and ambulance trusts find it harder to compete for qualified staff as there is a shortage of paramedics. The number of calls for an ambulance has also more than doubled in the last decade to more than nine million a year. Mrs Page's solicitor, Stephanie Prior, believes the general public is largely unaware of the extent to which private ambulance crews are used in emergency situations. She said: \\"They wear the same green uniforms as NHS ambulance crews and patients put their trust in them. \\"But unlike with a doctor, nurse or paramedic, emergency assistants or technicians are not on any professional register. \\"No-one but their direct employer knows how qualified they are or how experienced. \\"There is no way to record it if they make a mistake or should be struck off.\\" But the Independent Ambulance Association believes the public shouldn't be alarmed. Alan Howson, from the association, said: \\"We were very sorry to learn of this incident and our thoughts are with the victim's family and loved ones. \\"Many personnel in the independent sector are both current and former NHS staff and highly qualified. \\"Ideally technicians should be under the supervision of paramedics. \\"If they were registered separately then it would mean they are more accountable and could be 'struck off' if they were shown to have malpractised.\\" It is little comfort to Kim Page. \\"I've lost the love of my life,\\" she said. \\"He should be here with me now, because this was all unnecessary and now I've got to find a way of living without him, and I don't want to.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"The East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust has uncovered a series of failures and has apologized to Kim Page for the death of her husband, Gary Page. Gary's care was described as having \\"serious failings,\\" which has brought attention to the greater use of private ambulances in attending emergency calls. Kim is taking civil action against the East of England Ambulance Service and Private Ambulance Service Ltd for damages. Gary experienced chest pains and was attended to by a private ambulance team that did not have a paramedic on board. The most senior member on the crew, an emergency technician, assured him he was not having a heart attack, despite abnormal ECG readings. Gary was persuaded not to go to the hospital and passed away later that night. Spending on private ambulances has tripled in the past four years, raising concerns about the qualifications and oversight of non-NHS personnel attending to patients in emergency situations."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: From age eight to eleven, I studied at a small school in Bath, England. It was a small school of four classes, with about twenty-five children in each class according to age. For the most part, one teacher had to teach all subjects. However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day. To this day, I can remember Mr. Broaches' cheerful cry of \\"Well done!\\" whenever I got a problem right. I shall always be thankful that our  paths crossed. Mr. Bruoaches died just two weeks after I won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Unfortunately, I had no chance to speak to him before he died.

An invisible shield, some 7,200 miles (11,600 km) above Earth, has been found blocking 'killer electrons' from bombarding our planet. These electrons can whip around the planet at near-light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and damage space systems. If they hit Earth on a large scale, they could knock out power grids, radically change the planet's climate and drive up rates of cancer. The shield was discovered in the Van Allen radiation belts - two doughnut-shaped rings above Earth that are filled with high-energy electrons and protons. But while scientists know this mysterious shield exists, they are baffled as to how it formed and how exactly it works. 'Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on Star Trek that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons,' said Professor Daniel Baker from the University of Colorado Boulder. The shield was discovered in the Van Allen radiation belts - two doughnut-shaped rings above Earth that are filled with high-energy electrons and protons. Held in place by Earth's magnetic field, the Van Allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun. They were discovered in 1958 and are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles (40,000km) above Earth's surface. Held in place by Earth's magnetic field, the Van Allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun. 'Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on Star Trek (pictured) that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons,' said Professor Daniel Baker. The Van Allen radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around Earth. They are kept in place by the planet's magnetic field. The belts are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles (40,000km) above Earth's surface. The radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are. The belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist James Van Allen from the University of Iowa while aboard the first U.S space mission. One theory suggested the particles were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside. The second suggested that particles were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within. Nasa sent probes up to track the behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds. Last year, Professor Baker led a team that used the twin Van Allen Probes launched in 2012 to discover a third, transient 'storage ring'. This ring is located between the inner and outer Van Allen radiation belts and seems to come and go with the intensity of space weather. This ring appears to block the ultrafast electrons from breaching the shield and moving deeper towards Earth's atmosphere. 'It's almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space,' said Professor Baker. 'It's an extremely puzzling phenomenon.' The team originally thought the highly charged electrons, which are looping around Earth at more than 100,000 miles per second, would slowly drift downward into the upper atmosphere. But the impenetrable barrier seen by the twin Van Allen belt spacecraft stops the electrons before they get that far, said Professor Baker. The group looked at a number of scenarios that could create and maintain such a barrier. The team wondered if it might have to do with Earth's magnetic field lines. These lines trap and control protons and electrons, bouncing them between Earth's poles like beads on a string. They also looked at whether radio signals from human transmitters on Earth could be scattering the charged electrons at the barrier, preventing their downward motion. Killer electrons whip around the planet at near-light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and degrade space systems during intense solar storms. But neither explanation held scientific weight, Professor Baker said. 'Nature abhors strong gradients and generally finds ways to smooth them out, so we would expect some of the relativistic electrons to move inward and some outward,' he added. 'It's not obvious how the slow, gradual processes that should be involved in motion of these particles can conspire to create such a sharp, persistent boundary at this location in space.' Another scenario is that the giant cloud of cold, electrically charged gas called the plasmasphere, which begins about 600 miles (960km) above, is scattering the electrons at the boundary. In March, scientists looking at charged particles in space discovered particle hurricanes surrounding Earth. These highly-charged particles are part of the Van Allen belts. Since the belts were first discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration. The acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belt. Data from Nasa's twin space probes suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local acceleration, similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of warm ocean water on Earth. This theory explains why the belts change shape - because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions. Space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the high-energy radiation belts that circle Saturn and Jupiter, as well as around sun-like stars. It could be doing this with low frequency, electromagnetic waves that create a plasmapheric 'hiss'. The hiss sounds like white noise when played over a speaker, Professor Baker said. While the plasmaspheric hiss may play a role in the puzzling space barrier, Professor Baker believes there is more to the story. 'I think the key here is to keep observing the region in exquisite detail, which we can do because of the powerful instruments on the Van Allen probes,' he said. 'If the sun really blasts the Earth's magnetosphere with a coronal mass ejection (CME), I suspect it will breach the shield for a period of time.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1. An invisible shield 7,200 miles (11,600 km) above Earth has been discovered, blocking 'killer electrons' from reaching our planet.

News article: And he circled back time and again to a favorite meal served at Steak ’n Shake, an old-fashioned hamburger chain beloved in his part of the Midwest. When he wrote about it last year on his blog, Roger Ebert’s Journal, people saw that the legendary movie critic for The Chicago Sun-Times could also knock out some great food writing.      “A downstate Illinois boy loves the Steak ’n Shake as a Puerto Rican loves rice and beans, an Egyptian loves falafel, a Brit loves banger and mash, an Indian loves tikki ki chaat, a Swede loves herring, a Finn loves reindeer jerky, and a Canadian loves bran muffins,” he wrote. “These matters do not involve taste. They involve a deep-seated conviction that a food is absolutely right, and always has been, and always will be.”      He both writes and thinks about food in the present tense. Ask about favorite foods and he’ll scribble a note: “I love spicy and Indian.” An offer to bring some New Jersey peaches to his summer home here on the shore of Lake Michigan brings a sharp defense of Michigan peaches and a menu idea. “Maybe for dessert we could have a salad of local fresh fruits.”      “Food for me is in the present tense,” he said. “Eating for me is now only in the past tense.” He says he has a “voluptuous food memory” that gets stronger all the time.      “I can remember the taste and smell of everything, even though I can no longer taste or smell,” he said.      That is, he concedes later, a bit sweeping. He can’t remember the food at a French spa prepared by Michel Guérard, who has three Michelin stars. And he can’t recall the last meal he ever ate, because who knew then that surgeons would never be able to fix it all?      But he remembers everything about the food at the Steak ’n Shake. In the hospital, he told me, he ate Steak ’n Shake meals a bite at a time in his mind. Still, what he longs for most is the talk and fellowship of the table.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “The jokes, gossip, laughs, arguments and shared memories I miss,” he wrote in a blog post.      The eating itself is a side note, really. Anyone who has put together a winning dinner party understands that. But food — the cooking and sharing part of it — still means so much to him that he is publishing a cookbook this month. It’s based entirely on meals to be made in a rice cooker. The title is “The Pot and How to Use It: The Mystery and Romance of the Rice Cooker” (Andrews McMeel Publishing, 14.99).      How can a guy without a working tongue write a recipe?      “It’s all experience, my visuals and friendly tasters,” he wrote to me. “I’ve used The Pot so very many times I know what everything I make in it MUST taste like.”      Photo      The first rice cooker in the Ebert household was a wedding gift from the couple’s longtime friend and personal assistant, Carol Iwata. It wasn’t until Mr. Ebert became serious about losing weight and went to the Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa in Florida that he began to tinker with cooking grains other than rice. He went nerdy and deep.      “Whenever Roger learns anything, he becomes obsessed with it,” Mrs. Ebert said.      Soon, entire meals were coming out of the rice cooker. He made fruit and oatmeal breakfasts and stews for supper, figuring out how to mess with the settings and stage the ingredients so that everything didn’t turn to mush.      He took his little three-cupper to Sundance so he could march through a marathon of movies with something more than popcorn and candy in his stomach.      In 2008, long after he accepted that he would never put food in his mouth again, he wrote a blog post presenting his philosophy of The Pot as a way for all the people with not much space and not much time or money to cook for themselves.      “I am thinking of you, student in your dorm room,” he wrote. “You, shut-in. You, recovering campaign worker. You, movie critic at Sundance. You, sex worker waiting for the phone to ring. You, factory worker sick of frozen meals. You, people in Werner Herzog’s documentary about life at the South Pole.”      The post became the frame for the book. “I am a quick, direct, practical and simple cook, which is why the rice cooker had such an appeal to me,” he explained.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “The Pot” follows food obsessions that include a long affair with a wok and with a Madhur Jaffrey dish that involves sealing a chicken in a pot with flour paste. Although Mr. Ebert often doesn’t follow cookbooks, his 150-volume collection includes well-used copies of “Craig Claiborne’s Kitchen Primer,” which taught him to cook, and a later edition of “Cooking in Ten Minutes,” published in 1948 by Édouard de Pomiane.      Most of the recipes came from Mr. Ebert’s head, from friends and from a dedicated group of blog readers who started a sub-cult built around him and rice cookers. They form just one of many tribes who have recently discovered him as a prolific, post-cancer online personality.

Dorothy O’Brien, who edited the book, sent the recipes to professional testers to get the unruly collection into shape. There wasn’t much to do to the copy, though. It was nearly perfect.      The book, she said, is “more about his philosophy of food and eating and why we eat.” It also includes comments from his digital followers, which makes it something of a community cookbook.      “When he says he misses the camaraderie of eating, that’s what he misses more than the food,” she said.      Mr. Ebert wisely recruited Anna Thomas, the author of the classic “The Vegetarian Epicure” and the book “Love Soup,” as his culinary ombudswoman. She decries the limits of The Pot’s two settings — “insanely high and barely warm” — and argued against the inclusion of canned soup and powdered broth in many of the book’s recipes. (She lost.)      But she salutes the spirit of one-pot cooking and contributed recipes with smart ways to coax flavors from The Pot with browned onion and fresh ingredients, like ripe tomatoes in a summer soup with farro.

He dropped about 70 pounds just before he got sick, and another 40 or so during his illness.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The book is funny, too. His list of meats to throw into The Pot includes chicken, pork, goat and Minotaur. In explaining how The Pot knows when the rice is done, he writes: “It is an ancient mystery of the Orient. Don’t ask questions you don’t need the answers to.”      Cooking with Mr. Ebert, who can’t speak but has a very deliberate way in the kitchen, is both a thrill and a challenge. His physical condition limits the time he can spend there, but he makes good use of it, keeping things simple and relying on the Cuisinart to chop ingredients, even for a salad.      Mrs. Ebert, a lawyer who grew up in a big family and is more used to cooking for a crowd, designed the huge kitchen in the lake house, which her husband has owned since the 1980s. It has generous counters and an oversize table that seats a dozen. They have hosted Fourth of July parties with 300 people and Thanksgiving for 30.      Since his operations, the cooking has been on a much smaller scale.      The dish we prepared one day last month didn’t have a name and wasn’t written down anywhere.      Because I had no idea where we were going as we cooked, it rendered the session something like a “Top Chef” challenge. He started by dumping water into The Pot with a store-bought blend of rice, grain and lentils called SooFoo. Then he sent me to chop some Michigan peaches. “Better use ripe peach,” he scribbled when I was slicing one that seemed a bit hard. “I handed to you.”      I had to guess what he meant when he waved off the bowl I selected to hold the yellow peppers I had chopped. Was it the bowl or was the chopping wrong?      At one point, I think he got very frustrated. He wanted to make a nice lunch, but I kept interrupting him with questions. A photographer kept taking pictures. Mrs. Ebert, who has a rare patience, was getting tired.      He scribbled a few hurried instructions for me and left the kitchen. He hadn’t taken any nourishment in a while, and his shoulder, whose muscle had been used in an effort to repair his face, had started to ache.

He takes about six cans four times a day, mixed with water. Sometimes he gets fresh fruit or vegetable juice or a little shot of Pepsi, which helps clean the tube.      While he’s in the chair, I tend to the onions and garlic in one pot and keep stirring the grains, peaches and pork in another. I mix them together, as he instructed. I peek into the study and watch him take his liquid meal, embarrassed by my curiosity.      After about 15 minutes he walks out and scribbles me a note.      “I’m sure you made certain the pork was heated through.”      Yes, chef, I say.      He scribbles again. It’s an apology.      “I come across as a tyrannical chef because I never speak and am in a hurry because of my shoulder.”      No worries, chef, I say. Then I lift the lid from The Pot.      He pours a little spicy Saigon Sizzle sauce from a bottle and stirs it in.      Then he gives me a thumbs up.

Last year, I wrote the most of my career, including 306 movie reviews, a blog post or two a week, and assorted other articles. I must slow down now, which is why I'm taking what I like to call \\"a leave of presence.\\"What in the world is a leave of presence? It means I am not going away. My intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me. What's more, I'll be able at last to do what I've always fantasized about doing: reviewing only the movies I want to review.At the same time, I am re-launching the new and improved Rogerebert.com and taking ownership of the site under a separate entity,, run by me, my beloved wife, Chaz, and our brilliant friend, Josh Golden of. Stepping away from the day-to-day grind will enable me to continue as a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, and roll out other projects under the Ebert brand in the coming year.Ebertfest, my annual film festival, celebrating its 15th year, will continue at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, my alma mater and home town, April 17-21. In response to your repeated requests to bring back the TV show \\"At the Movies,\\" I am launching a fundraising campaign via Kickstarter in the next couple of weeks. And gamers beware, I am even thinking about a movie version of a video game or mobile app. Once completed, you can engage me in debate on whether you think it is art.And I continue to cooperate with the talented filmmaker Steve James on the bio-documentary he, Steve Zaillian and Martin Scorsese are making about my life. I am humbled that anyone would even think to do it, but I am also grateful.Of course, there will be some changes. The immediate reason for my \\"leave of presence\\" is my health. The \\"painful fracture\\" that made it difficult for me to walk has recently been revealed to be a cancer. It is being treated with radiation, which has made it impossible for me to attend as many movies as I used to. I have been watching more of them on screener copies that the studios have been kind enough to send to me. My friend and colleague Richard Roeper and other critics have stepped up and kept the newspaper and website current with reviews of all the major releases. So we have and will continue to go on.At this point in my life, in addition to writing about movies, I may write about what it's like to cope with health challenges and the limitations they can force upon you. It really stinks that the cancer has returned and that I have spent too many days in the hospital. So on bad days I may write about the vulnerability that accompanies illness. On good days, I may wax ecstatic about a movie so good it transports me beyond illness.I'll also be able to review classics for my \\"Great Movies\\" collection, which has produced three books and could justify a fourth.For now, I am throwing myself into Ebert Digital and the redesigned, highly interactive and searchable Rogerebert.com. You'll learn more about its exciting new features on April 9 when the site is launched. In addition to housing an archive of more than 10,000 of my reviews dating back to 1967 we will also feature reviews written by other critics. You may disagree with them like you have with me, but will nonetheless appreciate what they bring to the party. Some I recruited from the ranks of my Far Flung Correspondents, an inspiration I had four years ago when I noticed how many of the comments on my blog came from foreign lands and how knowledgeable they were about cinema.We'll be recruiting more critics and it is my hope that some of the writers I have admired over the years will be among them. We'll offer many more reviews of Indie, foreign, documentary and restored classic revivals. As the space between broadcast television, cable and the internet morph into a hybrid of content, we will continue to spotlight the musings of Pulitzer Prize-winning TV critic Tom Shales, as well as the blog \\"Scanners\\" by Jim Emerson, who I first met at Microsoft when he edited Cinemania. The Ebert Club newsletter, under editor Marie Haws of Vancouver, will be expanded to give its thousands of subscribers even bigger and better benefits.For years I devoutly took every one of my tear sheets, folded them and added them to a pile on my desk. The photo above shows the height of that pile in 1985 as it appeared on the cover of my first book about the movies published by my old friends John McMeel and Donna Martin of Andrews & McMeel. Today, because of technology, the opportunities to become bigger, better and reach more people are piling up too. The fact that we're re-launching the site now, in the midst of other challenges, should give you an idea how important Rogerebert.com and Ebert Digital are to Chaz and me. I hope you'll stop by, and look for me. I'll be there.So on this day of reflection I say again, thank you for going on this journey with me. I'll see you at the movies. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Legendary movie critic Roger Ebert reminisces about his love for food and the Steak ’n Shake, even though he is no longer able to eat.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (Choose from:  -- negative  -- positive).","output":"Title: Review - \\"Ad Astra\\" When it comes to science fiction cinema, there's a certain standard that audiences have come to expect. Stunning visuals, gripping storyline, significant character development, and above all, some genuine thrill. Unfortunately, James Gray's Ad Astra not only fails to meet those expectations but also descends into an abysmal narrative abyss, rendering it a painful viewing experience.  Boasting a cast led by Brad Pitt in the role of astronaut Roy McBride, Ad Astra offers a certain promise before unravelling its cloth of disappointment. Pitt delivers a tediously monotonous performance. He certainly tried resurrecting the frozen script with a few sprinkling of emotion, but even the charm of his scintillating blue eyes seemed lost in the zero-gravity vacuum of Space. The film revolves around the trite and worn-out idea of a son embarking on a journey to save humanity and find his long-lost father. To make it even more predictable, the writers sprinkled in a narrative structure revolving around self-discovery and redemption. The script, supposedly elite by Hollywood standards, is quite pedestrian, drowns in its ambition, and leaves the viewer sorely disappointed. The film also seems to suffer from an existential crisis, unable to decide whether it is a dense philosophical discourse or a frenzied space adventure. The lifeless dialogue and sleep-inducing soliloquies made it hard to connect with any character on an emotional level. It was like watching the endless expanse of space – cold and unfeeling. Even the usually reliable Tommy Lee Jones, who played Clifford McBride, Roy's lost father, seems underwhelming. Despite his extended screen-time, his character is neither fully developed nor compelling. Instead, his character’s motivations felt forced and hard to comprehend.  The narrative consistently hammers in the theme of isolation, which unfortunately expands to the audience's connection with the film. The cinematography is remarkable, with some truly awe-inspiring visuals, but it feels squandered when paralleled with such a lackluster narrative. It’s like standing in front of an exceptionally painted yet utterly meaningless canvas. Ruth Negga's short role is one of the very few highlights of the film. She shines and delivers an emotionally charged performance in her limited screen time. However, one actor’s shining moments cannot carry an entire movie, and Negga's talents were wasted in an underwritten role and an underwhelming narrative. Don’t get me wrong; the film did have a handful of thrilling moments. The lunar rover chase sequence was undeniably gripping, and the scenes involving the space creatures were genuinely terrifying. However, these instances were dipped in the chaos of the overstuffed plot and overburdened narrative, truly delineating the saying – too many cooks spoil the broth. In conclusion, Ad Astra seems more like an ostentatious Hollywood drama in the disguise of a sci-fi movie. It attempts to dive into profound philosophical ruminations but leaves the viewer cold and unaffected, lost and stranded in its emotional void. The imbalance between its breathtaking visuals and a stunted narrative echo an unfortunate disproportion that is impossible to ignore. Ad Astra, striving to reach the stars, falls dishearteningly short, leaving this viewer, at least, utterly unimpressed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To find the total value of these terms, -36*y - 768*y = (-36 - 768)*y = -804*y. Now the equation is: 584*y = -804*y - 100794 + 17514. Step 2: Simplify the equation. Rearrange the equation by moving the terms with the variable y on the left side and the constants on the right side by adding 804*y to both sides of the equation. 584*y + 804*y = -100794 + 17514. Combine the terms with the variable y: (584 + 804)*y = 1388*y. Now the equation is: 1388*y = -100794 + 17514. Step 3: Isolate y. Subtract 17514 from -100794: -100794 + 17514 = -83300. Now the equation is: 1388*y = -83300. Step 4: Solve for y. Divide both sides of the equation by 1388 to find the value of y: y = -83300 / 1388. y = -83300 / 1388 ≈ -60.

Which group of larvae had more somatic mutations?  The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, group L of larvae had more somatic mutations compared to group D. This is because group L displayed all kinds of mutations, while group D did not. Since somatic mutations are a type of mutation that occurs in the body cells, it is clear that group L would have exhibited more somatic mutations than group D."},{"instruction":"Information:  - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\"  - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633  26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy.  - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence.  - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource).  - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power.  - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility).   - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna.  - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).  - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.  - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome  - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.  - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).

Article: The stretch works best if you lie on the floor; do not perform the stretch lying on a bed or sofa. Rest on your back and stretch your legs out, letting your heels rest on the ground.  If the surface you’re lying on is hard or cold, you can lay down a blanket or a yoga mat. For a different angle to the stretch, lie on your stomach and prop yourself up on your elbows. Repeat the rest of the stretch motions, but keep your weight on your elbows and tuck your knee beneath your torso. For example, bend your left knee and draw it up towards your abdomen. While doing this, point your left foot towards the right side of your body. Reach down with your right hand and grasp your left ankle.  If you find this pose uncomfortable, you can also perform this stretch with your right foot resting on an inflated stability ball. Use your heel to pull the ball towards your hips when stretching your piriformis.  You can perform the stretch by bending either your right or left knee. It doesn’t matter which you start with. Once you have grabbed your left knee with your right hand, place your left hand just behind your left knee. You’ll use this hand to exert gentle pressure on your leg as you stretch the piriformis muscle. Exert a steady pressure on your left knee to move it gradually towards your right shoulder. Avoid pulling your knee sideways across your body. Stretch the piriformis slowly and gently. Hold the stretch for at least 5 seconds, and then release.  Keep your pelvis flat on the ground while stretching your piriformis. Do not roll your hips in the direction you’re pulling your knee. If you’re performing this stretch while propped on your elbows, tuck your left knee under your body and lean towards your left side. Then stretch your piriformis by leaning your weight forward over your elbows. This time, bend your right knee and grab the right ankle with your left hand. Place your right hand behind your knee and gently stretch the knee towards your left shoulder. As you improve your piriformis flexibility, you can hold the stretch for as long as 1 minute. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article provides instructions for a stretching exercise that targets the piriformis muscle.

After high school, he wanted to join the U. S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons  to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee  of his \\"plane\\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined   1,500 for breaking the law about air safety. When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Ted answered, \\"A man can't just sit around and do nothing; he should have his dream and go for it. \\" Why couldn't Ted join the American Air Force? A) Because he didn't finish high school. B) Because his parents stopped him. C) Because there was problem with his eyes. D) Because he was too short. A:","output":"Ted couldn't join the American Air Force because there was a problem with his eyes (Option C). His poor eyesight prevented him from being accepted into the U.S. Air Force, but this setback didn't stop him from pursuing his dream of flying.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ireland had been at war since the rebellion of 1641, with most of the island being controlled by the Irish Confederates. In 1648, in the wake of Charles I's arrest, and the growing threat to them from the armies of the English Parliament, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists. The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under Ormonde attempted to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding Dublin, but were routed at the battle of Rathmines by a Parliamentary army commanded by Colonel Michael Jones. As the former Member of Parliament Admiral Robert Blake blockaded Prince Rupert of the Rhine's fleet in Kinsale, Oliver Cromwell was able to land at Dublin on 15 August 1649 with the army to quell Royalist alliance in Ireland. The alliance, which was a compromise that gave command of the Irish Confederate forces to the English Royalists, was very shaky from the start, with many Confederates unhappy with the leadership of Ormonde. Indeed, the Confederates had fought a mini civil war among themselves in 1648 over this alliance, with Owen Roe O'Neill's Ulster army leaving the Confederation and only re-joining it after Cromwell had actually landed in Ireland. Partly as a result of this disunity, the Irish/Royalist coalition was driven from eastern Ireland by Cromwell, who beat down all resistance by his skill, and even more by his ruthless severity, in a brief campaign of nine months . At the end of May 1650 Cromwell turned over his command in Ireland to Henry Ireton and returned to England. It took two more years of prolonged siege and guerrilla warfare, before the last major Irish resistance was ended, after the fall of Galway in late 1652. The last Confederate Catholic troops surrendered in mid-1653. How many years between Cromwell landing in Dublin and Cromwell turning over his command?","output":"Oliver Cromwell landed in Dublin on August 15, 1649, and he turned over his command to Henry Ireton at the end of May 1650.

And the answer is?","output":"In Greek mythology, the mother of Oedipus was Queen Jocasta, also known as Iocaste or Epicaste. Jocasta was the wife of King Laius, who ruled over the ancient city-state of Thebes. Both Laius and Jocasta were  descendants of the house of Cadmus, the legendary founder of Thebes. Jocasta was the daughter of Menoeceus, and was either the sister or cousin of Creon, depending on different mythological sources. The story of Jocasta, Oedipus, and King Laius is a tragic one, and central to the famous play \\"Oedipus Rex\\" (or \\"Oedipus the King\\") written by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles. The tragedy begins when King Laius and Queen Jocasta receive a prophecy that their newborn son, Oedipus, will grow up to kill his father and marry his mother. Horrified, Laius orders a servant to take the infant Oedipus to the nearby Mount Cithaeron and abandon him there to die. However, the servant cannot bring himself to kill the baby and instead gives him to a shepherd from the city-state of Corinth who in turn presents the child to the childless King Polybus and Queen Merope, who then raise Oedipus as their own son. As Oedipus grows up, he learns about the prophecy from an oracle and, not knowing that he is adopted, believes that he might harm his adoptive parents. To avoid the tragic fate, he leaves Corinth and travels to Thebes. On the way, he unknowingly encounters his birth father, King Laius, and due to a dispute at a crossroads, Oedipus fulfills the first part of the prophecy by killing him.  Upon reaching Thebes, Oedipus solves the riddle of the Sphinx, who has been tormenting the city, and as a reward he is made the new king and marries the widowed Queen Jocasta – his own mother – thus fulfilling the second part of the prophecy. Oedipus and Jocasta have four children together: two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, and two daughters, Antigone and Ismene. Years later, Oedipus learns the truth about his parentage, and the tragic consequences of the prophecy are realized. Devastated upon discovering that she married her own son and realizing the depth of the prophecy's fulfillment, Jocasta takes her own life by hanging herself. In his anguish, Oedipus blinds himself, and eventually leaves Thebes, setting the stage for the continuing story of his children in the subsequent plays of the Theban cycle, \\"Antigone,\\" \\"Oedipus at Colonus,\\" and \\"Seven Against Thebes.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Libyan dictator had a voracious sexual appetite and was so addicted to anti-impotence Viagra pills a nurse told him to cut down his intake. The sordid world of the despot who was killed last month in the country's uprising, has been revealed by his manservant of seven years. Voracious: Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi lived a life of extravagance and sexual addiction. Faisal, a young chef, cooked Andrew a 'traditional' dinner of tabouli, hummus and couscous when the prince met the Arab leader at the villa of one of his female friends. Later Andrew, who's office has confirmed he dined with Gadaffi in November 2008, told Faisal it was the finest meal he had ever had and posed for a picture with him. Trade ambassador: Prince Andrew had a meal with Gadaffi in 2008. The aide, now 29, said the royal trade ambassador discussed relations between Libya and Britain and an oil contract. What Andrew was unaware of was Gaddafi's penchant for young women - many of whom were his bodyguards, according to Faisal. He said: There were four or sometimes five women each day. They had just become a habit to Gadaffi. 'They would go into his bedroom, he would have his way with them and then he would come out like he had just blown his nose.' Faisal, on leave from prison for the Muslim holiday of Eid, became friends with the bodyguards who were known as the 'Nuns of the Revolution'. He told the Sunday Times: They all had sex with Gadaffi. The more canny of them became wealthy from his gifts of villas or large sums of cash.' Faisal claimed that some of the women he bedded suffered so badly 'they went immediately from his bedroom to the hospital' to be treated for internal injuries. His addiction to Viagra, said the aide, was so extensive that his Ukrainian nurse urged to him to reduce the number of pills he swallowed every day. Gadaffi picked up victims at his former alma mater, Tripoli University, where he gave lectures and then led the young women to a nearby room whose only furniture was a double bed. Faisal claimed that another aide was once sent to a sex district of Paris, to buy a machine that Gadaffi used to apparently lengthen his penis. The despot was vain about his looks and demanded the aide dye his hair,  cover up his baldness and use make-up and treatments with green tea to hide his wrinkles. Faisal, who became a favourite of the dictator with his own house and car, sprayed a French-made lotion on the front of Gadaffi's head so his receding hairline would not be obvious. The aide was forced to be his servant after death threats were made against his family unless he obeyed. Faisal was captured by anti-Gadaffi forces but is unlike to be charged.

Die in Neapel verbrachten Jahre ( bis 1340) hatten großen Einfluss auf die persönliche und intellektuelle Entwicklung Boccaccios. Translate this to English?","output":"The years spent in Naples (until 1340) had a great influence on Boccaccio's personal and intellectual development. Giovanni Boccaccio was an Italian writer, poet, and scholar who lived during the 14th century (1313-1375). He is well-known for his masterpiece, \\"The Decameron,\\" a collection of 100 short stories that remains an important literary work in Western history. Boccaccio's years in Naples (until 1340) had a significant impact on his personal and intellectual growth. It was during this time that Boccaccio became acquainted with the intellectual and artistic circles of Naples, which was a thriving center for culture, learning, and commerce. Naples was part of the Kingdom of Sicily and was governed by the Angevin dynasty, which had strong ties to the French culture. This exposure to different cultures enriched Boccaccio's knowledge and would later be reflected in his works. While in Naples, Boccaccio studied law and pursued literary studies under the guidance of some eminent teachers. He was deeply influenced by the writings of classical authors such as Dante Alighieri, Virgil, Ovid, and Petrarch. Boccaccio's passion for literature and his eagerness to learn also led him to explore different genres and texts, which contributed to the development of his unique narrative style. During his time in this vibrant city, Boccaccio also developed important connections with the Neapolitan nobility. He became acquainted with important figures of the time, such as King Robert of Anjou, Queen Giovanna I, and Niccolò Acciaiuoli, a prominent nobleman. These connections would not only provide him with protection and patronage but would also serve as an inspiration for his literary works, as he often drew from his real-life experiences and encounters. Being in Naples also had a significant impact on Boccaccio's personal life. It is said that while in the city, he met his muse and the love of his life, Fiammetta, who is thought to have been a noblewoman named Maria d'Aquino, an illegitimate daughter of King Robert. Boccaccio's love for Fiammetta inspired several of his literary works, including \\"Filocopo,\\" \\"Ameto,\\" \\"La caccia di Diana,\\" and most notably, \\"The Decameron,\\" where she appears as a character. In conclusion, Boccaccio's years in Naples until 1340 were crucial for his personal and intellectual development. During this time, he absorbed various cultural influences, honed his literary skills under the guidance of prominent teachers, established connections with influential figures, and delved into profound emotions fueled by love. These factors undoubtedly contributed to shaping his literary genius and defining his status as one of the greatest writers of all time."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Information:  - Jan Maria Fleischmann ( July 6 , 1885 -- September 23 , 1939 ) was a Czechoslovak ice hockey player who competed in the 1924 Winter Olympics . In 1924 he participated with the Czechoslovak team in the first Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament .  - The 1924 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris, France. It was the second time Paris hosted the games, after 1900. The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and Paris was selected ahead of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Prague, and Rome. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921.  - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means.  - Haute-Savoie (or ' or ') is a department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of eastern France, bordering both Switzerland and Italy. Its capital is Annecy. To the north is Lake Geneva and Switzerland; to the south and southeast are the Mont Blanc and Aravis mountain ranges. The French entrance to the Mont Blanc Tunnel to Italy is in Haute-Savoie. It is noted for winter sports; the first Winter Olympic Games were held at Chamonix in 1924.  - Mont Blanc or Monte Bianco, both meaning \\"White Mountain\\", is the highest mountain in the Alps and the highest in Europe after the Caucasus peaks.  It rises above sea level and is ranked 11th in the world in topographic prominence.  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - The 1924 Winter Olympics, officially known as the I Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Iers Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), were a winter multi-sport event which was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Originally called \\"Semaine Internationale des Sports d'Hiver\\" (\\"International Winter Sports Week\\") and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions were held at the foot of Mont Blanc in Chamonix, and Haute-Savoie, France between January 25 and February 5, 1924. The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee, and were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games.  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, more commonly known simply as Chamonix (formerly also spelled Chamounix), is a commune in the Haute-Savoie département in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France.

Write some highlights for the following article: Former French President Jacques Chirac was found guilty Thursday on corruption charges stemming from his time as mayor of Paris and given a two-year suspended sentence, a court in the French capital announced. He was convicted of breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and illegal use of influence, the Paris Court's press office said. Chirac did not attend the trial, which was held from September 5-23, due to his medical condition, which doctors described as a \\"severe\\" and \\"irreversible\\" neurological problem. In a statement released later Thursday, Chirac, 79, said that while he \\"categorically refuse(s) this ruling,\\" he would not appeal the verdict. \\"Unfortunately I no longer have all the strength necessary to carry the fight for truth by myself and face of new panel of judges,\\" Chirac said in the statement. \\"I also realize that what is at stake is not only the honour of a man, but the dignity of the presidential office.\\" An aide to French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Elysee, or presidential palace, would not comment on the verdict, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. Francois Hollande, the presidential candidate from the Socialist party, said Thursday that \\"justice has been done, and it had to be done, so that there would be no sense of impunity.\\" However, he said, he did have some sympathy for Chirac. \\"Although the sentence is severe, it is both criminal and moral, and it affects him,\\" Hollande added, according to Le Monde. Ecologist party presidential candidate Eva Joly declared that justice has been done. \\"No citizen is above the law, if we want to reestablish trust in the justice system and democracy,\\" she said in a statement on her website. She also called on Chirac to resign from France's Constitutional Council, a body that decides if proposed laws are constitutional. Chirac and other former French presidents automatically serve on the council. Jerome Karsenti, of the anti-corruption group Anticor, lauded the ruling as \\"a historic decision and extremely important for the future of democracy. It's a message to all politicians.\\" Chirac was mayor of Paris, from 1977 to 1995, before he became president. He had immunity from prosecution during the 12 years he was president of France, from 1995 to 2007. He was accused -- along with the other defendants -- of using public money to pay people to work for his political party, the RPR, and to pay others to perform jobs that did not really exist. Former French Prime Minister Alain Juppe was sentenced in December 2004 for his role in the affair. After Chirac left office as president, he made it known he was available to answer any questions on the matter. He always denied wrongdoing. The city of Paris dropped a civil suit against Chirac after he and his party paid back about 3 million. Some in France praised the court's decision. \\"Finally, the justice of the Republic has come,\\" said a post from Pierre-Marie Muraz on Le Monde's website. It shows that \\"no, we are not a banana republic, but a democracy, and proud of it!\\" Others were not pleased. \\"Who are we kidding? Let's review: Politician and union leaders have flouted the country's rules for years, enriching themselves and betraying the trust of their citizens, and when 20 years later we relax, we hand out a penalty or a suspended sentence, a certain political class and the complacent media congratulate themselves on the exemplary justice!\\" posted someone with the user name \\"pas dupe\\" -- which means \\"not fooled\\" in English.

Tommy's unique intelligence has always kept him curious and engaged with the wonders of the universe, but has also isolated him from his peers. He finds solace in spending his days tinkering with gadgets, watching sci-fi movies, and gazing at the stars through his telescope. His only companion is his quirky and lovable dog, Astro. One unusual evening, Tommy stumbles upon a mysterious object that crash-lands in his backyard – a meteorite that later turns out to be an extraterrestrial pod. As Tommy cautiously investigates the wreck, he encounters an Alien named Zylar, who has come to Earth to escape from his malicious planet and seek refuge. At first, both Tommy and Zylar are frightened of each other. However, they soon befriend one another after realizing that they share a love for learning and a similar sense of humor. Together, they embark on adventures and conduct scientific research on Earth, while Zylar teaches Tommy about the various galaxies and advanced technology from his home planet. As their friendship grows, a covert government agency led by the enigmatic Agent Black becomes aware of Zylar's existence. They quickly dispatch their men in pursuit of Zylar, with the ultimate goal of capturing the Alien for sinister purposes. This reveal sheds light on unseen dark forces trying to control the universe from beyond Earth. Tommy, Zylar, and Astro team up to outwit and outrun the relentless agency agents, experiencing thrilling chases, narrow escapes, and unimaginable dangers. As their bond strengthens, Tommy and Zylar uncover a despicable plan by Agent Black to harness Zylar's advanced alien technology to create weapons of mass destruction that would endanger both Zylar's home planet and Earth. In a race against time, Tommy and Zylar devise a plan to expose Agent Black and the agency's corrupt agenda. They enlist the help of a group of outcast school friends – each offering a unique skill set – that Tommy had previously ignored due to his introverted nature.

Passage: The Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miamis \\"Big Three\\" coming together during the course of the 2010–11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \\"soft\\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility. Output:","output":"Part #1: Creating questions from a given passage that involve complex reasoning. Usage: What combination of events led to the Mavs winning their first ever NBA title in 2011? Explanation: This question requires examining multiple parts of the passage, such as the Mavericks comebacks, strategic changes, and key players' performances to understand that the team's overall efforts and adaptations contributed to their victory. Part #2: Generating questions that require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Usage: How much did Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry collectively score in the final game of the 2011 NBA Finals? Explanation: This question requires looking at two different parts of the passage: Nowitzki scored 21 points, while Terry scored 27 points off the bench in the final game. The answer is obtained by adding these numbers together (21+27=48). Part #3: Using a variety of reasoning types and answer types in questions. Usage: In which game of the series did both the Mavericks and Heat break 100 points, and what was the final score? Explanation: This question utilizes numerical reasoning and requires the respondent to identify the specific game (Game 5) and remember the final score (112–103). The answer type is a combination of a number (game) and a span (final score). Part #4: Creating questions with answer type \\"number\\" and starting them with \\"How many\\". Usage: How many points did Nowitzki average per game during the 2011 NBA Finals series? Explanation: This question meets the criteria of starting with \\"How many\\" and having a numerical answer type by asking for Nowitzki's average points per game. The answer is 26 points. Part #5: Encouraging more challenging questions and using different combinations of arithmetic operations. Usage: How many more points did the Mavericks score in total in games 4, 5, and 6 compared to games 1, 2, and 3? Explanation: This question requires complex reasoning and multiple arithmetic operations: adding the scores of games 4, 5, and 6 (total: 329 points), adding the scores of games 1, 2, and 3 (total: 262 points), and then calculating the difference between the two sums (329 - 262 = 67 points)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: The Bad Santa’s Christmas sack is coming but this year it is not only the usual suspects who are feeling the big chill. By seasonal custom it is the humble basement bosses in the Premier League who check whether their P45s come through the letter box with the greetings cards. Now, if not facing festive dismissal quite yet, one or two of the big boys are beginning to sense that the skids could be under them. Yaya Toure, Raheem Sterling and Lukas Podolski looks dejected after a week of disappointment in Europe. Europe is the destination of choice for the major clubs but when Champions League matches go the way they have in the past few days these can be perilous journeys for the managers. Who would have thought, as recently as a week ago, that Manuel Pellegrini, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers would be planning extra helpings not of turkey and Christmas pudding but hard tack. Let us consider them in turn:. SENOR PELLEGRINI spent the latter part of this Wednesday evening confessing that his costly Manchester City have lost nerve, faith, confidence and, potentially most damaging of all for himself, trust. Just one win in five matches speaks to the truth of that self-wounding assessment and had that solitary victory not come against Manchester United then Pellegrini would be on even slipperier ground already. Manuel Pellegrini has won just one of his last five games as Manchester City have started to stumble. Seydou Doumbia (centre) did the damage with CSKA Moscow's goals in their 2-1 win over Manchester City. How far have the English champions fallen? As low as losing at home to a distinctly ordinary CSKA Moscow and having two of their prima donnas sent off during that humiliating process. Pellegrini answers to foreign owners who regard the Champions League as the Holy Grail. City captain Vincent Kompany looks disappointed at the end of the defeat by CSKA Moscow. City’s prospects of surviving a relatively easy group depend now on Bayern Munich, who have already qualified, either sending their reserves to the Etihad or treating that fixture as a practice match. Feliz Navidad, Manuel. MONSIEUR WENGER whiled away his Tuesday evening watching Arsenal throw away a three-goal lead at home against the Belgian lightweights of Anderlecht. The boos rained down in North London as he turned away from the scene of that debacle. The fans, let alone the directors, can see that this team are, quite literally, defenceless. Even the most respectful of former players are beginning to query why the manager has not bought top-class centre-backs. It looked as if Arsene Wenger would have an easy night when Arsenal went 3-0 up against Anderlecht... But the Arsenal manager could hardly look as his side threw away their three-goal lead at the Emirates. That question would be asked with greater urgency right now if Arsenal were not still in position to go through to the last 16. For the moment, it is being conveniently forgotten that Wenger’s esoteric ensemble would be scrambling to advance had they not been fortunate enough to pull a last-gasp victory out of a wretched performance at Anderlecht in the preceding match. As it is they are looking at second place, yet again, with its implicit danger of a deadly draw in the next round. And, like City, they have not started the Premier League season at all well. Arsenal pair Santi Cazorla and Lukas Podolski look dejected after throwing away a three goal lead. The Arsenal board are historically patient and respectful of Wenger, who achieved so much in his early years there. But for how much longer? Joyeux Noel, Arsene. MISTER RODGERS, meanwhile, splashed through only the first half of his sudden watershed on Tuesday. By scorning the highest European tradition with his decision to send a weakened Liverpool team into Real Madrid’s fabled Bernabeu, this manager has impaled himself on the imperative of his rested first-teamers defeating Chelsea at Anfield this weekend. Or at least avoiding defeat. If Liverpool lose this one – and slump even further adrift of the Premier League leaders – the carrion will make a meal of Rodgers come Saturday lunchtime. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the Liverpool side he sent out to face Real Madrid. If so, that feast will come early. Rodgers was so recently hailed as the saviour of Anfield that a descent into doubt this soon seemed impossible. He is bringing it in part upon himself. Far be it from a sportswriter to advise a manager to turn off the quotes tap but Rodgers really needs to put thinking time between brain and mouth. As an example of his tendency to damage himself, how about this cracker at the dinner in May at which the Uruguayan Dracula of the game was dubiously installed as our Footballer of the Year: ‘I am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.’ In the end Rodgers and Liverpool only lost to the European champions by one goal. Nor, judging from his jocular appearance at subsequent training, does he understand even now the implications of a club of Liverpool’s European pedigree playing for damage limitation rather than glory at the Bernabeu. Among the chorus of disapproval, one Anfield legend asked: ‘What is the point of making qualification for next season’s Champions League the priority when you are playing Real Madrid this week?’ Rodgers, in training with Glen Johnson, appeared to be over the Madrid defeat at training on Thursday morning. That is not a question which will sit comfortably on his CV if ever he tries to pursue his professed ambition to manage in the upper echelons of La Liga. Worse still if Liverpool go out to – er - Basle. Merry Christmas, Brendan. Despite being held to a draw in Slovenia by the moderates of Maribor, Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho is iceberg proof this winter. Not only is he virtually certain of reaching the Champions League last 16 but Chelsea are top of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho is sitting pretty in Europe despite a midweek draw and his team are flying high in the league. However, the English game at large needs higher quality performances from Chelsea as much as from City, Arsenal and Liverpool... and Manchester United for that matter. This Champions League week – and not for the first time - has not cast the Premier League in a flattering light. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic celebrates his goal with teammates during the draw with Maribor. The best league in the world? Not even close unless the marquee clubs raise their game considerably, starting this weekend with Liverpool and Chelsea putting on a spectacle, Manchester City and United dazzling QPR and Crystal Palace respectively and Arsenal grafting substance onto style at Swansea. Highlights:","output":"- Manchester City, Arsenal, and Liverpool face various challenges after disappointing performances in the UEFA Champions League. - Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini admits the loss of nerve, faith, confidence, and trust after the team won just one of the last five matches. - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger faces criticism for not buying top-class center-backs, as the team struggles with their defense. - Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is under pressure after sending a weakened team against Real Madrid and must avoid defeat against Chelsea to regain trust. - All three marquee clubs must raise their game to improve their standings in the Premier League and regain their status as the top league in the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples.  Would sample B rocks have more or less chemical reactions? A:","output":"Sample B rocks, from the Atacama Desert, would have less chemical reactions compared to Sample A rocks from the Amazon Rainforest. This is because the Atacama Desert receives one of the lowest rainfalls in the world, which means less rainwater is available to pass through the soil and react chemically with the particles. Consequently, the rate of weathering in Sample B is lower than in Sample A, where high rainfall leads to a greater number of chemical reactions and an increased rate of weathering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She will be eligible for parole after she serves 35 years and sobbed in court as she addressed Cash’s parents. 'If there's anything I could do to take the pain away and bring it on myself I would,' Cullen said. 'I'm so sorry I'll never forgive myself and never expect anyone else to either.' The jury was not able to hear about Cullen's previous abuse of children while at previous day care jobs, but the judge was allowed to use the information for sentencing purposes.

In. the report he recalled how he had noticed his son lying face down in a. Pack-N-Play with labored breathing and so had rolled the baby onto his. back. Not wanting to disturb him, he had not picked him up. Ms Cullen did scoop up the sleeping. baby, however, and stepped out the front door holding him as Mr Bell pulled out of the driveway to leave.

By the time he arrived at the house,. she had already administered CPR unsuccessfully and the pair rushed to the. emergency room.

Upon our arrival, it took almost 15 minutes for the staff to acknowledge our presence and guide us to our table despite having a reservation. The overall ambiance was poor – the lighting was too dim, and tables were cramped together, making it challenging to hold a conversation without feeling like we were encroaching on our neighbors' space. The food was subpar in comparison to the praise I had read in other reviews. We started with the baked brie appetizer, which was overly greasy and lacked flavor. The bread accompanying it was slightly stale. Our entrees were nothing to write home about. I opted for the Pan-Seared Salmon, which was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. The Salmon was overcooked, dry, and lacked seasoning, while the garlic mashed potatoes were bland and lacked the promised garlic flavor. The only saving grace was the green beans, which were cooked just right with a slight crunch. My partner's Chicken Marsala was similarly lackluster – the sauce was thin and watery, not the rich and velvety Marsala sauce one would expect. The chicken was rubbery and appeared to be of low quality. We decided to skip dessert as we lost confidence in the kitchen's ability to deliver. Our server, although polite, appeared to be overwhelmed and inattentive. Drinks took far too long to be served, and we had to remind about our order twice. The overall service was slow and seemed disorganized. To top it off, the prices at The Gourmet Bistro were steep, considering the disappointing food quality and poor overall experience. I was expecting a fine dining experience for the price, but unfortunately, what we received was closer to that of a mediocre chain restaurant. In summary, my experience at The Gourmet Bistro was a letdown. I cannot recommend this restaurant to others based on the issues in the ambiance, food quality, service, and high prices. As someone who had high hopes for a lovely evening out, I regret choosing this establishment and can only hope that others heed my warning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CONTEXT: 16 de mayo de 2013 Una nueva polémica se desató en Costa Rica luego de que los medios de comunicación de ese país informaran que la presidenta Laura Chinchilla había viajado a Perú para una actividad privada, y se reveló que la mandataria fue en una avioneta cuyo dueño está siendo investigado por tráfico internacional de drogas. El hecho llevó a que el ministro de Comunicación de ese país renunciara de su cargo durante una rueda de prensa. Chinchilla viajó a Perú para participar en la boda del hijo del vicepresidente costarricense Luis Liberman en Perú. La prensa tica reveló que el vuelo de Chinchilla fue \\"regalado\\" por una empresa de capital canadiense, la cual se dedica a la extracción de petróleo. Francisco Chacón, ahora ex ministro de Comunicación del gobierno de Chinchilla, argumentó durante la rueda de prensa en la cual puso su renuncia que \\"la compañía que yo defendí como una compañía incuestionable resultó no serlo\\". Chacón reveló el nombre de un exfutbolista costarricense, quien labora para la empresa, que regaló el vuelo a Chinchilla. El monto del viaje de la mandataria a Perú durante los dos días que estuvo fuera del país se calcula en USD 60 000. Por ese viaje, la presidenta se encuentra siendo investigada en este momento en instancias judiciales para determinar si hay un conflicto de intereses con la empresa. El empresario que se encuentra detrás del avión en que viajó Chinchilla es el colombiano Gabriel Morales, quien se encuentra investigado por tráfico de drogas. La polémica creció cuando se reveló que la Dirección de Inteligencia y Seguridad de ese país, responsable de la seguridad de la mandataria, no revisó la avioneta en la que viajó, el piloto ni el dueño. La misma empresa facilitó el vuelo que Chinchilla realizó para participar en las honras fúnebres de Hugo Chávez en Venezuela. Por su parte, Chinchilla no se ha referido al caso; solamente aclaró que los gastos del viaje fueron pagados con su tarjeta de crédito. Las redes sociales estallaron en comentarios en crítica del actuar de Chacón y la Dirección de Inteligencia. Algunos alegaron que la mandataria incluso pudo haber sido secuestrada por no haberse seguido los protocolos de seguridad. La renuncia de Francisco Chacón es la número 15 desde que Laura Chinchilla asumió el poder en 2010. Chacón era considerado la mano derecha de la mandataria costarricense.

His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \\"Hook her up,\\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet. Cedric didn't respond. \\"I said hook her up,\\" Dorian said. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said for the third time. \\"I said hook her up!\\" Dorian screamed and Cedric jumped forward to the gurney. Coffee stain or no coffee stain, Dorian was a commanding presence. Dorian screamed  A. before Cedric jumped forward to the gurney  B. after Cedric jumped forward to the gurney  C. after Cedric died  D. not enough information","output":"A. before Cedric jumped forward to the gurney As the tension built in the room, Cedric could see that there was no time for questions or protests. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for what was to come, and started connecting the unconscious young woman to the various machines and monitoring equipment that surrounded her. His hands shook slightly, both from fear and uncertainty of the situation, as well as the concern for his friend and colleague. Dorian, meanwhile, was working furiously at the computer, typing in commands and pulling up data faster than Cedric had ever seen him work before. Something was definitely wrong, something that pushed Dorian to the edge of panic and desperation. Cedric couldn't help but wonder what could have driven Dorian to bring this woman into the lab, in the middle of the night no less, and what he hoped to accomplish with whatever risky experiments he had in mind. Once all the connections were made, Cedric glanced over at Dorian, looking for some explanation or reassurance that would ease his growing fears. Dorian must have sensed Cedric's unease because, for a brief moment, he paused and looked back at his friend. Though it was fleeting, Cedric could see a hint of vulnerability in Dorian's eyes, a silent plea for trust and support. Then, just as quickly, it was gone, and Dorian resumed his frantic work at the computer. With a final deep breath, Cedric steeled himself and started the process of initiating the experimental procedure, knowing full well that what they were doing was potentially very dangerous. There was no turning back now. His loyalty to Dorian overcame his fear and uncertainty. As the machinery whirred to life, an ominous feeling settled over the room. Cedric and Dorian had taken a dark path together, entwined in a web of uncertainty, mistrust, and potential disaster. Their shared motivations and friendship would be put to the ultimate test in the hours to come, as they worked feverishly to unravel the mystery surrounding the unconscious woman and the secrets she held."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Every artist needs a portfolio -- the place where potential buyers or clients can see your work. Luckily, the internet is making it easy as website design spaces like Wix.com, SquareSpace, and Wordpress all have templates designed for artists portfolios. All you have to do is customize the name, color, and bio, then import images or videos of your art.  Purchase a custom domain name if you are looking for professional clients. A site like www.MyPortfolio.wordpress.com looks much less professional than www.MyPortfolio.com. When done, attach this portfolio to all your social media accounts to make it easy to find. Consider printing (or drawing/designing, for memorable flair) some business cards to get the word around. Contact small galleries near you to see if you can put some work up. Look into that restaurant or coffee shop that puts work on the walls. And, if all else fails, throw your own art show. All you need is a space to hang everything, some refreshments, and friends willing to come and support you.  Try to host shows with multiple artists when possible. That way, everyone brings their own friend groups so each artist can meet new fans. You never know if you can display your work unless you ask. Don't be intimidated -- they absolute worst thing that happens is the word, \\"no.\\" Consider hosting \\"open studio\\" session once a month, where friends and curious spectators can watch you work and talk about your process. Few, if any, artists are so skilled that they can't benefit from some kind of formal instruction. Art classes can help you get past problems with your work that you haven't been able to solve on your own, identify areas in which you could improve, or just give you some direction and a regular time to devote to working on art. There are courses available for all skill levels at colleges, community centers, local arts centers, and numerous other places.  Your teacher and fellow students are essential contacts as you build your career. They can point to new opportunities, team up with you for shows, and support your work in the difficult early years when you're still unknown. Never discount a connection or friend. In the word-of-mouth driven art scene, a wide, strong social network is king. It isn't always a ton of fun, but it is absolutely essential if you intend to be a professional. No one wants to champion your art but you. And, in its own way, this is a good thing-- you no longer have to hope the \\"right\\" person shows up in your gallery. Instead, hard work online can get your work into many corners of the internet, and even make some money.  If you make smaller, sellable art pieces, consider a shop on Etsy or eBay. Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest, with their large pictures and big art networks, are great places to share and see work. Pick 1-2 social media accounts to run and stick with those. Trying to work on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. all at once is impossible to do well without spending all day on the internet. Artists need to stick together, and many of the greats have come from collectives and groups. It is no mistake that many famous artists knew each other before striking it big, and some of the greatest moments in art (Paris in the 40's, NY in the 80's) come from shared creative communities. So go to local shows, enroll in classes, and collaborate with other artists. A rising tide carries all boats, so get out there and make some waves.  If you're struggling to find a community, look online. There are tons of forums, sites, and communities (like the famous DeviantArt) that allow you to showcase work.  Pay attention to your contemporaries, supporting their own shows and work. When you are first starting out, your best network will be artists in the same situation. If you don't make art a daily priority, then it's going to be really hard to be a good artist. That is just the reality of practice-- all the talent in the world doesn't help if you don't sit down and make art. Honestly, this may require some sacrifices in terms of work hours, salary, and living situation. But if you want to be a professional artist, none of this should matter. You get to make art every single day! Always remember, especially in the early years of practice, that all of your favorite artists went through the same process.

Given the following passage  \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\",  answer the following question.

This is an example of OPTIONS: 1). learned behavior; 2). correct behavior; 3). instinct; 4). migration;","output":"To find the answer, let's analyze each option and choose the one that best describes the situation with Jake's cats. 1) Learned behavior: This implies that the cats have learned to associate a specific stimulus (the sound of the electric can opener) with a particular outcome (getting food). 2) Correct behavior: This refers to an action or response that is considered appropriate or suitable in a given context. In this case, the cats' behavior is not necessarily correct as they are coming running for corn, not their usual cat food. 3) Instinct: This refers to an innate, natural, or hardwired behavior that animals are born with and do not have to learn. The cats in this scenario have learned to associate the sound of the can opener with food, so it is not an instinctual behavior. 4) Migration: This refers to periodic, usually seasonal, movement of animals from one region to another. This option is not related to the situation of the cats and the can opener at all. After evaluating each option, we can conclude that the best answer to describe the cats' behavior in this situation is: 1) learned behavior. The cats have learned to associate the sound of the electric can opener with getting food, so they come running each time they hear it, regardless of the type of canned food being opened."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Lester  for the following movie plot:  Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a 42-year-old father, husband and advertising executive who serves as the film's narrator. Lester's relationship with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), an ambitious realtor who feels that she is unsuccessful at fulfilling her potential, is strained. His 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is unhappy and struggling with self-esteem issues. Lester himself is a self-described loser: boring, faceless and easy to forget. Lester is reinvigorated, however, when he meets Jane's friend and classmate, the egotistical Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a high school basketball game. Lester immediately develops an obvious infatuation with Angela, much to his daughter's embarrassment. Throughout the film, Lester has fantasies involving a sexually aggressive Angela and red rose petals. The Burnhams' new neighbors are Col. Frank Fitts, USMC (Chris Cooper), his distracted wife Barbara (Allison Janney), and his camcorder-obsessed son Ricky (Wes Bentley). When confronted with the gay couple living two doors down, Col. Fitts displays a distinctly bigoted attitude.Over the course of a few days, each of the Burnhams individually makes a life-changing choice. Carolyn meets real estate rival Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) for a business lunch and ends up beginning an affair with him, and later takes up shooting lessons (a suggestion of Kane's). Lester blackmails his boss Brad Dupree (Barry Del Sherman) for 60,000, quits his job, and takes up low-pressure employment as a burger-flipper at a fast food chain. He continues to liberate himself by trading in his Toyota Camry for his dream car, a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, starts working out to impress Angela, and starts smoking a genetically enhanced form of marijuana. Jane, while growing distant from Angela, develops a romantic relationship with Ricky, having bonded over what he considers to be his most beautiful camcorder footage he has ever filmed, that of a plastic grocery bag dancing in the wind.

Suddenly she receives an urgent call on her monitor from none other than the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin). He informs her that a young scientist named Durand-Durand went missing sometime during a mission to the North Star and is believed to have landed somewhere in the Tau Ceti star system. Not much is known about this region of space-- the President worries that Durand's invention, the positronic ray, may fall into the hands of a primitive culture; beings who might seek to use this technology as a weapon and launch an intergalactic war. Since the Earth, free of all conflict for centuries, lacks military and police personnel, the President tasks Barbarella with a mission to find the scientist. He teleports her some weapons and a device that will signal the presence of Durand-Durand. The latter has a \\"tonguebox\\" incorporated in its design which can translate any language.Barbarella spends most of the journey to Tau Ceti in suspended animation. She awakens just in time to lose control of her spacecraft and crash land on Planet 16, which her spaceship informs her contains an atmosphere similar to Earth's. She changes into a new outfit to explore the arctic terrain. The first humanoids she meets are a pair of twin girls-- they jabber to her excitedly in a language she can't understand. Before she can adjust her tonguebox, one of them knocks Barbarella unconscious with a piece of ice. The girls then pull the dazed explorer along in their sled, which is attached to a manta ray-like creature that glides across the ice.The girls arrive with Barbarella at the wreck of another craft where several other sets of twin children are sheltered and indigo-blue bunny rabbits abound.

Do this for at least 30 minutes to work your shoulders and arms and burn approximately 150 calories. Instead of sitting on your knees and leaning forward, you can stand straight and squat, trying to stay balanced. Apply your cleaning product, brush the toilet and wipe clean. Just like sweeping the floor, you should flex your stomach and oblique muscles and keep your back straight. Pull as far away as possible and squat, rather than bend, to pick up the leaves. This activity can be extended to other garden activities, such as mowing the lawn, flower planting, composting or general gardening. These activities, when done for at least 1/2 hour, will result in burning between 150 and 190 calories. Try to keep your back straight, as many people can end up with lower back strain. Moving furniture in good form, by bending your knees and straightening your back, is a form of weightlifting. Move each piece of furniture slightly and vacuum behind and replace it again. Use large sweeping motions and smaller motions. Reach up high with your vacuum extension. Vacuuming a house can burn approximately 80 calories, where moving furniture can burn over 200 calories. Use a knee pad or do deep squats while you reach the corners with a cleaning product and a brush. Mopping the floors burns just a portion of the 190 calories you can burn by hand-cleaning 1 floor. Grab a sponge, some mild liquid detergent, water and a bucket and wash all areas of the car. Use long sweeping motions to get hard to reach places and squat down to clean tires and the running board. Cleaning your car by hand can burn approximately 150 calories and work your arms, core muscles, and legs. Fill a bathtub with water, laundry detergent and dirty clothes. Rub the clothes against themselves and each other for 10 to 20 minutes.  Rinse the clothes twice in fresh water and squeeze to dry. For more delicate items, allow them to hang and drip dry or lay flat. Be careful not to lean too far into the bathtub, as that can put extra strain on your back.

The clip starts with teacher Robin Dziedzic filming in a pitch black bathroom with her students as they try to seek shelter. Horrifying: As they huddle in a bathroom, teachers can be heard trying to reassure their terrified students as they twister tears up Briarwood Elementary, one of two Oklahoma City-area schools hit by Monday's twister. Mayhem: The school corridor after being ripped apart by the twister - no-one at the school was killed. Dawning: A classroom which less than an hour before was in pristine condition is now wrecked. The only source of light is from a bulb in the corner of the room. Mrs Dziedzic, a fifth grade teacher, can be heard trying to reassure the terrified students telling them: 'It's almost over, it's almost over.' A student cries out 'I hate this' as the 200pmh winds swirl outside the tiny room. 'Keep your heads down,' instructs one of the teachers as the air pushes down on the students.

Obliterated: As the teachers and students emerge from the school, the full scale of the devastation can be seen. Dazed: Shocked and teary students stand outside the school as the carnage in revealed. Reunited: Mrs Dziedzic finds her son Sam, a first grader, who also attended the school. As the full force of the tornado rips through the school, cries of terror and screams can be heard from the students. The video, filmed on a cellphone,. then shows the students emerging from the darkness and seeing for the. first time the full scale of devastation. The school corridor is strewn with. debris, mud and insulator foam and the dazed students can be seen walking around. the building in horror.

Destruction: Robin Dziedzic walks down the tornado-damaged corridor- the bathroom she sheltered in is behind the wall. Poignant: Robin Dziedzic opens the door to her bathroom which saved the life of her and her students. The footage then cuts to outside the school where the land is completely obliterated. Terrified students gather in the land outside as Mrs Dziedzic searches for her two children who are also at the school- her son Sam, a first grader and daughter Mairi, a fourth grader. Sam finds her in the crowd and her husband, who arrives at the scene tracks down Mairi - the pair hug in a sobbing embrace.

A. deep sea  B. slaughterhouse  C. cattle ranch  D. countryside  E. barnyard  The best answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"C. cattle ranch Cowboys were primarily responsible for herding cattle, which were typically raised on large, sprawling properties known as cattle ranches. These ranches often covered vast areas of land, complete with open grasslands and natural resources necessary for raising healthy livestock. Cowboys would manage, corral, and drive the heifers towards various sections of the property to ensure their herds had access to fresh grazing areas and water sources. The other options provided do not accurately represent the environments or intended destinations for cowboys herding heifers: A. deep sea - Cowboys and their herds would certainly not venture into the deep sea. Not only is it geographically improbable, but it would also be detrimental to both the cowboys and the cattle in their charge. B. slaughterhouse - While some cattle would eventually be taken to slaughterhouses, the cowboys' primary responsibility was to maintain and manage the herds. They might occasionally be involved in transporting cattle to markets, but not directly to slaughterhouses. D. countryside - The term \\"countryside\\" is vague and could potentially encompass the grasslands and open areas found within cattle ranches. However, it is not a specific destination typically associated with cowboys herding heifers. E. barnyard - Barnyards are more commonly associated with smaller-scale farms rather than the cattle-centric ranches of the cowboy era. Cowboys would have been more focused on managing their herds in open pastures rather than navigating barnyard settings. In summary, the best answer for where cowboys would be herding heifers across their property is C. cattle ranch.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE To summarise the effects of anthelmintic drug treatment on growth and cognitive performance in children.     DATA SOURCES Electronic databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group controlled trial register, Cochrane controlled trials register, Embase, and Medline. Citations of all identified trials. Contact with the World Health Organization and field researchers.    REVIEW METHODS Systematic review of randomised controlled trials in children aged 1-16 that compared anthelmintic treatment with placebo or no treatment. Assessment of validity and data abstraction conducted independently by two reviewers.     MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Growth and cognitive performance.     RESULTS Thirty randomised controlled trials in more than 15 000 children were identified. Effects on mean weight were unremarkable, and heterogeneity was evident in the results. There were some positive effects on mean weight change in the trials reporting this outcome: after a single dose (any anthelmintic) the pooled estimates were 0.24 kg (95% confidence interval 0.15 kg to 0. 32 kg; fixed effects model assumed) and 0.38 kg (0.01 kg to 0.77 kg; random effects model assumed). Results from trials of multiple doses showed mean weight change in up to one year of follow up of 0.10 kg (0.04 kg to 0.17 kg; fixed effects) or 0.15 kg (0.00 to 0.30; random effects). At more than one year of follow up, mean weight change was 0.12 kg (-0.02 kg to 0.26 kg; fixed effects) and 0.43 (-0.61 to 1. 47; random effects). Results from studies of cognitive performance were inconclusive.     CONCLUSIONS There is some limited evidence that routine treatment of children in areas where helminths are common has effects on weight gain, but this is not consistent between trials. There is insufficient evidence as to whether this intervention improves cognitive performance..

Ruth controls custody of their son Lucas (Alderson) while Dwight maintains visitation rights. Dwight and Lucas are at a baseball game when Ruth calls, informing Dwight that he is late returning their son home. Dwight drives Lucas home in a hurry, thinking he might otherwise forfeit his visitation privileges. When he loses control of his vehicle, he strikes a young boy, Josh Learner (Curley), who is standing by the roadside. Aware that he has struck the boy, Dwight decides to flee the scene. He further lies to Lucas, who has a minor injury from the incident, saying that they had collided with a tree log. Dwight later hears on a newscast that Josh died in the collision. Subsequently, he tries to cover up the evidence which implicates him in the hit-and-run. After the initial shock of losing Josh, Grace (Connelly) gradually tries to get on with life, but her husband Ethan (Phoenix), is obsessed with finding out who killed their son and frustrated with the lack of progress the police are making in their investigation. Ethan eventually decides to hire a lawyer, who oddly enough turns out to be Dwight. Ethan later discovers, quite by chance, that Dwight is the perpetrator.

Options: a ) 4.04 , b ) 4.02 , c ) 4.01 , d ) 4.05 , e ) 4.06","output":"To determine the percentage of error in the calculated area of the square, first consider the error in measuring the side of the square. If the true measurement of the side is x, then the measured value is 1.02x because of the 2% excess.  The area of the square based on the true value of x is A_true = x^2. The area calculated using the measured value of the side is A_measured = (1.02x)^2. Calculate the percentage of error in the calculated area: 1. Find the difference between the true area and measured area: A_difference = A_measured - A_true = (1.02x)^2 - x^2 2. Simplify and find the ratio of A_difference to A_true: (A_difference / A_true) = ((1.02x)^2 - x^2) / x^2 3. Factor out the x^2 term: = (1.04x^2 - x^2) / x^2 → (0.0404x^2) / x^2 4. The x^2 terms cancel each other out: = 0.0404 5.

The coffee should be organic, because non-organic coffees usually have added chemicals and preservatives. Be sure to use a dark roast coffee or espresso. This will help make sure your hair will darken with the coffee. Make this brew strong, by adding a little bit more coffee than 1–2 cups (240–470 ml) calls for.  You can brew the coffee however you want (a drip coffee maker, on the stove), but brewing your coffee in a single serve instant coffee maker might not brew the coffee as strongly as it should be to adequately dye your hair. Let the coffee cool and use it when it is completely cooled, or lukewarm. You can use any kind of conditioner to mix with the coffee. However, thicker conditioners might make application easier. Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of the brewed coffee, with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of conditioner, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the organic coffee grounds. Use a spoon to mix all of these ingredients together. If you have longer hair, you can increase the quantity of coffee and conditioner used. The exact measurements are not a rule, but more so a guide. Apply this mixture to your hair using your hands, and consider using a wide-toothed comb to spread the mixture evenly through your hair. Once you have added all of the mixture to your hair, consider pinning your hair up in a bun to keep your hair out of your face as you let the mixture soak in. Leave this mixture on your hair for at least an hour. After an hour, the conditioner may start to dry and harden.  Apply this coffee mixture to your hair in a bathroom with a mirror so you can contain any mess and see what you’re doing. Drape an old towel (one you don’t mind getting messy) over your shoulders. This will prevent any of the coffee mixture from falling on your clothes and staining the fabric. Rinse the coffee and conditioner mixture out of your hair in the shower. Don’t add shampoo; simply let the water clean out the mixture from your hair. You may need to repeat this dyeing process a couple times to reach your desired results.","output":"This article explains how to make and use a mixture of organic coffee, conditioner, and coffee grounds to naturally darken your hair by brewing strong coffee, mixing it with conditioner, applying the mixture to your hair, and rinsing it out after an hour."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you have a fever, headache and runny nose, you might go to Google and type in the words \\"flu symptoms\\" to see whether you've come down with the disease.      Google knows that you might do something like that, and it also knows which state you're in if you are in the United States. Now, it's putting that information together in a tool that could find out flu outbreaks faster than traditional systems currently in use, according to CNN report. It is called Google Flu Trends.      \\"What's exciting about Flu Trends is that it lets anybody---doctors, health officials, moms with sick children---learn about the current flu activity level in their own state based on the data that's coming in this week,\\" said Jeremy Ginsberg, the lead engineer who developed the tool.      The tool operates on the idea that there's likely to be a flu outbreak in states where flu-related search terms are currently popular.      To test the accuracy of the data, Google compared its figures against statistics filed  over the past five years by the US Centers for Disease Control. It has a network of 1,500 doctors across the US who provide weekly reports on the number of patients complaining of flu-like symptoms.      \\"We found we could highly accurately estimate what the flu activity levels would be in those years,\\" Ginsberg said. They also found that the Google statistics, which can be gathered daily, were up to two weeks ahead of the government's data. The government's data took time to collect because it came from so many doctors.      The ability to speed up the response of health services could prove invaluable when a serious outbreak happens.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"The boy is skateboarding on the bench by the fence.\\", is the sentence \\"The person is on his skateboard.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Based on the given sentence, \\"The boy is skateboarding on the bench by the fence,\\" it is possible to consider the sentence \\"The person is on his skateboard\\" as a true statement with some interpretation. However, there are certain differences and limitations that must be taken into account when evaluating both sentences. First, let's analyze the original sentence: \\"The boy is skateboarding on the bench by the fence.\\" In this sentence, the subject is \\"the boy,\\" who is performing the action of skateboarding. The location is specified as \\"on the bench by the fence.\\" This gives a more precise description of the activity and location than the second sentence. Now let's move to the second sentence: \\"The person is on his skateboard.\\" The subject in this sentence is \\"the person,\\" which could be a reference to \\"the boy\\" in the original sentence, but it is not as specific. Additionally, the verb in this sentence is \\"is,\\" with the prepositional phrase \\"on his skateboard\\" providing more information about the subject's activity. This sentence does convey the idea that the subject is using a skateboard, but it lacks the details about the exact action, such as \\"skateboarding.\\" Furthermore, the location of this activity is not mentioned in this sentence, unlike the original sentence. Given the analysis above, it can be said that the sentence \\"The person is on his skateboard\\" indeed represents a true statement when considering certain aspects of the original sentence. However, it is a more general and less detailed representation of the original situation. It lacks the specificity that \\"the boy\\" provides in the original sentence and omits the information about the activity and the location (\\"skateboarding on the bench by the fence\\"). In conclusion, the second sentence is true in the sense that it conveys the idea of someone using a skateboard, but it falls short in capturing the full context and details of the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife.  I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as  traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Korea  for the following movie plot:  In Korea in 1951, a small boy called Manuk (voice: Joshua Ahn) is on his way home from school, playing as he goes. He wears a white badge on his shirt that says \\"happy birthday\\" in Chinese characters.The first scene opens on a butterfly perched on a somewhat puzzling structure; the boy, inside, is singing. When he comes out, the camera pulls back to show that the puzzling structure is the wreck of a plane that crashed into a building.Manuk makes his way through the village to a railroad track, where he puts his ear to the rail to listen for a train. Evidently he hears one coming; he lays a bolt taken from the plane on the rail, where the train flattens it. The train is hauling tanks.The boy picks up the flattened bolt and finds that it's been magnetized. He continues to a spot that overlooks the tracks. Seeing war planes in the distance, he pretends to shoot at them, exchanges a few urgent words with an imagined fellow soldier -- \\"Dad\\" -- and throws a rock grenade that hits a postman on a bicycle.Arriving home at last, Manuk opens a package he finds on the porch. He pulls out a worn wallet containing a picture of himself and a young man, a set of dog tags, and a boot. There's no sign that the boy understands what it means that these objects have been sent home. He puts on the dog tags and engages in more soldier-play.Indoors, the boy plays with toys -- mostly war-themed -- that he seems to have made himself. Sprawled on the floor, he falls asleep. His mother comes home.

Do these mean the same? After his death , the atheistic element of communism would be stepped up in some Marxist movements . After his death , the Marxist element of communism would be strengthened in some atheistic movements .","output":"While these two sentences appear similar at first glance, they actually convey different meanings. Let's break down each sentence to understand their individual meanings and the distinctions between them. 1. After his death, the atheistic element of communism would be stepped up in some Marxist movements. This sentence implies that, following the individual's passing, the atheism aspect within communism would become more prominent or influential in certain Marxist movements. This statement assumes that those specific Marxist movements already have a connection to or component of communism with an atheistic element. The focus of this sentence is on the growth or increased influence of atheism within these Marxist movements. 2. After his death, the Marxist element of communism would be strengthened in some atheistic movements. In this sentence, the focus shifts from the atheistic element to the Marxist element within communism. It suggests that, after the person's death, the influence or presence of Marxism within certain atheistic movements would be strengthened or intensified. In other words, the sentence implies that these atheistic movements may or may not have already had an association with communism, but the influence of Marxism within these movements would grow more substantial. In this case, the emphasis is on the growth or increased influence of Marxism within these atheistic movements. To sum up, the key difference between these two sentences lies in the elements being emphasized: - In the first sentence, the importance lies on the fact that \\"the atheistic element of communism\\" is increased within some Marxist movements. - Meanwhile, in the second sentence, the focus is on how \\"the Marxist element of communism\\" gets strengthened within some atheistic movements. Although both sentences discuss the growth or increased influence of certain elements within different movements, they emphasize different aspects: the first one highlights the growth of atheism within Marxist movements, whereas the second one emphasizes the strengthening of Marxism within atheistic movements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There are a number of ways to start off a session of analytical therapy (also known as imagination therapy), but getting the subject into a receptive state is essential.  Try having them lay on a comfortable couch/sofa and close their eyes. They are not to go to sleep at any point. Use a soft, relaxing tone at all times when speaking to the subject. You can attempt to have them count down slowly from 100. For more tense patients, you can have them intentionally and systematically tense, hold, and then release each of their muscles. Controlled breathing also can work. The subject places their hands on their chest and belly--sometimes the hypnotist can do this part--while the subject breathes slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. Once your subject is in a receptive state, you need to narrow the sets of imagery you focus on.  You can try some interesting experiments as long as you are careful. Select positive images like a holiday party, a graduation, a wedding, or a combination of multiple images in sequence to draw a correspondingly positive response out of the subject. If they need to relax, you may help them \\"construct\\" the images out of features the subject associates with positive emotions and memories. If you are helping a case of trauma, you may have them search for pleasant images to supplant horrific ones. There is a great deal of flexibility here, so this needs to be tailored to your subject's needs and perhaps discussed before the session.  With so much range, you can make the mode of expression part of the experiment. Maybe having your subject drive their images around in a vehicle, or make a movie of their happiest memories would be something you can attempt. Perhaps having the subject going on an adventure within their own images could be quite an experience to try. Find a creative way to discard negative images in a symbolic way that allows the positive images to remain in place. Consider something literal like tossing the bad images in a trash can or projecting them on a screen so there is room in the mind for the pleasant imagery. Your subject is in a receptive state, but not asleep. You are guiding them.  Steer the subject's images in a positive direction, but observe their responses carefully in case they are resisting. Maintain the calm steady tone of voice throughout the session. Suggest imagery that mixes positively with their existing responses. Be prepared to bring them out of the hypnotic state in the case of an adverse physical reaction. For experimental situations, you may take some time to find what techniques and images work best with the subject. And neither hypnotist nor subject should expect an instant cure, especially in trauma cases or when dealing with prolonged pain suffering.  Establish from the outset that the hypnotic technique can take many sessions. Schedule a regular time/interval for the sessions. Both parties should bring up issues if they feel the sessions are not working as they expect. What is a summary?","output":"Analytical therapy, also known as imagination therapy, involves guiding a subject into a relaxed and receptive state through techniques such as controlled breathing and muscle relaxation. Once the subject is in this state, the therapist helps them focus on positive images and experiences that evoke pleasant emotions and memories.

Throughout the session, the therapist maintains a calm and steady tone while observing the subject's responses and adjusting the imagery accordingly. For cases such as trauma or prolonged pain, multiple sessions may be required for the therapy to be effective. Establishing a regular schedule and discussing any concerns or expectations can help improve the therapy's success."},{"instruction":"Title: Powerful Results! Review: I first read Marva Collins Way several years ago, and have reread it many times since, to help guide and clarify my thoughts about education. She has revolutionized public education, and people's perceptions of it. She has also effectively refuted the growing slew of people in the highest placesof academia who stubbornly cling to long-discredited theories about the intellectual inferiority of certain races in this country. I would recommend this book to anyone, and ask only that you read it at least twice, because it has too much to absorb, to just read it once. It will possibly alter your concept about education, and just who is capable of learning. If you use Marva's concepts as a teacher, I guarantee powerful results!

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country....  Guess a valid title for it!

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples.  Answer this question please: Would new surfaces be exposed or stay covered in sample A? Answer:","output":"In sample A, which is from the Amazon Rainforest with one of the highest rainfall rates in the world, new surfaces would be exposed more frequently. This is because high rainfall leads to an increased amount of rainwater passing through the soil. As mentioned in the background, high rainfall also increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions, leading to more rapid weathering. Moreover, high rainfall can carry away materials, further contributing to the exposure of new surfaces. This process is in contrast to the situation in sample B, from the Atacama Desert, where low rainfall would result in less weathering and slower exposure of new surfaces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The first outstanding deaf teacher in America was a Frenchman Laurent Clerc. He and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America's first school for the deaf. When Laurent Clerc was one year old, he fell into a fire. As a result, he lost both his hearing and his sense of smell. At the age of 12, Laurent entered the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris. After he graduated, the school asked him to stay on as an assistant teacher. Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was studying to be a minister when he met a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell. He was upset to learn that there were no schools for the deaf in America. Therefore, in 1815, Gallaudet sailed to London to seek ideas on how to teach deaf people. However, he was unable to get help. He met a French educator of the deaf who invited him to Paris to learn at the Royal Institution for the Deaf. Gallaudet went to the Royal Institution for the Deaf, where Clerc became his Sign Language teacher. The two worked and studied well together. When the time came for Gallaudet to return to America, he asked Clerc to come with him. The two men set sail on June 18, 1816. The voyage across the Atlantic Ocean took 52 days; however, Clerc and Gallaudet put the time to good use. They discussed the school for the deaf which they planned to open.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. During the half century since President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, you may have heard about a few conspiracy theories. Decades of investigations, hearings, documents, records, books and interviews have failed to satisfy conspiracy theorists with a definitive answer to The Question: Did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone when he shot the President? At one time or another, doubters of the lone gunman theory \\"have accused 42 groups, 82 assassins and 214 people of being involved in the assassination,\\" said author Vincent Bugliosi. That's a lot of paranoia.

The king of","output":"JFK conspiracy debunking, Perry has spent the last 30 years meticulously researching and debunking the various theories surrounding the assassination. Through extensive analysis of documents, interviews, and other records, Perry has come to firmly believe that Oswald acted alone. Perry pointed out that the inconsistencies and errors found in the testimonies and records only serve as fuel for conspiracy theorists. However, he emphasized that human error and the chaos surrounding the tragedy are likely the culprits rather than any sinister collusion. \\"I don't claim to have all the answers, but I can tell you that most of these claims just don't hold up when you examine them closely,\\" Perry added. Spurred by public fascination, the U.S. government has had to confront the enduring conspiracy theories time and again. In 2017, President Donald Trump authorized the release of previously classified documents related to the JFK assassination, although it did little to appease skeptics. Perry diligently examined the newly released documents, ultimately finding no evidence to substantiate conspiracy theories. As the 60th anniversary of JFK's assassination approaches, the debate around the lone gunman theory persists. Perry continues to provide his insight and expertise, debunking myths and upholding the integrity of the investigation. While it is unlikely that any revelation will appease all conspiracy theorists, Perry remains dedicated to unveiling the truth and promoting facts above paranoia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is vital to wait for this before starting any digging, to avoid serious injury or property damage. In the U.S. and Canada, you can call the toll-free \\"Digline\\" number at 811. Knowing the depth, width, and length of your trench will help you save effort and keep your trench the shape you  desire. It may help you to mark widths, lengths and route of your trench using stakes and string. If available, you can use sandbags or other markers to outline the path of your trench.  If you are using the trench to install or replace electrical utilities or pipelines, you will want to dig at least 2.5 feet deep in order to protect the pipes from frost, but no deeper than 4 feet. The width of your trench will depend on your pipes, but will likely be narrow. If you are digging a trench for a sprinkler system, you may only need to dig 9-12 inches deep depending on the height of the sprinkler, and 5 inches wide depending, again, depending on your sprinkler system. Consult the instructions that came with your sprinkler system before installation. You’ll need a D-handle sharp shooter shovel and a trenching or clean-out shovel. These can be purchased at any hardware or gardening store. For clearing roots, pruning shear or a Pulaski digging tool can help you quickly remove this obstruction. Wearing gloves will protect your hand from blisters and splinters, and comfortable work boots will provide foot protection and traction. Be careful when you dig around trees or other pipes. Roots can add a significant time to your excavation, and a ruptured gas line will require you to call your gas provider immediately. Severed utility lines could also leave you without power until your electric company can fix the problem.  If you're digging near trees, make sure that your trench will not invade the tree’s protected root zone (usually the part of the roots that lie directly below its branches). If you're digging near pipes, try to determine where any other pipes may be. New pipes should be at least 1.5 feet away from another. Use the D-handle shovel to loosen the dirt along both sides of the soon-to-be trench. This will make it easier to dig out the dirt in the middle while physically establishing your dig line alongside the guideline you laid. Cut both sides of the hole with your shovel, break up the topsoil, and then work both sides of your trench until you have loosened enough soil to merit clearing. Once you have accumulated enough loose soil, use the trenching shovel to remove it out of your way. This may be a pile off to the side, or it may be a location you choose prior specifically for backfill. Depending on the depth and length of your trench, this could take a considerable amount of time and effort. Use your D-handle shovel to break up the soil and the trench shovel to clean it out until your trench is the desired length and depth.  Running into roots might require you to place the pointed end of your shovel on the root and stomp, which should sever most small-medium sized roots. More developed root systems might require a Pulaski digging tool. Pruning shears are another good option, if your shovel fails and you do not have a Pulaski digging tool on hand. An unsupported trench can be extremely dangerous, as collapsing soil can kill someone standing in the trench. Any trench 3 feet (0.91 m) (0.9m) deep, and some shallower trenches in soft soil, should be supported by side walls (such as timber posts and panels) before digging any deeper. You can increase safety by \\"benching\\" (digging in tiered levels), or by digging the walls at a slope instead of vertically. An experienced trench excavator may choose to keep the trench unsupported at depths up to 5 ft (1.5 m), but only under stable soil conditions. Follow the 3 ft (0.9 m) rule if you do not have expert supervision.","output":"This service helps find hidden things underground like power lines and pipes. You must call 811 before digging so you won't get hurt or break things. You need to know how deep, wide, and long your trench should be. Use stakes and string to mark the area. If you put wires or pipes in the trench, it should be 2.5 feet to 4 feet deep. If for a sprinkler, only 9-12 inches deep and 5 inches wide. You need special shovels to dig and cut roots. Wear gloves and boots for protection. Do not damage tree roots or other pipes. Make the trench walls safe with wood or by digging at an angle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Cats Don't Dance Movie plot: In 1939, Danny, an optimistic cat, dreams of Hollywood stardom, so he travels from Kokomo, Indiana to Hollywood in hopes of starting a career there. After meeting a new friend Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film called the Li'l Ark Angel that is in production alongside a white cat named Sawyer at Mammoth Studios. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie, Cranston, Frances, and T.W., Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny winds up angering Darla Dimple, a popular, extremely spoiled child actress and star of the film, so she assigns her Valet Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part. Danny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals; a fact that none of them are very happy with but know they must accept. He longs for the spotlight and tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios â such as by assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans. Later, Danny is given advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature with a sweet one as she always does) through song on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B. Mammoth the head of Mammoth Studios, and Flanagan the film's director, is giving an interview, getting the animals blame and fired. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Studios (especially Danny who was convinced by Darla that she was trying to help the animals). As Woolie tells Danny to leave for home, Cranston, Frances, and T.W. blame him for ruining their careers while Tillie suggests Sawyer to follow Danny. After a comment from the bus driver... My question: Why did Danny traveled from Kokomo, Indiana to Hollywood? Answer:","output":"Danny, the optimistic cat, traveled from Kokomo, Indiana to Hollywood because he had dreams of becoming a Hollywood star. He was passionate about pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and believed that Hollywood, being the center of the film and entertainment world, was the best place to achieve his dream. Upon reaching Hollywood, he hoped to land roles in movies and eventually become a well-known actor, making his mark on the industry and fulfilling his aspirations. Hollywood represented the ultimate destination for anyone in the entertainment industry, with its glamour, fame, and countless opportunities to work with talented individuals in various creative fields. Danny's journey to Hollywood symbolizes the pursuit of ambition, self-belief, and the desire to reach for the stars, no matter the challenges that lie ahead."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Medical reports confirmed he would be out of action for two more weeks and Real coach Manuel Pellegrini had said it would be \\"impossible for Ronaldo to play with Portugal\\" and urged Carlos Queiroz to leave him out of the squad. Ronaldo has missed the Spanish side's last eight matches after suffering an injury to his right ankle during the Champions League match with Marseille on September 30, and then aggravating it while playing for Portugal in their World Cup qualifier against Hungary on October 10. The former Manchester United star has since met with Dutch specialist Professor Niek van Dijk in Amsterdam after tests conducted by Madrid last Wednesday revealed that no improvement had been made on Ronaldo's injury since undergoing an MRI scan a week before. Van Dijk, who operated the winger's right ankle in the summer of 2008, advised Ronaldo to continue his treatment before returning for a fresh evaluation in two weeks' time. Portugal coach Queiroz revealed, however, that the injury would not stop him from naming Ronaldo in his 23-man squad and the forward admitted that not playing in South Africa would be a bitter pill to swallow. \\"We have one more test left.

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Please write a short summary for the following article: CATSKILLS REAWAKENING AFTER A LONG SLEEP LIBERTY, N.Y.— In the glittering resort hotels there is talk of casino gambling, while in the decaying towns the topic is unemployment and crime. But the center of discussion throughout the hills is the new face of the Catskills - people from New York City seeking second homes, a melange of off-brand religious groups who want isolation and artists needing cheap studios. After almost a century of dormancy, the Catskill Mountains - the 3,000-square-mile pastoral area spreading over Sullivan, Ulster and Orange Counties about 100 miles northwest of New York City - is confronting rapid growth and ethnic change. ''The image of the Catskills as the Borscht Belt is gone,'' said Brian Ingber, the 32-year-old Supervisor of the Town of Fallsburg in Sullivan County who is credited with attracting several Federal and state redevelopment grants for the area. ''The Catskills are going through a revival of a type never seen before here,'' he added. ''The population of Sullivan County shot up 23 percent between 1970 and 1980 as a lot of people suddenly found out that land was cheap here and either started speculating in property or buying second homes.'' Grossinger's, the legendary resort that stands on a hill overlooking this small town like a feudal manor, is still doing well, as are Brown's, the Concord, the Fallsview and a dozen or so major resorts. But over the last 20 years, perhaps 100 others have gone out of business, as have hundreds of bungalow colonies that were summer vacation homes for New Yorkers with low or moderate incomes. The lands they once occupied are being subdivided for second homes on plots of about an acre, or have been sold as package deals to the many religious groups moving in. The region, already noted for religious toleration, whether of Jewish splinter groups or followers of the late Father Devine, now seems inundated with gurus, swamis and saffron-robed Buddhist monks, who on weekend nights can be seen mingling with more somberly attired Hasidic Jews. Freshly painted directions on signposts point the way: Swami Muktananda has taken over the old Gilbert Hotel in South Fallsburg. Nearby, the old Winter Hotel is now the Capital of the Age of the Enlightenment, a transcendental-meditation movement headed by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. A second such center is at the old Walde-mere Hotel in Shandelle. The Sivandada Yoga Ranch has set up shop in Woodbourne; Livingston Manor is host to the Dai Bosatsu Zendo; a colony of Hare Krishna is at Lake Huntington; the Reunification Church, under the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, has bought land in Accord, and other groups range from the Emissaries of the Divine Light to the Shalom Retreat Center. ''The new cult groups are quite a contrast with the old resorts,'' said Andrew Neiderman of South Fallsburg, who has written novels and histories of the Catskills. ''The fluxing that is going on here is exciting - to see Orthodox Jews talking to guys in togas.'' He added that the religious immigration had also led to the removal of 1 million in property from the tax rolls. More low-income families have settled in the region, and Mr. Neiderman, who teaches English in high school, said he had seen a decline in students' ambitions and the quality of education. But the most noteworthy recent change, he said, is the arrival of painters, sculptors, musicians and other artists fleeing the sharp increase in the price of studio space in New York City. One group of Manhattan and Brooklyn artists has virtually taken over Mountain Dale, a Sullivan County hamlet that was once a stop on the old New York, Ontario and Western Railroad that brought in vacationers before World War II. ''I drove into Mountain Dale one day in 1975 trying to buy a pack of cigarettes,'' said Bob Lew, a 29-year-old sculptor from Brooklyn. ''It was a ghost town - the dogs sleeping on the main street wouldn't even budge.'' Bought Church for 7,500 Mr. Lew bought the Mountain Dale Methodist Church and its two acres for 7,500, then turned it into a studio; he plans to make it a foundry for casting. He and Gregg Bennett, 28, a Monticello musician, then bought the town's main building, once a candy store and luncheonette, for 14,500, and turned it into a restaurant and saloon. In the last few years, artists and designers have moved in, bought old buildings and rehabilitated them through grants averaging 3,500. More than 1 million is being invested in new water and sewer lines and storm drains, and the once-dead hamlet has been officially designated as the model community of Sullivan County. The outlook for other towns in the Catskills, such as Ellenville, Monticello and Liberty, is less optimistic. Crime Rate Climbing To Larry Barnes, the Liberty police chief, the changes are not necessarily for the better. ''When I started on the force here 10 years ago, we dealt with 300 criminal cases a year,'' he said. ''The number last year was 800, and the rate is continuing to rise.'' He attributed the problem to unemployment and the movement of lowincome people from other areas. An increase in the Spanish-speaking population - and ensuing difficulties in communication - are another indication that the ethnic mix of the Catskills is changing. Resorts such as the Villa Roma, the Bel Fior Hotel and Lanza's Hotel now operate alongside the more traditional inns and, like the older ones, they badly want legalized casino gambling. Mark Grossinger Etess, vice president and general manager of Grossinger's, said that 1980 was the best year in recent times, a view echoed by his competitors. He and Charles Slutsky of the Fallsview resort are leading lobbying efforts to have gambling legalized, and both men view the Atlantic City casinos as the biggest threat to their livelihood since the European vacation boom of the 1960's. ''We need gambling to stay competitive,'' Mr. Etess said. He added that he foresaw tremendous competition within five years, when Atlantic City builds many more hotel rooms ''and gets its social act together.''
