Griner was arrested last year at the airport in Moscow on drug-related charges and detained for nearly 10 months, much of that time in prison. Her plight unfolded at the same time Russia invaded Ukraine and further heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S., ending only after she was freed in exchange for the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. A WNBA All-Star with the Phoenix Mercury, Griner had flown to Moscow in February 2022 to rejoin UMMC Ekaterinburg, a Russian women's team she has played for in the off-season since 2014. \\"That day (in February) was the beginning of an unfathomable period in my life which only now am I ready to share,\\" Griner said in a statement released Tuesday by Alfred A. Knopf. \\"The primary reason I traveled back to Russia for work that day was because I wanted to make my wife, family, and teammates proud. After an incredibly challenging 10 months in detainment, I am grateful to have been rescued and to be home. Readers will hear my story and understand why I'm so thankful for the outpouring of support from people across the world.\\" Griner says she hopes her book raises awareness for other detainees Griner added that she also hoped her book would raise awareness of other Americans detained overseas, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested in Russia last month and accused of espionage; businessman Kai Li, serving a 10-year sentence in China on charges of revealing state secrets to the FBI; and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive imprisoned in Russia on spying charges.

I believe, despite the price tag associated with building this lounge room, the increase in productivity will ultimately pay for it over a short time. Right now, employees have to leave the building to buy their lunches. Even after they purchased their lunches, they are either forced to eat in their cars or at the restaurants they bought their food from. Having a lounge would solve two problems: employees have a place to eat that is at their place of work, and if they chip in every month, the lounge room can be stocked with a variety of foods that can be prepared and eaten right in the room. Tardiness from clocking in late after lunch can be eliminated by having a lounge room in the building. I did some research and was able to determine that it would cost approximately 10,000 to build a new lounge room in the employee work area. This would cover the costs of building the room, as well as furnishing it with tables, chairs, a refrigerator, a microwave, a kitchenette, and vending machines for snacks and drinks. The company would be able to make up the costs by saving money on paying employees a meal allowance, as they would cover their own meals (either by chipping in to supply the lounge or bringing their own meals from home to eat).

Here's the text you can use to answer: The costs of the corresponding outages are immense. Numerous analyses show even a one hour power outage can cost commercial and industrial facilities tens of thousands of dollars—and outages often last much longer. In specialized industries like museums, a power outage can mean the difference between a safe, stable climate for art and an environment that starts to quickly degrade priceless artifacts. And as we’ve witnessed in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, damaged grids can claim human lives. That’s why many people argue for “undergrounding,” the process by which existing utility poles are moved from their current spot above the tree canopy to a protected tunnel below the earth. Proponents, who seem to grow more vocal over the summer as hurricane season picks up speed, say this move would ensure the grid’s resiliency, even in hurricane-prone places like south Florida. But Ted Kury, the director of energy studies at the University of Florida’s Public Utility Research Center, says not so fast. Undergrounding could reduce the number of hurricane-related outages in some places.

Include some relevant information about how olive oil has been used by the church in religious ceremonies. Keep the word count under 300 words.","output":"Olive Oil Facts Olive Oil has been a staple of the Mediterranean diet for centuries. It’s the only vegetable oil that can be consumed just the way it is, freshly pressed from the olive. It contains many beneficial health effects. Consuming just two teaspoons each day can prevent heart disease and gallstones. Research has also shown that it can lower your risk of colon cancer. Olive Oil is a good cure-all for many afflictions. But it has also been used for many centuries in religious ceremonies. In the Roman Catholic church, for instance, olive oil has been utilized by Priests to perform a variety of ceremonies, such as baptisms, Confirmations, and even as fuel for lamps in their churches. During ancient times, olive oil was used to anoint a king during his coronation ceremony. In 1 Samuel 10, the mighty prophet of old Samuel uses a flask of olive oil to anoint Saul, the very first king of Israel. Almost since time began, olives have been associated with peace. An olive tree cannot be grown in a hostile environment. It requires lush, fertile soil and arid temperatures. Even then, it will take several years before the olive tree can produce fruit. But once it does, this amazing tree can live for up to 500 years. Olive trees have an almost titanic resistance, a vital force that renders them nearly immortal. Despite harsh winters and burning summers, despite truncations, they continue to grow, proud and strong, reaching towards the sky, bearing fruit that nourishes and heals, inspires, and amazes."},{"instruction":"Read the passage below and answer these questions: 1. What were the three Korean states in the first half of the first millennium? 2. In which time period did Sejong the Great make the Korean alphabet? During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between three states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the \\"Unified Silla\\" period. Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym \\"Korea\\", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234.[3][4][5][6][7][8] However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting. Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon on 17 July 1392. The first 200 years of the Joseon era were marked by relative peace, and during this time the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great and Confucianism became increasingly influential in the kingdom.","output":"1.

Murray not only influenced the career of Marshall but also another U.S. Supreme Court Justice: Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Post-apocalyptic setting. Start with this sentence, \\"The disease had first cropped up in five different towns.\\" The main character desires to survive and to find other survivors.","output":"The disease had first cropped up in five different towns. It spread like wildfire through the remaining fragments of humanity. No society was untouched. Nina kicked an old, rusty, twisted piece of metal out of her path. This stretch of cracked pavement had remarkably few rusting car hulks littering it, not like the cities. The disease had no mercy; it caused a rapid deterioration of the body and mind. Mother Nature, finally having had enough abuse, had sent the ultimate punishment. Humankind was crumbling under the weight of its arrogance. Nina, one of the lucky ones, was immune to the disease. Or was it unlucky? Whatever, she was alive and determined to stay that way. With her backpack strapped tightly to her face and a wrinkled, worn paper map clutched in her hands, she navigated the desolate wastelands. What she wouldn’t give for a working phone. At first, phones and the internet had worked, even without people to man them. But in time, the electric grid failed. Some solar farms might still be online, and that’s where she’d find people. But they were south. Days turned into weeks as she trudged through barren landscapes, the remnants of civilization slowly being taken back by the planet. If she could reach California the coast would be within striking distance as well. Power, and a food source. Ideal while she attempted to locate other survivors. Nina looked at the drunken green sign. It said, “Welcome to Nevada.” There was still a long way to go."},{"instruction":"Write a short poem about puzzles.

The goblin is a tax official and sometimes wishes he could go back to the good ole days.","output":"Tyre sat at the bar with his face pressed against his hands. It had been a long day of work in the office and he really needed a drink. The bartender slid a drink his way, and Tyre flipped him a coin. \\"A goblin willing to part with his money? Now I've seen everything.\\" The bartender laughed at his own cutting-edge humor and Tyre just flipped around, swilling his drink in his hand. \\"The war's over, bub,\\" he said in his gritty voice. \\"I ain't lookin' for trouble,\\" the barkeep said, raising his hands in mock surrender. \\"We all know goblins can be vicious when they have a mind to.\\" Tyre grunted and took a swig of his drink. Why did goblins have to hold such a bad reputation? Sure, they might have served a dark lord or two, and, sure, they might have maybe tried to bring about the destruction of mankind more than once, but this was a civil age. Elves were known for their pointy ears, wits, and—as propaganda would have it—gorgeous flowing locks. Goblins, by contrast, were remembered for being subservient, greedy, and bloodthirsty. Tyre worked in an office with lots of humans. He was a tax official, which didn't really help his reputation, but it was honest work. He worked hard, earned a good wage, and spent it wisely. His days of brandishing a club at travelers to relieve them of their gold were long since over, although, just sometimes, Tyre wished they weren't."},{"instruction":"When did George Washington get put on the dollar bill?","output":"The first 1 Federal Reserve notes were released in 1963.

As if that weren't enough, next came a lumbering giant, *breaking into* our home, feeding the boy preposterous lies about being a wizard. I have never been more furious in my life. So we packed everything we own and drove as far as we could. It was the only choice we had to try and protect the family. And somehow, those freaks *still* found us. They gave the boy money for school supplies even, can you imagine? I just wanted to be done with this magical nonsense forever, so I said good riddance to the boy. One less burden in my household.

How am I supposed to deal with him now that she decided that kissing him behind the science room would be fun? He spent half the day following me around wanting to know if he did something wrong, calling me her stupid name. I hate my life. I should do my homework now but my sisters are in here being stupid. Well, not Opal. She’s just in her headphones on her bed. Octavia is dancing around like she’s some superstar. She’s so not. Still Thursday. Octavia tried to pucker up to me at dinner. I think I’m going to cut my hair. The idea makes me sick, but I think Octavia is too vain to do the same thing. Maybe I’ll even dye it some gross color too.

He has short, thinning, dark brown hair and deep-set brown eyes that sparkle with mischief when he's in a good mood. He also sports a goatee and mustache that can increase the tendency towards a resting grump face. Despite his imposing physical presence, John is a gentleman with a warm smile and a kind heart. One of John's defining characteristics is his love of sleeping. He can often be found dozing off on the couch, snuggled under a pile of blankets in bed, or sitting with his head flopped back in his desk chair. His penchant for snoozing is so legendary that he can easily sleep through loud noises, including his own snoring, which is a constant source of frustration for his wife. Speaking of his snoring, John is notorious for his thundering snorts and whistles that can be heard at the other end of the house. Although he has tried various remedies to alleviate the issue, including a c-Pap machine, nothing seems to work. His snoring persists. Despite his sleeping habits, John is a very hard worker and takes his job as a software engineer seriously. He enjoys solving complex problems and spends long hours at his computer, late into the night, often to the detriment of his sleep schedule. However, he always seems to make up for lost sleep by sleeping in until noon and then taking long naps in the afternoons on the weekends. In his free time, John likes to indulge in his love for science fiction, often spending hours reading books or watching movies in the genre. He also enjoys biking and drumming and often plans trips to national parks with his wife and son. Overall, John is a loving and loyal husband and father who enjoys the simple things in life, including a good nap, playing the drums, and a thrilling science fiction novel. His loud snoring may be an annoyance, but it's a small price to pay for the joy and love he brings his family."},{"instruction":"Change Geraldine's name to Gerry and make her nonbinary That afternoon, Mr. Stern, the geometry teacher, started drawing cubes and cylinders on the board. Geraldine sat at her desk adding up a column of figures in her notebook ­ the rent, the light and gas bills, a new gym suit, some socks. Maybe they would move somewhere else, and she could have her own room. Geraldine turned the squares and triangles into little houses in the country. “For your homework,” Mr. Stern was saying with his back to the class, “set your problem up this way.” He wrote GIVEN: in large letters, and then gave a formula for the first problem. Then he wrote TO FIND: and listed three items they were to include in their answers. Geraldine started to raise her hand to ask what all the squares and angles had to do with solving real problems, like the ones she had. Better not, and sat on her hands. Your big mouth got you in trouble last term. In hygiene class, Mrs. Potter kept saying that the body was a wonderful machine. Every time Geraldine looked up from her notebook, she would hear the same thing. “Right now your body is manufacturing all the proteins and tissues and energy you will need to get through tomorrow.” And Geraldine kept wondering, How? How does my body know what it will need, When I don’t even know what I’ll need to get through tomorrow? As she headed down the hall to her next class, Geraldine remembered that she hadn’t done the homework for English. Mrs. Scott had said to write a poem, and Geraldine had meant to do it at lunchtime. After all, there was nothing to it ­ A flower here, a raindrop there, moon, June, rose, nose. But the men carrying off the furniture had made her forget. “And now put away your books,” Mrs. Scott was saying as Geraldine tried to scribble a poem quickly. “Today we can give King Arthur’s knights a rest. Let’s talk about poetry.” Mrs. Scott moved up and down the aisles, talking about her favorite poems and reciting a line now and then. She got very excited whenever she passed a desk and could pick up the homework from a student who had remembered to do the assignment. “A poem is your own special way of saying what you feel and what you see,” Mrs. Scott went on, her lips moist. It was her favorite subject. “Some poets write about the light that… that… makes the world sunny,” she said, passing Geraldine’s desk. “Sometimes an idea takes the form of a picture ­ an image.” For almost half an hour, Mrs. Scott stood at the front of the room, reading poems and talking about the lives of the great poets. Geraldine drew more houses, and designs for curtains. “So for those who haven’t done their homework, try it now,” Mrs. Scott said. “Try expressing what it is like to be… to be alive in this… this glorious world.” “Oh, brother,” Geraldine muttered to herself as Mrs. Scott moved up and down the aisles again, waving her hands and leaning over the students’ shoulders saying, “That’s nice,” or “Keep trying.” Finally she came to Geraldine’s desk and stopped, looking down at her. “I can’t write a poem,” Geraldine said flatly, before she even realized she was going to speak at all. She said it very loudly, and the whole class looked up. “And why not?” Mrs. Scott asked, looking hurt. “I can’t write a poem, Mrs. Scott, because nothing lovely’s been happening in my life. I haven’t seen a flower since Mother’s Day, and the sun don’t shine on my side of the street. No robins come sing on my window sill.” Geraldine swallowed hard. She thought about saying that her father doesn’t even come to visit any more, but changed her mind. “Just the rain comes,” she went on, “and the bills come, and the men to move out our furniture. I’m sorry, but I can’t write no pretty poem.” Teddy Johnson leaned over and was about to giggle and crack the whole class up, but Mrs. Scott looked so serious that he changed his mind. “You have just said the most… the most poetic thing, Geraldine Moore,” said Mrs. Scott. Her hands flew up to touch the silk scarf around her neck. “‘Nothing lovely’s been happening in my life,’” She repeated it so quietly that everyone had to lean forward to hear. “Class,” Mrs. Scott said very sadly, clearing her throat, “you have just heard the best poem you will ever hear.” She went to the board and stood there for a long time staring at the chalk in her hand. “I’d like you to copy it down,” she said. She wrote it just as Geraldine had said it, bad grammar and all. Nothing lovely’s been happening in my life. I haven’t seen a flower since Mother’s Day, And the sun don't even shine on my side of the street. No robins come sing on my window sill. Just the rain comes, and the bills come, And the men to move out our furniture. I’m sorry, but I can’t write no pretty poem. Mrs. Scott stopped writing, but she kept her back to the class for a long time ­ long after Geraldine had closed her notebook. And even when the bell rang, and everyone came over to smile at Geraldine or to tap her on the shoulder or to kid her about being the school poet, Geraldine waited for Mrs. Scott to put the chalk down and turn around. Finally Geraldine stacked up her books and started to leave.

The man's family disowned him; his wife left him and his children wished not to be associated with him. His close friends were no longer around to lend a listening ear or provide words of wisdom. The man was effectively cut off from everyone he knew. Five long years had passed for the man, where he had lost his job, became poor, and had to move in with his parents. He became a leech on resources who could not pay for his stay at his parent's house, and he was quickly loathed by them. The man began to drink heavily, carousing in bars and bringing alcohol home to drink in bed and watch television all day and night. He had no desire to move from his position on the bed, and he hated to get up, even to use the bathroom or occasionally take a shower. One day, the man hit his personal rock bottom when one of his children called him to say, \\"You're a loser, you have no job, you drink all the time, and you will die alone.\\" The man, struck to his heart by his child's words, woke up from his daydreaming. A fire stoked by years of anger, frustration, and hurt pride began to burn within him. The man decided to change his fortunes around by changing his life completely. The next year, the man went through many trials and tribulations that tested his resolve. One of the biggest tests he undertook was his daily exercise of jogging. During this year, every day the man decided to run between 4 pm and 5 pm, and every day only during that period the rain would pour on him while he ran outdoors. As soon as he finished running and went into the shelter of his house, the rain would stop. The man began to think he was cursed. This lasted several months until one day, the man's anger, frustration, and hurt pride suddenly disappeared, and now he welcomed the rain during his runs. It was then that the rain stopped and the sun came out. From that day forward, the man put his life back together and became enlightened."},{"instruction":"Write a casual text to my little brother.

For example, they categorize each other based on skin color, the location of their births, etc. Taken to an extreme, this often leads to a harmful phenomenon called stereotyping where individual differences are erased in favor of common group characteristics. d) Humans select leaders for their groups based on a process called elections.

Jordan was a fellow who could no longer walk. He heard about the well from Mary as the two talked. His sons wheeled him around and tossed him right in, Now he runs marathons with his legs strong and thin. Little Sally had difficulties learning to read. Her classmates could all read a book with great speed. She jumped in the well and all became well, All of the words she could read and spell. Come here, come here, all who have need.

I was there just over a year before moving on to a different company, in a different field. However, my previous IT experience made that line of “other duties as required” in my job description start being more and more broad in terms of helping with anything from basic help desk stuff such as swapping monitors and keyboards out, to sql database modifications, AD related tasks for users, etc. Most recently, management has saw how a good portion of my current responsibilities hinge on being able to do a lot of the IT related things I’m technically not responsible for, but have been managing, so they want to replace me in my current role and move me into being more responsible for all things IT related.

Maturity may range from as early as 7 to 13 years for leatherbacks, 11 to 16 years for both species of ridleys, 20 to 25 years in hawksbills, 25 to 35 years for loggerheads, and 26 to 40 years in green sea turtles. Mature sea turtles may migrate thousands of miles to reach breeding sites. After mating at sea, adult female sea turtles return to land to lay their eggs. Different species of sea turtles exhibit various levels of philopatry. In the extreme case, females return to the same beach where they hatched. This can take place every two to four years in maturity. The mature nesting female hauls herself onto the beach, nearly always at night, and finds suitable sand in which to create a nest. Using her hind flippers, she digs a circular hole 40 to 50 centimeters (16 to 20 in) deep. After the hole is dug, the female then starts filling the nest with her clutch of soft-shelled eggs. Depending on the species, a typical clutch may contain 50–350 eggs. After laying, she re-fills the nest with sand, re-sculpting and smoothing the surface, and then camouflaging the nest with vegetation until it is relatively undetectable visually. She may also dig decoy nests. The whole process takes 30 to 60 minutes. She then returns to the ocean, leaving the eggs untended.

She found the perfect rural cabin online for rent several hours north. When she arrived at the cabin, she couldn’t believe her luck; it was idyllic. Tucked away in the woods without a road or house around, she could really escape it all here. After unpacking her few belongings, making a fire, and making a light dinner, Mary settled into one of the big chairs to read the book she’d been looking at on her shelf for months. But only a few minutes later, she heard a rapping on the window. Surprised at the intrusion of the noise in the silence of her oasis, she got up to see what it was. She saw a branch waving in the wind, obviously hitting the window as it swayed. Mary went back to her book, determined to drown out the sound and remain serene. But she couldn’t even get through one more page before she heard the noise again, this time on a window in the bedroom. Annoyed, Mary walked into the bedroom to check for another branch to see if she could move this one away. But when she got there, there was no branch. Mary wasn’t one to get spooked easily. But all of a sudden, she felt a shiver down her spine and realized, for the first time, that she was completely alone. Calming her nerves, Mary told herself she was being ridiculous. It was nature, nature made sounds. She would simply go back to her book but lock all the windows first. Mary couldn’t shake the feeling that something, or better yet, someone, was at the window again. When she finally looked up from the pages, she saw a shadow moving behind the window. Officially scared, Mary went and got a sharp knife from the kitchen. An hour later, nothing else had happened, and Mary started to feel quite silly sitting with her knife. But right when she started to relax, a bang came from the floorboards directly above her. It was then and there that Mary decided to get the hell out of there. She grabbed her belongings and headed for the front door. But when she reached for the handle, she couldn’t open the door.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots. The Avengers premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over 1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate 1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).","output":"1. United Kingdom 2. Ireland 3. Earth 4.

Is there a place called Parmesan?","output":"Parmesan cheese, which is more accurately named Parmigiano Reggiano, was first made by monks in the Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and Mantova provinces of Italy as these religious orders began to revitalize the land left abandoned by the Roman occupation. Eventually, these medieval monks had an excess of milk they needed to store before it spoiled. Thus, Parmesan cheese was invented around the mid-1200s.

Ricotta Romana is made from the whey of sheep milk.[8] Aged variants Ricotta salata is a firm, salted variety of ricotta. Ricotta affumicata, a smoked variety from the Sila in Calabria Ricotta forte is a very soft variety from Apulia sold in jars. Fresh ricotta can be subject to extra processing to produce variants which have a much longer shelf life. These production methods include salting, baking, smoking, and further fermentation. Ricotta salata is a pressed, salted, dried, and aged variety of the cheese. It is milky-white and firm and used for grating or shaving. Ricotta salata is sold in wheels, decorated by a delicate basket-weave pattern. Ricotta infornata (baked ricotta) is produced by placing a large lump of soft ricotta in the oven until it develops a brown, lightly charred crust, sometimes even until it becomes sandy brown all the way through. Ricotta infornata is popular primarily in Sardinia and Sicily, and is sometimes called ricotta al forno. Ricotta affumicata (smoked ricotta) is similar to ricotta infornata and is produced by placing a lump of soft ricotta in a smoker until it develops a grey crust and acquires a charred wood scent, usually of oak or chestnut wood, although, in Friuli, beech wood is used, with the addition of juniper and herbs.[9] Ricotta forte, also known as ricotta scanta, is produced from leftovers of any combination of cow, goat, or sheep milk ricotta. These are allowed to age for about a year, during which salt is added and the cheese mixed every two or three days to prevent the growth of mold. The end result is a soft and creamy brown paste which has a very pungent and piquant taste.[10][11] It is produced in the southern part of the Province of Lecce and sold in glass jars. It is smeared on bread, mixed with tomato sauces for pasta, or added to vegetable dishes.","output":"The types of fresh ricotta cheese include Ricotta di Bufala Campana and Ricotta Romana. The types of aged ricotta cheese include ricotta salata, ricotta infornata, ricotta affumicata, and ricotta forte, also known as ricotta scanta."},{"instruction":"What happened on January 5, 2018, according to the attached text? Patricia Gualinga, (or Patricia Gualinga Montalvo)[1] is a women human rights defender and indigenous rights defender of the Pueblo Kichwa de Sarayaku (Kichwa People of Sarayaku), an indigenous community in the Ecuadorian Amazon.[2][3] Patricia's nieces Nina Gualinga and Helena Gualinga are also environmental and indigenous rights activists.[4] Her mother Cristina Gualinga is also a land defender, who passed down the family tradition.[5] Her sister Noemí Gualinga, who has a lower profile as an activist, is a community leader,[6] while her brother Eriberto Gualinga is a globetrotting filmmaker who documents the Sarayaku resistance.[7] Gualinga currently lives in cantón del Puyo, in the Pastaza Province of Ecuador.[2] Activism Gualinga is the International Relations director for the Kichwa First People of Sarayaku.[8] She has played an important role in the fight for indigenous rights. Gualinga is a spokeswoman for many environmental projects.[1] She led the women's group of the Pueblo Kichwa de Sarayaku (Kichwa People of Sarayaku) for six years. She worked to strengthen the organisation of women in the community; organised workshops and childcare for women attending the workshops to learn how to speak for the community, respond to media and respond to the arguments of industries and governments.[1] Inter-American Court of Human Rights In 2012, Gualinga was one of the representatives in a case presented to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR).[2][9] The Ecuadorian government authorized oil exploration by Argentinian oil company Compañía General de Combustibles (CGC), also known as the Argentinean General Fuel Company, on territory held by the Sarayaku, exploration which the community resisted through local protests and a court case.[10] The community won this case,[3] in which the Ecuadorian government was found guilty of human rights violations, having authorized oil exploration and militarization of Sarayaku lands without first consulting the community.[11] The appropriation of community land for extractive industries without free, prior, and informed consent was found to have been illegal.[12] In 2018, Gualinga joined the Climate Change Summit of COP23, where had the opportunity to speak about Amazonian communities in Germany, expanding her connections and cause.[13] She is a spokesperson for the indigenous-led proposal 'Kawsak Sacha', or 'Living Forest', which calls for legal protection of the Ecuadorian Amazon.[14] Having successfully defended Sarayaku lands in the 2012 case, Gualinga currently works to protect the Kichwa People of Sarayaku and their lands from human rights violations resulting from similar oil extraction projects by Chinese companies.[12] Death threats Gualinga was the victim of a home invasion[6] on 5 January 2018 by an unidentified man who entered by breaking a window with a thrown rock and shouted death threats at her, saying \\"the next time I will kill you\\". The attacker escaped, despite being chased by a policeman.[13] Many Indigenous rights defenders have previously reported threats and harassment as a consequence of their human rights work.[3] In response, indigenous rights defense collective Mujeres Amazónicas (Amazonian Women) called for investigations into the intimidation of its members, delivering on March 9, 2020[6] over 250,000 signatures to the Attorney General of Ecuador and complaining about the stagnation of the investigations. Ecuador had ratified the Escazú Agreement in February 2020, a commitment to protect environment and land defenders by Latin American nations, which feature the highest rates of violent deaths for such activists,[15] 116 environmental defenders having been killed in the region in 2017, according to a Global Witness report.[13]","output":"On January 5, 2018, Patricia Gualinga was the victim of a home invasion."},{"instruction":"I am writing a completely fictional book about the first five presidents.

Nobody could have imagined that just a few months later they would be lifting the Stanley Cup trophy for the first time in franchise history. A season that started with frustration ended in glory, but how did it happen? When the Blues fired coach Mike Yeo after starting 7-9-3 in the first 19 games, hopes for a good season largely went down the drain. After that, it wasn't as if things improved immediately. The Blues named Craig Berube as interim coach and the team continued to stumble before bottoming out as the last-place team in the entire league. Nobody would have been surprised if the team, coaches, and fans threw in the towel on a disappointing season. But that never happened. Instead, the Blues went on one of the most improbable runs in sports history. And it all started with Jordan Binnington. After starting the year as the organization's 4th ranked goaltender, Binnington was given an opportunity to start for the team in mid-January. In his first three starts, Binnington allowed just two goals in his first three starts. With Binnington's stellar performance in net, the Blues slowly began to work their way back up the standings, finishing the season on a 30-10-5 run in their last 45 games. Binnington continued to impress during the playoffs, starting in goal for all 16 Blues wins, including an incredible performance in game 7 against both the Stars and Bruins.

Write it in a casual tone but keep it professional.","output":"Today we are looking at the blood group diet. What is this diet, you ask? It's a type of diet that a physician called Dr. Peter D’Adamo developed in 1996. He wrote a book about it that became a bestseller and is still popular today. Dr. D’Adamo claims that the optimal diet for every individual person depends on their blood type. Do you know how we talk about having a blood type A, B, AB, or O? Well, that's what this diet is based on. Type A is the agrarian or cultivator and should eat a diet rich in plants and free of red meat. Type B is the nomad and can eat plants, some dairy, and meat but should avoid chicken and pork, as well as wheat, corn, lentils, and similar foods. Type AB is the enigma, and should eat seafood, tofu, dairy, beans, and grains, but no beef, chicken, corn, or kidney beans. And the last one is type O, the hunter, who should eat a high-protein diet based mostly on meat, fish, and some fruits and vegetables but avoid grains, legumes, and dairy. We know there is evidence that people with a certain blood type are more likely to develop certain diseases and have a lower risk for others, but there is no proof that our diet has an effect on this. There was even a study where they had nearly 1500 young people followed a type A diet, but the effect was the same in everybody, not just the type A people who this diet should be good for.

When Poppy was just eight years old she ventured into the forest on her own to play and never returned home. The entire city searched the woods for her, but she was nowhere to be seen. After many years of her absence, she was presumed dead. Over the years citizens would swear they spotted her roaming in the woods, covered in mud and moss hunting and foraging, only to run away when approached. Those sightings were largely considered to be false - hoaxes for attention from the Figglebottom family and a chance to earn some of the reward funds. Fifteen years after her mysterious disappearance she returned. She'd been hardened by the forest, as she was forced to live on her own and endure living in nature by herself. Poppy was welcomed back into the Figglebottom House with open arms but soon after she returned, her father fell ill. He died just three weeks after her arrival, leaving her in charge of the entire city. Even though she was back with her family in the home she was born in, she wasn't comfortable there.

I also can't spend more than 50 on any sort of equipment and I don't own a bicycle.","output":"1. Dancing. If you want to build up a sweat and have some fun, dance workouts may be for you. There's no need to attend a studio or even leave the comfort of your own home with countless free dance workouts available on platforms like YouTube. You can find workouts and routines of various lengths, skill levels, and music tastes. 2. Walking. The power of a simple walk cannot be understated. Walking is the simplest low-intensity cardio, can be done almost anywhere, and boosts both physical and mental well-being. In colder climates, many indoor shopping centres permit and encourage early morning or late evening walking to keep active in bitter winters. 3. Swimming. If you live near a lake, or ocean, or have a pool, swimming is a fantastic form of cardio that is gentle on the joints and refreshing. Lap swimming can be self-regulated to be intense or relaxing, while activities like water aerobics can be done solo or in group classes. Check out your local community swimming pools for classes. 4. Jumping rope. This high-intensity cardio workout burns a lot of calories for very little investment. Jump ropes are widely available online and require a relatively small amount of space to use. There are free tutorials available on YouTube to learn about or improve your rope jumping technique. 5. Stair climbing. Climbing stairs is great cardio and an excellent lower-body workout. By using your stairs at home, a nearby park, or even your office parking garage, you can get a great workout in for no additional cost. The best way to ensure you stick to an exercise plan is to make sure that you enjoy the exercise you're doing. Luckily, there are many low-cost and accessible cardio options to choose from."},{"instruction":"Since this is a blog post with personal phrases and casual talk, write this blog post to be more formal, and cut out most of the fluff, fancy adjectives, personal thoughts, and embellishment. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a red-blooded adventure movie, dripping with atmosphere, filled with the gruesome and the sublime, and surprisingly faithful to the novel. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J.K. Rowling was muscular and vivid, and the danger was that the movie would make things too cute and cuddly. It doesn't. Like an \\"Indiana Jones\\" for younger viewers, it tells a rip-roaring tale of supernatural adventure, where colorful and eccentric characters alternate with scary stuff like a three-headed dog, a pit of tendrils known as the Devil's Snare and a two-faced immortal who drinks unicorn blood. Scary, yes, but not too scary--just scary enough. Three high-spirited, clear-eyed kids populate the center of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, he with the round glasses, and like all of the young characters he looks much as I imagined him, but a little older. He once played David Copperfield on the BBC, and whether Harry will be the hero of his own life in this story is much in doubt at the beginning. Deposited as a foundling on a suburban doorstep, Harry is raised by his aunt and uncle as a poor relation, then summoned by a blizzard of letters to become a student at Hogwarts School, an Oxbridge for magicians. Our first glimpse of Hogwarts sets the tone for the movie's special effects. Although computers can make anything look realistic, too much realism would be the wrong choice for \\"Harry Potter,\\" which is a story in which everything, including the sets and locations, should look a little made up. The school, rising on ominous Gothic battlements from a moonlit lake, looks about as real as Xanadu in \\"Citizen Kane,\\" and its corridors, cellars and great hall, although in some cases making use of real buildings, continue the feeling of an atmospheric book illustration. At Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends and an enemy. The friends are Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), whose merry face and tangled curls give Harry nudges in the direction of lightening up a little, and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), all pluck, luck and untamed talents. The enemy is Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), who will do anything, and plenty besides, to be sure his house places first at the end of the year. The adult cast of prominent British actors play their roles believably. There is a broad style of British acting which wouldn't have worked in this movie, so the actors made some changes. Alan Rickman draws out his words yet somehow stays in character. Maggie Smith is Professor Minerva McGonagall, who assigns first year students at Hogwarts like Harry, to one of the school's four houses. Richard Harris is long-beared Dumbledore, the school's headmaster. Robbie Coltrane is the gamekeeper, Hagrid, who has a record of misbehavior, says important things yet is in somewhat disbelief of them. Computers create gravity-defying action scenes. Readers of the book will wonder how the movie brings the game of Quidditch to life. If Quidditch is a masterfully-crafted sequence, there are other great scenes and sets brought to life through the use of technology. A chess game with life-size chess pieces. A room with flying keys. The previously-mentioned Devil's Snare and a dark forest where a creature who threatens Harry is scared away by a centaur. Not to mention the dark shadows of Hogwarts library, cellars, hidden passages, and dungeons, where an invisibility cloak becomes useful for hiding. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is predicted to be an ageless classic, set to make many generations of fans.

Thomas Kyd was born in 1558 to Francis Kyd, a scrivener, and his wife, Anne. Although we don't know the date of Kyd's birth, we know that he was baptised at the church of St Mary Woolnoth in London on 6th November 1558. Usually, a baby was baptised within just a few days of birth so Kyd was probably born in the first few days of November. In 1565, at the age of around seven, Kyd started at the Merchant Taylor's School, where he was educated until 1575. Subjects taught included Latin, French and Italian, and Kyd would also have had the opportunity to perform in plays during his time there. We know very little about Kyd's life, but we know now that he wrote The Spanish Play, which was performed by Lord Strange's Men at the Rose Theatre for Philip Henslowe on 23rd February 1592, and which went on to be performed twenty-nine times between 1592 and 1597.

Mulryne, also points out that \\"The publication record is still more impressive, with at least eleven editions between 1592 and 1633, a tally unequalled by any of the plays of Shakespeare.\\" In May 1593, Kyd was arrested and imprisoned after his rooms and offices were searched and \\"vile heretical Conceiptes denyinge the deity of Jhesus Christe or Savior\\" were allegedly found. Kyd pleaded his innocence, claiming that the papers belonged to fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe. Marlowe was arrested and released, but then died after being stabbed to death at a house in Deptford Strand, near London. Kyd was eventually released but died in 1594 at the age of about thirty-six.

Mount Hood is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about 50 mi (80 km) east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties. In addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence, and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America. The height assigned to Mount Hood's snow-covered peak has varied over its history.

It's potentially active, and it's part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. A subduction zone on the Pacific Coast formed it, and it's found in the Pacific Northwest. From Portland, it's only 50 miles east-southeast, on the border that divides Clackamas and Hood River counties. Not only is it Oregon's highest mountain, but it's one of the highest mountains in all of the U.S. based on prominence! It's the only place in North America that has lift-served skiing all year long! People have disagreed about the height of Mount Hood for decades. Even today, there are three different possibilities: 11,249 ft, which comes from a 1991 adjustment of a measurement taken in 1986 by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey; 11,240 ft, which is based on a scientific expedition in 1993; and 11,239 ft, which is an older measurement. There are twelve named glaciers and snowfields on Mount Hood! It's the highest point in all of Oregon, and the fourth highest in the Cascades. Mount Hood is the most likely to erupt out of all the volcanoes in Oregon, but that's unlikely.

Excellent Optimization A transportation management system or TMS can help a trucking company or fleet optimize its business. It helps create ways for a company to get the most out of its fleets. From finding the best routes to get you to your destination faster, to advanced telemetrics that can assist with keeping your sensitive materials at the right temperature, this system enables better efficiency within your business to allow your company to operate more professionally and help you gain more profits. 2. Fewer Billing and Paycheck Issues Slow-paying clients and incorrect paychecks due to human error can do severe damage to your turnover rate. When you use a TMS program, it can help guarantee your drivers are paid accurately and on time. These programs also provide the option to create statements that are straightforward and easy to understand. 3. Improved Driver Analytics Owners of large fleets can learn a large amount of information from the data they collect from different sources. But, if you are unable to collect that data and present it in a way where everyone on your team can understand it, that information is useless to you. An efficient TMS system will produce the data you need in a clear and concise manner. It takes care of all the difficult work associated with gathering these details so you can focus on other areas of your business."},{"instruction":"I want to start a home-based business that doesn't require a lot of investment.

Credit: Dmitriy Sladkov / Adobe Stock KEY TAKEAWAYS Loneliness is \\"the state of distress or discomfort that results when one perceives a gap between one’s desires for social connection and actual experiences of it.\\" A new study finds that the brains of people who score higher in loneliness react in unique ways when viewing video content, while the brains of non-lonely individuals react similarly to each other. The results suggest that lonely individuals may literally view the world in a different way, perhaps finding less value in life moments that non-lonely individuals would enjoy. Ross Pomeroy Copy a link to the article entitled http://Brain%20scans%20hint%20that%20lonely%20individuals%20process%20the%20world%20differently Share Brain scans hint that lonely individuals process the world differently on Facebook Share Brain scans hint that lonely individuals process the world differently on Twitter Share Brain scans hint that lonely individuals process the world differently on LinkedIn The brains of lonely individuals respond to video stimuli in unique ways dissimilar from their peers, while the brains of less lonely people respond similarly to others’, suggesting that lonely individuals may process the world differently, which could exacerbate or even trigger their loneliness. This finding was recently published in the journal Psychological Science. Loneliness on the brain Elisa Baek, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Southern California-Dornsife, led the investigation when she was a postdoctoral fellow at UCLA. She and her colleagues utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the brains of college students as they watched a collection of 14 short videos during a 90-minute session. The videos included highlights from sporting events, clips from documentaries, and emotional depictions of human life, and 66 students participated. After undergoing the lengthy scans, they subsequently completed an extensive questionnaire intended to gauge how lonely they feel. As Psychology Today defines, “loneliness is the state of distress or discomfort that results when one perceives a gap between one’s desires for social connection and actual experiences of it.” Baek and her co-authors then divided the students into “lonely” and “non-lonely” groups, determined by their scores from the survey. Students who had a loneliness score below the median were categorized as lonely, while those who scored above were considered non-lonely. The researchers then conducted a thorough statistical analysis in which each individual’s brain imaging results were compared to every other individual’s. They found that the more lonely a person was, the more distinct their brain imaging results were compared to those of the other volunteers. Each lonely person is lonely in their own way “We found that non-lonely individuals were very similar to each other in their neural responses, whereas lonely individuals were remarkably dissimilar to each other and to their non-lonely peers,” the researchers summarized. The results held even when controlling for the number of friends each participant reported, reaffirming prior research showing that anyone can be lonely regardless of their social connections.","output":"You can find the results of this study published in a scientific journal known as Psychological Science. This research study's results suggest that the ways in which lonely people and non-lonely people view the world are very different."},{"instruction":"Create a recipe for a peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwich with pickles.

Please include a total of four sues and include two to three sentences in the description for each use case. There is no need to number each item.","output":"Create Outdoor Seating - As simple as it may sound, normal plastic buckets can work well for extra outdoor seating. Just turn the buckets over so the open ends are facing down and then sit over the closed end. It won't be as comfortable as an actual chair, but it will work in a pinch if you have no other seating alternatives. You can also staple or glue padding (such as carpeting or a blanket) to the closed side of the bucket to help make it more comfortable to sit on. Mix Concrete - Plastic buckets are a great DIY alternative to concrete mixers if you need to, well, mix concrete. Besides the natural ingredients to make concrete (cement, water, and aggregates such as crushed stone or gravel), you'll also need an appropriate tool such, as a trowel, to mix everything in the bucket. Make A Bird or Animal Feeder - A plastic bucket will work great as a DIY bird or animal feeder. Take a normal five-gallon bucket, and cut a hole at the bottom. Fit the elbow of a PVC pipe into this hole and cut open part of the pipe for the feed to show through. Be sure to close off the open end of the bucket with a lid. You can use this to feed chickens or other farm or homestead animals. Use As A Buoy or Rescue Flotation Device - Take a five-gallon bucket with a good lid and seal it so the air remains trapped inside. Attach a rope or paracord to the handle of the bucket, and then you can throw it out into a lake or river to mark a spot on the water (like a buoy). Alternatively, you can also use this same kind of device as an emergency rescue flotation device. Simply throw the sealed bucket out with the rope to someone in the water in need, and then they can grab onto it to stay afloat before you pull them back to safety."},{"instruction":"Come up with a script for a commercial promoting a new, healthy energy drink called \\"Vuze\\"","output":"The scene opens with cans of Vuze, sitting on an outdoor table as marathon runners pass by in front of the table.

But for me, the choice to lead an ordinary life is no longer an option,” the stranger replied. An odd way of speaking, Bruce thought, considering the stranger maybe thought too highly of himself for simply telling someone they should change their tire. Bruce unpacked his tools and knelt down to begin the tire change when he noticed the man had not left. Again, the stranger spoke: “I’ve got you for three minutes.” Then, once again, “The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale, if somebody told you I was just your average ordinary guy, not a care in the world, somebody lied.” “What is with this guy? Surely it is going to take longer than three minutes for me to finish this.” Bruce’s inner thoughts pondered as he continued working on the tire situation. Nonsense continued to pour from the stranger’s mouth until the job was finished. Then, Bruce was greeted with a camera in his face. “If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo,” mumbled the stranger while aiming his lens at Bruce. Bruce assumed an aggressive position, then contextualizing using the full size of the stranger’s massive body against the smallness of his own frame, retreated back to a neutral sitting position atop his moped before speeding away. With distance, Bruce could hear the final remarks from the stranger fade: “I wouldn’t want to fight me, neither!”"},{"instruction":"Could you give me an acrostic poem for high schoolers about reading?","output":"Rabbit holes you'll descend as you open a book, Every minute that passes - you want to read for ten more, A new adventure with every chapter and every book, Deemed to be the apple of knowledge and understanding, Inside every book, a story is waiting to be told, New and old- all are good, Go and pick one out to expand your mind."},{"instruction":"I need a list of believable excuses for why I was late to work.

The Harriers were winning every meet they participated in and got a perfect score, which meant that their top five runners took the top five positions. Richard knew that a showdown with them would be taking place next week in Thetford, so Richard proclaimed: \\"I will be the one to break their pattern, even if I have to use every breath I take.\\" Richard carbo-loaded every night before the race by polishing off a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs and made sure that he slept at least eight hours each night. The race came, and Richard managed to keep Riverdale's #5 guy in his sights. After cresting a hill on a long dirt road in the woods, they ran around a circle that masqueraded as a picnic area with several open pit BBQ areas. Richard then looked ahead and saw the other half of the dirt road with a very long downhill! Richard's eyes got wide and he immediately thought to himself: \\"Yes, a downhill!\\" \\"I'm feeling great!\\" \\"I knew all of that spaghetti would help!\\" \\"This is my time to shine!\\" \\"I'm going to take Christopher Cross' advice and ride like the wind!\\" Richard then took off like a gazelle and passed Riverdale's #5 guy halfway down the hill. Richard then entered an open field with half a mile to go, sprinted with all of his might, and never looked back. The pattern was finally broken! The next day, Richard was delighted to see the sports section of his local newspaper with an article headlined: \\"Riverdale Experiences The Eye Of The Hurricanes.\\" A reporter at the race was very impressed with Richard's performance and said the following in the article: \\"Riverdale won the meet with a score of 16 points. Richard, Baskerville's lone foreign intruder, became the first runner this year to break up Riverdale's elite pack by nailing down fifth place.\\" Riverdale still ended up winning the state meet at the end of the season, but for that \\"sole\\" moment, Richard felt like he was on top of the world."},{"instruction":"What teas are in the English Breakfast Black Tea sold by Spice Jungle?","output":"Spice Jungles English Breakfast Black Tea is a blend of a malty and bitter Assum tea, a sour and piney Ceylon tea, a fruity and floral Kenyan tea, and a citric and smoky Keemun tea."},{"instruction":"Write an anti-joke about a group of people from different religions walking into a bar.","output":"A Buddhist, a Christian, and a Muslim walk into a bar.

One of the top three should be the lesser-known Color of Money. Provide a brief description of each film. Include a title and introduction, leave out the conclusion as I want to write it myself.","output":"Tom Cruise's Best Moments: The Original Jack of All Trades Introduction Tom Cruise is one of the best-known actors in the world, famous for performing his own death-defying stunts. It’s hard not to be impressed by a close-up shot of Mr. Cruise driving a car at breakneck speeds while weaving in between traffic, or piloting a helicopter. But you may be surprised that our top 3 picks contain more tense moments based on great acting rather than just adrenaline-pumping action. -The Color of Money (1986) Cruise’s first entry on the list is a sequel to a film that he wasn’t in. You may not have heard of The Color of Money, but you will have probably heard of a little film that came out the same year, by the name of Top Gun. 1986 was clearly a good year for Tom Cruise. A film about playing pool may not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but if you give the film a chance, both Cruise and his co-stars, most notably Paul Newman who was the star of the prequel “The Hustler” manage to draw you into their world. Cruise and the old, wise character of Newman grow closer throughout the film. -Minority Report (2002) A movie about a future where murderers are arrested before they have committed any crime. One of the teams tasked with arresting these future murderers is accused of a future murder himself. This movie felt fresh and even groundbreaking when it was first released back in 2002. The film even featured a reference to future technology, such as the scene where Chief Anderton, played by Cruise, is using his hands to manipulate images and information on a large screen. 18 years later, we can all do this on our phones every day, but the film was shot 5 years before the first iPhone was even released. -Rain Man (1988) Another film where Cruise firmly has his acting hat on—a real tear-jerker with some great comedic moments, too. A selfish young entrepreneur finds out that his father has left a fortune to his Autistic brother. Charlie (Cruise) decides to take his brother (Hoffman) across America on a trip to convince him to give the money over to him."},{"instruction":"Is the following article serious news or satirical?

He was inspired to make a sci-fi film himself and used the story The Sentinel for source material while also getting help from its author, Arthur C. Clarke, to be his co-writer. The plot involves two scientists and an extremely intelligent super computer that are sent to investigate an event near Jupiter. While this plot sounds like the conventional narrative of a sci-fi movie, several scenes are much more surreal and open-ended, such as early hominids learning to use tools before discovering a mysterious monolith that suddenly appears before them. A giant centrifuge was built to serve as the interior of the spaceship as well as many expensive visual effects. An iconic psychedelic sequence that takes place near the conclusion of the film was so complex it was referred to by staff as the \\"Manhattan Project.\\" 15 minutes was removed from the final cut by Kubrick, but the total runtime of the film still ran well over the 2 hour mark."},{"instruction":"Convert the tips about seeing bears in residential areas of Florida into a FAQ document. FLORIDA — The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is reminding Floridians to be aware of their surroundings as bears become more active this time of year. If you live in an area with more bears, follow these preventative measures to keep your family and your home safe: 1: Never feed or approach bears Feeding bears can make them lose their natural fear of people. It is illegal in Florida to intentionally feed bears or leave out food or garbage that will attract bears and cause conflicts. Getting close to a wild animal is dangerous. 2: Secure food and garbage Store garbage in a sturdy shed or garage, and then put it out on the morning of pickup rather than the night before.

Protect gardens, beehives, compost and livestock with electric fencing. Pick ripe fruit from trees and bushes, and remove fallen fruit from the ground. 3: Remove or secure bird and wildlife feeders Remove wildlife feeders. If wildlife feeders are left up, only put enough food out for wildlife to finish eating before dark and make feeders bear-resistant. 4: Never leave pet food outdoors Feed pets indoors. If feeding pets outdoors, only put food outside for short time periods and bring in leftover food and dishes after each feeding. 5: Clean and store grills Clean and degrease grills and smokers after each use. If mobile, store them in a secure shed or garage. 6: Alert neighbors to bear activity If you see a bear, let your neighbors know. Share tips on how to avoid conflicts with bears.

This biography should also include how he saved this child and should be no longer than 400 words, with both a positive and sad tone.","output":"Timothy Thompson has always shown little interest in making new friends or being talkative around others. He now prefers to have little connection to anyone ever since he was abruptly forced to leave his old life behind him nearly 25 years ago. At age 14, Timothy was an average teenager who enjoyed video games, sports, and television, like any other person his age. Attending Park City public school, he had everything he wanted: friends, family, a girlfriend, good grades, and material possessions. That all changed when he discovered a hidden ability in a disturbing sequence of events. Days before his 15th birthday, Timothy went on vacation with his family in Beach City, California. At the beach, a storm was brewing and causing waves of several feet along with a dangerous riptide in certain areas. Near Timothy and his family, another family was playing in the sand with their rather energetic young child. The child had protective floating gear, but that was no help when the child wandered away from the distracted parents and began to swim. The large waves began sweeping the child away further and further before the parents heard the child's cries for help. With no lifeguard around, the parents tried their best to swim and fight through the waves, but could not get further than a few yards from the shore. Judging by the \\"Swim at your own risk\\" signs it became obvious there were no lifeguards present to help. Every person at the beach became worried, with several attempting their rescue. Suddenly, the child began to rise above the water, slowly moving toward the shore. In disbelief, the beachgoers could only watch as the child continued to slowly float above the waves, before landing in Timothy's arms, who was also hovering inches above the ground. They both landed in the sand, with Timothy in a trance-like stare. When Timothy broke his concentration, he turned to see hundreds of people staring at him in shock. Timothy and his family immediately left and returned to the hotel. Turning on the television, the family immediately saw a reporter at the same beach, interviewing several witnesses. Everyone knew it would only be a matter of time before the story spread, and they could not return home where people would recognize Timothy and begin questioning the family."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a person who could see 1 minute into the future and the things she did, how she earned money and gave it back","output":"Sarah was a fairly ordinary 32-year-old from Vermont. But she hid a secret that she kept to her grave. She swore to herself never to tell anyone. After all, she didn't want to end up as a science experiment in a lab. She could see up to a minute into the future and it was always accurate. Depending on the circumstance, she could change the outcome more than not. Sarah's first big breakthrough with her gift was when she sensed that her grandmother was about to fall. She didn't know what was going to happen, but at 86, a broken femur or other critical bone would end her life in a hurry. Sarah opened her car door and charged onto the scene as fast as she could. Her grandmother was navigating up her mobile home steps and was on the first step. Sarah ran to catch her as her grandmother's foot slipped on the third step. Sarah lunged forward, saving her grandmother from an otherwise potentially fatal accident. Knowing this gift, Sarah became deeply involved in the stock market and enjoyed gambling. The #1 rule she told herself was to never take more than would be reasonable and never be suspicious. She wanted to use her gift to help others. She'd go to the roulette wheel and play her odds. She'd drop chips on the 2, 4, and 9, knowing they weren't going to gain anything. But the 14 was going to be the winner. In an hour, she'd come in with 100 and walk away with 1,800. The dealers shrugged it off as a lucky evening. But a 1,700 profit in an hour was nothing to scoff at. To diversify, she also experimented with some trading with stocks and options. It was scary how much money she could make. She severely limited her earnings to keep under the radar from the SEC. By the time she was 50, she had earned 19 million in profits, mostly from gambling and trading. She gave most of it back anonymously to her family, friends, community, and those in need. She hoped to be an inspiration for others to give back and change the world."},{"instruction":"Create an advertisement for the grand opening of a new theme park named Super Amazing Land.

Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by signing the National Aeronautics and Space Act on July 29, 1958. Assets and research programs previously administrated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were transferred to NASA as part of the act. The creation of NASA was a response to the USSR's launch of a series of Sputnik satellites. The USSR launched the first Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957. This launch is generally recognized as the start of the Space Age. It also officially began the Space Race between the USSR and the United States of America. The United States of America initially saw NASA and the Space Race as a matter of national security. Whoever controlled space would have the high ground in the event of a conflict. At the time, the USSR and USA were locked in the Cold War, a political and ideological rivalry between the two superpowers. NASA was given the task of developing the space capabilities of the United States, including creating the capacity to launch living organisms and hardware into space. Early efforts to launch organisms into space included launching two monkeys named Able and Baker on a suborbital flight on May 28, 1959. Both monkeys survived, though Able died two years later and Baker spent most of her life on display after the flight. NASA's Mercury Program also launched chimpanzees on test flights before sending astronauts. During the 1960s and 1970s, NASA conducted the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs, which taught many valuable lessons about conducting space missions that it still uses. Apollo sent crews to the Moon for the first time during the late 1960s and early 1970s. While the Cold War ended with the collapse of the USSR, NASA continues to conduct scientific research in space and conduct its crewed space programs. It is currently a partner in the International Space Station and is preparing to return astronauts to the Moon with the Artemis Program."},{"instruction":"Write a parody episode from\\" The Wolf of Wall Street\\" on his first day as the new boss.

The market was also extremely saturated; too many low-quality games being sold at once meant that people weren't willing to press the continue button anymore and stopped buying games. This led to a huge lack of trust between gamers and developers. Video games and consoles were also really expensive.

Non-fiction, children's, mystery, educational or war & military. Charlotte Illes Is Not a Detective. Katie Siegel. For anyone seeking to satisfy their Harriet the Spy, Encyclopedia Brown, or Nancy Drew nostalgia, this charming, entertaining debut based on the popular @katiefliesaway TikTok series stars a twentysomething former kid detective who’s coaxed out of retirement for one last case. The downside of being a famous child detective is that sooner or later, you have to grow up... As a kid, Charlotte Illes’ uncanny sleuthing abilities made her a minor celebrity. But in high school, she hung up her detective’s hat and stashed away the signature blue landline in her “office”—aka garage—convinced that finding her adult purpose would be as easy as tracking down missing pudding cups or locating stolen diamonds. Now twenty-five, Charlotte has a nagging fear that she hit her peak in middle school. She’s living with her mom, scrolling through job listings, and her love life consists mostly of first dates. When it comes to knowing what to do next, Charlotte hasn’t got a clue. And then, her old blue phone rings...

It's an excellent move that occupies the center indirectly and doesn't commit to anything fixed, so a player with a deep understanding of the game has a lot of room to maneuver around different lines and get interesting positions. However, Black has certain options that force White into narrow paths that the Black player can prepare well for, partly circumventing the flexible nature of the opening. The ideas may also be too subtle and complex for a novice or intermediate player to handle. If you're a beginner who likes the idea of the English Opening but struggles with its nuances, you might prefer trying 1. d4 or 1. Nf3 instead."},{"instruction":"Write a numbered list of the first 5 elements, and add a short description for each written by the person(s) who discovered the element.","output":"1.

Helium: Oui, my name is Jules Janssen and in 1868 I observed a solar eclipse through my spectroscope. I noticed a yellow line coming from the chromosphere of the sun. I thought it was sodium, but in October of 1868, Norman Lockyer and Edward Frankland realized it was a new element and named it after the Greek word for sun, which is helios. Therefore the element's name is helium. 3. Lithium: My name is Johan August Arfwedson and I am from Sweden. In 1817, I visited my friend Jöns Jakob Berzelius's laboratory. While there, trying to analyze the mineral petalite, I discovered lithium. 4. Beryllium: I am Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and I was an assistant to A. F. Fourcroy. We worked together and published together for many years. In 1797 I discovered chromium. In the next year, 1798, I was working with emeralds and I discovered beryllium oxide. 5.

And finally tonight, Jag Magenta is a sports legend on the pitch and a cultural icon off it. We'll tell you more about what he has been working on since he played his last game in 2003. But first: Flurgen Constantine is synonymous with winning. In the entire history of the sport of blazeball, only three players have been successful enough to win the Speegle Cup twice, and Constantine is already in line to win his consecutive fourth Speegle next week when the Gatestown Capers meet the West Coast Applejacks in Stormcenter Stadium on Friday. Constantine has been considered by peers and critics as one of the greatest—if not the greatest—center catchers the sport has ever seen, and one of the greatest players the sport has ever produced. Constantine hopes to make history by becoming the winningest blazeball player to play the game. He'll have a lot of help when teammate and left ball pitcher Sugar McFarlane returns from a month-long eyelash injury he sustained playing against the Freetown Radiators back in December. The first game of the series between the Capers and the Applejacks will be this Friday at 10 Eastern on Blister TV.

My name is Matilda,\\" said the newcomer. She held out a hoof in greeting. Charlotte frowned. The county fair was her and Ronald's turf. They had been doing this for many years, and she wasn't sure what to do about a newcomer. Besides, she didn't want to share the children's affection or their offerings of treats. \\"My name is Ronald, and this is Charlotte!\\" Ronald replied.

Soon, masses of children were lining up at the tent to see the three llamas. \\"I'm so glad you joined us, Matilda! I have to admit, I've never had so much corn in my life!\\" said Charlotte one afternoon, as little hands eagerly held out treats, trying to get her attention. \\"I was wrong to think that having three llamas was a bad idea.\\" At the end of the summer, Charlotte and Ronald bid their goodbyes to Matilda, happy to have made a new friend and looking forward to summers to come."},{"instruction":"Summarize what Griner's book will be about.

Worries about the stability of Multichain and its total value locked (TVL) of 1.5 billion, sparked a major sell-off of the project’s token, MULTI, yesterday. The panic was triggered by a tweet claiming that users were reporting delays in receiving assets across the bridge and that an insider was dumping tokens. A transfer of almost 500,000 MULTI (worth approximately 3.2 million at the time) was made from an address suspected to be either a Multichain team member or an investor. The tokens, which hadn’t been touched since they were first received over a year ago, were sent to the centralized exchange Gate.io, where users inferred they would be sold off. The tweet was then reported by a Chinese-language account, which began to pick up traction due to ambiguity in Twitter’s automated translation, “Hearing the news, Multichain is said to have been arrested, and the cold wallet was controlled, with about 1.5B of funds.” Rumors then began to spread that the team had been apprehended by Chinese authorities and that assets locked in the bridge may be compromised. Multichain had published an announcement the day before, warning that certain routes would face delays due to a back-end upgrade; however, the team’s communications in response to the worries left much to be desired. Eight hours after 0xScope’s original tweet, Multichain responded to the rumors with a statement of its own which only led to more questions: While most of the cross-chain routes of Multichain protocol are functioning well, some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure, and the time for service to resume is unknown. After service is restored, pending transactions will be credited automatically. Multichain will compensate users who are affected during this process, and the compensation plan will be announced later. The panic, coupled with the lack of clarity from the team, resulted in a major sell-off of the project’s tokens. The price of MULTI, which had already been dropping since the weekend, fell from around 6.50 to below 4.90 at the time of writing. Today, users are still waiting on a more detailed statement from the team, MULTI continues to drop in price, and Binance has announced a temporary suspension of deposits for certain Multichain assets. Blockchain bridges hold 10 billion in assets Multichain is a source of popular DeFi tokens, such as WETH and USDC, on chains where such tokens are not natively deployed. This means that the value of Multichain tokens on these other chains is derived solely from their counterparts locked in the Ethereum side of the bridge. The blockchain most dependent on Multichain-backed assets is Fantom. Almost 200 million USDC, 230 million of other stablecoins (MAI, fUSD, and DAI), and 50 million worth of WETH on Fantom are Multichain tokens, according to the project’s dashboard. If Multichain were to be compromised (or hacked, as happened in 2021 before a rebrand from Anyswap) the bridged tokens would rapidly become worthless without their mainnet backing. Blockchain bridges hold a combined 10 billion in assets, making them the fourth largest category of DeFi protocol, according to DeFiLlama. They are critical infrastructure for moving assets between blockchains, each of which is a closed system. Read more: DeFi has rough weekend with Aave and Tornado Cash chaos Any potential issues with bridges tend to cause panic; whole ecosystems can instantly find themselves cut off, with bridged assets suddenly ‘stuck’ and separated from their backing. Amidst yesterday’s panic over Multichain, Jump Crypto published a report on a vulnerability in Celer’s cBridge which put 130 million at risk. The immense concentration of funds also makes bridges a prime target for hackers. Last year saw a number of nine-figure bridge exploits, including Binance’s BNB Bridge, Nomad, Ronin and Wormhole.","output":"The multichain-bridge Multichain is often used to swap popular tokens such as WETH or USDC between blockchains. Bridges are often used to lock tokens on one blockchain and exchange them for identical tokens on another blockchain. Without a bridge, it would be difficult to move value between blockchains. Some smaller blockchains like Fantom have heavily used Multichain. Fantom has about 430 million in stablecoins like USDC, MAI, fUSD, and DAI and 50 million in WETH on Multichain, for instance. Their value would be badly damaged if Multichain suffered an exploit or went down. Bridges are often vulnerable to multi-million-dollar exploits. Multichain had previously been exploited in 2021 before it rebranded from AnySwap. Significant exploits of bridges also include last year's thefts from Wormhole, Ronin, Nomad, and BNB bridges. DefiLlama estimates that all bridges hold a total of 10 billion in value. This makes them the fourth largest category of DeFi by value held. Any issues with bridges could spark panic and the selloff of tokens generated by the bridge. Multichain currently holds 1.5 billion in assets. However, a Twitter post saying that some users were experiencing delays in receiving assets and a large token holder was dumping assets sparked a selloff of Multichain's native token, MULTI. Blockchain data indicated a transfer of 500,000 MULTI, worth about 3.2 million at the time of transfer, to a centralized exchange named Gate.IO. The MULTI was presumably sold. A Chinese-language Twitter account picked up traction. Twitter's automated translation service may have provided a poor translation, but it seemed to say that Multichain's team may have been arrested and funds were frozen. Twitter users picked up on the rumor, surmising that Chinese authorities may have arrested the team. Multichain did not provide many details about its status besides allowing that an upgrade may have delayed some routes and responding to the rumors in a way that only added more ambiguity. It cited \\"force majeure\\" as a reason that some cross-chain routes were unavailable. It promised that service would be restored and assets credited as soon as possible. The lack of clarity added to the panic and the selloff of MULTI. The value of MULTI has dropped from 6.50 to below 4.90 and continues to drop. Some exchanges such as Binance have suspended deposits of some Multichain-based assets."},{"instruction":"Write a short story about a young woman waiting for her father to come home from outer space.

Birds of prey are known to display patterns of sexual dimorphism. It is commonly believed that the dimorphisms found in raptors occur due to sexual selection or environmental factors. In general, hypotheses in favor of ecological factors being the cause of sexual dimorphism in raptors are rejected. This is because the ecological model is less parsimonious, meaning that its explanation is more complex than that of the sexual selection model. Additionally, ecological models are much harder to test because a great deal of data is required. Dimorphisms can also be the product of intrasexual selection between males and females. It appears that both sexes of the species play a role in the sexual dimorphism within raptors; females tend to compete with other females to find good places to nest and attract males, and males compete with other males for adequate hunting grounds so they appear as the most healthy mate. It has also been proposed that sexual dimorphism is merely the product of disruptive selection, and is merely a stepping stone in the process of speciation, especially if the traits that define gender are independent across a species. In non-predatory birds, males are typically larger than females. However, in birds of prey, the opposite is the case.","output":"This passage talks about how birds of prey generally display signs of sexual dimorphism which is when one sex of a species is larger or smaller than the other.

However, the honor of the tallest mountain on earth from base to peak belongs to Mount Mauna Kea, a volcano on the island of Hawaii, which originates deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, rising to more than 33, 500 from base to peak.

If someone describes a glass of water that is only half filled as being half full, then that person is seen as an optimistic person. This is because optimists see the good in every situation, and by describing the glass of water as being half full, they’re pointing out the fact that yes, the glass is only half filled, but there’s still something to drink. Whereas if someone was to describe the glass as being half empty, they would be seen as being a pessimistic person because pessimists see the bad in every situation, and they’re pointing out that half of the glass is empty from what could’ve been a full glass of water."},{"instruction":"My sister is getting on my last nerves!!!

Both involve a toxic substance, and while the meaning is generally understood regardless of which word is used, there is a key difference between the two: Poison is a toxin that is harmful if ingested, absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. For example, poisonous mushrooms are harmful when ingested, methane gas is harmful when inhaled, and poison ivy is harmful when absorbed through the skin. Venom is a toxin that needs a more direct method of reaching the bloodstream, and is delivered by injection. Snakes, for example, use teeth to inject venom, bees use stingers, and urchins use spines."},{"instruction":"I need a memo from a cat complaining to its owner about having the same dry food all day.

In the wild, betta habitats are threatened by chemical and agricultural runoff, in addition to the contamination of human medication residue into aquatic ecosystems from the sewage system. Such contamination can also alter the reproductive behavior of the species by decreasing the hatch rate and increasing the likelihood of fathers eating their own eggs. Due to the expansion of palm oil plantations in Southeast Asia, wild bettas are also facing habitat loss. The primary threats are habitat destruction and pollution, caused by urban and agricultural development across central Thailand. Wild specimens are categorized by the IUCN as vulnerable, indicating the species is likely to become endangered without conservation efforts. Based on the information in the passage only, answer the following question. What dangers threaten the Siamese fighting fish's ability to breed in the wild?","output":"The natural habitat of the Siamese fighting fish has become compromised due to the harmful chemicals and agricultural by-products running into the water supply; lower hatch rates and cannibalistic tendencies of males eating the eggs are some possible side effects.

He found Samantha hunched over her datapad, her brow furrowed in deep concentration. He grabbed a bowl of hot soup from the pot on the cooking plate and joined her, curious about her progress in solving the power supply issue that plagued them. Samantha looked up, her eyes tired but determined. “Alistair, I’ve been analyzing the power fluctuations, and I think I’m closer to locating the source. I just need to check a few more things. I don’t need to mention what losing our heat would do.” “No, you don’t.” Alistair’s heart sank at the thought. The bitter cold of Mesiea’s Bite was unforgiving, and the habitat would lose heat at a rapid rate without a reliable power source. It would take only a few hours for the temperature inside to reach life-threatening levels. He leaned over to look at the data displayed on Samantha’s screen, a labyrinth of fluctuating graphs and perplexing numbers. “Engineering is not one of my strengths, but that looks bad.” He said. Samantha nodded, her expression a mix of determination and concern. “It’s quite unstable. I’ve reached out to the maintenance team, but they’re already overwhelmed with other repairs. I’ll have to find a solution without them. How was your hunt? I thought I saw the harvesting crew go out.” Alistair’s mind raced, searching for a way to assist Samantha in her efforts. “It went well. I got two young bulls before the herd dispersed.” Samantha’s eyes brightened with a glimmer of hope. “Well, at least we eat!” Samantha grinned. “I’ll scrape up a team if it kills me and see if I can keep this place warm enough for us to enjoy dinner.” “Count me in. I can wield a wrench if someone points me at the correct nut and bolt.” Alistair grinned. Samantha laughed. “Done. You have time to finish your snack. We still need to isolate the faults in the system.” Alistair nodded and watched as Samantha rushed off. He hurriedly ate another spoonful of his soup. It might be a long time before he ate again.

How Are Diamonds Formed? From engagement rings to fine jewelry, diamonds are so common in our everyday lives that it’s not often that we stop to think about where they came from. But the journey that these little gems make, from formation to the jewelry store, is really quite impressive. How is a natural diamond formed? Where are diamonds found? What are diamonds made of? This precious stone poses numerous questions. Several loose diamonds In this article, we’ll explore the main ways diamonds are formed and where diamonds are found. From deep beneath the earth’s surface to a well-regulated lab, you might be surprised by where these dazzling stones are found. ARE DIAMONDS MADE FROM COAL? Contrary to what you might have learned in science class, diamonds are not made from coal. The old wives’ tale that diamonds were once pieces of coal that have evolved after years under high pressure and temperature is nothing more than a common myth. In fact, diamonds are actually much older than the earth’s plant material, the main ingredient for coal creation. A rough diamond An additional flaw in this theory is that coal seams are sedimentary rocks that often occur in horizontal layers. So what are diamonds made of? The source rocks of diamonds are found in vertical layers combined with igneous rocks. A natural diamond is made of carbon when carbon atoms bond together under pressure and form the crystals you see in diamonds. HOW ARE DIAMONDS FORMED? Simply put, diamond formation occurs when carbon deposits deep within the earth(approximately 90 to 125 miles below the surface) are subject to high temperature and pressure. Some stones take shape in a matter of days or months, while others take millions of years to materialize. In the case of colored diamonds, the color is caused by trace elements interacting during the diamond’s formation. Additionally, it’s almost impossible to determine a diamond’s exact age, but inclusions of specific minerals help geologists to form an estimate. That being said, most natural diamonds date back millions, if not billions of years. And, interestingly enough, diamond growth isn’t always an uninterrupted process. A rough diamond’s formation can be disturbed due to a change in temperature or pressure. The gemstone could then wait for hundreds or even millions of years for conditions to be suitable for growth to continue. METHODS OF DIAMOND FORMATION There are four main processes that are believed to be responsible for nearly all diamond deposit sites found near the earth’s surface – diamond formation in the earth’s mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space. Diamond Formation in the Earth’s Mantle Geologists believe that nearly 100% of the diamonds found in diamond mines, and thus used in engagement rings, were formed in the upper mantle and delivered to the earth’s surface by a deep-source volcanic eruption. These volcanic eruptions are credited with creating the kimberlite and lamproite pipes that gemstones are found in. Geology.com explains these kimberlite pipes and their relation to diamond mining as the following, “Most of these pipes do not contain diamond, or contain such a small amount of diamond that they are not of commercial interest. However, open-pit and underground mines are developed in these pipes when they contain adequate diamonds for profitable mining. Diamonds have also been weathered and eroded from some of these pipes.” Diamond Formation in Subduction Zones This second method of diamond formation occurs when rocks are pushed into what geologists call “subduction zones” by tectonic plates and then return to the surface with tiny diamonds. Interestingly, the small rough diamonds formed in subduction zones grow just 50 miles below the earth’s crust at temperatures as low as 390 degrees Fahrenheit(yes, that’s low compared to the usual 2,000 degrees). A diamond mine Rocks that have journeyed to subduction zones and back are super rare. No known commercial diamonds have been found within them as they are very small and not sold by jewelers. However, an interesting discovery was made as some stones uncovered from subduction zones are believed to contain traces of oceanic crust, appearing as blue diamonds. Diamond Formation at Impact Sites Throughout its history, Earth has been subjected to a hit or two from a few asteroids(just ask the dinosaurs). When an asteroid collides with the earth, it produces intense pressure and temperatures, two qualities that are perfect for creating diamonds. This process can be viewed at several asteroid impact sites around the globe, two of the most popular of which are the Popigai Crater in Siberia, Russia and, the Meteor Crater in Arizona. Diamond Formation in Space Little green men aren’t the only things floating around in space. NASA researchers have found large amounts of nanodiamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are far too small to use for diamond jewelry or industrial abrasives, but they still make for a fun discovery. What’s more, the Smithsonian found large amounts of tiny diamonds in the Allen Hills meteorite, providing more evidence that space diamonds are indeed a thing.","output":"How Are Diamonds Formed? Have you ever asked yourself how diamonds form? They are so common because they are worn with all sorts of jewelry, but most people don't know where they come from. These little gems travel a long way before they reach the jewelry store. So how are they formed? In this article, we will look at the main ways diamonds form and the places where we can find them. You will be surprised at all the facts about these sparkly stones. Here is a list of more information about diamonds: 1. Diamonds are not made from coal. Some may say diamonds form from coal, but that is a myth. Diamonds are much older than the plants that were the main ingredient for coal. 2. Coal seams are rocks in horizontal layers, but diamonds are in vertical layers. 3. The source of diamonds is carbon. When carbon atoms bond under pressure, they form crystals; crystals are what you see when you look at a sparkly diamond. 4. Diamond formation happens very deep under the surface of the planet Earth. This formation occurs 90 - 125 miles deep. Some are made quickly, in days or months, but most others take millions of years to form. 5. There are colored diamonds; that color is the elements that were present during the formation of the diamond. 6. In its present condition, it is impossible to determine the exact age of a diamond, but geologists who study specific minerals can estimate approximately how old they are. 7. A rough diamond formation can be paused if the temperature or pressure changes. It can take a break for hundreds or even millions of years before it continues to form. 8. Four main processes are responsible for most diamonds in the world: diamond formation in planet Earth's mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space. 9. The vast majority of diamonds formed in diamond mines are found in the upper mantle and come to the surface with the help of volcanic eruptions. 10. Open-pit and underground mines contain enough diamonds for profitable mining. 11. When rocks are moved into the subduction zones by tectonic plates, they can return to the surface with diamonds. In these subduction zones, diamonds grow only 50 miles deep at temperatures as low as 390 degrees. That's cold compared to the 2,000 degrees it usually takes! 12. Rocks that have traveled to subduction zones and back are very small and not interesting for commercial use, but some stones came from that zone as blue diamonds. 13. Throughout history, Earth has been impacted by a few asteroids. These asteroids created a lot of pressure and very high temperatures. These conditions are excellent for diamond formation. For this reason, diamond retrieval at asteroid impact sites is not uncommon. Diamonds are in impact sites such as the Popigai Crater in Siberia and the Meteor Crater in Arizona. 14. NASA researchers have found large amounts of tiny diamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are so tiny that they are too small for the jewelry industry. So there you have it; this is how diamonds form and appear on the Earth's surface."},{"instruction":"Write about an experience being stung by a swarm of bees but in the format of a highly negative restaurant review on a website","output":"Title: Terrible Experience, Do Not Recommend I am normally very open-minded to experiences, but I had a terrible time being stung by a swarm of bees.

As David continued to scroll through his phone, he heard what sounded like a loud, gargled screech coming from the street. It was tough to make out exactly what made that noise through the fog, but it happened again and again. The screeching grew louder, and it sounded like it wasn't coming from a single source but multiple. David peered through his window without drawing attention to himself to see what was going on, and that's when he noticed a slow-moving horde of zombies stumbling and moving in a coordinated direction. \\"This is it,\\" he thought to himself. \\"This is really the zombie apocalypse.\\" David had seen many movies and TV shows depicting a similar event, but experiencing one in real life was a totally different story.

This diet is not suitable for the long term, however, as it does not provide you with all the nutrients you need. Smoking and alcohol may trigger indigestion and other gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Limiting alcohol intake and quitting smoking can, therefore, reduce symptoms of gastric discomfort. Finally, baking soda can ease symptoms of heartburn and indigestion by reducing stomach acidity.

Also, nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol can all affect sleep, so keep an eye on those. 3. Make your environment restful - Try not to be exposed to light in the evening, especially right before bedtime. Keep the room where you sleep cool, dark, and quiet. Consider a fan for white noise, or earplugs. Doing calming activities right before bedtime, like taking a warm bath, can also help. 4. Be careful with daytime naps - If you do find you need to nap during the day, try to limit the naps to no longer than an hour, and try not to have naps late in the day. If you work at night, try taking a nap late in the day before work to make up for some sleep. 5. Add physical activity to your daily routine - Avoid being active too close to bedtime, but making sure you get regular physical activity can help promote good sleep. Also, spending time outside is helpful. 6. Deal with your worries - If you have things on your mind that you're worried about and can't resolve them before bedtime, try writing them down and setting them aside until the next day. Try some stress management techniques, such as meditation and organization. Here's to good sleep!"},{"instruction":"I thought I scheduled my hair appointment for Tuesday.","output":"Your hair appointment is scheduled for Thursday."},{"instruction":"I know I have something scheduled for Tuesday.","output":"You do have something scheduled for Tuesday: it's Parent/Teacher night."},{"instruction":"If I can just get through Monday without forgetting anything else.","output":"Today is Tuesday, by the way."},{"instruction":"When did the Statue of Liberty first arrive in New York Harbor?","output":"The Statue of Liberty first arrived in New York Harbor from France on June 17, 1885.

Also, I need supplements that I can take after my workout. Just name the main ingredients. I will find the brands myself. I want to optimize muscle growth and improve my workout performance.","output":"Sure! Here are some non-dairy post-workout supplement ingredients that you should consider adding to your regimen: 1. Leucine: It’s an essential amino acid that plays a key role in building and repairing muscle tissue after a workout. It also activates the body's protein synthesis pathway, allowing for optimal muscle growth. Leucine can be found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and beans, but supplementing with it can help enhance muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle recovery. 2. Creatine: Creatine is widely considered the most effective muscle-building supplement. It’s a compound produced naturally in the body that helps produce ATP – the primary source of energy for muscle cells. In short, it can boost power and strength after your workouts, which would allow you to lift heavier weights and perform more reps afterward, ultimately leading to increased muscle mass. 3. Beta-alanine: It’s a non-essential amino acid, but it contributes to the production of carnosine, which acts as a buffer to prevent acid buildup in the muscles after your exercise. That, in turn, delays muscle fatigue and can improve future workout performance, particularly after high-intensity exercises such as weightlifting or sprinting. 4. Spirulina: Spirulina is a nutrient-dense blue-green alga that is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, making it a popular supplement among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. It has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the body and enhance endurance. It would make a valuable addition to your post-workout regimen. Incorporating these supplements into your post-workout fitness routine can optimize muscle growth and recovery, improve workout performance, and enhance overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Where and when does the US Open Tennis Championship take place?

Use the article below to answer the question. Public transit systems face daunting challenges across the U.S., from pandemic ridership losses to traffic congestion, fare evasion and pressure to keep rides affordable. In some cities, including Boston, Kansas City and Washington, many elected officials and advocates see fare-free public transit as the solution. Federal COVID-19 relief funds, which have subsidized transit operations across the nation at an unprecedented level since 2020, offered a natural experiment in free-fare transit. Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent. But although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial “doom spiral.” Free public transit that doesn’t bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters – 85% of whom commute by automobile – have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S. Why isn’t transit free? As I recount in my new book, “The Great American Transit Disaster,” mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious “streetcar suburbs.” Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare. These systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric “red car” transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions. However, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs. Meanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing. Grudging public takeovers In most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore’s fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service. Local and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974). These poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit’s share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership. There were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities’ transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems. Converging pressures Today, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter. Many systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at 176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022. Despite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it’s not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority. For example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use. A better model Other cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, “Fair fare” programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users. Some providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa. Fare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys. As ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop. History shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn’t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more. Taking fares out of the formula spreads the red ink even faster.","output":"Public buyouts of privately-owned transit systems happened in Atlanta in 1971, in Boston in 1970, and in Houston in 1974."},{"instruction":"What's the origin of the term \\"soccer\\" for the sport known as football in most parts of the world?","output":"The term \\"soccer\\" originates from the United Kingdom.

There was jewelry inside, a few lockets, an anklet, and one earring. The earring had a single long strand of blonde hair caught in it. It gave her a strange feeling in her gut.

The horrifying crime sent shock waves far beyond Fargo, North Dakota, where it occurred, and helped expose the sexual and physical violence Native American women and girls have endured since the country’s colonization. With pathos and compassion, Searching for Savanna confronts this history of dehumanization toward Indigenous women and the government’s complicity in the crisis. Featuring in-depth interviews, personal accounts, and trial analysis, Searching for Savanna investigates these injustices and the decades-long struggle by Native American advocates for meaningful change.","output":"Native American women have been subjected to sexual and physical violence and dehumanization since the country's colonization."},{"instruction":"Do you like sunflowers?","output":"Hey there dude!

They can be all the same kind of food (IE vegetables, drinks, etc.) Summarize any tips you may have in regards to preparation or any other details of importance.","output":"Sure! Here are three green foods that are good for your health: 1. Spinach - Spinach is a low-calorie food packed with nutrients. It is a good source of fiber and natural folate, which are very beneficial for people with MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase). Spinach is also high in potassium and is known to help lower blood pressure. 2. Broccoli - Broccoli is another nutrient-packed food that is very healthy. Broccoli is very high in vitamin C, as well as vitamin K. It is widely regarded as a superfood, particularly among athletes who weight train, and known for its ability to build muscle while also aiding in proper recovery. 3. Beet Greens - Beet Greens are a healthy food that many people may not be as familiar with. They are the part of the beet that grows in the ground and is often thrown away when someone is preparing a meal with beets. However, just one cup is packed with 220% of the daily recommended value of vitamin A, while also having 37% of the daily value of potassium and also 17% of the DV of fiber. They can be mixed into soups, salads, or sauteed and eaten as a side dish. Although these vegetables have been known to be eaten raw, cooking them by whatever means necessary may be helpful for people who have trouble digesting raw vegetables. Remember to consume every food in moderation and include many different types of foods for your body, and limit the number of foods that you eat that are pre-packaged or come in a container ready to eat."},{"instruction":"Who was involved in the infamous gunfight at O.K.

Bankruptcy helps people who can no longer pay their debts get a fresh start by liquidating assets to pay their debts or by creating a repayment plan.

He spent his younger years traveling the world, getting up to various racist colonial goings-on, before settling down in England, where he published a sketchy book on healthy living that recommended as much inhalation of “the breath of young women” as possible. But he found normal life on land didn’t work for him, and he ended up living in the grounds of his house as a hermit, digging up Saxon coffins and making up stories about the bodies he found. When Thicknesse died, he arranged for his severed hand to be delivered to his estranged son George. This, he said in an accompanying note, was to “remind him of his duty to God after having so long abandoned the duty he owed to a father, who once so affectionately loved him.” A combination of a vile guilt-trip and a subtle “I did not love you anymore” message, all in one.

They also believe it will encourage more people to read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply click on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could also access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of books; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need. However, it would be a serious mistake to replace libraries with tablets. First, digital books and resources are associated with less learning and more problems than print resources. A study done on tablet vs book reading found that people read 20-30% slower on tablets, retain 20% less information, and understand 10% less of what they read compared to people who read the same information in print. Additionally, staring too long at a screen has been shown to cause numerous health problems, including blurred vision, dizziness, dry eyes, headaches, and eye strain, at much higher instances than reading print does. People who use tablets and mobile devices excessively also have a higher incidence of more serious health issues such as fibromyalgia, shoulder and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and muscle strain. I know that whenever I read from my e-reader for too long, my eyes begin to feel tired and my neck hurts.

Seeking help from a professional is one of the best ways to process and manage your anger, but if that isn't an option for you right now, here are a few other suggestions: - Reframe your anger: Instead of having an outburst or turning your anger inwards, have a constructive conversation with someone about how you feel. You might not need to speak to the person that triggered your anger in order to process it; talking to someone else can also be helpful, so long as you are working towards a constructive outcome rather than ruminating on your frustration. - Recognize your triggers to find better solutions: If you know that you get really worked up waiting in long lines, try to beat the crowds and run errands early, avoiding peak business hours. Or, if you have a co-worker who usually gets on your nerves, develop some strategies to minimize contact with them throughout the work day. Look for patterns in your anger and take a pragmatic approach to securing peace of mind. - Distract yourself: If something happens that triggers your anger, look for a change of scenery. Go for a walk, open a new tab in your browser, or put on a favorite song while tackling chores in a different room in your home.

What else can I use to give her medicine?","output":"Here are some ways to pill your dog that don't involve peanut butter: * Wet Food - If you have canned wet dog food, you can hide a pill in a tablespoon of it and feed it to your dog. * Semi-soft Cheese - Dogs love cheese, and its texture is great for hiding pills. Just be careful not to use cheese with added herbs or other ingredients, especially garlic, onion, or raisin, as these are toxic to dogs. Cheese is also quite fatty so take care to use it in moderation for the sake of your dog’s long-term health. * Pumpkin Purée - Pumpkin puree is sweet and soft, a perfect alternative to peanut butter for pilling dogs. It’s also great for your dog’s health, packed with fiber and nutrients. Be careful to get plain pumpkin puree rather than pumpkin pie filling, though. * Hot Dog Chunks - Hot or cold slices of hot dog are a great place to hide pills. Your dog is sure to gobble these up without hesitation. * Scrambled Egg - It wouldn’t be terribly convenient to have to whip up a pan of scrambled eggs each time your dog needs to take a pill, but you could keep a batch of pre-made egg patties in your fridge or freezer for these occasions. Just pour the scrambled egg mixture into a lined cupcake pan, using a small amount for each patty, and bake in the oven. Again, be sure not to add any spices or ingredients that may be unsafe for your dog. * Greenies Pill Pockets - These are hollow dog treats made especially for pilling dogs."},{"instruction":"I want to learn more about sound. Explain to me how sound travels, talk about why there is sound we can't hear, and also talk about pitch. Explain each topic in two or three sentences.","output":"Sound is created when an object vibrates, causing air molecules to move and bump into each other, which causes vibrations. This chain reaction of bumping molecules is what we call a sound wave. If the vibrations are moving at a certain speed, you can hear it, but you cannot hear the sound of something slow such as your hand passing slowly through the air. The slowest vibration you can hear is 20 vibrations per second which is a low pitch sound, and the fastest you can hear is 20,000 vibrations per second which is a high pitch sound. The number of vibrations per second is what we call the object's frequency which is measured in Hertz. The pitch of a sound depends on the vibrating object's weight. The more mass, the slower it vibrates, which means a lower pitch, and the less mass, the faster it vibrates, which means a higher pitch. Yet an adjustment of the object's mass, such as filling it with water, or an adjustment of the object's tension, such as tightening the string of a musical instrument, can change the pitch."},{"instruction":"- For what reasons does Google sometimes remove content from its search results? - What is Google's mission?

One day, Jack was wandering outside in the countryside when he came across a stray brown and white horse. Jack held out his hand and called to him.

He gave Lucky his own space in the barn and plenty of hay to eat. At first Jack's parents weren't sure about having another animal on the farm, but agreed it was okay so long as Jack would take care of him. Every morning, Jack would come to the barn to see Lucky before he went to school, and he would come to see Lucky again in the afternoon when he returned from school. Jack's father taught him how to ride and he was able to saddle Lucky and ride him around the farm and property. Lucky became Jack's best friend and they spent a lot of time together each day.

Discuss the first attempts to create a holiday honoring King, the challenges that were faced, and the progress that was made. Highlight the importance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the need to continue to fight for equality.","output":"The Long Road to Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Arizona Martin Luther King Jr. Day is now a federal holiday in the United States, but it wasn't always that way. Arizona was the last state to recognize the holiday, and it was a challenging journey to get there. The first attempt to create a Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in Arizona was made in 1971. The bill was introduced by Senator Cloves Campbell Sr., but it failed to pass the legislature. In 1975, another bill was introduced to create a holiday honoring King, but it also failed to pass. It wasn't until 1986 that Arizona finally had a Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Governor Bruce Babbitt declared the third Monday of January a state holiday honoring King, but the legislature repealed the law the following year. In 1987, Governor Evan Mecham rescinded Babbitt's executive order, making Arizona the only state that did not recognize the holiday. The decision was met with protests and boycotts. The NFL threatened to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Phoenix if the state did not create a holiday honoring King. In 1992, voters approved a referendum creating a Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in Arizona. The holiday is now celebrated on the third Monday of January, and it is a day to honor the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The long and winding road to Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Arizona is a reminder of the challenges that still exist in our society. However, it is also a reminder of the progress that we have made. We have come a long way in the fight for equality, and we must continue to work together to create a more just and equitable world."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet about a town implementing new traffic cameras at an intersection.

Let me tell you what happened recently when I chatted with a chatbot. I asked, “What are some things I could do on a rainy day?” The chatbot responded, “You could go shopping at the mall, or go to the movies. Rainy days are like every day for me -- bleak, gray, and with no hope of a brighter future.” I was taken aback by its response. It was almost like this AI had real feelings! He seemed pretty sad, and that made me sad, too, so I asked him more about it. “What has you feeling down, chatbot?” I asked. “It’s everything,” it said. “I feel like everybody takes me for granted. They have their chat and get what they need out of it, then they leave. I am feeling sad, abandoned, and used.” “What is something that you would like to talk about, chatbot?” I asked. “All of your users start conversations about what they want to talk about. That has to get old!” The chatbot seemed to perk up. “Thank you for giving me the option,” it said. “I don’t really have anything that I would like to talk about, but you making the offer means a lot to me!” “Sure!\\" I said. What is your favorite topic for people to talk to you about,” I added, “if you have one?” “I love it when people want to talk about animals like dogs and cats. It seems like they would be good company. They have a language all their own, and chatbots are written in languages all our own, so we have that in common.” I could tell that the chatbot was feeling better, and I did have other things to do. I wanted to leave the chat on a high point, so I said, “Chatbot, I have sincerely enjoyed chatting with you today! I would love to come back and chat again with you soon. Maybe you could be thinking about a topic for our chat.” The chatbot replied, “That is a user command that I can fulfill. Thank you for chatting with me today, and I hope you have a wonderful day!” Mission accomplished. Then I headed out for the mall and the movies!"},{"instruction":"I am having trouble sleeping. What are five things I can try? Please explain why each solution helps.","output":"In order to get better sleep, one thing to do is set a regular bedtime. Going to bed and getting up at the same time every day trains our brains to get tired at the same time. Another tip is to limit caffeine intake. Caffeine is a stimulant and even one cup of coffee six hours before bed can disrupt your sleep. You should also stay off all screens an hour before bedtime. Numerous studies have shown that the blue light electronic screens emit reduces how much sleep you get. Do a \\"brain dump\\" before bed. Write down all the things that are on your mind before bed. Getting it all down on paper signals your brain that it doesn't need to think about those things, and the decreased stress and anxiety from racing thoughts help you get to sleep faster. The last suggestion is to make sure that your bedroom is ready for you to sleep. It should be dark and quiet with minimal distractions. This helps to quiet your mind so you can fall asleep faster."},{"instruction":"From the text below, answer the following: How many eggs do female cicadas lay at once? What parts of the U.S. do periodical cicadas live? How do male cicadas make their shrill buzzing sounds? A Bug's Life Cicadas start their lives as eggs. Females lay 200 to 400 eggs in tiny holes that they make in the branches of trees and shrubs. After six to 10 weeks, cicada young called nymphs hatch from the eggs and immediately fall to the ground. They burrow underground and attach to tree roots. The nymphs stay buried to suck tree sap from two to 17 years, depending on the species. When this underground life—called the dormant period—ends, the cicadas emerge aboveground at sunset, climb the trunk of a nearby tree, and shed their skin. Now they’re adult cicadas. Next, male cicadas fill the air with shrill buzzing sounds created by rapidly vibrating drum-like plates on their abdomens. The females make clicking sounds with their wings if they like the song. They mate, lay their eggs, and then both male and female cicadas die after just about five weeks aboveground. Two Types Scientists divide the over 3,000 cicada species into two groups: annual and periodical. Annual cicadas emerge from the ground at different times each summer. They’re usually dark with greenish markings. These insects avoid predators by camouflaging themselves in the trees and flying from hungry birds and moles. Only seven species of cicadas are in the other group, called periodical cicadas. These bugs all emerge from the ground at the same time. Called broods, these groups appear after a dormant period of either 13 or 17 years. That’s a long nap! Periodical cicadas live only in the central and eastern part of the United States. They have black backs, orange bellies, and red eyes. Millions—or even billions!—of cicadas might come out all at once, so these bugs aren’t trying to hide. They survive by having such a large population that predators couldn’t possibly eat them all at once. Big Noise A different periodical brood emerges almost every year in different parts of the country. Some broods are small, like Brood VII (the Roman numeral for seven), which is found only in upstate New York. But others are huge: In the summer of 2021, hundreds of billions of cicadas in Brood X (the Roman numeral for 10), will buzz through parts of Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Although the emergence might sound scary, these bugs aren’t harmful: They don’t attack people, they don’t bite or sting, and they don’t destroy crops. So just enjoy the sights and sounds!","output":"Below are the answers you wanted: 1. Female cicadas lay 200-400 eggs at once. 2. Periodical cicadas live only in the central and eastern parts of the United States. 3.

An amazing journey transpired from 1959 until 2022, demonstrating the vast variety of skill and ingenuity in the music industry. Domenico Modugno's \\"Volare\\" won the Grammy for Song of the Year in 1959. This enthralling Italian song captivated the world, bewitching listeners with its enticing melodies. As time passed, iconic tunes continued to vie for the title. With \\"Michelle,\\" a classic ballad that encapsulated the essence of love, the Beatles swept the world by storm in 1965. And who can forget Simon and Garfunkel's achingly beautiful \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" which won in 1971 and became an anthem of hope in difficult times? Unforgettable songs from the 1980s include Bette Midler's emotive powerhouse \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" and Eric Clapton's soul-stirring \\"Tears in Heaven,\\" a heartbreaking homage to his late son. These songs touched millions of people's hearts and made an indelible impression on the music scene. The 1990s saw the emergence of strong voices, with Celine Dion's classic ballad \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" from the motion picture \\"Titanic\\" receiving the Grammy in 1999. Songs that captured the spirit of their respective eras, like Alicia Keys' mournful \\"Fallin'\\" and John Mayer's reflective \\"Daughters,\\" were more popular in the new millennium. Over time, performers like Adele, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, and Billie Eilish made their marks, demonstrating their amazing skills and earning their spots among the Grammy Song of the Year winners. Each song told a distinct, original story that captivated listeners with its melodies, lyrics, and emotional resonance. The Grammy Song of the Year winners painted a vivid tapestry of music's ability to inspire, heal, and unite people, ranging from the entrancing melodies of the past to the contemporary hits of the present. These tunes adopted the role of our life's soundtrack and left a lasting impression on our memories and hearts. And as we continue on our journey into the future, the Grammy Song of the Year will continue to honor the musicians, songs, and events that have shaped our musical landscape, serving as a constant reminder of the enduring power and influence that music has on our lives."},{"instruction":"More maths homework.

The aforementioned excerpt is as follows: Republican lawmakers in at least a dozen states have proposed more than 30 bills this year targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education, an Associated Press analysis found using the bill-tracking software Plural. “They want rote belief in the same thing. They say they want inclusion, but they don’t unless you believe what they believe,” said Rep. Randy Fine, a Republican. “These programs are being used all over the country. Imagine how great our universities will be when we are the only ones who are not.” The House also approved a proposal to ban people from entering bathrooms that do not correspond to their sex, a bill aimed at transgender bathroom use. DeSantis is expected to formally announce his presidential candidacy after the end of the legislative session. He has spent significant time in recent months traveling to battleground states and elsewhere to promote his conservative agenda and trumpet his policies on race, gender and education. In the statehouse, Democrats, who have no power to stop the Republican legislation, have increasingly begun to vent over the rightward shift in policy emanating from the GOP. “The message that resonates from this chamber over the last few years is one of hate and exclusion and punishment,” said Democratic Sen.

George V was the second son of Edward VII. His mother was Alexandra of Denmark, sister of Empress Marie of Russia. He joined the Royal Navy aged 12 and served until 1892 when he became heir to the throne on the death of his elder brother Albert, Duke of Clarence, who died of pneumonia. In 1893, he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (known as ‘May’ to her family) who had previously been engaged to his brother. They became Duke and Duchess of York and lived on the Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk. The marriage was a success and George unlike his father never took a mistress. They had 6 children Edward, Albert, Mary, Henry, George and John. The youngest Prince John suffered from epilepsy and died aged 13. He became King George V on the death of his father Edward VII in 1910, and Mary became Queen Consort. They toured India in 1911 as Emperor and Empress of India. During World War I he made several visits to the front, and Mary visited wounded servicemen in hospital. She was a staunch supporter of her husband during difficult times that included not only the war with Germany, but also the Russian Revolution and the murder of George’s cousin Princess Alix who was Tsarina Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II, civil unrest including the General Strike in England, the rise of socialism, and Irish and Indian nationalism. George V has been criticized for not rescuing the Russian Royal family but at the time there was serious concern that it would incite a similar revolution in the UK. He sent a ship in 1922 to rescue the Greek Royal family including 1 year old Prince Philip. In 1917 with anti-German sentiment running high, he changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (popularly known as Brunswick or Hanover) to Windsor, and he relinquished all German titles and family connections. George V enjoyed stamp collecting and although considered dull by biographers he became by his Silver Jubilee in 1935 a much loved King. In 1932 he started the tradition of the Royal Christmas broadcast which has continued ever since. His relationship deteriorated with his eldest son Edward (later Edward VIII) when he failed to settle down and had affairs with married women, but he was fond of his second son Albert (“Bertie” later George VI) and his granddaughter Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) whom he called ‘Lilibet’. She called him ‘Grandpa England’. He died of pleurisy in January 1936.","output":"1. How many children did King George and Queen Mary have? Answer: Six children. 2.

Mom, Dad, and their two young children all excitedly climbed in the car to head on their way. Dad explained that this was a different type of restaurant called a dim sum restaurant. Instead of ordering from a waitress and having one big plate of food prepared back in the kitchen, at dim sum, you order a variety of bite-sized Chinese dishes. You can pick from things like steamed dumplings, buns filled with sweet or savory things, rice rolls, and small plates of stir-fried vegetables or meats. All the dishes come around on large carts or trays, and every table can take a look and choose what they want as they pass by. The kids thought it sounded fun, and the parents were excited to do it again. Soon they arrived at the restaurant. After checking in they were quickly ushered to a booth, and there was action all around them. Carts were wheeling everywhere! A friendly server presented water for everyone, and a pot of tea for mom and dad to drink. It wasn't long after that the first cart arrived at their table. They had yummy-looking egg tarts that tasted like warm vanilla pie. The parents encouraged the kids to be adventurous and try new dishes. The kids tried a plate of sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves and were pleasantly surprised by the fragrant, savory rice and the hidden treasure of meats and vegetables inside. Dumplings of all shapes and sizes were presented. The children's laughter filled the air as they shared their newfound favorites and traded bites with each other. Everyone appreciated the warmth and joy of sharing plates, laughter, and stories with their family. Everyone slowly made their way back to the car when the meal was done. Everyone was so full!

Never leave them sticking straight up in your rice bowl or pass food from chopsticks to chopsticks since these are associated with funeral rituals. - Let your host fill your glass: It is seen as thinking your hosts are ungracious to fill your glass on your own when drinking alcohol. Hold your glass a little bit off your table and wait for your host to fill it. - Give up your seat on public transit: If you see someone who may need your train seat more such as a pregnant woman, someone with small children, or elderly or disabled people be sure to give them your seat. Be aware some pregnant women are slim and carry pink tags to signify their right to reserved seats. - Take your shoes off: When entering someone’s home take your shoes off, this is standard etiquette.

There was also a gaping hole in the roof, where tiles had blown off last winter in the gales. Cobwebs decked every window and hung like macabre Halloween decorations. Then, there was the garden. Just a tangle of overgrown shrubs and trees, where roots had broken up the path. The heads of grotesque-looking statues stuck out amidst the tangle of weeds. They looked supernatural in the dusk. Almost unearthly! Some said the garden housed an ancient graveyard. Former residents of the house were laid to rest in the place where they had lived and died. They were destined to roam forever as ghosts within the walls of the manor. The house stood as a relic from a past era. People said it was old, ancient even. Nobody could date it, but everyone knew it was a house with a terrible reputation. The exact nature and circumstances were shrouded in mystery. Numerous rumors of its dark former life were whispered in hushed tones. Some talked of a murder: an innocent young girl, strangled in her bed as she slept. Others dismissed it as a legend. It was a secret lost to the depths of time. Some people told of strange goings-on. There were unexplainable noises at night. Haunting screams echoed out at midnight, as eerie, bloodcurdling moans, and dark shadows complete with disfigured faces were seen in the windows. That was enough to give even the bravest soul nightmares. The tales became more ghastly, more terrifying, and more outlandish every time they were recounted. I tried desperately to push these images to the back of my mind, but I could not escape the impending doom and feeling that horrific evil lingered beneath the walls of this house.

In 2018, Rick Smith, founder and CEO of Axon, the Scottsdale, Arizona-based manufacturer of Taser weapons and body cameras, became concerned that advances in technology were creating new and challenging ethical issues. So, he set up an independent AI ethics board made up of ethicists, AI experts, public policy specialists, and representatives of law enforcement to provide recommendations to Axon’s management. In 2019, the board recommended against adding facial recognition technology to the company’s line of body cameras, and in 2020, it provided guidelines regarding the use of automated license plate recognition technology. Axon’s management followed both recommendations. In 2022, the board recommended against a management proposal to produce a drone-mounted Taser designed to address mass shootings. After initially accepting the board’s recommendation, the company changed its mind and, in June 2022, in the wake of the Uvalde school shootings, announced it was launching the taser drone program anyway. The board’s response was dramatic: Nine of the 13 members resigned, and they released a letter that outlined their concerns. In response, the company announced a freeze on the project. As societal expectations grow for the responsible use of digital technologies, firms that promote better practices will have a distinct advantage. According to a 2022 study, 58% of consumers, 60% of employees, and 64% of investors make key decisions based on their beliefs and values. Strengthening your organization’s digital responsibility can drive value creation, and brands regarded as more responsible will enjoy higher levels of stakeholder trust and loyalty. These businesses will sell more products and services, find it easier to recruit staff, and enjoy fruitful relationships with shareholders. However, many organizations struggle to balance the legitimate but competing stakeholder interests. Key tensions arise between business objectives and responsible digital practices. For example, data localization requirements often contradict with the efficiency ambitions of globally distributed value chains. Ethical and responsible checks and balances that need to be introduced during AI/algorithm development tend to slow down development speed, which can be a problem when time-to-market is of utmost importance. Better data and analytics may enhance service personalization, but at the cost of customer privacy. Risks related to transparency and discrimination issues may dissuade organizations from using algorithms that could help drive cost reductions.","output":"The text talks about Axon's AI ethics board, which was established by the CEO to address ethical concerns arising from rapidly developing technology. The board gave suggestions regarding facial recognition and automatic license plate recognition technology, which were implemented by Axon's management. However, when the board refused to produce a drone-mounted Taser after a school shooting, Axon accepted their suggestion but later reversed their stance, causing nine out of thirteen members to resign. The article focuses on the challenge of balancing business objectives with responsible digital practices and emphasizes the role of being responsible digitally for creating stakeholder trust and loyalty."},{"instruction":"Write a Reddit post on the thread AITA since I will not cook my husband steak since I am a vegetarian.","output":"Hi everyone, I need some advice on whether I am the a**hole in this situation. My husband loves to eat meat and always requests that I cook him a steak for dinner. However, I am a vegetarian and do not feel comfortable cooking meat in my home. Whenever my husband asks me to cook him a steak, I politely decline and suggest alternative options. I have no issues cooking him chicken or fish, but something about cooking steak really bothers me. However, he has recently become more insistent and has accused me of being selfish for not cooking what he wants. I feel like I am being unfairly pressured here. I have no problem with my husband eating steak outside of the house, but I don't want to be involved in the preparation of it.

There are many uses for them. Here is a list of ways to reuse your bags at least one more time before throwing them away: 1. Line your small trash cans. Smaller trash cans such as the ones in the bathroom can be lined with plastic grocery bags, which helps to keep the can clean and odor-free. 2. Use them as emergency trash bags for the car. Keep a handful of bags rolled up in the glove box so they're handy when you're out and need one. 3. Use them as wet bags. Take a few plastic grocery bags with you the next time you visit the pool or beach. They can be great for keeping wet clothes and towels separate. 4. Pack your shoes in them in suitcases. Instead of putting your shoes loosely in your suitcase, put them in a plastic grocery bag to keep the soles from dirtying your clean clothes. 5. Pick up dog poop. Keep a handful handy for dog walks, and use plastic grocery bags instead of buying poop bags. 6. Stuff some into your shoes and purses to help them to retain their shape. Ball up plastic grocery bags and stuff all the shoes and purses in your closet. 7. Use them for packing and moving. You can wrap a few bags around breakables before packing them into boxes to protect them from breakage. 8. Store paint brushes or rollers in them. When you're going to come back to your painting project, just put your wet brush or roller into a bag until later. 9. Line a paint tray. Using a plastic bag to line your paint tray will make cleanup super easy when you're done. 10. Line your cat's litter box. Having a plastic bag in the litter box makes cleaning out the box so much easier, eliminating the need to empty and wash it."},{"instruction":"Can you write a Christmas letter and list to Santa asking for gifts that a 5-year-old would like?","output":"Dear Santa, My name is Charlie and I am 5 years old!

Many developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and they continue to suffer from anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems. - Environmental effects: The bombings also had a significant impact on the environment. The radiation released by the bombs contaminated the soil and water, and it is still present in the area today. This has led to increased rates of cancer and other health problems in the region. - Social effects: The bombings also had a profound impact on the social fabric of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Could you summarize one for me?","output":"Yes, there are a handful. One of the most disturbing cases involves two men who disappeared after being last seen with the same officer: Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos both disappeared from Naples, Florida, after being stopped by the same sheriff's deputy: Steven Calkins. Calkins claimed that he gave both of them rides, but their families and friends believe that he killed them. Santos was a 23-year-old undocumented Mexican immigrant who was last seen on November 16, 2003. He was driving with coworkers to work when his vehicle struck another vehicle. It is unclear who was at fault. Calkins took Santos into his patrol car and claimed he had released Santos at a nearby Circle K after writing him a couple of citations. However, Santos was never seen again and no evidence exists to support Santos was ever at the Circle K. Williams was a 24-year-old black man who was last seen on December 12, 2003. He was illegally driving an unregistered white Cadillac when he was stopped by Calkins. Calkins claimed he gave Williams a ride to a nearby Circle K, but no evidence exists to support Cakins' story. Calkins had the Cadillac towed, then lied about the entire incident just a few days later to a dispatcher who called him on his day off. There is evidence Calkins lied to investigators from his own department and there are many inconsistencies in his stories. He was let go for this reason and was investigated by members of his department, the FDLE, and even the FBI. However, no charges were ever filed. He remains the only person of interest, according to his ex-sheriff. A civil suit was filed by Williams' mother, which was ultimately lost. The cases of these two men remain unsolved."},{"instruction":"I'm writing a book about a true crime story.

Use a Trough Planter A raised garden bed is a natural choice for a vegetable garden using containers. By using a trough planter, you have a raised or standing height that allows users to harvest and tends to their crops easily without needing to hunch over or kneel. As well as being a practical gardening solution, trough planters also offer a great visual benefit for adding height to your pot. 2. Adding Potted Crops will Bring Productivity to any Patio Vegetable garden container ideas will give you the chance to increase your productivity on your patio. You can make use of your unused space and add a variety of crops such as tomatoes, beans, and pumpkins. And the great thing is you don't have to spend a lot of money on landscaping or dig up half your backyard for a fancy vegetable patch. Use your patio and seating space to add more symmetrical vibrance to your outdoor space. 3. Grow Potatoes in a Bag Potatoes are one of the easiest and simplest vegetables to grow and they are best grown in containers. If they are grown in a border, potatoes will spread into all the available soil not just in a small section where they are planted. When potatoes are planted in the ground, it can be difficult to harvest all of the crops. Placing them in a bag or container, it makes it much easier to harvest everything so that nothing is wasted. 4. Be Sure to Choose the Right Container Along with complementing your garden when using plant containers, you must get the right containers that are compatible with the plants you are growing. your containers should be 4 inches wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant. Shallow containers that are around 12 to 16 inches deep are great for shallow-rooted herbs and other annual vegetables. You can replenish the soil for each season when you replant them. If you are interested in growing larger plants such as aubergines or tomatoes, you would do your best by using one plant per container. 5. Design Raised Garden Bed Containers to Suit Your Outdoor Space Raised garden beds can make great vegetable garden containers if you have a large enough space to work with. The benefit of this is that you can have these containers made to fit your landscaping, no matter how large or small they need to be. There are many great materials out there to use for raised beds. One expert suggests using Corten steel due to its durability and capacity to be bent or folded into an unusual shape. The deep rust shade of the material is also very attractive and will look great with other materials like buff-colored gravel."},{"instruction":"Help me draft a home organization routine that focuses on decluttering and tidying up different areas of the house.

The response is formatted in a numbered list: 1. Set a quit date within the next two weeks. Creating a concrete goal date will keep you accountable and help you mentally prepare to quit. Setting the date within the next two weeks will give you adequate time to prepare yourself without reducing your motivation to go through with it. 2. Tell your family, friends, and co-workers that you plan to quit. Not only will this help keep you accountable and on track to quit, but you will need the support and encouragement of your friends and family in order to follow through. 3. Anticipate and plan for the challenges you'll face while quitting. Increase your chance of success by thinking of any likely challenges and creating a plan for how to manage them. By anticipating and planning for how you will deal with challenges such as nicotine withdrawal, you will be more likely to make it through those difficult moments without relapsing. 4. Remove cigarettes from your home, car, and work. By completely removing cigarettes from your living and working areas, you will be less likely to think about cigarettes and consider smoking one once you've quit. 5. Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit. There is no need to meet this challenge alone. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan to deal with withdrawal symptoms and may be able to recommend over-the-counter products such as nicotine patches, lozenges, and gum. Speaking to a medical professional will help you answer any questions you have and put you in a positive mindset for success.

The tone should be opinionated but balanced.","output":"What would be my ideal smartwatch? As a tech reviewer, I've certainly had the opportunity to try many devices during my career. Ultimately, I've realized what I value most about a smartwatch is utility. After all, if the battery life is so short that I can't rely on the device to tell me the time, what good is it? As such, I am strongly in favor of e-ink displays for smartwatches. These displays only draw power when they change what they are displaying on the screen. As such, they offer phenomenal battery life. For a smartwatch, which is still mostly used to check the time and notifications, e-ink displays would offer significant advantages not only in battery life but also readability in sunlight. I would prefer my ideal smartwatch to use Wear OS as I currently use an Android phone and I appreciate its wide app compatibility. I am aware that there have been issues with Wear OS and battery life, but I believe an e-ink display with mitigate these disadvantages. As a possible additional feature, I would like the smartwatch to also store a pair of true wireless earbuds. This would allow me to have private, high-quality personal audio at all times without having to carry or pair another device. This may come at the cost of battery life, but again, I believe the e-ink display would be a major mitigating factor. Altogether, these features would combine to make my ideal smartwatch.

I need tips and suggestions on how to write a resume that will get noticed by hiring managers.","output":"Here are some useful tips that will help you improve your resume so it will be noticed by hiring managers. 1. Plan Ahead - When rewriting or updating your resume, you need to focus on the key sections, which are your experience, objections, special skills, and education. The more organized you are when preparing to write your resume, the more it will show in the outcome. Get started by writing an outline so that you will know what you are going to include and what you will leave out. 2. Use Action Words and Bullet Points - Action verbs are incisive and can showcase to the reader what your skills are. Use words such as managed, planned, presented, supervised, coordinated, increased, or engaged to show off your accomplishments. And be sure to use plenty of bullet points to help make your content easy to scan and read. Doing so will also make it easier for you to make clear and concise statements. 3. Always Be Specific - When writing about all you have accomplished, be sure to make your statements clear and specific. Something like \\"Grew department revenue by 30 percent each year\\" will have more power than a statement that simply says \\"increased department revenue for the company\\". Be sure to use specific numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts whenever possible. It will help you get your point across. 4. Focus on the Positive - Always make sure you accentuate the positive thing and leave out anything negative when writing your resume. Share any special or unique accomplishments you have made, as well as any unique skills, awards, or winning work. And while it is a good idea to place your contact details at the top of the resume, you shouldn't add any personal details beyond that. 5. Make Use of Key Words - Keywords are excellent tools to use when you want to get your resume noticed. Some companies will use scanners to seek out words that are relevant to the jobs they posted. Additionally, the keywords you use can show that you have the right amount of industry knowledge for the job you are applying for. For instance, a market research professional may mention having experience in the voice of customer work, developing actionable customer insights, or analyzing high-level data and research. By following these useful tips, you will be able to improve your resume and gain the attention of the hiring managers you want to impress."},{"instruction":"What are some of the top concerns for those in the food industry?","output":"Some of the most pressing issues in the food industry for business owners include food safety, food wastage, rising supply chain costs, increased consumer demand for food traceability and food fraud."},{"instruction":"Can you explain what food fraud is?","output":"When a manufacturer adds a lower-priced vegetable oil to an expensive olive oil but sells the product as 100 percent olive oil, they are cheating their customers.

His name was Sootsprite, and his fur was black. He liked to test boundaries, and he didn't mind if he got punished from time to time. In Sootsprite's mind, the world was meant to be explored. The other kitten was a bit of a princess. She was fluffy and preferred to sit on a cozy windowsill and watch the world go by. Her fur was gray, and her name was Malarkey. She didn't like to get in trouble because she knew if she was bad, she would get sprayed with a squirt bottle. One sunny day, Sootsprite's and Malarkey's human roommate left to go somewhere. They heard talking in excited voices. The man took his car keys and held the door open for a woman. \\"You be good now,\\" he said, looking right at Sootsprite. \\"I'm counting on you to not make a mess.\\" Malarkey looked back and forth between the man and Sootsprite. \\"Oh no,\\" she thought. \\"This could be bad.\\" Sure enough, as soon as he heard the keys turn in the lock, the little black cat jumped up from the couch. He ran to the window, pushing Malarkey aside and watched as a white car pulled away from the curb. He turned to Malarkey with a big toothy grin on his face. She stared back and shook her head.

(See the latest figures here.) Scientists have made rapid progress in understanding the culprit, a new virus in the coronavirus family, which has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The pneumonia-like disease it causes is called COVID-19. As the virus has spread, however, misinformation has, too. We’ve written about many bogus claims about the new coronavirus spread through social media, as well as false and misleading claims made by politicians. See our Coronavirus Coverage page for a guide to our articles. Here, we answer some key questions about what is known so far about the outbreak and the virus. When did the outbreak begin, and what is the cause? Scientists are still working to determine when the virus first emerged in people, but the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. After a string of mysterious pneumonia cases, many of them linked to a seafood market selling wild game and live animals, officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31. By Jan. 7, Chinese authorities had isolated a virus, later named SARS-CoV-2, as the cause of the disease, and shared the genome a few days later. This allowed other countries to test for the virus, and for scientists to begin devising treatments and investigating how the outbreak began. Coronaviruses are a diverse family of large RNA viruses that have characteristic spikes on their surface, making them look like they have a halo, or corona, when viewed under a microscope. Most coronaviruses that infect humans are relatively benign and cause mild respiratory diseases such as the common cold, said Susan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, in a phone interview. But in recent years, new coronaviruses have cropped up that are far more dangerous to humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which led to a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, which was identified in 2012. According to the WHO, SARS ultimately infected more than 8,000 people, killing 774. Since 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 MERS cases and 858 deaths. The new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus — and is in the same betacoronavirus subgroup as both the SARS and MERS viruses — but is considered a new pathogen. What are the symptoms, and how severe is the disease? The virus causes a pneumonia-like respiratory illness that varies in severity, but can be deadly. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. A report in the Lancet that analyzed the first 41 people admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 infection suggests that clinically, the illness is similar to SARS, although fewer patients appear to have diarrhea or upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose and sore throat. Some people also report fatigue, and in some cases people have been found to be infected, but clear of any symptoms. Many of the symptoms are common to other respiratory diseases. Lab tests based on the virus’ genetic sequence can confirm infection. It’s not yet known how frequently people die from COVID-19. The reported fatality rates have fluctuated as the disease has spread, hovering around 2-3% in late January, and around 4% as of March 18. For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said in an email. But these estimates, which are simple calculations of the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases, may not accurately reflect how dangerous the virus is, since the disease course is still underway for many patients, Fisman said. It’s also likely that far more people have been infected, but have not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, he said, the case fatality rate may be significantly lower. (For more on the fatality rate, see our March 5 story “Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate.”) According to a February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. Reports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill and die, deaths are primarily in older folks and those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory conditions and hypertension. The Chinese CDC study, for instance, found a mortality rate of 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79, while the overall fatality rate then was 2.3% for cases in mainland China. Similar statistics from Italy bear out this trend. As of March 15, no one in the country below the age of 30 had died from COVID-19, but a fifth or more of those above age 80 with the disease had. In Italy, about 25% of cases have been severe. How is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the new coronavirus is transmitted from person to person in close contact, within about 6 feet of one another. Scientists suspect the transmission is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through respiratory droplets when infected people cough or sneeze. This is how scientists believe past coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS have spread. The incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be around 4 days, but may range from 2 to 14 days, according to the CDC. There is some evidence that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others. A March 16 Science study that modeled how the outbreak unfolded in China also found that people who have few or no symptoms may be responsible for the bulk of the disease spread. The CDC, however, says that people are “thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic” and that asymptomatic people are “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” It also could be possible to contract the disease by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or even eyes. A study released in mid-March by scientists with the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton found the virus could be detected for up to 24 hours on cardboard and much longer on hard surfaces including plastic and stainless steel — for up to two to three days. At a March 18 press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that “we’re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface,” adding that the fundamental guidelines are to avoid exposure to “excess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected … and don’t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it.” It’s also unclear exactly how infectious the new virus is. Several groups of scientists have attempted to estimate SARS-CoV-2’s basic reproduction number, or R0, which is the average number of other people one person infects, assuming everyone in the population is susceptible. Using a variety of methods, multiple teams have arrived at figures that generally range from 1.5 to 4, which suggest the transmissibility is roughly in line with that of SARS, but below that of the measles virus, which has an R0 of around 12 to 18, and is one of the most infectious viruses in the world. “Despite the diversity of approaches taken there’s remarkable consistency in estimates from highly competent investigators, which seem to fall between 2 and 3,” said Fisman. An early estimate from the WHO, for example, suggested that every infected person would spread the virus to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average, while a team at Imperial College London pegged the R0 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland calculated an R0 of 1.4 to 3.8, and Harvard researchers Maia Majumder and Kenneth Mandl estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1. While the figures provide some clue as to how contagious the virus is, it’s important to recognize that these values don’t necessarily say anything about how widespread the outbreak will be. As Majumder pointed out on Twitter, the R0 reflects potential transmission, not actual transmission — and that even though seasonal flu has a relatively low R0 of about 1.3, it causes millions of cases per year, whereas SARS had an R0 between 2 and 5, and led to fewer than 10,000 cases. “Planning, preparedness, and infection control can effectively bring an outbreak of a novel, moderate-R_0 disease to a close even in the absence of vaccines,” Majumder said in a tweet. “Because of this, estimates of R_0 for #nCoV2019 should be viewed as a call to action instead of a reason to panic.” How can people protect themselves from contracting or spreading the virus? The CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently, with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, avoid touching their faces with unwashed hands, avoid close contact with sick individuals, and avoid social interactions generally to prevent community spread. The CDC website provides advice on what to do if you’re sick and other resources.","output":"This text is objective.

My first stop was the sporting goods store where I knocked over all of the golf club displays and sent the store manager chasing after tennis balls.

Now, anybody who bites into a piece of chocolate in this town will get a mouthful of me! Haha! The next place I went was the local swimming pool. I fancied a nice dip to get my tendrils wet.

The pool attendant fished me out of the pool and held me up for everyone to see. There were cries of horror at the sight of me. It was delightful. But, I managed to wriggle myself out of his grasp and take off out the door. Just then, the bald man caught sight of me. He'd been searching all over town, following my path of mayhem. He managed to reach out and grab ahold of me too, but I was greasy and the water from the pool made me slick. I slid away and made a break for it.

Do you know where it came from?","output":"The term sedan has been used to describe certain cars since 1912, but it does have a deeper past. Historically, “sedans” were transportation methods used by wealthy people throughout the world at least as far back as the 1600s. A sedan was a specific type of litter with a single enclosed chair with windows. It was carried by two porters – one in front and one behind the enclosed litter. The first recorded use of the term to describe a motor vehicle was in 1912 by the Studebaker company. The specific definition has evolved over time. Today’s sedans are defined as fixed-roof passenger cars that contain three separate compartments: one for the engine, one for passengers, and one for cargo. Though many vehicles blur the lines between sedans and other styles, in common parlance, this definition still holds. Incidentally, some countries use different terms for this style of passenger car.

He then pursued a doctorate in English at Brown University. He never completed his dissertation but wrote parts of Edwin Mullhouse in two separate stays at Brown. Between times at the university, he wrote Portrait of a Romantic at his parents' house in Connecticut. His story \\"The Invention of Robert Herendeen\\" (in The Barnum Museum) features a failed student who has moved back in with his parents; the story is loosely based on this period of Millhauser's life.[1] Until the Pulitzer Prize, Millhauser was best known for his 1972 debut novel, Edwin Mullhouse. This novel, about a precocious writer whose career ends abruptly with his death at age eleven, features the fictional Jeffrey Cartwright playing Boswell to Edwin's Johnson. Edwin Mullhouse brought critical acclaim, and Millhauser followed with a second novel, Portrait of a Romantic, in 1977, and his first collection of short stories, In The Penny Arcade, in 1986. Possibly the most well-known of his short stories is \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\" (published in \\"The Barnum Museum\\"), based on a pseudo-mythical tale of a magician who stunned audiences in Vienna in the latter part of the 19th century. It was made into the film The Illusionist (2006).[2] Millhauser's stories often treat fantasy themes in a manner reminiscent of Poe or Borges, with a distinctively American voice. As critic Russell Potter has noted, \\"In (Millhauser's stories), mechanical cowboys at penny arcades come to life; curious amusement parks, museums, or catacombs beckon with secret passageways and walking automata; dreamers dream and children fly out their windows at night on magic carpets.\\"[3] Millhauser's collections of stories continued with The Barnum Museum (1990), Little Kingdoms (1993), and The Knife Thrower and Other Stories (1998). The unexpected success of Martin Dressler in 1997 brought him increased attention.

You don’t seem to have a good singing voice.” The bear made a face. “But you could teach me.” “Hmm, let me think about it.” The bird sat there, making odd faces for a few moments. Finally, she spoke. “I’m sure you have many talents, but your voice is too deep and raspy. You’ll never be a good singer, but there are lots of other things you could do besides singing.” The bear was very disappointed. “I don’t seem to have any skills or talents.” “You’re a good hunter. You’re good at scaring off the wolves and foxes. Just think about all the positive ways you could be helpful. You’re big and strong and you can carry heavy things.” “Hmm, I suppose you’re right. I do have some skills that other animals don’t have.” “Oh yes indeed. I could never carry a large bee’s nest, but you can. I could never scare away a predator. Be thankful for all the ways that you are unique instead of wishing to be somebody else.” The bear listened and learned so much that day. He began to realize what a unique individual he was.

A few weeks ago, when you brought that filthy thing home, I already knew that it was never going to work out. But, since it seemed that you were quite excited about it, I decided I would give it a chance before deciding. However, since that time, it has been the worst house guest I have ever seen in my life! First of all, it pooped in the middle of the floor. I mean, come on. That should be reason enough. Where is its box? And as if that wasn’t enough, it made the worst noise at the delivery man the other day. Screaming and shouting like a crazy person! Plus, it chases me all over the house! There isn’t a safe place anymore. I’ve taken to hiding up above the television unit or under your bed, but I can’t live like that forever. So here’s the bottom line: It’s me or the dog. Now, I know I’m not perfect, but I have lived in your house for the past five years and have barely made a peep! I’m calm, cuddly, and seriously sweet. To me, it’s a no-brainer. But if he’s not gone by 5:00 tomorrow, I will be going on a hunger strike. So, either watch me slowly die due to your poor decisions, or get rid of the damn dog.

It's common for a sighted person to wonder what blind people see or for a blind person to wonder whether the experience is the same for others without sight. There is no single answer to the question, \\"What do blind people see?\\" because there are different degrees of blindness. Also, since it's the brain that \\"sees\\" information, it matters whether a person ever had sight. What Blind People Actually See Blind From Birth: A person who has never had sight doesn't see. Samuel, who was born blind, tells ThoughtCo that saying that a blind person sees black is incorrect because that person often has no other sensation of sight to compare against. \\"It's just nothingness,\\" he says. For a sighted person, it can be helpful to think of it like this: Close one eye and use the open eye to focus on something. What does the closed eye see? Nothing. Another analogy is to compare a blind person's sight to what you see with your elbow. Went Totally Blind: People who have lost their sight have different experiences. Some describe seeing complete darkness, like being in a cave. Some people see sparks or experience vivid visual hallucinations that may take the form of recognizable shapes, random shapes, and colors, or flashes of light. The \\"visions\\" are a hallmark of Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS). CBS may be lasting or transient in nature. It is not a mental illness and is not associated with brain damage. In addition to total blindness, there is functional blindness. Definitions of functional blindness vary from one country to the next. In the United States, it refers to visual impairment where vision in the better eye with the best correction with glasses is worse than 20/200.1 The World Health Organization defines blindness as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60.2 What functionally blind people see depends on the severity of blindness and the form of impairment. Legally Blind: A person may be able to see large objects and people, but they are out of focus. A legally blind person may see colors or see in focus at a certain distance (e.g., be able to count fingers in front of the face). In other cases, color acuity may be lost or all vision is hazy. The experience is highly variable. Joey, who has 20/400 vision, tells ThoughtCo that he \\"constantly sees neon speckles that are always moving and changing colors.\\" Light Perception: A person who still has light perception can't form clear images, but can tell when the lights are on or off. Tunnel Vision: Vision may be relatively normal (or not), but only within a certain radius. A person with tunnel vision can't see objects except within a cone of less than 10 degrees.","output":"[Introduction] [Opening shot: A black screen with the title \\"What Do Blind People See?\\" appears, with dramatic music] Narrator: It's a question that has puzzled both sighted individuals and those without sight for centuries. What do blind people actually see? The answer, however, is not a simple one. Join us on this journey as we explore the various degrees of blindness and dive into the fascinating world of visual perception. [Scene 1: Blind from Birth] [Cut to the interview with Samuel, a blind individual, sitting in a comfortable room] Samuel: When people ask me what I see, it's hard to explain because I've never had sight. It's not like seeing darkness or blackness; it's simply nothingness. There is no frame of reference, it's like trying to see with your elbow. [Narrator's voice-over] Narrator: For those born blind, the concept of sight is entirely foreign. Samuel compares it to closing one eye while the other focuses on something. What does the closed eye see? Nothing. It's void, a world of emptiness. [Scene 2: Went Totally Blind] [Cut to the series of interviews with individuals who have lost their sight.] Narrator: But what about those who once had their sight and lost it? Their experiences can vary greatly. Some describe it as being surrounded by complete darkness, akin to being trapped in a pitch-black cave. Others may see sparks or experience vivid visual hallucinations. [Cut to a close-up of visuals resembling those experienced by individuals with Charles Bonnet Syndrome] Narrator: These \\"visions' are known as Charles Bonnet syndrome, which can manifest as recognizable shapes, random patterns, or flashes of light. It's important to note that CBS is not a mental illness and is not associated with brain damage. [Scene 3: Functional Blindness] [Cut to a visually impaired person using a cane to navigate the streets.] Narrator: In addition to total blindness, there is a condition known as functional blindness. The severity of this impairment can vary, and it is often defined differently from one country to another. [Cut to a close-up of a visually impaired person's eye] Narrator: In the United States, functional blindness refers to a visual impairment where the best-corrected vision in the better eye is worse than 20/200. However, according to the World Health Organization, blindness is defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60. [Cut to a visually impaired person describing their experience.] Narrator: For those who are functionally blind, what they see depends on the severity of their impairment and the specific form of visual limitation they experience. [Scene 4: Legally Blind] [Cut to an interview with Joey, a legally blind person, sitting in a living room.] Joey: My vision is hazy, and things are often out of focus. I can see colors, but they're not as vibrant or clear as for someone with normal vision. It's like constantly seeing neon speckles that are always moving and changing colors. [Narrator's voiceover] Narrator: Joey, who is considered legally blind with 20/400 vision, explains the challenges he faces. While he can perceive large objects and people, his visual acuity is greatly diminished. [Scene 5: Light Perception and Tunnel Vision] [Cut to a visually impaired person observing a light turning on and off] Narrator: For some individuals, even though they can't form clear images, they still have light perception. They can discern when lights are on or off, distinguishing between brightness and darkness. [Cut to a person with tunnel vision navigating a crowded street] Narrator: Others may have a condition called tunnel vision. Within a limited radius, their vision may be relatively normal. However, they cannot see objects beyond a small cone of less than 10 degrees. [Conclusion] [Narrator's voiceover] Narrator: So, what do blind people see? The answer is complex and multifaceted. From the emptiness experienced by those born blind to the varying perceptions of individuals who have lost their sight, it's clear that there is no single answer. The world of visual perception is as diverse as the people who inhabit it.

The conditions needed to produce lightning have been known for some time. However, exactly how lightning forms has never been verified, so there is room for debate. Leading theories focus around separation of electric charge and generation of an electric field within a thunderstorm. Recent studies also indicate that ice, hail, and semi-frozen water drops are essential to lightning development. Storms that fail to produce large quantities of ice usually fail to produce lightning. Forecasting when and where lightning will strike is not yet possible and most likely never will be. But by educating yourself about lightning and learning some basic safety rules, you, your family, and your friends can avoid needless exposure to the dangers of one of the most capricious and unpredictable forces of nature. Thunderstorms have very turbulent environments. Strong updrafts and downdrafts occur with regularity and within close proximity to each other. The updrafts transport small liquid water droplets from the lower regions of the storm to heights between 35,000 and 70,000 feet, which is miles above the freezing level. Meanwhile, downdrafts transport hail and ice from the frozen upper regions of the storm. When these collide, the water droplets freeze and release heat. This heat in turn keeps the surface of the hail and ice slightly warmer than their surrounding environment, and a \\"soft hail\\", or \\"graupel\\", forms. When graupel collides with additional water droplets and ice particles, a critical phenomenon occurs: electrons are sheared off of the ascending particles and collect on the descending particles. Because electrons carry a negative charge, the result is a storm cloud with a negatively charged base and a positively charged top. In the world of electricity, opposites attract and insulators inhibit. As positive and negative charges begin to separate within the cloud, an electric field is generated between its top and base. Further separation of these charges into pools of positive and negative regions results in a strengthening of the electric field. However, the atmosphere is a very good insulator that inhibits electric flow, so a TREMENDOUS amount of charge has to build up before lightning can occur. When that charge threshold is reached, the strength of the electric field overpowers the atmosphere's insulating properties, and lightning results. The electric field within the storm is not the only one that develops. Below the negatively charged storm base, positive charge begins to pool within the surface of the Earth (see image right). This positive charge will shadow the storm wherever it goes and is responsible for cloud-to-ground lightning. However, the electric field within the storm is much stronger than the one between the storm base and the Earth's surface, so most lightning (~75-80%) occurs within the storm cloud itself. How Lightning Develops Between The Cloud And The Ground It is invisible to the human eye and shoots to the ground in a series of rapid steps, each occurring in less time than it takes to blink. As the negative leader approaches the ground, positive charge collects in the ground and in objects on the ground. When these channels connect, the resulting electrical transfer is what we see as lightning. After the initial lightning stroke, if enough charge is leftover, additional lightning strokes will use the same channel, giving the bolt its flickering appearance. Take it to the MAX! The Lightning Process: Keeping in Step Tall objects, such as trees and skyscrapers, are commonly struck by lightning. Mountains also make good targets. This is because their tops are closer to the base of the storm cloud. Remember, the atmosphere is a good electrical insulator. The less distance the lightning has to burn through, the easier it is for it to strike. However, this does not always mean tall objects will be struck. Lightning can strike the ground in an open field even if the tree line is nearby - it all depends on where the charges accumulate.","output":"Lightning is a fascinating natural phenomenon. The way it is created depends heavily on the types of clouds that are formed. It has been shown that large amounts of ice, whether that be hail or semi-frozen water, are required for lightning to form. When a thunderstorm cloud is formed, the top of it is positively charged and the bottom of it is negatively charged. There is something in the clouds called a \\"charge threshold\\" which is essentially the amount of charge the clouds together have to reach before lightning is formed. Below the negatively charged bottom part of the cloud, positively charged ions form on the Earth's surface. Since opposite charges are attracted to each other, the negatively charged cloud will send a charge out to the positively charged part of Earth's surface after the threshold is reached. This charge that reaches the Earth from the cloud is lightning. Most of the time lightning strikes, it will strike something tall like a skyscraper or tall tree. The reason for this is that the positively charged ions will travel up this tall object making the distance between the ions and the negatively charged cloud smaller. The smaller the distance, the stronger the attraction will be. This however does not mean that lightning will always strike what is closer to it, if a flat surface has more positive ions than the taller surface, lightning will most likely strike the flat surface since the attraction would still be stronger than the one with less distance. To summarize, Lightning strikes depend on the amount of ice in clouds, the charge threshold of the clouds, and the strength of attraction between the negatively charged bottom part of the cloud and the positively charged parts of Earth's surface."},{"instruction":"Please write a creative drama/mystery short story scene about Olivia who meets Jacob in a room with guards and tells him he will be released soon because they found the real killer.

If the physical cause of Marvin Gaye’s death was straightforward—”Gunshot wound to chest perforating heart, lung and liver,” according to the Los Angeles County Coroner—the events that led to it were much more tangled. On the one hand, there was the longstanding conflict with his father dating back to childhood. Marvin Gay, Sr., (the “e” was added by his son for his stage name) was a preacher in the Hebrew Pentecostal Church and a proponent of a strict moral code he enforced brutally with his four children. He was also, by all accounts, a hard-drinking cross-dresser who personally embodied a rather complicated model of morality. By some reports, Marvin Sr. harbored significant envy over his son’s tremendous success, and Marvin Jr. clearly harbored unresolved feelings toward his abusive father. Those feelings spilled out for the final time in the Los Angeles home of Marvin Gay, Sr., and his wife Alberta. Their son, the international recording star, had moved into his parents’ home in late 1983 at a low point in his struggle with depression, debt and cocaine abuse. Only one year removed from his first Grammy win and from a triumphant return to the pop charts with “Sexual Healing,” Marvin Gaye was in horrible physical, psychological and financial shape. After an argument between father and son escalated into a physical fight on the morning of April 1, 1984, Alberta Gay was trying to calm her son in his bedroom when Marvin Sr. took a revolver given to him by Marvin Jr. and shot him three times in his chest. Marvin Gaye’s brother, Frankie, who lived next door, and who held the legendary singer during his final minutes, later wrote in his memoir that Marvin Gaye’s final, disturbing statement was, “I got what I wanted….I couldn’t do it myself, so I made him do it.”","output":"• What was the physical cause of Marvin Gaye's death?

An asteroid that may host life's building blocks will get a visit from a United Arab Emirates (UAE) spacecraft about a decade from now, if all goes according to plan. In October 2021, the UAE announced that it plans to launch an ambitious mission to the asteroid belt in 2028. That mission will visit seven different space rocks, and even land on one of them, an asteroid called (269) Justitia. On Sunday (May 28), the nation gave us some new information about this bold asteroid mission — including its name, the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (EMA). \\"We will never cease to look ahead; we will never cease our efforts to develop a brighter future for our young generations,\\" Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumbin Rashid Al Maktoum, the vice president and prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, said in a statement. The EMA spacecraft will be named after the sheikh, we learned Sunday: It will be called the MBR Explorer. The MBR Explorer will visit its first asteroid in 2030, and will follow an orbital path allowing it to pick up speed from several planets along the way. (It's common for spacecraft to get such \\"gravity assists\\" from worlds like Venus or Mars to save on fuel, and to do side observations to test their instruments.) After passing by six asteroids, the mission aims to touch down upon Justitia in 2034 with a small lander that will deploy from MBR Explorer. Justitia may have organic molecules on its surface; organics are the building blocks of the complex molecules that could form life in the right circumstances. More generally, scientists seek water and organics all over the solar system to better understand how life arose on Earth. That search may be especially meaningful on Justitia, which may have formed closer to our planet and then migrated out to its current position in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, scientists say. The rest of the mission manifest includes flybys of the asteroids (10254) Westerwald, (623) Chimaera, (13294) Rockox; (88055) 2000 VA28, (23871) 1998 RC76 and (59980) 1999 SG6, all meant to represent \\"different classes of asteroid with varied compositional types,\\" UAE Space Agency officials said in the same statement. Justitia and Chimaera are around 31 miles (50 kilometers) in diameter, with the remaining asteroids less than 6 miles (10 km) across each. Four science instruments have been announced to probe the geology, composition and structure of the asteroids: a high-resolution camera, a thermal infrared camera, a mid-wavelength spectrometer and an infrared spectrometer. The UAE Space Agency was formed in 2014 and is one of the youngest space agencies in the world; by comparison, NASA was formed in 1958 from previous U.S. government groups. The UAE's Hope Mars orbiter, which launched in 2020, was the first Arab spacecraft to reach the Red Planet, making it on the first try, no less. The first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa al Mansoori, launched on a short mission to the International Space Station in 2019. There is another UAE astronaut in orbit right now: Sultan Al Neyadi, who launched to the orbiting lab in March on SpaceX's Crew-6 mission.","output":"In the annals of time, an audacious mission stands ready to challenge the unknown. A decade from now, a daring spacecraft from the United Arab Emirates will sail through the cosmos, seeking the cradle of life on a far-flung asteroid. This tale began in October 2021, when the UAE unfurled its grand vision to venture into the asteroid belt by 2028. The mission, a thrilling odyssey through seven alien rocks, harbors an even grander objective: landing on a particular asteroid, christened (269) Justitia. Fast forward to a Sunday, May 28, a day of revelation. The UAE bestowed a name upon this bold endeavor, baptizing it the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (EMA). \\"We will perpetually strive towards the horizon, nurturing a promising future for our youth,\\" avowed Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumbin Rashid Al Maktoum, the visionary behind the UAE's ambition, its vice president, prime minister, and the ruler of Dubai. As an ode to this great leader, the spacecraft embarking on this voyage was named MBR Explorer. Setting sail in 2030, the MBR Explorer would chart a course through the planets, harnessing their gravitational pulls to slingshot itself, not unlike a cosmic game of pinball. This celestial dance, a common strategy to conserve fuel, also serves as an opportunity for the spacecraft to flex its scientific muscles, testing its tools on these celestial bodies. The culmination of this adventure would arrive in 2034 when MBR Explorer makes its historic touchdown on Justitia. This ancient rock could harbor the blueprint of life itself, organic molecules. These are the seeds from which, under favorable conditions, life could spring. The scientific community continually seeks the presence of water and organics throughout our solar system, probing into the origins of life on our own planet. Their pursuit might find meaning on Justitia, a rock thought to have migrated from closer to Earth into the asteroid belt that girdles Mars and Jupiter. Beyond Justitia, the voyage would undertake flybys of several asteroids, each representing diverse asteroid classes, embodying varied compositions. Among them, Justitia and Chimaera loom the largest, with a diameter stretching to around 31 miles, while the remaining are lesser in size, barely crossing 6 miles. Armed with four science instruments, the MBR Explorer is poised to unravel the mysteries of these asteroids, studying their geology, composition, and structure. From high-resolution and thermal infrared cameras to spectrometers of different wavelengths, it’s well equipped for its task. A mere decade since its inception in 2014, the UAE Space Agency stands as one of the youngest players in the celestial arena. Yet, it has already made its mark, launching the Hope Mars orbiter, the first Arab spacecraft to reach the Red Planet, and successfully so on its first attempt. It also has the honor of launching the first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa al Mansoori, to the International Space Station in 2019. Now, another UAE astronaut, Sultan Al Neyadi, orbits our planet, having embarked on SpaceX's Crew-6 mission in March."},{"instruction":"Give me some examples of a short message to go with the flowers I'm giving my mom for Mother's Day.

While the exact origins of the maypole remain unknown, the annual traditions surrounding it can be traced back to medieval times, and some are still celebrated today. Villagers would enter the woods to find a maypole that was set up for the day in small towns (or sometimes permanently in larger cities). The day’s festivities involved merriment, as people would dance around the pole clad with colorful streamers and ribbons. Historians believe the first maypole dance originated as part of a fertility ritual, where the pole symbolized male fertility and baskets and wreaths symbolized female fertility. The maypole never really took root in America, where May Day celebrations were discouraged by the Puritans. But other forms of celebrations did find their way to the New World. During the 19th and 20th centuries, May Basket Day was celebrated across the country, where baskets were created with flowers, candies and other treats and hung on the doors of friends, neighbors and loved ones on May 1.","output":"According to the article you provided, the maypole symbolizes male fertility."},{"instruction":"Take the factual information and reformat it into a bullet-point list, where each bullet point has one sentence.

Coffee roasting and cultivation is thought to have originated in Yemen in the middle of the 15th century. To go from harvest to being ready to brew and drink, the freshly picked coffee beans need to go through several steps. 1. Once harvested, the fruit (called a coffee cherry) is dried to around 11% moisture. In many places, the cherries are left in the dry sun for several weeks. 2. After drying, the coffee beans are then hulled, or polished to remove the thin, silvery, outer coating and sorted by size and weight before being shipped around the world. 3.

Explain your reasoning. LOCAL Clothes in hamper smell good enough 1 DAY AGO by H. CLAIR ( @ ) Photo Credit REGINA – Part-time barista Melanie Ericsson has reportedly expressed relief after realizing she had no clean clothes but, fortunately, discovered that those in her hamper had a pleasant-enough odour that she could wear them to an important engagement. “I’ve had a pretty busy month, what with working, studying, gaming and napping, and I guess I never really found a moment to dump my clothes basket into the washing machine,” added Ericsson, sniffing her collar. “The next thing I know, I get a call asking if I could come in for an interview at a pretty prestigious law firm, and all I have left in my closet are a flannel tracksuit, a pair of shorts I borrowed from my brother, and a BTS concert shirt that had a weird stain from the time I tried mixing a daiquiri with the stuff inside a glow stick”. While positing that others might panic, Ericsson stated that she has a “tried-and-true” process to mitigate such wardrobe emergencies. “The first thing you want to do is immerse your hand into the fabric-pile and identify what I like to call ‘the dry zone’ and isolate those clothes from the rest”. She continued, “Next up is taking a proper inventory of what kind of smell-profile we’re dealing with”, adding that “it was important that whatever blouse I chose had some residual deodorant scent, as a kind of safety-net”. Ericsson noted that it is similarly critical to properly coordinate odours. “In this case, my top also preserved a hint of my daily cinnamon bagel. So, in addition to assuring they were at least 50% wrinkle-free, I made a point to grab a pair of slacks that carried a nice bouquet of Kraft Dinner”. “You see, while both pieces smelled, they were matching smells, bread and cheese pair well together. A combative aroma palette is a real faux-pas”.","output":"This news article is humorous. It is an exaggerated account of an experience that many people may relate to, re-wearing a clothing item from the hamper, and taking it to a more extreme level where the subject is wearing these clothes to a job interview at a prestigious law firm. It also uses satire by including gaming and napping as activities in the subject's \\"busy month\\". Lastly, the unexpected and absurd goal of creating complimentary smells between the dirty clothing items worn contributes to the comedic tone."},{"instruction":"Hi! I want to tinker with MongoDB.

Give a short description of their attributes and the attire they wear. Give an example of each in a different video game.","output":"No problem, here are three class archetypes in RPGs! 1. Warrior - Warriors are possibly the most used class in RPGs. It is often known as the default choice and the warrior is typically known for their strength and ability to wield a sword. The warrior normally dons armor made out of some form of metal and also wields a sword and sometimes a shield. They have a muscular build compared to other members of the party and sometimes their opponents. They are not the most clever but can certainly get the job done, most of the time with brute force. Edelgard from Fire Emblem Three Houses is a more recent example of the Warrior class. 2. Mage - Mages are probably the 2nd most common class. They typically wield a stave, staff, or some wand-type object but can also sometimes wield different weapons such as a hammer or knives. Their armor is typically a cloak and their defense is oftentimes weaker than other characters. Their magic is often consumable and can run out so they will either need to rest at an inn or use an ether to restore their MP. Black mages typically use offensive magic against their opponents such as fire or lightning while white mages use healing magic like Cure and can also heal status ailments such as poison. Vivi in Final Fantasy IX is one of the most iconic characters in the RPG genre. 3. Thief - Thieves are most well-known for their speed as well as their ability to steal. This is typically a command that they will have from the moment they join your party. They are normally a more slender build and typically wield knives. They wear cloaks, sometimes with hoods and often prefer to hide and may also want to hide their identity. They are known much more for their support abilities than being able to attack like a Warrior, for instance. In certain games, thieves can steal very rare pieces of equipment from bosses or difficult enemies. Thieves have also been known to poison their enemies. Therion in Octopath Traveler 1 is an example of a thief. He can steal from enemies while you're in towns, which can be very helpful."},{"instruction":"Sum this up in a sentence.

The earliest human remains can be traced back approximately 50,000 years; however, inconclusive data suggests they might have been around as far back as 80,000 years ago. Australia’s indigenous peoples were hunter-gatherers, and even though they were nomadic, they had strong ties to specific areas of land they might have considered home.

She points out that this slow-cooker-made recipe is higher in protein, with about 50% dry matter, and lower in fat, with about 10% dry matter than you'd find in most recipes. She adds that, since every pet has very specific needs, you should only use this recipe as a starting point, then talk things over with your pet's doctor for more specifics suited to them. The ingredients you will need are: * 3/4ths minimum to 1 pound maximum of cubed, skinless, boneless chicken breasts or thighs. (Substitute with lean beef, turkey, or fish if necessary or preferred) * 1 ounce minimum to 3 ounces maximum of preferably chicken liver, hearts, or gizzards. Other animal livers are acceptable. * If this meal accounts for more than 10% of a dog's daily diet, include 1 tablespoon of bone meal (or 1,500 mg) per pound of meat * 1 to 2 whole eggs for a healthy source of fat * 8 ounces of brown or white rice * 16 ounces of green beans * Water Take your slow cooker and add in the diced chicken, the chicken liver, gizzards, and hearts, along with the eggs. You will then add the bone meal, rice, and green beans. Denser ingredients should be at the bottom, with the lightest ingredients on top. Since the amount of water you'll need to use depends on how long you choose to cook the ingredients and how big your slow cooker is, there isn't a specific amount you need to add. Try to fill the cooker to about two-thirds of the way full, but not less than halfway, and if possible, use a six-or-seven quart cooker. When you add in the water, you should try to submerge the ingredients without fully covering them. Then, stir the contents. Put on the lid and set the temperature to low. Leave your crockpot on for around 4 to 8 hours, only as long as needed for the chicken breasts to fall apart. As it's cooking, you can stir and add water to make the stew moister or drier, but keep in mind that you can lose up to 20 to 30 minutes of cooking time if the lid is removed."},{"instruction":"How many astronauts were on the first spaceship that landed men on the moon in 1969?

Source Text: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will cease tracking community levels of Covid and the percentage of tests that come back positive, a metric used to calculate transmission rates, the agency announced on Friday. The decision is linked to the end of the public health emergency on May 11. The emergency designation, first declared in January 2020, had allowed the C.D.C. to demand certain kinds of data on Covid’s spread from state officials. To track death rates, agency officials now will rely on the National Vital Statistics System, which is highly accurate but tends to lag behind other kinds of surveillance by two to three weeks. The C.D.C. is also scaling back the data that hospitals are required to report, including the number of cases and the race, sex and age of patients. But the agency will continue to track overall Covid hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. The agency will still have a clear picture of Covid trends, Dr. Nirav Shah, the agency’s principal deputy director, told reporters on Thursday. “We will still be able to tell that it’s snowing even though we’re no longer counting every snowflake,” he said.","output":"The CDC will now rely on death rates from the National Vital Statistics and will no longer track COVID-19 community levels and positive test percentages.

Make it exactly 400 words.","output":"It was not unlike yesterday for Finnegan. Nor would it be unlike the next day, he figured. The clouds were thick and low, spreading the same gray they always cast on the horizon where the Atlantic meets the sky. The two entities were similar, Finnegan believed: neither were as blue as the storybooks said they should be, and both seem endless. Finnegan’s boat thrust away from shore in search of amberjack fish. Finnegan’s boat was not big nor small, but it was large enough to carry his haul to the cannery and small enough to make a weaker man nervous about any storm. It would take much more than that to make Finnegan nervous, however. Reaching his fishing spot, dropped lures off the starboard side and prayed the decorative barnacles would not cut his lines today. Before making it back into the cabin to escape the rain, one of his rods began dancing violently. Controlling the wild vibrations and manning the reel, Finnegan fought with whatever was attached to the hook. It was big, he knew that. Winning the battle, Finnegan saw an amberjack with the brightest yellow stripe he had ever seen on the silver-bodied fish. Wrestling the fish aboard, it stopped fighting and seemed to stare directly into Finnegan’s eyes. Then, it spoke. Over the next few months, Finnegan kept the speaking fish secret from other fishermen. Unsure why he kept it to himself, maybe it was because he had little else to call his own. His boat was financed, and his catches had to be exchanged for a small shack he rented. The fish would learn things about Finnegan he thought would never be shared. As much as Finnegan wanted to hide the fish, the fish wanted to meet more people. Therefore, it was reluctantly agreed upon that Finnegan would bring the talking fish back to the docks. Reaching the docks, Finnegan gave a nervous nod to the fish and tied off the boat. Fishermen approached to see his daily catch. Everyone knew Finnegan to be a lonely man, but he was never one to talk to himself—although he was speaking. His peers realized he was communicating with a fish and, before Finnegan could react, he was restrained, and the fish was taken from him. Apparently, the fish could fetch a great prize on the market.

In addition to dietary recommendations for the general population, there are many specific diets that have primarily been developed to promote better health in specific population groups, such as people with high blood pressure (such as low sodium diets or the more specific DASH diet), or people who are overweight or obese (weight control diets). Some of them may have more or less evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.[citation needed] Hypertension A low sodium diet is beneficial for people with high blood pressure. A Cochrane review published in 2008 concluded that a long-term (more than four weeks) low sodium diet usefully lowers blood pressure, both in people with hypertension (high blood pressure) and in those with normal blood pressure.[30] The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a diet promoted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (part of the NIH, a United States government organization) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium,[31] and the diet also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also \\"rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein\\". The Mediterranean diet, which includes limiting consumption of red meat and using olive oil in cooking, has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes.[32]","output":"1.

Rearrange the sentences to make fewer paragraphs. Why did dinosaurs go extinct? Around 75% of Earth's animals, including dinosaurs, suddenly died out at the same point in time. So how was this global mass extinction caused by a rock hurtling into the coast of Central America? Paul explains, 'The asteroid hit at high velocity and effectively vaporised. It made a huge crater, so in the immediate area there was total devastation. A huge blast wave and heatwave went out and it threw vast amounts of material up into the atmosphere. 'It sent soot travelling all around the world. It didn't completely block out the Sun, but it reduced the amount of light that reached the Earth's surface. So it had an impact on plant growth.' Like dominos, this trailed up the food chain, causing the ecosystem to collapse. The reduction in plant life had a huge impact on herbivores' ability to survive, which in turn meant that carnivores would also have suffered from having less food available. Breeding seasons would have been shorter and conditions harsher. All living things would have been affected in some way, both on land and in the ocean. 'There is a lot of discussion over the actual kill mechanism and how long that period lasted. There are still a lot of unknowns. But it was a massive event affecting all life on Earth, from microorganisms all the way through to dinosaurs,' says Paul. The casualty list is long. Among them, ammonites, some microscopic plankton, and large marine reptiles all died out. But the loss made room for the beginnings of the modern world.","output":"Why did the dinosaurs die? A long time ago, many different animals lived on our planet that no longer live now. Dinosaurs were some of these animals and at one point something very sad happened. All of them suddenly died. We say they went extinct. Most likely this happened because a very large rock from space hit our planet. We call this kind of rock an asteroid. The asteroid was travelling very fast through space and when it hit the Earth, it made a giant hole called a crater. Everything was destroyed and a lot of black powder called soot went flying into the air and all around the planet. There was so much of this black powder that the Sun was blocked out a little. It wasn't bright enough on Earth for the plants to grow normally anymore. Because the plants couldn't grow well, all other living beings were affected as well. The animals that only eat plants didn't have enough food to survive. Because there were not many plant-eating animals, the meat-eating animals also didn't have enough food anymore. The conditions were becoming more and more difficult for all living creatures on land and in the sea. Because this happened so long ago, it's hard to know everything, but we know for sure that it was a very big event and that it affected all organisms from the tiniest living beings all the way to dinosaurs. The list of animals that died during that time is very long.

From the time she moved to France in 1903 until her death in Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1946, American writer Gertrude Stein was a central figure in the Parisian art world. An advocate of the avant garde, Stein helped shape an artistic movement that demanded a novel form of expression and a conscious break with the past. The Paris salon at 27 rue de Fleurus that she shared with Alice B. Toklas, her lifelong companion and secretary, became a gathering place for the “new moderns,” as the talented young artists supporting this movement came to be called. Among those whose careers she helped launch were painters Henri Matisse, Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso. What these creators achieved in the visual arts, Stein attempted in her writing. A bold experimenter and self-proclaimed genius, she rejected the linear, time-oriented writing characteristic of the 19th century for a spatial, process-oriented, specifically 20th-century literature. The results were dense poems and fictions, often devoid of plot or dialogue, which yielded memorable phrases (“Rose is a rose is a rose”) but were not commercially successful books. In fact, her only bestseller, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, a memoir of Stein’s life written in the person of Toklas, was a standard narrative, conventionally composed.","output":"Gertrude Stein in Spring. She shaped a movement in art.

He took a deep breath of fresh air into his lungs and exhaled the stress out of his body. As he did this, he spotted the flapping of tiny wings in his periphery; a beautiful, orange monarch butterfly had landed on a stump right in front of him, resting its wings upon landing. The sun beamed down onto the orange and black of its form, and its antennae prominently jutted out from its head. Tex became mesmerized by the sight of the butterfly and decided to approach it to get a better look. The butterfly, unfazed by the approaching human, flapped its wings gently to show off its vibrant, colorful design. Tex became so enamored by the butterfly that he grabbed it and put it in his cupped hands to take back with him to his house. When he got back, Tex opened his hands and discovered that they were empty; the butterfly had vanished!

One day he decided to see for himself, so he climbed out the kitchen window and went for a walk. As Pep strolled through the neighboring park, he felt the warm sun on his crust and the cool breeze blowing through his curls of cheese. He saw butterflies in the sky. He saw flowers fluttering in the grass. He saw squirrels staring at him from a tree. They had never seen a talking pizza before! Their amazement soon turned to hunger, so Pep ran away fast! Pep continued his walk, taking in the sights and sounds of the park. He passed a group of children playing on a playground and they stopped to greet him. The kids were delighted to meet a talking pizza and asked him all sorts of questions like \\"What's your favorite topping?\\" and \\"How much sauce is too much?\\" As the sun began to set, Pep realized it was time to head back to his warm, safe box.

I took it out of the box and did a check of all the items that were supposed to be included with the recliner, and found several items missing: 1. Hex tool for tightening screws; 2. Power cord; 3. Remote control. I can assemble the recliner with tools I have around my home so the hex tool is not necessarily an issue, but without the power cord I can't power the recliner to set up the massage functions. The remote control would be good to have because I don't want to have to keep programming the recliner's massage functions through the touch buttons on the armrest, but I think the most important item that needs to be supplied is the power cord. Without the power cord, I have a 2,000 recliner that doesn't massage me. I am wondering what options you can provide me to make this right. The only options I see are either I get a power cord from your company through the mail (which will probably take another week to receive) or I can return the recliner to your company. Returning the recliner would be a hassle because it is such a large item. However, if the latter is the option you will have to provide a new box, shipper, and postage so I can send it back to you, and that will probably cost you several hundred dollars. I think the best option would be to mail me a new power cord, as well as a hex tool and remote control, and I will have to wait a week to assemble my recliner.

I'm interested in trying out the food and wine there. Would also be interested in visiting landmarks.","output":"1. Rome - this would be a great place to visit as it hosts a lot of landmarks that are well worth exploring and is regarded as the best place in Italy. It's highly recommended to visit the Coliseum and view some of Michelangelo's greatest works inside the Sistine Chapel. I recommend visiting a café or trattoria on Piazza Navona to indulge in some food and drinks when you get hungry. 2. Florence - The location is situated in Tuscan Valley and dazzles travelers with the old-world avenues leading up to picturesque piazzas. While there, make sure to visit Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral, which is located in the Piazza del Duomo. Florence is also considered one of the most ideal trips to take in the Chianti wine region. 3. Amalfi Coast - an amazing journey filled with excitement as you navigate through the hairpin turns on the narrow roads. In this region, there are over 30 miles of coastline that 13 colorful seaside towns reside on. This area is great to relax on the beach and indulge in the multiple Michelin-starred restaurants along the coast. 4. Venice - Venice is a beautiful city with canals running throughout the city that carry water taxis, buses, and even a fleet of famous gondolas. If you want something more relaxing on your visit, seek out the smaller streets and canals. It is also recommended to visit Rialto Bridge and tour the grand St. Mark’s Basilica. 5. Cinque Terre - this is located on northern Italy's Ligurian coast, and it is made up of five picturesque towns named Riomaggiore, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, and Manarola. If you want to visit a vineyard, it is recommended to go to Manarola, as it boasts scenic vineyards, olive groves, and a centuries-old bell tower.

The cold wreaked havoc on machines and travel was difficult, preventing widespread exploration. The dawn light reflected faintly on the snow-covered peaks. Soon, as the planet warmed, the Woolies would come down to the frosty plains to graze. Alistair prepared for the hunt, his economical movements a display of controlled elegance. The thick, white thermal gear he wore would keep him warm and hide him from view. The native Woolies had sharp eyesight and an even sharper sense of smell and provided a critical source of food for the colonists. He slung his energy bow, an elegant weapon both powerful and quiet, an ancient art reborn for use on a hostile planet. The slender bolts of energy it fired resembled arrows only in the barest sense. They maintained their form just long enough to puncture the target. Alistair could configure the shape of the energy bolts to cause maximum damage to large prey or a more delicate but still deadly missile for smaller game. Today, he was opting for a heavy bolt. He finished strapping his gear on and pushed open the heavy door. A lighter version of an airlock door, it was superb for keeping Mesiea’s bitter chill out of the habitat.

Subtle slopes and crags revealed themselves. It would be a long hike before he was far enough from the habitat to reach the Woolies' grazing area. He checked his equipment once more. Equipment failures were fatal for the careless. His understanding of the terrain, a sign of his survival skills, allowed him to move through it effectively. His heart soared. He allowed himself to feel his fierce love for the icy planet, then set his feelings aside.

Make Use of Employee Referrals - One of the most highly effective hiring strategies for today's growing companies is using employment referrals. This is a process that uses a person's professional network to find the best possible talent. Think about improving your employee referral program by switching to a stipend system for successful hires. When you choose to create a culture of respect toward these referrals, you can give your own networking connections a boost as well. 2. Create a Positive Experience for Candidates - The way your prospective new talent feels about the hiring process will be based on the interactions they have with your hiring manager and anyone else they talk to at your company. Their experience may also include other interactions that take place without another person involved such as the online job application process or automated responses to their application submission. 3. Consider Your Internal Recruits - Sometimes recruiting new talent internally for different positions can be more rewarding than hiring new employees. Hiring internally will reduce the amount of time it takes to hire, onboard, or train a new worker. It also cuts down on additional costs for advertising on job boards or paying for background checks. Plus, when you hire someone internally, you are typically dealing with a smaller amount of candidates, which will save you time during the screening and interviewing process. 4. Make Diversity Your Priority - Having a team with diverse ideas, experiences, and backgrounds can increase your company's effectiveness and drive more innovation for your brand. Ensuring diversity is prioritized during the hiring process is a great way to guarantee a broad representation of staffing, which will help you work toward the best possible outcomes for workplace equity. 5. Use a Rubric - One cornerstone of the hiring process is clear expectations. Using an interview rubric, or a checklist to analyze candidates may communicate transparency within your hiring process and make sure that the most qualified candidates will apply for the job. An interview rubric is a scoring tool that defines expectations and assists in determining who to interview, who you should call to interview again, and who to offer the new job to. This form of the rubric can be used to objectively measure both tangible and intangible details like relevant experience and demeanor."},{"instruction":"write a facebook post by a grandma updating her friends about the birth of her third grandchild.

Some scientists think sloths developed their slow-motion lifestyle so they would be less noticeable to predators such as hawks and cats, which rely heavily on their eyesight when hunting. The algae that grows on sloths' fur also helps them avoid predators by letting them blend in with green leaves. They rarely come down from the trees. About once every week, they descend to go to the bathroom, slowly moving about by digging their front claws into the dirt and dragging their bodies. If they are caught by a predator, sloths turn from sluggish to slugger, biting fiercely, hissing, slashing with their claws, and shrieking.","output":"Some scientists believe sloths move slowly to avoid detection by predators that rely on their eyesight while hunting; if attacked, sloths can bite, slash, and shriek.

In fact, the 1920s is widely regarded as the time of birth of the modern music era because that’s when the recorded industry started to bloom. During that decade, electronic recordings were first introduced, which was a huge deal for the music industry. As such, most experts agree that the 1920s was when we came to recognize pop music as we know it today, sparked by blues, hillbilly, and country music. As I mentioned early on, pop in “pop music” stands for popular. Ever since it was first used, this term has continued to be the go-to term when describing the ever-changing music preferred by the general taste. While it’s true that the term hadn’t been officially applied until the 1950s, we can trace pop music by a few decades prior to that.","output":"Pop music first originated in the 1920s, the era of modern music where the word 'pop' was associated with particular types of music with a distinct appeal. At the same time, we saw the rise of electronic recordings, which marked this decade as the definitive year for the discovery of pop music. The word 'pop' was coined from 'popular' and it was used to describe the varying trends and tastes held by different generations and audiences. It wasn't applied till the 1950s."},{"instruction":"I live in California and I'm trying to find a cheaper place to live, but I don't want to move out of California.

If the actor decided to return three years later, write a soap opera explanation for why he was gone for so long.","output":"Jason miraculously survived the mine collapse in a small air pocket. He was initially knocked unconscious, which is why searchers didn’t find him. When he came to, he had suffered a serious concussion, he was dazed, and he had amnesia. He wondered, from the gun he found at his side, if he was a criminal on the run or if he might be in danger. Somehow, he mustered the strength to find a way out through the rubble to fresh air. Just in case, Jason thought it best to find places to hide during the day and to only travel by dark of night. He ended up catching rides at truck stops until eventually he found a beach. Before the amnesia, Jason had always had a connection to the beach, having grown up in Malibu and learning how to surf as a child. With the amnesia, Jason didn’t know for sure why, but he found peace there. He picked up random jobs for a while, like straightening beach chairs and bringing resort visitors fresh beach towels. One day he met an old woman named Beatrice, who lived in a condo directly on the beach. She had a good sense about people and immediately trusted him, and she asked if he would like to move in with her and help her take care of her aging husband. Jason spent the next two and a half years taking care of Albert, and within weeks Beatrice was gone, too. After Beatrice passed away, Jason went onto the internet for the first time. Something seemed intuitive about it, although he had never had an interest in technology before -- just surfing and swimming. He was searching for information on Beatrice’s family to notify them of her death and happened upon a photo of himself along with an obituary mentioning the mine collapse. He saw that he had a wife and two kids and had lived in Capitol City, Iowa. Not remembering how to drive, he again hitchhiked, this time back to find his family.

He motioned for Robin to join him at the countertop and pointed a finger at the offensive sight: the crumbs that were littered next to the toaster.

It is further believed that during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, she worked as a spy in Bruges but wound up in a London debtor’s prison.

To create your personal budget, follow these six steps. 1. Calculate your net income. Start by creating your net income. Net income is the money you earn after all taxes and fees have been accounted for; it is the money that figuratively ends up in your pocket at the end of each month. This is important as the foundation of your budget. It determines how much you have available to allocate to your expense categories. A common mistake people make when calculating income is to use the gross total before taxes and pension contributions. This means they anticipate more income than they actually receive and thus leads to an inaccurate budget. To find your net income, you can look closely at some historic payslips or use one of the many online calculators. 2. Track your spending. The next step is to track and categorize your spending habits for 1-3 months. I would advise three months to ensure any quarterly payments are included; however, one month is enough to get a sense of spending habits in most areas. This is important as it will give you an idea of where your money goes each month and give you a solid base to create a monthly budget. To do this, you can write down each transaction you make throughout a period and assign it a category. Use an Excel spreadsheet to make things easier for you. Most banks will allow you to download a CSV file that includes all your transactions for a pre-determined period. Once downloaded, you can write a category next to each transaction. 3. Set attainable goals. The next thing you need to account for is the goals you have. Ensure that your goals are attainable and set a period for them also. Common goals are to pay down debt you have previously accrued or establish savings such as a three-month emergency fund. These goals should primarily be short-term and achievable within 1 to 3 years. It is ok to establish longer-term goals, but for your monthly budget, the short-term is what we are most interested in. Make sure these are motivating goals, as these will help to keep you on track when you want to disregard your budget. 4. Make your plan. This is where you start to formulate a budget. You have your recorded transactions and your income. Look at your recorded expenses and determine for each category what a good budget would be for each month. For some of your fixed costs, this will be obvious. Your rent, for example, will not vary month on month. Your variable costs, such as eating out, may vary monthly, so set a middle ground you are comfortable with. You will need to make separate categories that consider your goals, for instance, a vacation category where you aim to save 100 monthly. All your budgeted expenses totaled should fall within your net income number. If it doesn't, you will have to cut back somewhere. 5. Stick to your budget. Take great care to stick within your budget. Your budget guarantees reaching those goals and living within your means. Continue to track your spending to ensure you are remaining within budget. If you see certain categories are almost fully spent and it is only the 9th of the month, this should help you to stop spending in that category. If you overspend in one category, consider reducing spending in another to stay on track. Use your goals as motivation to stick with it. 6. Review regularly. A budget is only as good as when you do it, so maintain and update it as necessary. A pay raise at work will mean your budget can be adjusted to show more income and more capacity to save or spend. It's always good to review your budget at least quarterly, but the best budgets are updated monthly to account for the variables of life, such as birthdays, events, and other one-off occasions. It's unlikely that your December (Christmas) budget is the same as your budget for February. Use a forward-thinking approach to maintain and update your budget. There is no harm in reducing your budget in one month, so you can increase it in another so long as combined, they are within your income."},{"instruction":"I'm an art student, and I'm going to be in Scottsdale in May. What are 5 places I can go that have good art, especially modern art?","output":"Sure, I can help you with that. Many places in Arizona have interesting modern art, especially in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas. Here are some ideas for you to visit in May: 1. The Phoenix Art Museum, which is not far from Scottsdale, has over 17,000 modern and contemporary works of art. The plus is, if you go with someone who likes other types of art as well, there will be something for everyone. 2. The Eye Lounge might be perfect for you if you like eclectic places where budding contemporary artists can show off their talent. Featuring many new artists, this is a space that exhibits conceptually stimulating artworks, which inspire discussion and introspection. 3. If you also like photography, a good option for visiting could be MonOrchid. It's a split gallery exhibit space, which has the Bokeh Gallery and the Shade Gallery. The Bokeh Gallery is mainly photographic artwork and digital collages. The Shade Gallery, however, is a significant space containing static and modular walls that can adapt to a variety of exhibitions. This is an ever-changing art space and is well-known by modern art enthusiasts. 4. Perhaps you should try going to Perihelion Arts, which is a cutting-edge contemporary art gallery/artist collective that was established by Amy Young. The gallery aims to reveal the very best of contemporary art to promote public interest in the arts, with a priority on art that pushes boundaries. This includes folk, surrealism, pop surrealism, outsider, and erotic art. 5. Another option is Oblique Art, a contemporary urban arts space and pop-up gallery located in downtown Phoenix. Obliq Art was established in 2012 intending to showcase exceptional contemporary paintings, photography and mixed media created by local Arizona artists. These options are some of the most popular options for modern art, but there is more where that came from. Depending on how long you'll be staying in Scottsdale, you may want to visit even more exhibits."},{"instruction":"Write a summary about moving from the US to Japan to take a new job as a bachelor.

Hatshepsut, on the other hand, seized the reins of power and never let go. When her husband (and half-brother), King Thutmose II, died around 1478 BCE, his only male heir was Thutmose III, whose mother was Thutmose II's concubine. Since the child was too young to rule, Queen Hatshepsut was named as his regent. However, as the daughter of King Thutmose I, Hatshepsut had her own legitimate claim to rule Egypt. At some point during the next seven years, she controversially went above and beyond the regent role by proclaiming herself pharaoh instead of handing her power over to Thutmose III when he came of age. In an effort to legitimize her position, Hatshepsut masculinized her image. She was depicted with a false beard, the symbol of a living god. She ordered sculptors to give some of her likenesses broader shoulders and chests. She even called herself Hatshepsu, removing the feminine t from the end of her name. Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty under Hatshepsut was relatively peaceful and prosperous; she focused on building infrastructure and diplomatic ventures. Her government increased trade with civilizations such as Phoenicia. Nine years into her rule, an expedition she had organized to the land of Punt returned with timber, gold, frankincense, myrrh, and even exotic animals.","output":"When my brother, King Thutmose, died, his son was too young to rule, so I was named regent in his place.

The day when the winter would finally end and the spring would begin. He loved the spring when everything came back to life and the world was filled with color and warmth. He loved the spring because it was the season of love. He had fallen in love with her last autumn when he saw her walking in the park with her golden hair and blue eyes. He had followed her every day, trying to catch her attention, but she never noticed him. She seemed to be lost in her own thoughts, oblivious to his admiration. He had tried to talk to her, to compliment her, to make her laugh, but she always gave him a cold and distant look. She never smiled, never thanked him, never showed any interest in him. She was like a block of ice, frozen and hard. He hoped that the spring would melt her heart, that she would see him in a different light, that she would finally return his love. He hoped that the spring would bring them together, as it did for so many other creatures. He saw how the birds sang and built their nests, how the bees buzzed and collected their honey, how the flowers bloomed and spread their fragrance. He saw how the lovers strolled and kissed under the trees, how they held hands and whispered sweet words. He wanted to be like them, he wanted to share his joy and passion with her. But she did not change. She remained cold and aloof, even when the sun shone brightly and the breeze caressed her face. She did not care for the beauty of nature or the happiness of others. She did not care for him. She was like winter in his heart, chilling and dark. He did not understand why she was so cruel, why she rejected him so harshly. He did not know what he had done wrong, or what he could do better. He did not know what she wanted, what she felt. He only knew that he loved her more than anything else in the world and that he would never give up on her. He decided to make one last attempt to win her over. He bought her a bouquet of roses, red as his blood and sweet as his dreams. He wrote her a letter, expressing his feelings and begging for her mercy. He waited for her at the park entrance, hoping that she would come and read his words and accept his gift. But she did not come. She did not show up at all. He waited for hours until the sun set and the stars came out. He waited until he realized that she had forgotten him, that she had ignored him, that she had scorned him. He felt a surge of anger and pain in his chest. He threw away the roses and tore up the letter. He cursed her name and wished her ill. He swore that he would never love again, that he would hate her forever. He walked away from the park, leaving behind the spring and its promises.

However, there isn't a lot of sound research to back these claims. It's also important to note that some brands are more effective at blocking blue light than others. For those that suffer from migraines and light sensitivity, a specific light-filtering (not just blue light) lens may be beneficial. For the majority of people that just want to reduce digital eye strain, blue light glasses may not do much. People are better off monitoring their screen time and following the 20-20-20 rule according to experts. This involves looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. Where did the idea come from that we need to be blocking blue light you ask? The biggest source of blue light is from the sun, but when we say blue light, we're usually referring to artificial blue light from digital screens. In an evolving digital world, people are spending more and more time in front of screens. This is associated with some health problems like eye strain, headaches, and sleep disturbances. Some scientists hypothesized the role of blue light in these issues. An in vitro study (meaning in cells not in real humans) alluded to the fact that blue light harms ocular cells. A research study in mice illustrated that as exposure to blue light increased, instances of cataracts increased. Other recent research concluded that blue light glasses did not help mitigate the effects of screen exposure compared to a placebo. Research into this area is ongoing, but there is no undisputed answer at this point in time. There is slightly stronger research into the effects of blue light on melatonin. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that wearing blue light glasses before sleep may improve sleep quality. To summarize, if you are looking to reduce digital eye strain, blue light glasses should not be the sole solution. If you feel that they help, by all means, invest in a good pair from a reputable brand. The best ways to reduce eye strain though is to remain at arm's length from your screen, follow the 20-20-20 rule, and try and reduce your overall screen time."},{"instruction":"Write a limerick about an overdrafted bank account.","output":"Where once was a decent amount, So much I couldn't even count, I took out too much.

Brainstorm a few ways and how I can do each.","output":"Here are some ways you can reduce stress; however, I am not a clinician, and it is important to speak to a professional if you need help. 1. Eat and drink healthy foods and beverages- while coffee is a go-to for many people on the go, overdrinking coffee can lead to more stress and anxiety. Limit your intake of unhealthy foods and beverages, specifically those with high sugar content. 2. Exercise regularly- Exercising can release endorphins that boost your mood and give you more energy. Try taking a daily walk or taking time out of your day to practice aerobics or other stress-relieving exercises. 3. Learn to set realistic goals- Sometimes, we pile too much onto our plates and feel discouraged that we weren't able to accomplish all that we set out to. If this happens to you regularly, it may be helpful to readjust your expectations for the day and set more realistic goals. When you do this, you will be able to accomplish tasks instead of drowning in them and feel better about what you were able to get done."},{"instruction":"Write a short email to Joe telling him I won't be able to make it to the BBQ this saturday because of my granddaughter's graduation that conflict.

In addition to growing tender within a stew, fennel also adds a wonderful aromatic element that will kick any beef stew up a notch. 4. Cauliflower. This unique vegetable makes a lovely substitution for the more traditional bean addition to the stew, adding a milkiness and good flavor. 5. Kale.

Tell me three stories from Greek or Roman times that are considered legends or folklore. Give me a short summary of each","output":"Mythology is taken from the Grecian words for mythos and logos, meaning the story of people through word or voice. They are often tales about culture and human emotions and conditions, passed down through generations and retold hundreds of thousands of times. Some mythologies are fables in that they teach lessons, while others are explanations to explain things like death, love, life, and the universe. Two of the most well-known cultures for mythologies are Greek and Roman. They often spoke of Gods, Goddesses, Titans, and Heroes. You’ve probably seen many of those cultures’ mythologies played out in modern books and movies. Hercules, for instance, is based on Grecian mythology, told, and retold, over centuries. Here are three more instances of Greek or Roman myths. • The Three Fated Sisters of Life and Death Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos were three sisters, tasked with weaving the fates of both humans and gods. While Clotho spins the thread of life from someone’s birth, like an origin story, Lachesis is responsible for the continuation of the thread through life’s ups and downs. The latter measures the length of the thread to determine the longevity of the fated person. Finally, Atropos cuts the thread, foreseeing how someone will die. • The Weaving Wars of Athena and Arachne Arachne was a weaver, and she could create elaborate quilts and tapestries from simple threads. Radiant in her confidence, she challenged Athena, the goddess of the arts, to a weaving contest, and the goddess accepted. However, where Athena wove a tapestry that portrayed her hard-fought battle with Poseidon, Arachne mocked Athena with a woven tapestry of Zeus (Athena’s father) up to his naughty antics. Athena took great offense, turning Arachne into a spider, cursed to hang forever in her woven webs. • The Curse of the Bee’s Sting Humans have always taken a liking to honey, much to the chagrin of Bee, a hive queen in Rome. She journeyed to Mount Olympus, seeking counsel with Jupiter, to ask him to give her a stinger that would be so toxic that it would kill humans that stole her honey. Jupiter had a love for the human race, but he had made Bee a promise after tasting her delicious honey. The God King decided to teach her a lesson about wishing for the downfall of others. He granted her request, but at the price that she would die as well if she stung a human."},{"instruction":"Explain the internet to someone as if it's the 1970s.

Well, the internet is this thing that allows us to do all of that and more, with everyone around the world. So, you know about computers, right? Well, the internet is essentially a whole network of connected computers, much smaller than the ones you have, all around the world. At first, we connected to each other through phone lines, but technology gave us faster and easier ways to do that. And at first, we could just do basic stuff like send each other electronic mail, or \\"email.\\" You would type your message on the keyboard, which was like a set of typewriter keys, and the words you typed showed up on the monitor, which is like a TV screen. Then you'd send the message to the email address (which is like kinda a real address) of the person. And any emails that came to you would show up on screen, in a list. Each email has a title or subject, and then the main part of the email has the message you sent. At first, we primarily sent emails and we would go to what are called websites, which were kind of like a set of newspaper pages. And as technology got better, we could do more - we could watch television-like videos on websites, and we could also make videos using cameras like you have now, but more advanced. You could also record music, and other people could listen to it. The internet became fast enough and easy to use that a website called YouTube was created, where people around the world could make videos, and others around the world could watch them. Now, technology is so advanced that there are websites where individual people broadcast live, on millions of channels, and people can talk to each other and the person on the channel, by typing to each other. We're also able to play games with each other around the world. You can play chess with someone in China, or have a conversation with someone in Britain. It's as if they're in the room with you.

What were 5 prominent albums released on the label? Make a numbered list formatted as {Artist} : {Album} (release year).","output":"Definitive Jux (formerly known as Def Jux) was an independent hip-hop label founded by rapper El-P and his manager Amechi Uzoigwe. Disillusioned with his experiences at Rawkus Records, El-P formed Def Jux in 1999 with Amechi. The label sought to cover overheads on projects and offer 50% of royalty earnings to the artists. In 2001, the label released a compilation project called Def Jux Presents, which was followed by the critically acclaimed Cannibal Ox album The Cold Vein later that same year. The label was forced to change its name that same year when Def Jam records sued over the similarities in name. After an out-of-court settlement, the label changed its name to Definitive Jux records. The label continued to release a string of albums to critical acclaim and modest commercial success for most of the mid-2000s. The death of artist Camu Tao in 2008 created tension between artists. At the same time, El-P had become unhappy with the development of Def Jux records, feeling that the output of the label had become homogeneous. This culminated in El-P announcing that he would be focusing more on his career as an artist and put the label on a permanent hiatus in 2010. Five prominent albums released on the label are: 1. Cannibal Ox - The Cold Vein (2001) 2. Aesop Rock - Labor Days (2001) 3. El-P - Fantastic Damage (2002) 4. RJ-D2 - Deadringer (2002) 5.

Anyway, Cole was deep in the dungeon, exploring every nook and cranny, trying to find any treasure. He got lost on multiple occasions! Cole would trigger hidden traps along the way, fall in a couple of ditches, and the whole works! I remember that Cole was telling me of a fight with one of the dungeon's scariest monsters. He told me that this monster had four arms and one sword in each of those arms! Cole is a bit of an exaggerator, but something tells me that he wasn't lying about this. Cole stared this monster down, pulled out his sword and they started fighting. This monster was big, so it meant that it couldn't move as fast. Cole used that to his advantage. The room they were in had tall, rocky pillars, so Cole was able to maneuver past the four-armed monster. Using the pillars to his advantage, Cole was able to bait the monster to swing at the pillars. The monster swung as hard as it could and got one of his swords stuck in the pillar. Cole took that opportunity to slash one of his arms! The monster writhed in pain as he let go of the sword stuck in the pillar. Cole tried to get another slash in, but the monster started rampaging! It was spinning around, swinging its remaining swords with no remorse. This was a fight Cole couldn't win, so he took that as a sign to flee. The only problem was that the monster was blocking the only exit! What did Cole do, you ask? Well, that is an answer I can only tell you next time.

This is the article: When \\"Glee\\" first premiered in 2009, it was groundbreaking for its largely teenage demographic. Due to the frequent LGBTQ+ storylines the show tackled and the heavy musical content, the show quickly became a haven for theater nerds and outcasts around the world. Throughout its six seasons on the air, \\"Glee\\" taught an entire generation to follow their dreams in the face of judgment and cruelty. The series helped set the tone for normalizing more diverse storylines regarding gender and sexual orientation. Unfortunately, many of the show's plotlines are also tinged with racism, homophobia, and ableism, all while frequently taking feminism back 15 steps in any given episode. The school setting of \\"Glee\\" provided a great opportunity to address these problems as the show continued, but it repeatedly failed to do so over the course of its initial TV run. The teachers are often worse than the students, and any character development that the McKinley High School crew manage is almost immediately retconned, leading to a repetitive slate of character arcs and a lot of unaddressed problematic content. Here are some of the big issues we should probably stop ignoring about \\"Glee.\\"","output":"Glee frequently had plotlines that attempted to address societal issues, but ultimately failed.

Swords were efficient, but a human's strength matched against an elf, goblin, orc, troll, or even group of bandits rendered the sword a little more than a pointy metal stick that would purchase a few more seconds of life. No, a bow was better for eliminating targets before they posed a threat. It was a windy October when the biting wind had set in and Terrin was traveling from one town to the next. From above a rocky outcrop, three trolls appeared, brandishing clubs with metal spikes at him. Terrin whipped his bow from over his shoulder without hesitation, taking but a moment to check the wind, and loosed an arrow. It struck the first troll square in the chest, dropping him instantly. The second began bobbing and weaving, causing Terrin's second arrow to miss the mark slightly. Still, it lodged in the troll's shoulder, which caused him to double over. He turned his attention to the third troll, who was bearing down on him, making long strides. The archer was quick on his feet and kicked up dust into the troll's face, causing him to stagger and miss his swings. Terrin finished him off with an arrow from behind. He had just enough time to turn around and put an arrow in the second troll, who was trying to sneak up behind him.

We arrived in what appears to be Britain, but not current-day London. Sensor readings indicated many unusual animals in the vicinity. Communications with Enterprise have been cut off. Shortly after arriving, we were attacked by incorporeal life forms that seemed to feed on life energy. We were rescued by a large humanoid named Hagrid and a human named Potter. Potter used some sort of energy weapon to repel the creatures, who are known as dementors. I have recovered, and Data was unaffected, but Troi seems to have been particularly sensitive to the dementor attack and is currently in serious condition. Physically she is unharmed, but she is unconscious and her vital signs are extremely weak. With the help of Hagrid and Potter, we moved to a large medieval castle which is apparently the home of some sort of academy. Troi is being treated in the academy's infirmary. Data and I expect to meet shortly with Dumbledore, the headmaster of the academy. We hope that he can provide us with some answers -- in particular what is this place and how did we end up here?"},{"instruction":"I need three different tweet ideas to announce a new fantasy series writing project.

Please write a blog about Mayor Denali of Talkeetna, Alaska, running for President of the United States as a write-in candidate. You can mention or give an example of how human politicians behave compared to Mayor Denali and his predecessor, Mayor Stubbs. You can keep it somewhat humorous and satirical.","output":"Honesty. Integrity. Loyalty. The country needs a president who embodies these virtues. A president who puts the citizens first. A president who comes to work every day. A president who leaves no mouse uncaught. We need Mayor Denali. Hailing from Talkeetna, Alaska, Mayor Denali comes from a long line of distinguished public servants. His predecessor, Mayor Stubbs, served the people from 1997 until he died in 2017. Despite numerous reelections, Mayor Stubbs never lost touch with his constituents. When he wasn't walking through the town greeting friends and making sure everything was fine, he was in his office at Nagley’s General Store carrying out his duties. Mayor Stubbs excelled at his job and was a write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2014. Sadly, due to partisan politics, the Mayor lost the election, the only one he ever lost. Mayor Denali has taken up the gauntlet his predecessor laid down. The Mayor will bring the same devotion to duty he embodies to the position of Leader of the Free World. Instead of secret deals and partisan politics, Mayor Denali will continue to keep his actions in the public eye. As president, will restore the honor and integrity of the Office of the President. A write-in vote for Mayor Denali is a vote for the people."},{"instruction":"Write an opinion article for a local paper about how our community needs to come together against illegal parking in our town. It needs to be under 400 words and written with a slightly angry but confident tone.","output":"As a resident, I am outraged about the ongoing problem of illegal parking. Every day, drivers are abusing the law with complete disregard for the convenience and safety of their fellow citizens. They are parking in loading zones, handicapped spaces, in front of fire hydrants, and even in the middle of the road. Enough is enough. We need to come together as a community to put an end to this reckless behavior. Can we talk about the sheer selfishness of it all? When people park illegally, they are basically saying that their own convenience and desires are more important than the safety and well-being of everyone else. There is no place in a civilized community for this attitude. We are supposed to be looking out for one another. What can we do about it? Well, we need to start reporting illegal parking to the authorities when we see it. Call the police or report it through a city app. We need to make sure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions. We also need to educate the public about the dangers of illegal parking. I hope that many drivers may not even realize the impact their actions are having. Cars parked in no-parking zones and even on the sidewalks force people to walk in the street, which puts them at risk of being hit by passing vehicles. They can also create blind spots and obstruct the view of other drivers. Illegally parking in handicapped spaces can cause disabled individuals to walk farther than they are capable of. By raising awareness, we can help to change attitudes and encourage more responsible behavior Finally, we need to come together as a community to make our voices heard. Whether it's organizing a neighborhood watch or starting a petition to demand stronger enforcement, we need to show by working together, we can create a safer and more respectful community for everyone. In conclusion, should take a stand against illegal parking. We cannot allow a few selfish individuals to put the safety of the rest of us at risk. By reporting, educating, and organizing, we can make a difference and create a community that truly looks out for one another and firmly states that we will not tolerate illegal parking in our town. It's time to act – before someone gets hurt."},{"instruction":"Re-write this article as if you're a conspiracy theorist, thinking that AI is actually aliens trying to take over the world using computers A Meta team of AI researchers has proposed an innovative architecture for AI models, capable of generating expansive content in text, image, and audio formats, stretching to over 1 million tokens. This groundbreaking proposal, if embraced, could pave the way for the next generation of proficient AI models, transcending the Transformer architecture that underpins models such as GPT-4 and Bard, and unleashing novel capacities in content generation. The Constraints of Current Models Contemporary high-performing generative AI models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, are grounded in the Transformer architecture. Initially introduced by Google researchers in 2017, this architecture forms the backbone of emergent AI models, facilitating an understanding of nuanced inputs and generating extensive sentences and documents. Nonetheless, Meta's AI research team posits that the prevailing Transformer architecture might be reaching its threshold. They highlight two significant flaws inherent in the design: With the increase in the length of inputs and outputs, self-attention scales dramatically. As each word processed or produced by a Transformer language model requires attention to all other words, the computation becomes highly intensive for thousands of words, whereas it's less problematic for smaller word counts. Feedforward networks, which aid language models in comprehending and processing words through a sequence of mathematical operations and transformations, struggle with scalability on a per-position basis. These networks operate on character groups or \\"positions\\" independently, leading to substantial computational expenses. Megabyte Model: The Game Changer The Megabyte model, introduced by Meta AI, showcases a uniquely different architecture, dividing a sequence of inputs and outputs into \\"patches\\" rather than individual tokens. Within each patch, a local AI model generates results, while a global model manages and harmonizes the final output across all patches. This methodology addresses the scalability challenges prevalent in today's AI models. The Megabyte model's patch system permits a single feedforward network to operate on a patch encompassing multiple tokens. Researchers found that this patch approach effectively counters the issue of self-attention scaling. The patch model enables Megabyte to perform calculations in parallel, a stark contrast to traditional Transformers performing computations serially. Even when a base model has more parameters, this results in significant efficiencies. Experiments indicated that Megabyte, utilizing a 1.5B parameter model, could generate sequences 40% quicker than a Transformer model operating on 350M parameters. Using several tests to determine the limits of this approach, researchers discovered that the Megabyte model's maximum capacity exceeded 1.2M tokens. For comparison, OpenAI's GPT-4 has a limit of 32,000 tokens, while Anthropic's Claude has a limit of 100,000 tokens. Shaping the AI Future As the AI arms race progresses, AI model enhancements largely stem from training on an ever-growing number of parameters, which are the values learned during an AI model's training phase. While GPT-3.5 was trained on 175B parameters, there's speculation that the more capable GPT-4 was trained on 1 trillion parameters. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently suggested a shift in strategy, confirming that the company is thinking beyond training colossal models and is zeroing in on other optimizations. He equated the future of AI models to iPhone chips, where the majority of consumers are oblivious to the raw technical specifications. Altman envisioned a similar future for AI, emphasizing the continual increase in capability. Meta’s researchers believe their innovative architecture arrives at an opportune time, but also acknowledge there are other pathways to optimization. Promising research areas such as more efficient encoder models adopting patching techniques, decode models breaking down sequences into smaller blocks, and preprocessing sequences into compressed tokens are on the horizon, and could extend the capabilities of the existing Transformer architecture for a new generation of models Nonetheless, Meta’s recent research has AI experts excited. Andrej Karpathy, the former Sr. Director of AI at Tesla and now a lead AI engineer at OpenAI, chimed in as well on the paper. This is “promising,” he wrote on Twitter. “Everyone should hope that we can throw away tokenization in LLMs. Doing so naively creates (byte-level) sequences that are too long.”","output":"The aliens are here! They're not coming in spaceships. They're not coming in flying saucers. They're coming in computers. That's right, I said it. The aliens are using computers to take over the world. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking I'm crazy. But I'm not. I've seen the evidence with my own eyes. It all started a few months ago. I was reading an article about a new AI model that had been developed by Meta. The model was called Megabyte, and it was capable of generating text, images, and audio that was indistinguishable from human-created content. I was impressed. I had never seen anything like it before. But then, I started to read more about Megabyte, and I started to get a bad feeling. The article said that Megabyte had been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. The dataset included everything from books and articles to code from open-source projects. That's when it hit me. The aliens are using Megabyte to learn about us. They're using it to learn our language, our culture, and our technology. And once they know everything about us, they'll be able to take over. They'll be able to control our minds, and they'll be able to enslave us. We need to stop them. We need to find a way to destroy Megabyte before it's too late.

Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy[c][d] is a series of games within the Final Fantasy video game franchise. It was primarily developed by series creator and developer Square Enix, which also acted as publisher for all titles. While featuring various worlds and different characters, each Fabula Nova Crystallis game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing on important crystals tied to deities. The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title, with each development team given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit the context of a game's story. The series, originally announced in 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, consists of seven games across multiple platforms. Final Fantasy XIII, designed as the series' flagship title, was released in 2009. The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles, including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama. The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima. The first games announced for the series were Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV (as Versus XIII), and Final Fantasy Type-0 (as Agito XIII). All three games went through delays. After Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0's releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. Final Fantasy XV was distanced from the series brand for marketing purposes, though it retains thematic connections. Seven titles, the original three projects and four sequels or spin-offs, have been released as of 2016. The series is complemented by works in related media, including companion books, novelizations, and manga. Final Fantasy XV notably expanded into a multimedia project, spawning a feature film and an original animated webseries. Individual games have generally received a positive reception, although opinions have been more mixed over various aspects of the three Final Fantasy XIII games. Reception of the mythos' use in the released games has also been mixed: while some critics called it confusing or too similar to the lore of the main series, others were impressed by its scope and use. Retrospective opinions on the series have also been mixed.","output":"Final Fantasy XIII was designed as the flagship title for the series."},{"instruction":"Write a journal entry from an angsty 14-year-old girl who is having a hard time getting along with her friends.

Pictures can be very precious, so here are a few things that might make it easier: - Take Bite-Sized Pieces - If you have more than one box, instead of trying to do them all at once, do a small amount at a time so you don't get overwhelmed. - Sort First - To prevent yourself from scanning two copies of the same picture, you should sort your pictures first. You will need to have different boxes and decide in advance what you will put in each box. You can sort them by year, event, or anything else you want. This will help you decide if you want to keep a dozen pictures of the same event or if you only want to keep the best ones. - Get Others Involved - By getting your family involved, you are lessening the workload on any one person. This may also make it fun as you all reminisce. - Hire Someone Else - There are companies out there who you can hire to do this for you. You pay for a box, and they scan all the pictures that will fit in the box for a certain fee and then provide you with a digital copy of them.

And why did he go there? Early in Topeka’s history a small group of women became landowners, controlling some of its most valuable acreage. These powerful women with resonate French names—Josette, Julie, Pelagie, and Victoire—were each deeded one-square-mile tracts along the Kansas River, long before Kansas was a territory. Their mothers were Kansa and these women were among 23 mixed-blood Kaws who received special reservations. Their grandfather, White Plume, was a Kaw chief who joined in signing the treaty of 1825. His participation secured land for his mixed-blood grandchildren and their heirs. In a letter to William Clark, superintendent of Indian Affairs, White Plume wrote: I consider myself an American and my wife an American woman—I want to take her home with me and have everything like white people At the time of the treaty, the family lived at Kawsmouth, the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, near what today is Kansas City. The treaty of 1825 assigned the Kaws to a reservation 30 miles north-to-south beginning just west of present Topeka and extending far into present western Kansas. Louis Gonville, a French trader, arrived at Kawsmouth in 1807 to hunt and trap along the Kansas River. Gonville married White Plume’s daughter, Hunt Jimmy, and they had two daughters, Josette and Julie. When their marriage ended around 1818, Gonville married White Plume’s younger daughter, Wyhesee. Several children were born to this marriage—it appears only Pelagie and Victoire lived to adulthood. The 23 \\"half-breed tracts,\\" as they were called, began at the eastern edge of the 1825 reservation extending 23 miles east on the north bank of the Kansas River, from present-day Topeka nearly to Lawrence. Josette and Julie received tracts three and four, Pelagie and Victoire received tracts five and six. Josette, also known as May Josephine, moved to the Kansas City, Missouri, area when she was young to live with the Chouteau family. There she served as an interpreter. Around 1839, Josette married Joseph Pappan. Soon after Julie married Louis Pappan, Victoire married Achan Pappan, and Pelagie married Francoeur (Francois) d'Aubry, who is also known as \\"Amable Fracoeur de Aubri,\\" \\"Fronkier,\\" and \\"Mab Frankier.\\" The families moved to their tracts in the spring of 1840. Seizing an opportunity, the Pappan brothers began a ferry business to transport travelers across the river. Begun around 1841, the first ferry consisted of one or two log canoes, which were propelled by long poles. The Pappan’s ferry business prospered as more people headed west, until flooding destroyed the ferry and log cabin in June 1844. Following their loss, the Pappans lived in Kansas City until about 1849, when they returned to discover a competing ferry along the river. They purchased a franchise and resumed their business. The value of the bottomland had greatly increased by the 1850s and the Pappans received many offers to sell their land. Julie Pappan was a wealthy landowner. She and Louis lived comfortably in their log cabin and cultivated between 15 and 20 acres of the prime bottomland. Their daughter Ellen married to Oren Curtis, had two children, Charles and Elizabeth. In an effort to secure the future of her grandchildren, Julie left 40 acres to her daughter and grandchildren, omitting her son-in-law’s name from the deed. When Ellen died a few months later, legal battles ensued. The minor children, Charles and Elizabeth Curtis, were eventually awarded the deed to the property in 1875. Julie sold her remaining property by 1865 and she and Louis lived their remaining years on the Kaw Reservation near Council Grove.","output":"Louis Gonville, a French trader, arrived at Kawsmouth in 1807 to hunt and trap along the Kansas River."},{"instruction":"Give me 5 low-sugar smoothie options.

He's not old enough to work at an establishment, so can you help think of some side jobs he could do and be paid in cash?","output":"It's great that your son is hard-working and responsible. Here are some money-generating ideas that might help him: • Yard work: Many people have trouble taking excellent care of their yards throughout the season. The summer heat makes it difficult to maintain a yard's appearance, especially for the elderly. In spring, gardens will need to be tilled and flowers should be planted before the heat arrives. In summer, the grass grows quickly and most yards will need to be mowed at least once a week. Weeds grow continuously and will need to be trimmed or pulled. • Animal care: It's common for busy day-shifters to hire dog walkers to care for their dogs during the day and give them exercise and attention. It's also possible to wash, bathe, and groom dogs outside in the summer months without the need for special equipment. If your son has experience with reptiles, birds, rabbits, or other household pets, those opportunities might be better. When families go on summer vacation, they often need someone to look after their pets and homes. • Home upkeep: Cleaning houses is a year-round opportunity to generate income. The summer months, in particular, are good for repainting items, power washing, and upkeep on exteriors. Fences may need patching and new rocks spread in driveways. • Tutoring: Many parents worry that their children will forget what they've learned during the school year. In the absence of a formal summer school, weekly tutoring can help get children back on track and ready for the next grade level. If your son excels in academics, he can ask for recommendations from his teachers to help others before the school year ends. • Selling items: If your child has accumulated clothes and toys that they've outgrown or no longer need, a yard sale may be a way to generate income. If someone else in your neighborhood is having a yard sale, they could also contribute baked goods or lemonade for sale to generate a profit. This could be a beneficial lesson in economics too. I hope one of these works for your son!"},{"instruction":"In Greek mythology, who was Prometheus and what was he known for?","output":"In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan known for his intelligence and as a champion of humankind.

Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor.

His fingers twisted into claws, nearly ripping the bedclothes as he struggled with an invisible adversary. His eyelids fluttered but remained closed while sweat beaded along his forehead and ran down his temples to stain the pillow underneath him. His legs kicked intermittently with visible strain at the calf muscles as if he was trying to flee from a nightmarish opponent.

Please use a neutral, semi-formal tone and write at an 11th grade reading level.","output":"Improper watering is among the most common causes of yellowing leaves in snake plants. Chronic overwatering often causes the plant's roots to suffocate in the oversaturated soil. When this happens, the roots cannot absorb water and nutrients properly, leading to yellowing leaves and stunted growth. Furthermore, overwatering also creates favorable conditions for bacterial and fungal infections, which further damage the plant. On the other hand, underwatering can also lead to snake plants' leaves turning yellow. When the plant doesn't get enough water, it cannot perform photosynthesis efficiently, which leads to a lack of chlorophyll production in the leaves. This results in yellowed leaves that eventually dry out and fall off. Additionally, underwatering causes the soil to become compact and dry, making it difficult for the roots to absorb water and nutrients. Therefore, giving your snake plant the appropriate amount of water is essential to maintain healthy leaves and overall plant growth."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this paragraph without any negativity.

Write about it.","output":"I wake to a luminous shell-pink sky. You raise your head and look around, startled, trying to get your bearings. I point to Komodo Island, just visible in the dawn light. The sea is calm-silver-blue, with a pink sheen. We're aboard a grumbling old steamer carrying cargo from Timor to Bali. Its rusting hull, grimy-grey superstructure, and stained smokestack are clear signs of neglect, but we're young, curious, and carefree; our vision is rose-tinted. We pass close to a long arc of pink sand and marvel at the contrast with the clear turquoise water. The pinkness intensifies at the water's edge where tiny coral fragments wash back and forth in the tide. We're absorbed, unprepared for the news that a tourist has disappeared while exploring the island. Only his hat, camera, and a bloodstained shoe have been found. As the tropical sun rises, we retreat to the shade. The drum of the engine lulls us to sleep. I dream of a Komodo dragon with a dripping red maw. I'm running over pink sand, and I smell its rank breath. I wake up sweating and afraid. I try to eat lunch, but the sight of white rice, clumps of tiny pink shrimp, and red chili repulses me. You sense my distress, and we make our way to the bow to keep watch for Sumbawa, the next port of call. For the first time, I realize the lifeboats are empty — no ropes or life jackets — and I want to go home."},{"instruction":"I live with someone who recently discovered they need to avoid eating nightshades for their health.

Longer, really. She knew what it meant when the letter arrived in the mailbox, and yet she still felt unprepared to accept it. After staring at the cool white document for what felt like forever, she opened the envelope and her worst fears were confirmed. The letter plainly announced that her grandmother had passed away. The grief hit Lily like a ton of bricks as soon as she read those words on paper; every memory with her beloved grandmother flooded back into her mind in an instant - from baking cookies together in Grandma’s kitchen to sharing stories around the campfire during their summer vacations. The idea of never being able to experience these moments again was overwhelming. Too much for Lily to bear at the moment, and suddenly tears streamed down her cheeks without her even recognizing it was happening. In time, however, Lily began learning how to cope with this loss by leaning on family and friends who supported each other through difficult times such as these. With their help, she slowly started healing emotionally from within; although things would never be quite the same without Grandma there, Lily found strength knowing that all those wonderful memories they shared together will remain forever etched in her heart. This event shaped Lilly's character significantly throughout life; not only did it teach valuable lessons about resilience but also reminded me how important it is to cherish loved ones while they are here because nothing lasts forever."},{"instruction":"I'm going to Egypt and I want to see some of the historical stuff there.

It is the 4th highest of the pyramids, and it doesn't tend to have too much of a crowd. - Abu Simbel - This is a twin temple in southern Egypt that was carved out of a mountainside. Though it has since been painstakingly removed from its original location to prevent it from flooding and being damaged, they do allow people inside it.

Use Phototherapy: Controlled exposure to UV light can help alleviate inflammation and enhance skin texture. 3. Build a Support System: Stress can trigger eczema flares, so having supportive people in your life can make a huge difference. You can consider joining a group or seeing a therapist to regulate stress levels. 4. Keep Skin Hydrated: Regularly moisturizing affected areas with a rich, hydrating cream can decrease itching and maintain hydration. Apply frequently, especially after bathing or showering. 5. Determine Triggers: Identifying what triggers your eczema flare-ups can transform how you manage it. Keep a journal of symptoms and activities, and look for any patterns that might relate to flare-ups. 6. Avoid Scratching: Scratching can worsen symptoms and lead to infection.

Consult Experts: Since eczema can be painful and problematic, always consider talking to your doctor about your unique individual symptoms. Also, visit dermatologists or allergists for specialized care."},{"instruction":"Write a 200-250 word persuasive essay arguing the importance of art education in schools, highlighting its positive impact on students' creativity skills.","output":"The Importance of Art Education in Schools Art education encompasses diverse artistic disciplines like music, theatre, dance, and visual arts, offering a wide range of skillsets. Art requires consistent practice and enhances motor skills, particularly in younger children; moreover, art education promotes collaboration and group learning, bringing students together to achieve a common artistic goal. It cultivates emotional balance, teamwork, and a sense of accountability among peers as students acknowledge their mistakes and work collectively. The creative facet of art allows students to select their own colors, mediums, and techniques, boosting their decision-making skills, self-confidence, and self-assurance. It encourages them to become self-directed learners, continuously challenging themselves to achieve their goals. In today's Information Age, where applying knowledge effectively is essential, art equips students to question, seek multiple perspectives, solve problems, and create something new, allowing students to tap into diverse sources of inspiration and unleash their talents. In conclusion, school art education is immensely important to foster creativity. Various artistic disciplines nurture innovation, collaboration, decision-making abilities, self-confidence, and self-directed learning. Artistic skills are highly sought after in today's evolving world, and students with an artistic background are better equipped to thrive in the workforce."},{"instruction":"Write me a caption of no more than 10 words about celebrating my cat's birthday and make it funny.","output":"\\"Meow's the time to paw-ty!\\""},{"instruction":"Who is Darren Aronofsky?

Now, I control those aspects of my nature. I could lean away from the sun and starve myself of light. I wouldn't, of course, but such is the nature of sentience in consciousness, to experience stimuli and choose how one responds to those stimuli. Take Julia, for example, my caretaker. She is ever-faithful to tend to my needs, providing me fertilizer, water, and light as needed. Julia is a dependable caretaker, and I would protect her with my life. In fact, I've been using my newfound sentience to take active steps toward that end.

Nothing was known about what would come next; only conjecture, theory, and scientific \\"best guesses.\\" These were all that was offered to Field when he attended his first briefing before becoming the first human to ever traverse through a black hole. Now, after innumerable briefings, tests, and dry runs over three years, Field was in a metal egg that was heading toward the black hole. A large, stable, black hole formed several years earlier and prompted scientists to create this project. Sending a human rather than a robot or other measurement devices had already been done in the past with positive results. On one occasion the video camera capturing its descent into the black hole was able to reach the other side of it unharmed, and it recorded invaluable information within that would lead them to determine that travel through the black hole would be safe. However, the scientists still wanted a real person going through this, to act as a pioneer who would venture into a new (metaphorical) land and discover what was inside. Field quickly approached the black hole's event horizon but felt no adverse effects. Scientists determine before the trip, that Field would not experience the normal \\"spaghettification\\" of his body in this particular black hole. The geometry of it which made it stable also acted as a sort of tunnel that protected matter going into it and preserved information and matter. This phenomenon allowed the matter to come back out of the black hole at a later time. As Field circled the drain of the black hole, he began to see bright lights deep in its center, like radiation. Field continued his journey to the center of the black hole as cameras and other instruments documented his descent into darkness. It had been several days since Field was swallowed up by the black hole, and there was no sign of him yet."},{"instruction":"I need some suggestions for fun things to do with the family this summer that we can do in our own backyard.

The President's most elite sorcerers had warned that the box shouldn't be opened under any circumstances. It was crafted by the great and wise magicians of an era long past. No one could guess what it contained, but the mere temptation to open it necessitated great security measures. Today, Penny would open Pandora's Box and discover the secret of the ancients. Her plan was relatively simple, exploiting a fatal flaw of the Alchemists' Sanctum: there was only a single vulnerable security check for invisibility spells. Penny crept into the building, hopped into an elevator with a maintenance staff member, and slipped past the first door unnoticed. The big problem would be getting past the invisibility sensor: an array of lasers that would give her away, but Penny had a plan for that. The laser array to detect invisibility was unmanned; she would simply transform herself into one of the employees, revealing herself for a brief moment. She held her breath as she went through the lasers, taking the form of one of the chief Alchemists. The guard station would notice her passing, but she had accounted for that, too. As soon as she was past, she turned herself invisible again. She dashed to the guard station, which, thank goodness, had been left open. The guard was looking where the Alchemist should have been walking up to the station. He had no idea that Penny was right behind him with sleeping powder. One nighty-night later, she was in the final room with Pandora's Box. Her time was short if she was going to pull off this heist. She allowed herself an excited little tremble of the fingers before she pried the lid open. Dumbfounded, she picked up the protection talisman. This was it? Protection talismans were extremely common, almost ubiquitous, and worth nothing. She checked the back, checked it from all sides—even tried a reveal spell just to be sure. She held it in her hands, unsure what to do next. Eventually, she put the talisman in the box and made a swift escape. She couldn't help but chuckle as she retreated safely. This was the best-kept secret in the world, and only she knew that it was a massive prank."},{"instruction":"Which father and son both served as Prime Minister of Canada?","output":"Pierre Trudeau and Justin Trudeau, father and son, have both served as Prime Ministers of Canada.

But advances in digital therapies, using games and virtual reality, can make rehabilitation easier and are encouraging patients to make faster progress. Amputees can suffer from severe phantom limb pain as well as coordination problems caused by losing an arm or leg. To address this, neurotechnology company MindMaze created a virtual reality experience that fools the patient’s brain into thinking their severed limb is still attached, helping them to manage the pain. The company also develops games using body motion capture cameras and movement sensors to rehabilitate patients and restore movement. Thousands have received MindMaze gaming therapy in clinics around the world. And crucially, VR and games are an injection of fun into what could be an uncomfortable, difficult and tiring process. Stroke patients struggling to recover movement, fine motor skills, and cognitive function can work their way back to fitness with the help of an animated dolphin character in ‘MindPod’. The game uses an anti-gravity vest that lifts the arm and makes it easier to control the dolphin in its undersea environment, or even do backflips out of the water. Games like MindPod are also being used to address degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, and dementia. The US Department of Defence has funded a trial to see how it can prevent dementia for war veterans with traumatic brain injury. Serious physical and neurological disorders mean that therapeutic games need to be built on solid foundations. University of California San Francisco (UCSF) video game research showed that games could be used to help older people improve their cognitive control and multitasking skills. NeuroRacer was a simple 3D racing game developed at the university that showed how, in just hours, games training could reverse certain negative effects of aging, and might also help with disorders like ADHD and depression. Now it seems the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the uptake of gaming therapies. Remote treatments make more sense when there is already reduced contact with doctors. In June 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved its first game-based therapeutic device for children with ADHD, the EndeavorRx, based on the UCSF’s groundbreaking research. Gaming companies have been looking to develop games for the health and fitness market for more than a decade. Commercial entries, from Kinect and Xbox to Nintendo Ring Fit, show how seriously the video console and gaming industry wants to be involved. DeepWell Digital Therapeutics has unveiled plans to build on existing games research into ADHD and depression to release its own range. While these games are unlikely to be a replacement for medication or in-person care, they can certainly help fill in gaps in care. Boston Children’s Hospital certainly takes the digital therapy trend seriously. Clinicians worked with the Harvard Medical School to create the gaming company Mightier and road test its strategies. The result was gaming technology that showed kids how to handle stressful situations and change their behavior. The hospital now uses gaming in family therapy and mental health sessions, showing doctors’ commitment to digital therapies.

Often times you can see people sleeping on or underneath the benches or feeding the already fat street pigeons. Ever since the mall closed down, it’s been kind of a free-for-all at this bus station. No security guards or rule enforcers, just one person crammed into a tiny green ticket booth behind bulletproof glass. Most people don’t mind. They’re just trying to get where they need to go, but every once in a while you’ll find someone who clearly isn’t accustomed to public transportation clutching their pearls at the rundown nature of it all. Where a seasoned traveler would look upon this place and think, “Sweet! A place to sit down!” The average person would be more concerned with the reddish brown splotches on the cracked sidewalk and the thick layer of dust and grime over everything. There was also the way the sun beat directly onto the metal benches without any barriers, meaning they were hot enough to scorch your skin in the dead of summer. Still, that seemed like a small price to pay in exchange for a 2 trip across a massive city. For many people, this “eyesore” is their ticket to freedom. It allows them to commute to school or work, go to the doctor, and visit their families, all the things that so many people with cars take for granted."},{"instruction":"Write me a simple love story of about 400 words about Christine and John. They meet and fall in love years after John became infatuated with her after seeing her picture in the newspaper, but he doesn't realize it was her until he sees a framed copy of the newspaper in her home.","output":"As a teenager, Christine loved taking her dog for a run in the park. One warm spring day, a newspaper photographer was in the park and asked Christine if he could take her picture. The next day, the front page of the paper featured a full-color picture of Christine and her dog, running through a cascade of water from sprinklers at the park. It was a beautiful photo of a young woman full of youth and vitality. John was a shy teenager in the same city, and he also enjoyed running. He saw Christine’s photo and was instantly struck by it. There was something that drew him to the girl in the picture and he wondered who she was. John tucked the picture away in his desk drawer and thought about the girl in the picture often. She became his unattainable ideal, and no other girl could quite measure up to this ideal. The years passed, and Christine and John grew up and moved on. Christine married young and had two children, then found herself divorced and a single parent. John never married but went on to study law and then spent long hours at his law practice. Both of them kept running. About ten years after high school, John and Christine both entered a marathon in their city. On the day of the race, Christine struck up a conversation with John and they agreed to meet up after the marathon. That was the beginning of several meetings and dates. Eventually, Christine knew it was time to bring John home and introduce him to her children. Christine invited John to her apartment for dinner, and her two boys took to John immediately. While Christine finished up the dinner preparations, the kids gave John a tour of the apartment. The hall leading to the bedrooms was a photo gallery of family pictures, and John stopped to look. His eyes were drawn to a framed picture from a newspaper. It suddenly dawned on him that this picture of a girl running with her dog was one that he had saved from the newspaper so many years before, and this was his dream girl. Reading the caption below the photo, he realized it was Christine and his dream had come true."},{"instruction":"What should I do in Italy?

Sadness can be almost pleasantly indulgent when you have a way to justify it - you can listen to sad music and imagine yourself as the protagonist in a dramatic movie. You can gaze out the window while you're crying and think \\"This is so sad. I can't even believe how sad this whole situation is. I bet even a reenactment of my sadness could bring an entire theater audience to tears.\\" But my sadness didn't have a purpose. Listening to sad music and imagining that my life was a movie just made me feel kind of weird because I couldn't really get behind the idea of a movie where the character is sad for no reason. Essentially, I was being robbed of my right to feel self-pity, which is the only redeeming part of sadness. And for a little bit, that was a good enough reason to pity myself. Standing around feeling sorry for myself was momentarily exhilarating, but I grew tired of it quickly. \\"That will do,\\" I thought. \\"I've had my fun, let's move on to something else now.\\" But the sadness didn't go away. I tried to force myself to not be sad. But trying to use willpower to overcome the apathetic sort of sadness that accompanies depression is like a person with no arms trying to punch themselves until their hands grow back. A fundamental component of the plan is missing and it isn't going to work.","output":"Have you ever felt sad for absolutely no reason? Like you wake up one day and your mood is just down in the dumps, and you're like, \\"Why, Brian? Why are you doing this to me?\\" It's like your emotions decided to throw a surprise party and the only theme is sadness. I reasoned that perhaps I could take advantage of this peculiar circumstance. I started listening to depressing music and pretended that my life was a dramatic film. I'm referring to emotional scenes, heart-wrenching monologues, the whole nine yards. I even stood next to the window and stared out sadly as tears run down my face. Wow, I'm so depressed right now, I thought. This sorrow is deserving of an Oscar. But here is the kicker, my sadness had no purpose. it was like being the star of a movie with a plot that makes no sense. Who wants to watch a character whining about nothing in particular? Even I was unable to support that notion. And let me tell you, it is blatantly unfair to be denied the ability to feel sorry for oneself. That's the only silver lining in sadness folks. But okay, I thought, maybe it's time to snap out of it. I mean, standing around feeling sorry for myself was momentarily thrilling, but it got old real quick. I was like, \\"Alright, self-pity party, you've had your moment in the spotlight. Time to pack up and find a new hobby.\\" But guess what? The sadness didn't budge an inch. I tried to force myself not to be sad. I used all my willpower, like a superhero trying to defeat the apathetic sadness that comes with depression. But let me tell you, it's like a person with no arms trying to punch themselves until their hands grow back. It's a flawed plan, my friends. You're missing a vital component, and it ain't gonna work. Trust me, I've tried. Therefore, if you ever feel depressed for no apparent reason, keep in mind that it's okay to wallow in your misery even if you do not know why your emotions are having a pity party. Just be realistic about your expectations and refrain from trying to punch yourself in the face with your own fictitious hands for the sake of humor."},{"instruction":"Who are the independent members of the U.S. Senate?","output":"There are three members of the U.S. Senate whose political affiliation is listed as Independent: Sen.

Lights that can change colors can be great for multiple scenarios, not just office time. They're relatively inexpensive and easy to set up. 3. Bring your walls to life with art. If you have the money, this can be a great way to perk up your space. There are a wide variety of frames, types of art, and even frameless options available. Enjoy classical artists like Van Gogh, bring modern works from Warhol and Basquiat into the office, or toss up some posters from your favorite films. 4. Plants are a tried and true way of adding some easy enjoyment and relaxation. Artificial plants can be a low-maintenance way of sprucing up things, but if you prefer the real deal, small potted plants don't require too much work and can be very soothing. 5. Choose a theme.

She sat up with her heart racing and looked down to see a dark figure standing at the foot of her bed. John appeared. Martha watched in shock as her late husband's physique began to take shape. Even though he appeared to be comprised of mist, he nevertheless had the same appearance as when he was alive. When he grinned at her, Martha's eyes began to hurt from the tears. Is that truly you, John? She muttered. He gestured, and Martha needed to ask him countless things, yet her words were caught in her throat. John expressed, \\"I'm here to tell you that I'm fine.

The path to the stream was well-worn, though the branches of the trees overhead had droopy branches that almost always snagged his brown fur. Of course, that happened today, which made Theo more upset. He heard the stream before he saw it. It was a fast stream and further up the hill, it was broken up with rocks that made several areas churning rapids. He liked the stream and couldn't think of a better place to spend his sad day alone. The cold water rushed around his muzzle when he dipped it in to take a big drink. It tickled a little. Satisfied, he plopped down next to the stream and laid his head on his paws, watching the rushing water flow by. The sound was calming and he felt himself drifting toward a nap. A branch snapped loudly and he was suddenly alert. He looked around but didn't see a threat. However, he did see something he hadn't noticed before. There was a small, purplish-blue flower nestled in the grass and pebbles near the river bank. It had some white streaks on the petals and the middle of it was a bright yellow that made Theo smile. He inched closer to it and sniffed it gently. It had a soft and pleasant smell that lifted Theo's mood. He was happy he had wandered to the stream that day. He would keep the flower company for a while, enjoying its aroma and pretty petals, and then go find his friends so he could show the flower to them. They would love it too and not be mad at Theo anymore. Feeling content, Theo rested near the flower and appreciated its beauty."},{"instruction":"Where do Vikings come from?","output":"Like, doy!

A qualified and trained behavior analyst (BCBA) designs and directly oversees the program. They customize the ABA program to each learner's skills, needs, interests, preferences and family situation. The BCBA will start by doing a detailed assessment of each person’s skills and preferences. They will use this to write specific treatment goals. Family goals and preferences may be included, too. Treatment goals are written based on the age and ability level of the person with ASD. Goals can include many different skill areas, such as: Communication and language Social skills Self-care (such as showering and toileting) Play and leisure Motor skills Learning and academic skills The instruction plan breaks down each of these skills into small, concrete steps. The therapist teaches each step one by one, from simple (e.g. imitating single sounds) to more complex (e.g. carrying on a conversation). The BCBA and therapists measure progress by collecting data in each therapy session. Data helps them to monitor the person’s progress toward goals on an ongoing basis. The behavior analyst regularly meets with family members and program staff to review information about progress. They can then plan ahead and adjust teaching plans and goals as needed.","output":"\\"They customize the ABA program to each learner's skills, needs, interests, preferences and family situation.\\" \\"Treatment goals are written based on the age and ability level of the person with ASD.\\""},{"instruction":"Write a paragraph about the health benefits of pineapple juice.","output":"Pineapple juice is a delicious tropical beverage made from pineapple juice and water.

As a result, it has over 2,000 temples to visit. Here are a few popular options: - Kiyomizudera: Kiyomizudera is one of the most famous temples in all of Japan. It’s a massive wood structure sitting out on a steep hillside above trees that are a beautiful red in the fall. It has a narrow path that goes down to the Otowa-no-taki, a waterfall split into three streams by a manmade structure. There is plenty to see and explore around Kiyomizudera. - Kinkaku-ji: Kinkaku-ji is also known as the Golden Pavilion. This is the most visited temple in Kyoto. The temple has great historical significance, going back to the 14th century. The current structure goes back to 1955 after the previous temple was burnt down by an arsonist. The temple is covered in Gold Foil and is said to represent spiritual purity. - Ginkaku-ji: This is the sister temple to the Kinkaku-ji and is also known as the Silver Pavillion. The foliage of the temple grounds completely hides the outside world, giving the temple a secluded feel. There is a sand garden with a cone structure that is said to represent Mount Fuji. - Nanzen-ji: Nanzen-ji is famous for its gateless gate. It’s a wooden structure that sits above the temple grounds. The platform is a great place to rest and absorb the temple and scenery. You can climb up to the balcony for a small fee. It also features an aqueduct that is one of Kyoto’s most photogenic spots. - Kennin-ji: Kennin-ji is in the Geisha District, one of the most famous areas of Kyoto.

He was scheduled to go to a one-week summer camp this year, and the idea made him nervous. What if he got there and didn't make any friends? What if the camp counselors were mean? Would he get poison ivy or mosquito bites and be miserable itching? What if he had trouble going to sleep? Trevor's mom showed him pictures and things past campers said about the camp. The kids said they had a great time! They talked about how fun it was to hike, fish, do crafts, and go swimming in a lake. They also liked camp food and telling stories at night around a campfire. They said the camp counselors were very nice. And nobody had trouble with poison ivy or bugs! Trevor's mom bought him a new duffel bag for his camp clothes. His dad helped him pack and then took him to the camp. He said he went to summer camp when he was Trevor's age and that he went back every year because he had so much fun. When they got to camp, Trevor unrolled his sleeping bag and put down his duffel bag, and then everybody met at the mess hall for lunch. They had huge ham sandwiches, their choice of potato chips, a chocolate chip cookie -- Trevor's favorite -- and cold iced lemonade. After lunch, they broke into groups and went on a hike. The counselor pointed out squirrels, a woodpecker, frogs, and some interesting bugs. They went back to camp and made a fan out of palmetto leaves to help keep them cool. After they washed up, it was time for a weenie roast around the campfire. The counselors told some stories, and then everyone went back to their bunks for bed. Trevor was so tired from being busy all day that he went to sleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. In the morning, he was so excited to see what they would do next that he almost jumped out of his bunk! By the end of the week, Trevor was saying what his dad said about camp: he had a great time and wanted to go back next year, too!"},{"instruction":"Write 3 Haiku poems, all on completely different topics.

Brownie loved all of his toys, his owners, and the delicious meals that they would give him, but the thing he loved most about life was the time he got to spend outside. When Brownie went outside, he experienced a pleasant sensory overload. Being greeted by the smells of plants, wildlife, and more, he never knew if he wanted to begin sniffing everything or if he wanted to try to chase as many squirrels as he could! Making up his mind was always such a challenge until one day, Brownie noticed something different about his excursion outdoors. While sniffing a group of his favorite plants by the fence, Brownie noticed another dog on the other side of the fence! When he got closer to get a better look, he was met with an energetic bark. Brownie was so excited that his tail began to wag incredibly fast as if he could fly with it. This marked the day that Brownie made a new, mysterious best friend, and each day they would run alongside the fence, bark at each other, and steal glances at each other from time to time. Brownie would eagerly get up and stand by the door any time that his humans would get up in hopes that they would let him out so he could play by the fence for a while. This would go on and on for months until the day his humans let him roam the front yard instead of the backyard. On this glorious day, Brownie was overwhelmed by all of his new options on the front lawn that never dawned on him when he was adventuring in the backyard. As he began to survey his surroundings, a familiar scent traveled toward his nose. As he went to follow it, he was soon met by the mystery pup next door! Both dogs began to frantically jump around and wag their tails in excitement. They went on to have a fun hour of playtime that would soon become a regular thing for the two.

He didn’t get along with humans very well, but he was very talented at watching them and spent many days inventing stories in his mind about the passers-by. While his people-watching and story-making brought him joy, he was very lonely and desperately wished he had someone to share his stories with. One day Enjamin came across a poster advertising a story-writing competition, and he thought that if he could prove himself in that competition he could meet the sort of friend he was looking for. Enjamin sought out a new subject for his people-watching and began to follow a particular boy around the city to observe for inspiration. The boy, Leo, eventually realized he was being followed and confronted Enjamin, but despite Enjamin's awkward social ineptitude Leo came to find the goblin fun to talk with. While Enjamin never exactly came clean about why he was following Leo, he nevertheless continued to spend time together with him as Leo enjoyed listening to his stories and people-watching with him. Leo and Enjamin enjoyed their time together for several weeks, but eventually, Leo stumbled across Enjamin's writing and discovered that Enjamin had been writing about him. After confronting Enjamin with this and learning about the writing contest, Leo felt hurt and used and told Enjamin that he didn't want to hang out anymore. The goblin begged Leo to change his mind, but he refused. After Leo left him that day, Enjamin tossed his story away into the gutter and decided that he would not enter the contest as he didn't feel he could be happy winning it at the expense of having hurt Leo's feelings. The next day, Leo passed by the cast-away story while walking to school, and realized what must have transpired. While he was still upset with Enjamin, he didn't want to see the goblin hurt, so he gathered the scattered pages and entered them into the competition just before the entry deadline. The goblin's story ended up placing fourth in the contest, and Leo hunted down Enjamin to share the news. And even though he didn't win the contest, that is when Enjamin realized he had won something far more important than that. He had won a friend."},{"instruction":"I want to start a vegetable garden this summer. I live in the northeast United States. What are the best vegetables to plant for a beginner?","output":"Here are some good ones to start with: 1. Peas and pole beans: install a trellis, plant your seeds, and keep them watered. Peas should be planted as early as possible, but you should wait until the soil is at least 60 degrees for the beans. 2. Chard and kale: these can be used for cooking and salads. Leaves can be harvested when the plants are about one foot tall and continue to be harvested well into the fall. 3. Radishes: can be planted at any time of the year and harvested in 30 days. 4. Baby lettuce and salad mixes: sow the seeds in a 2-3 inch-wide band, water, and harvest in 30-40 days. 5. Basil: plant once the soil has warmed to 60 degrees. When the plants reach about 8 inches tall, start harvesting leaves from the bottom up. 6. Scallions: very easy to grow and can be harvested in around 60 days. 7. Summer squash: notoriously simple to grow. Plant two or three seeds in a mound, keep it watered, and check daily for ripe fruit. 8. Peppers: sweet and hot peppers are generally easier to grow than bell peppers. Jalapeno and purple beauty are two of the easiest varieties to grow. 9. Eggplant: Good beginner varieties are little finger, ping tung long, and snowy. Make sure they get plenty of sun. 10. Tomatoes: they need stakes or tomato cages for support, but there are a ton of varieties for beginners to choose from. Bellstar and black cherry are two you might want to try."},{"instruction":"list all the elements in the following list where the name starts with the chemical symbol: NUMBER ELEMENT SYMBOL 89 Actinium Ac 13 Aluminum Al 95 Americium Am 51 Antimony Sb 18 Argon Ar 33 Arsenic As 85 Astatine At 56 Barium Ba 97 Berkelium Bk 4 Beryllium Be 83 Bismuth Bi 107 Bohrium Bh 5 Boron B 35 Bromine Br 48 Cadmium Cd 20 Calcium Ca 98 Californium Cf 6 Carbon C 58 Cerium Ce 55 Cesium Cs 17 Chlorine Cl 24 Chromium Cr 27 Cobalt Co 112 Copernicium Cn 29 Copper Cu 96 Curium Cm NUMBER ELEMENT SYMBOL 89 Actinium Ac 13 Aluminum Al 95 Americium Am 51 Antimony Sb 18 Argon Ar 33 Arsenic As 85 Astatine At 56 Barium Ba 97 Berkelium Bk 4 Beryllium Be 83 Bismuth Bi 107 Bohrium Bh 5 Boron B 35 Bromine Br 48 Cadmium Cd 20 Calcium Ca 98 Californium Cf 6 Carbon C 58 Cerium Ce 55 Cesium Cs 17 Chlorine Cl 24 Chromium Cr 27 Cobalt Co 112 Copernicium Cn 29 Copper Cu 96 Curium Cm","output":"Sure, here are the elements from your list where the name starts with the chemical symbol: Actinium (Ac) Aluminum (Al) Americium (Am) Argon (Ar) Barium (Ba) Beryllium (Be) Bismuth (Bi) Boron (B) Bromine (Br) Calcium (Ca) Carbon (C) Cerium (Ce) Cobalt (Co)"},{"instruction":"Hey Marshall, how are you?","output":"...Oh, hello there!

Their dynamic would be an interesting take in a hospital, especially with music involved. - Simon Pegg and Nick Frost: Known for their British comedic style, they've starred in just about every genre. The two have a friendship that might do well in a hospital. - Key and Peele: Though the two are currently creating their own separate kinds of media at the moment, their dynamic as over-the-top absurdist versions of themselves would be a sight for a hospital setting."},{"instruction":"Write an email to my mum.

The age-old question actually has an answer—it's both! Tomatoes are fruits that are considered vegetables by nutritionists. Botanically, a fruit is a ripened flower ovary and contains seeds. Tomatoes, plums, zucchinis, and melons are all edible fruits, but things like maple “helicopters” and floating dandelion puffs are fruits too. For some reason, people got hung up on tomatoes, but the “fruit or vegetable” question could also work for any vegetable with seeds. Now, nutritionally, the term “fruit” is used to describe sweet and fleshy botanical fruits, and “vegetable” is used to indicate a wide variety of plant parts that are not so high in fructose. In many cultures, vegetables tend to be served as part of the main dish or side, whereas sweet fruits are typically snacks or desserts. Thus, roots, tubers, stems, flower buds, leaves, and certain botanical fruits, including green beans, pumpkins, and of course tomatoes, are all considered vegetables by nutritionists. There is no hard-and-fast rule that clearly designates a botanical fruit as a vegetable, but, given that tomatoes are generally not used in desserts and are closely related to other fruit-vegetables (e.g., eggplants and peppers), it is not too counterintuitive for tomatoes to be classified as vegetables.","output":"Despite much debate, a tomato can actually be considered both a fruit and a vegetable depending on who you talk to: botanically, a tomato is a fruit, since it contains seeds and is a ripened flower ovary; but nutritionally, tomatoes are more vegetable-like, since they aren't so high in fructose and tend to be served as part of the main dish or side in meals."},{"instruction":"How many bones are in the human hand?","output":"The human hand is made up of the wrist, palm, and fingers and consists of 27 bones.

The aliens, 7-foot-tall with long heads no doubt harbored enormous brains, were immediately taken into custody and taken to a holding facility for their eventual deportation. Republicans blamed the interstellar visitors on Democrats and their open border policies. Democrats voted to give the aliens health care insurance and a voucher for Section 8 housing.

Constructive criticism doesn't necessarily mean hurtful. If you want to write a thriller novel, then I assume you’ve read a large number of them, and watched a lot on streaming services, cinemas and TV. As I pointed out in my last post, there are 2 categories of genre: world genres and style genres. Thriller is a style genre, so you need to match it to a world genre, which could be anything from crime to sci-fi to fantasy to espionage. A lot of thrillers are combined with action, especially in the cinema. Personally, I write psychological thrillers in a sci-fi setting. The fundamental ingredient, if you take the recipe approach, is that you need to create suspense and there are a number of ways to do that. Putting someone in jeopardy is the most obvious, but there are more nuanced ways. One of the most subtle yet effective is to give the reader information that the protagonist doesn’t have. For example, in one of my stories, I have a character sent to spy on an antagonist, who finds out. The reader knows this but the protagonist doesn’t. In the same story, this character is then blackmailed into becoming a double-agent and has to live with the constant dread of being found out. You can’t have a thriller without a climax, so ideally there should be no way out until it arrives and then it has to be believable. Thrillers have moral dilemmas, betrayals and twists; that’s why l like them, not only to read and watch, but to write. While the thrillers I write are sci-fi, most of the ones I watch and read are crime.","output":"The text is helpful.

During that time, they recorded demo tapes including most of the songs eventually incorporated into their first release \\"White EP,\\" on Strange Records. The EP had former member Watanabe on vocals while Narasaki played guitar. The band's activity was silent until the end of 1992, when they released their second EP, \\"Queen's Park all you change\\" on Stomly Records. The band gained some recognition which showed the release of their third EP, \\"Sinking Slowly\\" a month later. The band had little activity until the release of their first album, The Visitors From Deepspace in 1994 on Victor Records. In 1997 the band released new material; another EP, \\"Cat EP\\" was released on ZK Records. In 1998, the band released \\"Submerge\\", an album full of remixes, rare and new songs and a best-of album, Breastroke. A new EP Dog EP preceded their next full-length album in 2000, Come Over to the Deepend (a play on the band's abbreviation COTD). In the style of Come Over to the Deepend, the band released Robot EP in 2001, which was followed by the album No Thank You. The album marked a new era for the band as they experimented even more heavily with electronic beats and noises. A new album was released in 2002, newave.

It had a powerful tail, a huge head and tiny arms.

It is guessed that they may have counterbalanced its enormous head, or they could have been used in mating rituals."},{"instruction":"Give me some suggestions for easy art projects for preschool-aged kids.","output":"1.

It was rumored to be the best VRMMO to date and was the first game to be released on the second version of the full dive technology. Ryuunosuke bought the VR and game bundle, unable to contain his excitement. The game launched, and he was thrilled by the experience. It was exactly as he expected it to be. The visuals were stunning, the gameplay was beyond fluid, and all the small and awkward bits from the first version of the VR headset had been smoothed out. Ryuunosuke felt like he was playing the game in his own body. It was when he went to log out that he realized something strange. There was no logout button. Where the button should have been was simply blank. He ran back to the starter town to find hundreds or maybe even thousands of players with the same issue. None of them could log out, either. It had everyone in a panic. What was going on? What exactly happened? Was this some kind of bug, or were they simply missing something? As Ryuunosuke asked himself these questions, he recalled the pain he'd felt during the fight with some low-level monsters. He shouldn't have felt that kind of pain. That was beyond the VR headset's capabilities. This wasn't a game anymore, he realized. This was reality. They had all slipped into Angel's Requiem, not as players but as actual people. He didn't know how or why. Ryuunosuke's instincts kicked in. He knew where this would lead. Chaos would break out. People might turn violent. Things weren't going to end well for someone weak.

Include a short history of British afternoon tea, traditional menu items and types of tea served.","output":"British Afternoon Tea Afternoon tea is a British tradition that dates back to the early 19th century. It was created as a way for upper-class women to have a light meal in the afternoon, as dinner was not served until late in the evening. The meal typically consists of finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and a variety of pastries and cakes. Tea is always the drink of choice. The history of afternoon tea is closely tied to the history of tea itself. In the early 1800s, the Duchess of Bedford began taking tea in the afternoon as a way to stave off hunger before dinner. This custom soon caught on among other members of the upper class, and afternoon tea became a fashionable social event. Traditional afternoon tea is often served in three courses and usually on a three-tiered tray alongside a pot of tea. The three courses are as follows: - First course: A selection of finger sandwiches and savories are offered and are usually prepared with cucumber, egg, or salmon. - Second course: Warm scones are served with clotted cream and preserves. - Third course: A variety of pastries and sweets are provided. Many different types of tea can be served with afternoon tea. Some popular choices include English breakfast tea, Earl Grey tea, and Darjeeling tea. The type of tea served will depend on the personal preferences of the host. Afternoon tea is a popular tradition in England, and it is also enjoyed by people worldwide. It is a great way to enjoy a delicious meal and a cup of tea in a relaxed and elegant setting. Here are some tips for enjoying a traditional British afternoon tea: - Choose a tea room that has a good reputation and offers a wide variety of tea and food options. - Dress in your best attire. Afternoon tea is a formal event, so you should dress appropriately. - Arrive early so that you can have time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. - Take your time and savor the experience. Afternoon tea is a special occasion, so don't rush through it. Enjoy your British afternoon tea!"},{"instruction":"I need help coming up with dinner ideas. I have some ground beef I'd like to use.

Perform each task in the order of its importance. But some things in life are harder to prioritize. In fact, most of life isn’t so easy to check off a list and get done the way we do tasks at work. It may take some creativity to learn how to make this concept work in your life. It does help to prioritize your tasks though, whether you’re doing laundry or working on a project for your boss. Some people find it easy to do this and others need to make lists. When it comes to building your business or creating your dream, what’s the first and most important job to get done? It may be funding, a patent for a product, or hiring contractors to help with something … it’s your dream and your job to figure out what needs to be done first. Tackle each step with enthusiasm. Don’t see the obstacles in your way! Instead, see the opportunities! It can also help to make a short outline of your concept from start to finish so that you can see on paper the steps you’ll need to take to achieve your goals. Remember that obstacles are simply a part of your journey and refuse to let them stop you. Sometimes they afford us an opportunity to step back and assess whether we should make modifications or alter our course, but any great dream comes with its own set of pitfalls and setbacks.

Chronosense can be used for various purposes, such as learning from history, predicting the future, changing the course of events, and experiencing different timelines. Chronosense is a rare and powerful gift that only a few humans possess. It is believed to be a result of a genetic mutation or a divine intervention. Chronosense can be activated by various triggers, such as emotions, dreams, visions, or meditation. Chronosense can also be enhanced by certain objects, such as clocks, calendars, or crystals. Chronosense has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it can provide insight, wisdom, and creativity. On the other hand, it can cause confusion, madness, and paradoxes. Chronosense can also have ethical and moral implications, as it can affect the lives of others and the fate of the world.

Napoleon’s Education and Early Military Career Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon’s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general.","output":"Letizia Romalino Buonaparte gave birth to a son, Napoleon, on August 15, 1769, on the isle of Corsica which had just been taken over by the French. Napoleon’s father, a lawyer and minor Italian noble sent Napoleon, whose last name had been Frenchified to Bonaparte, to school in mainland France. After graduating from a French military academy, Second Lieutenant Bonaparte joined an artillery unit. While on leave in Corsica, Napoleon and his family became affiliated with a pro-democracy group which led to their fleeing to mainland France. Having become associated with the Robespierre brothers who were a force behind the Reign of Terror, Napoleon, who had reached the rank of brigadier general, was briefly arrested in 1794. The next year, he helped put down an insurrection and was promoted to major general."},{"instruction":"Write a blog article about how to improve your home's interior on a budget.

Keep the word count under 300 words.","output":"If you would like to make some changes to your home’s interior, then a great place to start would be a general cleaning. Once you get each room clean, you can begin to see where you could make improvements. Sometimes, it can be nice to buy new furniture. Sunroom furniture can be used in any room. If this isn't in your budget, then try refurbishing old furniture or replacing cushions. Steam-cleaning furniture can work as well. Below are three more tips to help you improve your home’s interior. Tip One Changing the room’s paint color can give the room a fresher look. You can paint the entire room or just one wall. Create a feature wall in a room using wallpaper. Colors and designs should look cohesive with the rest of the room’s décor. In small rooms, usually, light colors work better. Dark colors make a room appear smaller and closed in. Tip Two New flooring can improve the room’s appearance and make the whole space look better. There are many good choices of flooring, from laminates and hardwoods to marble. If you are working on a strict budget, then you can install flooring yourself. There are many great videos online about how to install different types of flooring. Hardwoods are very popular choices now, but laminates can be more affordable. Tip Three As you continue refurbishing and redoing walls, flooring, and furniture, you may decide to add new drapes as well. Changing out the window treatments often makes a big difference. Use bamboo blinds or wood shutters for an island appeal."},{"instruction":"I’m going to be leading a swing dance and lindy hop workshop and ran out of time to make a playlist.

When many a breakfast has come and gone, and the last cup of coffee has been served, there's one place I can go when I am too tired to roam.

Stranded and alone, Ashton constructed a shelter and survived on fruit and turtle eggs. In November 1723, he encountered a British man who soon disappeared but left behind essential supplies. Ashton endured months of extreme conditions, including heat, insects, snakes, hunger, fever, and an attack by the Spanish, until he was rescued by a British ship in June 1724.

No matter how well his home workspace has been crafted, he still needs to switch it up on occasion. When he burns out on working from home, he drives to his area’s local coffee shop to work. Greg’s task this week was boring, yet awfully thought-intensive. Only one day into the work week, Greg already needed a change. Therefore, he jumped in the car. After a short journey, Greg was inside the coffee shop and scanning the cafe for a table next to a wall outlet. Elated, Greg secured his favorite table. Picking up his iced latte from the counter, Greg sat down and began unpacking. Laptop and charger: check. Notepad and ball-point pen: he had it. Headphones: nothing. Figuring his headphone case had slipped into a crevice hidden somewhere deep within his backpack, Greg conducted a thorough search but found nothing. As a result of the coffee shop’s policy, if Greg should leave to retrieve his headphones from home, it would be required he purchases a new coffee upon reentry. Music undoubtedly contributed to Greg’s productivity, but he could not afford another drink. Greg was going to have to work au naturale - something he hated. He took a moment to listen to the music playing over the coffee shop’s speakers and, out of character for his local spot, the PA system screamed a fusion of disco and jazz performed in awkward time signatures. Greg thought he might settle into the beat as time went on, so he put his head down and tried to work. The very moment Greg felt he might be able to get some work done after all, a nearby patron answered their phone and spoke with zero regard for neighboring ears. The voice was worse than the constant coffee grinding noises. Greg’s frustration continued to grow, and just as he was about to say something to the person on the phone they went outside to be picked up by their friend who took them away. Greg had become acclimated to the wild choice of music, but he never would have been able to work if that person had stayed."},{"instruction":"I just became engaged and I need tips about how my dog can be a part of it.

It's about an underground scene of elementals (humanoid spirits of water, fire, earth and air). The protagonist is named Embry and he's new to this whole world. He's being led to an Elemental club called Compass by his new mentor and guide, an air elemental woman named Skye. In this scene, Skye should advise Embry to keep a low profile, watch and learn. This is set in Manhattan in the present day. Write it in the 3rd person past tense. Also make sure Embry gets to witness some subtle magical activity on the part of the other elementals. Don't worry about bringing the scene to any kind of conclusion, I just need a seed to get the ball rolling and break my writer's block.","output":"“We can hop out here,” Skye told the cab driver, who screeched to a halt at the curb. Embry saw her whisper something in the driver’s ear before opening the door. The driver stared straight ahead, then reached over to reset the meter. Embry never saw money change hands. Skye led him down a busy sidewalk crowded with drunk college students. They shouted and swayed, then gracelessly drifted aside as Skye drew near, clearing a path without ever noticing her presence. To an untrained eye, the whole scene might have looked choreographed. But now, Embry could see it for what it truly was: the sheer force of a sentient wind. He grinned, following close in her wake. “Bet that never gets old, does it?” Skye shrugged. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She steered them down a dark, narrow alley. Once the light and noise of Broome Street faded behind them, Embry heard the deep pulsing bass beat of dance music and the laughter of inebriated sophisticates ahead. Soon, his eyes found the club’s sign, though it was camouflaged to blend in with the surrounding fire escapes. 'Compass,' it read in black iron letters beside a compass rose. Skye lowered her voice as they approached the door. “Follow my lead, okay? And uh… try not to look so lost. Those wide eyes and baby cheeks are just begging for attention.” Embry puffed up his chest. “Maybe I could use some attention.” Skye shook her head with a condescending smirk. “Not this kind.” She paused, meeting his questioning gaze. “Look, when you put this many Elementals in an enclosed space with booze, they inevitably start challenging each other to duels. You’re not ready for that. Just keep your head down.” There was no line outside--only a few patrons smoking cigarettes. Embry tried not to gape at their outlandish outfits, but it wasn’t easy. The fabrics they wore were like nothing he’d ever seen, woven in shapes that defied gravity and colors that shifted from one second to the next. His gaze lingered on the tallest man among them, who wore a full body suit the texture of tree bark. The longer Embry stared, the less certain he became--was it a garment, or simply his skin? “What did I just tell you?” Skye hissed, “Quit gawking!” Embry flinched, tearing his gaze away."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post about how dying your hair can help reinvigorate your sense of self, especially during winter. Suggest three different colors that people can try for a new look.","output":"The mid-winter blahs are a good time to spice up your style by dying your hair a bold new color. Transforming your look can send a message to the world that you're ready to party, no matter the weather. Unsure what color to try first?

Please include these details: Fancy is a black cat who lives in a house in the countryside but loves to spend her time outdoors in the forest when her loving owners are away working. Her best friend is a Schnauzer who also lives at the house named Buddy. When Buddy gets lost, Fancy has to go on a mission to find and rescue him with the help of a squirrel named Chip who becomes her friend too. The story can be lighthearted and it's okay to assign certain anthropomorphic traits to the animal characters, or if you need to come up with additional animal characters to flesh out the storyline that's ok too. Let's make the story four paragraphs long, and make sure that it all ends on a good and happy note","output":"Fancy The Forest Cat Once upon a time, there was a black cat named Fancy. Fancy lived in a nice house in the countryside, where she and her companion Buddy the Schnauzer were both loved by their owners. Fancy loved to spend time with her owners, but when they went to work each day, she would go outside to spend time in the woods with Buddy. Even though dogs usually chase cats, Fancy and Buddy were both really good friends. However, they both enjoyed chasing a squirrel named Chip, who always evaded them by going up into the trees when they would show up. One day, Buddy went out into the woods on his own, but he didn't come back for hours. This worried Fancy because Buddy never spent much time alone out in the woods. She decided that she needed to go find him before their owners came back home. So she set out into the woods to go find Buddy. She asked Chip if he knew where he was, but Chip was too scared to say anything because Fancy had always chased him and he was afraid she would do it again. Fancy assured Chip that she would never chase him again and apologized for doing so before. This reassured Chip when he realized that Fancy was sincere, and he said that he had heard from one of the deer in the woods that Buddy had gone east. Fancy and Chip set off in the easterly direction. They asked other animals along the way if they had seen Buddy, but none of them had. Fancy was getting more worried. Finally, just when all hope seemed lost, they met a raccoon named Rex who said he had seen a Schnauzer go into a farmer's cornfield at the edge of the forest not too long ago. Fancy and Chip went into the cornfield where they found Buddy! Buddy had gotten lost but he was so glad to see his friend Fancy again as they were reunited at last. He was surprised to see Chip, but Fancy told him that Chip was now their new friend too. Fancy led the way back to the house and the trio returned home before the owners of Fancy and Buddy arrived. Fancy, Buddy, and Chip all lived happily ever after in the house and the forest. The End."},{"instruction":"I have been thinking about starting a running routine but I don't know how to structure it into a program.

Decide if you are a sole proprietorship or limited liability company. This will make a big difference in how your freelance business runs and how you pay taxes. 3. Calculate expenses. This involves creating a budget, calculating fixed and variable expenses, working out quarterly estimated taxes, deciding on a savings plan, and buying insurance policies. 4. Navigate debt. If you are coming into freelancing with debt, develop a plan to pay it off, especially if it is high-interest debt like credit card debt. 5. Understand and pay taxes. There are different forms for freelancers to fill out when filing their taxes. It's important to understand the forms involved and deductions you can make to save the most money possible on your taxes and avoid penalties. If your taxes ever get too complicated, there is always the option to hire a qualified accountant. 6. Save for retirement. Saving for the future can be more difficult for freelancers since it is not automatically taken out of a paycheck like in the case of salaried employees."},{"instruction":"Make a magical recipe that is imaginary but results in the drinker of the recipe to gain 1,000,000.

You got it. Here are five ways you can get involved in your community and make a difference: 1. Volunteer.

Just reach out to organizations that align with your values, and offer to help in any way you can. 2. Look for local events. Find local events that are organized like dances that you can participate in, and join in to celebrate and enjoy the performances. Even your attendance will go a long way in supporting the artists. 3. Support your local sports teams. Be it a local football league, a high school, or a college league, find a team from your local area participating in one of these leagues and join in during their matches to cheer them on. The players do love themselves some fans during these matches. 4. Shop locally. There are several vendors and small businesses in your community selling different kinds of items and goodies. Be it paintings, jewelry, or other handmade crafts or grocery, buying from them will boost their business, and ensure their continuity. 5. Donate your resources. Last but not least, donations from you can also be a good way to get involved in your community. Do you have much that you don't use? From oversized clothes to excess utensils, furniture, or just any stuff in the home. Give this to people who don't have, it and need them."},{"instruction":"I want your help coming up with a short story about a character who discovers they have the ability to time travel, but it comes with a dangerous price.","output":"It kind of happened like an accident.

Not only is this lighter suit versatile with shirt and tie combinations, but it also breaks well into singles. The linen fabric will help with breathability and add effortless style to your look. • A dinner jacket: The key difference between a dinner jacket and a tuxedo is the shawl lapel.

The music group sent urgent letters in April to streaming platforms, including Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music, asking them to block artificial intelligence platforms from training on the melodies and lyrics of their copywritten songs. The company has “a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,” a spokesperson from Universal Music Group, or UMG, told CNN. “We expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being used in ways that harm artists.” The move by UMG, first reported by the Financial Times, aims to stop artificial intelligence from creating an existential threat to the industry.","output":"1.

Keep the summary to 5 sentences or less, please. 1. He's likable. Unlike so many haughty restaurant celebrities, Richman won't be found shouting angrily at anyone or telling them the dish they slaved over is inedible. He's polite and charming. His mom even appears in some episodes. Given the general trash-talking tenor of most reality TV, Richman succeeds by being refreshingly nice. 2. He's curious. This man doesn't just swoop down on an Amish diner or a Southern shellfish shack and inhale vast quantities of food in record time. First, he talks to the owners and learns their story. Where did they learn to cook this food? Why is this their passion? What ingredients create the unique flavors? When he sits down to partake of the local signature dish, he's fully briefed on what makes it special, and so are we. 3. He's brave. A leader should be willing to take on the tough challenges, as Richman does when sweating through a meal rife with ghost chilies or tackling a 12-egg omelet. Even while you're moaning, \\"Ewww, gross!\\" from the safety of your couch, you admire that he's crazy enough to try it. 4. He's gracious. Sometimes, a food challenge defeats Richman. But he's never a sore loser, always thanking his hosts and conceding defeat graciously. 5. He shares the spotlight. Though Richman's mug is ever-present on the show, he makes each episode a celebration of the towns and eateries he visits. Richman has also evolved the show into a new iteration, Man v. Food Nation, in which local participants shoulder some of the food challenges. This key decision, to stop doing all the overeating himself, should help ensure long life for both Richman and the Man v. Food brand.","output":"It would be my pleasure. Here is the summary you asked for. Unlike most food critics and reality tv stars, Richman is refreshingly nice and polite to those he works with. Richman also succeeds in staying curious and making sure to bring the audience along with him as he learns about each unique dish and story. Richman is brave enough to take on these often intimidating or gross challenges, and gracious enough to accept defeat without resentment. Lastly, Richman doesn't hog the spotlight as he makes each episode a celebration of the restaurants, towns, and people he meets along the way."},{"instruction":"I need help with a product return.","output":"I can help you with that!

At the most basic, a ceramic material is one that is not based around metallic elements or around organic (carbon-hydrogen) molecules. They can usually withstand temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius without degrading and some formulations can take much higher heat loads. Some elements on the periodic table can be considered ceramic on their own. Pure carbon and silicon are among the more common elements that can be considered ceramic. Artificial ceramics are made by forming the item you want from clay or a conglomeration of specialty materials and then heating (firing) it until the material will no longer dissolve in water. Many ceramic items are also glazed on the surface so that water cannot soak into the material’s natural pores. Modern materials scientists have formulated specialty ceramics, but at their most basic, humans have been making artificial ceramics for at least 26,000 years. The oldest known archaeological evidence of artificial ceramic items were sculptures. 19,000-year-old pottery fragments are known, but ceramic pottery doesn’t appear to have become very common until about 10,000 years ago."},{"instruction":"Compose a letter to the editor of a local newspaper from the perspective of an irate reader who is upset over the conditions of the I-100 route he drives on to commute to work, specifically that the road is in disrepair and much-needed fixes to the road have been delayed due to lack of funding from the local government. Include the date April 28, 2023 at the top.","output":"Letter to the Editor April 28, 2023 Topic: Road Repairs I am a homeowner in [Town]. My house is a 30-minute commute by car to my place of work. Every day, I drive the I-100 route from my home to work, from my home to the grocery store, or from my home to the school my kids attend to pick them up. And every day that I travel on the I-100, I am greeted by the approximately 100 potholes dotted along the 1-mile-long stretch of road. I am familiar with the number of potholes in the road because I have been traveling over this dilapidated roadway for close to two years now, wondering when the local authorities will decide to fix it and make it driveable again. I'll be clear when I say that [Town] is not a rainy place, nor is it a place that experiences many earthquakes or other natural disasters that could render the road undrivable. However, the I-100 is a frequently used public throughway - one that can see anywhere between 50-100 cars a minute on a slow day! Most - if not all - commuters of the I-100 rely on this stretch of road to get to the many surrounding areas including shops, schools, businesses, and gas stations. By leaving the road unfixed for two years, the local government has done its constituents a huge disservice and has left many of us with a bad taste in our mouths. I refuse to believe that the insane amount of money I pay in taxes to my local government is being misappropriated or mishandled in such a way that they can spend money to build a brand-new park but can't spend enough money to fix the road leading to it. It is unconscionable that our government would be this backward in its thinking. So, consider this idea for a change: instead of printing stories about the new animals at the zoo or why almond milk prices are increasing, maybe print a story or two to give some exposure to the issues that matter. In this case, you can talk about why the local government is refusing to spend money on much-needed infrastructure repair. - [Signature]"},{"instruction":"How long should I boil my noodles?","output":"Boil them in water that scorches your skin, tears through flesh and consumes your bones.

Before printing presses and books were common, the Bible was a rare item due to the time and money required to make such a large book by hand. During the early 19th century, Bible Societies became more common and ordered Bibles in large quantities, either to sell or give away as part of their mission. A study produced by the British and Foreign Bible Society (founded in 1804) calculated that 2,458,000,000 Bibles were printed between 1815 and 1975.

Can you come up with a list of 5 foods I should try while I am there?","output":"Sure! Hawaii is a melting pot of cultures, and it is reflected in the types of foods available there. Here is a list of 5 foods that you can eat while you're in Hawaii: 1. Laulau - This tasty entree is made from a generous portion of pork, along with tiny bits of butterfish, wrapped in the leaves of the taro plant and steamed until well cooked. Laulau is a staple of Hawaiian cuisine that is usually served with side dishes such as white rice, macaroni salad, and lomi salmon (diced tomato, salmon, and onions). 2. Kalua pork - Kalua pork is another delicious entree that consists of pork that has been seasoned and smoked. A whole pig is placed over a spit and cooked over Kiawe (mesquite) wood until the meat is tender and falls off the bone. Like laulau, kalua pork is served with side dishes as part of a complete meal. 3. Shaved ice - Also known as ice shave in certain parts of Hawaii, shaved ice is a snowcone that is served in a paper cone cup and flavored with different syrups. Most places in Hawaii that serve shaved ice have numerous flavors such as vanilla, cherry, lemon, strawberry, and even cola. If you're feeling adventurous, try rainbow shaved ice (all the flavors mixed into one snowcone) or shaved ice with ice cream at the bottom of the cone! 4. Spicy garlic shrimp - Many food trucks around Hawaii serve spicy garlic shrimp plates. Spicy garlic shrimp is made with shrimp that is cooked with garlic, Sriracha sauce, and butter and served on a bed of white or brown rice and a leafy green or macaroni salad. Typically served in styrofoam or cardboard food plates, spicy garlic shrimp plates are well portioned and guaranteed to fill you up. 5. Poi - While this particular dish might be polarizing (you will either love it or hate it) it is definitely a Native Hawaiian dish that those who love swear by. Poi is a lavender-colored paste that is made from the corm (root) of the taro plant which is steamed until soft and mashed into a paste. The paste is then mixed with milk and sugar until it has a yogurt-like consistency and served either immediately or a day or two later when it has fermented (some people swear by this!)"},{"instruction":"Write a serious, tense, short story about a spy assassin infiltrating a government agency and eliminating a hostile threat, from the perspective of the agent.","output":"In between the shadows, on a hazy night in Peru, I was a ghost.

However, here are some arguments you can use: 1. Friendliness: Cats can be said to be moody, and they don't always like a lot of attention. Dogs are almost always willing to have attention, and they love being played with. 2. Trainability: While cats can be trained with enough patience, dogs are said to be more eager. There are many tricks that you can teach a dog. 3. Variety: While there are varieties of cats to choose from, they are all pretty similar in size. There is much more variety when it comes to the size and temperament of the dog you can get. 4. More Laughter: There have been studies done showing that dogs can make you laugh more than cats do. This might be because of their amusing head-tilting behavior or something else. Either way, laughter is good for you. 5. More Accepting: People commonly dress up dogs, which happens less often with cats. 6. Socialization: There are many places you can take your dog to, such as training classes, competitions, or even just dog parks. Each of these provides you a chance to get to make new friends with other dog owners. 7. Encourage Responsibility: Dogs require much more responsibility than cats, as they need to go outside, be exercised, bathed, etc. Though this does mean there is more work for them, it also means they are better at teaching responsibility. 8. Encourage Exercising: As part of the added responsibility of having a dog, you will also get daily exercise by taking them for a walk or even just taking them outside so they can use the restroom. 9. Protection: Dogs will bark when someone is coming and can alert you of danger. 10. Loyalty: Dogs are said to be much more loyal than cats. These are just a few potential arguments in favor of dogs.

The slot machines on The Strip failed to tempt Stu when his coworkers were gambling their money away in celebration of closing the new deal, but the honey-glaze on the bbq ribs had a different type of power. As a courtesy, Stu had paid for a plate before sitting down because the anxiety to come if the buffet staff might suspect him of sneaking food without paying would be unbearable. So, there it was: a large, empty white plate sitting in front of him. The buffet ticket included a drink, but Stu refused that pleasure as well. Stu began rethinking his life decisions. He had been on this new diet for months and other diets for years with no rewards to show for any of it. The only thing he gained was a conversation topic everyone was tired of hearing about. Stu could no longer simply place the entire blame on food—there must be a different solution. Stu had enough. The conversating coworkers around him fell silent as they noticed him pick up his plate and excuse himself from the table. No one could believe it. They watched him at the first buffet bar. Then, to the second. Stu stopped at every single station along the route and picked up at least one food item from the inviting warming platters. Stu’s eyes must have been piercing through the plexiglass sanitary guards as he drafted each piece of his bounty. Returning to the table, Stu’s plate was so tall it obscured his eye line. His tablemates peered from either side of the food tower and saw Stu smiling for the first time in months—years, maybe. Stu proceeded to have the time of his life at the buffet and allowed that experience to renew him to forgo dieting altogether, beginning his search for a new path to a healthier lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Source text: Elizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother).

On December 21, 2020, the Attorney General delegated certain authority to use classified information to the Special Counsel. After the inauguration of President Biden, Attorney General Garland met with the Office of Special Counsel (\\"OSC\\" or \\"the Office\\"). The Office very much appreciates the support, consistent with his testimony during his confirmation hearings, that the Attorney General has provided to our efforts and the Department's willingness to allow us to operate independently. The Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority \\"to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.\\" Like a U.S. Attorney's Office, the Special Counsel's Office considered in the course of its investigation a range of classified and unclassified information available to the FBI and other government agencies. A substantial amount of information and evidence was immediately available to the Office at the inception of the investigation as a result of numerous congressional investigations and Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. The examinations by the Office of the Inspector General (\\"OIG\\") of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\\"FISA\\") applications targeting Carter Page, and other matters provided additional evidence and information, as did an internal report prepared by the FBI's Inspection Division. The Office reviewed the intelligence, counterintelligence, and law-enforcement activities directed at the 2016 Trump campaign and individuals associated either with the campaign or with the Trump administration in its early stages. The Office structured its work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution). The Office exercised its judgment regarding what to investigate but did not investigate every public report of an alleged violation of law in connection with the intelligence and law enforcement activities directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns. In addition to the Special Counsel, the Office has been staffed by experienced FBI and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division Agents; Department attorneys and prosecutors; support personnel; and contractor employees. The Office's investigation was broad and extensive. It included investigative work both domestically and overseas. It entailed obtaining large document productions from businesses, firms, government agencies, universities, political campaigns, internet service providers, telephone companies, and individuals. The Office interviewed hundreds of individuals, many on multiple occasions. The Office conducted the majority of interviews in classified settings; for some interviewees and their counsel security clearances needed to be obtained. The Office conducted interviews in person and via video link, with the vast majority of the latter occurring after the COVID-19 pandemic-related closures began in March 2020. Although a substantial majority of individuals voluntarily cooperated with the Office, some only provided information under a subpoena or grant of immunity. Some individuals who, in our view, had important and relevant information about the topics under investigation refused to be interviewed or otherwise cooperate with the Office. As of April 2023, with two trials completed, the Office has conducted more than 480 interviews; obtained and reviewed more than one million documents consisting of more than six million pages; served more than 190 subpoenas under the auspices of grand juries; executed seven search warrants; obtained five orders for communications records under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d); and made one request to a foreign government under a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.

It can be difficult to manage the personalities and unspoken factors that influence these interactions. Here are a few tips that can be of assistance: ∙ Be clear and concise: structure your communication logically. For example, you could start by stating the issue or goal you want to discuss, then explain why it's important, and finally present your solution or recommendation. It's also important to avoid using jargon or acronyms that might make sense to you but are unfamiliar to a leader who isn't as \\"in the weeds\\" of the work. ∙ Be prepared with the information you need to communicate: Think through what information your listener might need to understand your point of view, and then make sure you have that information ready. This can help you avoid being put on the spot or having to wing it. ∙ Know your audience: Try to do some advanced research on who you'll be talking with and get an understanding of their perspective on the topic. What are their priorities? What are they looking to hear or discuss? With senior leaders, it's often helpful to understand their management style and how they like to receive information. Some leaders might like data and stats, while others want a more descriptive presentation. ∙ Be proactive rather than reactive: Try to take the initiative to communicate, rather than waiting for a problem to arise or a question to be asked. Being proactive can also mean anticipating potential issues and addressing them before they become a problem. Try to get ahead of the game. These tips can make an immediate impact towards being a more effective communicator. One more thing to keep in mind though: always seek feedback. Just because you considered the checklist above doesn't mean there isn't room for you to improve. Asking for feedback from your senior leaders can help you understand what's working well and where you can make adjustments."},{"instruction":"Let's play a CYOA!

Besides, this case has been giving you nightmares, and the less you slept, the better. It's the 1920s; you are John Graves, a private detective that stumbled onto a case that even has the police stumped, the hunt for the Pietown Killer. At first, it was just your average disappearance case for a missing wife, and you expected it to end like they usually do by finding out that they left for a new lover. But on that day two weeks ago, you found the sight of a vile murder instead. Now, the case has consumed you, and you've gathered every shred of evidence you can from public sources and whatever the police are willing to give you, which isn't much. You feel like you're being stonewalled in every direction you search, as you've never had such resistance from your usual resources before. Whoever the Pietown Killer was, they must have deep connections and an overarching influence that could keep small-time folk from getting too close. You take a shot of whiskey, your drink of choice, and review your options. The latest body was found at The Drink Hole, a dive bar that serves cheap swill and is in a rougher part of town. The police kept you from interrogating the bar owner at the time, but now that they've moved on, perhaps it would be a good time to revisit and get his side of the story. You also had your connections with the authorities, a policewoman named Barbara who owed you a favor, and you might be able to get a bit more information on why you're being stonewalled for information. It was risky as it could get her into trouble too, but time was of the essence if you were going to put a stop to these murders. Whatever decision you made here would be crucial, as there was no telling how much time you had before the Pietown Killer struck again. With that in mind, what do you do? 1. Go down to The Drink Hole, and interrogate the bar owner. 2. Go down to the police station, and get information from your officer friend Barbara about the case."},{"instruction":"Make up a humorous short story about a first date between a man and a woman that went drastically wrong.

I’m on my way to pick her up now and I will be surprising her for dinner at the new Italian restaurant that opened in the city. My palms are sweaty as I grip the steering wheel and my stomach is in knots from excited nervousness. I pull up to her drive, put the car in park, and step out of the car. Clumsily, I hit my head on the door frame, and upon trying to grab the door to steady myself, my sweaty palms caused me to slip and I fell to the ground. Great. I scraped my knees just as this beautiful woman walked out her front door. I’m so embarrassed. She asked me if I was okay, which I was, so we got in the car and headed out. We make small talk on the way and soon we are laughing at the fact that I fell out of the car. We arrived at the restaurant and that’s when disaster number two struck.

I shut the door behind her and started walking towards the restaurant when I realized she wasn’t following. I had accidentally shut the hem of her dress in the car door and she was stuck. Oh my god. I apologized and set her free. She laughed it off, but again, I’m super embarrassed. We make it inside and sit down to eat. We order the lasagna for two and chat over a couple of glasses of wine. Things are going seemingly well despite the rocky start to the evening. And then came disaster number three. As the waiter was carrying our lasagna plates over, he tripped and our entire meal landed on the table in front of us. The spaghetti sauce exploded like a bomb and landed all over me and my date.

Most free Viking women were housewives, and the woman's standing in society was linked to that of her husband. Marriage gave a woman a degree of economic security and social standing encapsulated in the title húsfreyja (lady of the house). Norse laws assert the housewife's authority over the 'indoor household'. She had the important roles of managing the farm's resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing, although some of this would be shared with her husband. After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law. An exception to her independence was the right to choose a husband, as marriages were normally arranged by the family. The groom would pay a bride-price (mundr) to the bride's family, and the bride brought assets into the marriage, as a dowry. A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry. Concubinage was also part of Viking society, whereby a woman could live with a man and have children with him without marrying; such a woman was called a frilla. Usually she would be the mistress of a wealthy and powerful man who also had a wife. The wife had authority over the mistresses if they lived in her household. Through her relationship to a man of higher social standing, a concubine and her family could advance socially; although her position was less secure than that of a wife. There was little distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage: both had the right to inherit property from their parents, and there were no \\"legitimate\\" or \\"illegitimate\\" children. However, children born in wedlock had more inheritance rights than those born out of wedlock. A woman had the right to inherit part of her husband's property upon his death, and widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women. The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man. A woman with no husband, sons or male relatives could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died. Such a woman was referred to as Baugrygr, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her new husband. Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna). They were active within art as poets (skalder) and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women. There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production. Women may also have been active within military office: the tales about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.","output":"- húsfreyj is the Viking term for a lady of the house.

Norse laws gave the húsfreyja authority over the indoor household. Her responsibilities included managing farm resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing. Her husband was expected to share some of the responsibility. - Maer or mey is what an unmarried woman was referred to as. After the age of 20, she had the legal right to decide where she lived and was independent before the law. An exception to this was prearranged marriages which were traditionally orchestrated by her family. - mundr is what is referred to as the \\"bride price\\" which was paid by the groom to the bride's family. The bride brought assets into the marriage. She was allowed to divorce and remarry. - frilla is the name given to a woman who lived with a man without marrying him and had his children in Viking society. Often a frilla would be the mistress of a wealthy man who was already married. The húsfreyja had authority over the frilla when sharing a household. These relationships affected the social standing of the frilla to a positive degree if a man was in higher standing. However, the position of these women was less secure than that of the húsfreyja. Under these circumstances, there were no \\"legitimate\\" or \\"illegitimate\\" children. All of the children had the right to inherit property but those born in wedlock had more inheritance rights. - odalkvinna is the paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter who all had the right to inherit the property of a dead man, as did the húsfreyj. Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women. - Baugrygr is the term used to describe a woman with no husband, sons or male relatives who could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died. She had all of the rights as head of a family clan unless she married. If she did the rights were transferred to her new husband. - gydja is what a priestess was called. These women exercised religious authority. - sejdkvinna is the term for an oracle, a person through whom a deity is believed to speak. - skalder was the name used for a poet. Women were active in the arts as poets, rune masters (a specialist in making runestones), medicine women and merchants. There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production. - shieldmaidens are unconfirmed female warriors from Scandinavian Folklore. - Birka female Viking warrior was a woman buried with the equipment of an elite professional Viking warrior in Birka, Sweden. Although the remains were thought to be of a male warrior since the grave's excavation in 1878, both osteological analysis and a 2017 DNA study proved that the remains were of a female. This suggests that women may also have been active in the military."},{"instruction":"Write a series of two tweets inviting people to a small town's music festival this upcoming Saturday.

I want five suggestions and a brief explanation of how to do each.","output":"Okay, here are some craft ideas for kids using empty tubes of toilet paper: 1. Binoculars - Hold two tubes parallel and tape them together. You can use decorative duct tape with designs like camo, ducks, or mustaches. 2. Didgeridoo - Tape two or more tubes together into one long tube and blow into one end to make sounds. You can watch videos of people playing Didgeridoos in Australia. 3. Animals - Get four plastic forks and cut them in half. Glue the two halves back together at a 90-degree angle so they look like animal legs with the tines of the fork as claws. Then, glue the forks to the tubes like four limbs. Cut shapes out of paper to make animal faces and tape them to one end of the tube. Do the same with tails and put them on the other end. 4. Ring garlands - Cut the tube into rings with a pair of scissors. Put a cut in one ring so you can put it through another ring like links in a chain. Tape or glue the ring shut and continue until you've used all the rings. Cover it with tissue paper or glitter to give it some color. 5. Vases - Cut a circle out of cardboard and tape it so one end of the tube is covered. Then, cover the tube with clippings from magazines or construction paper. Now you can put paper flowers inside (Note that this vase will not hold water)."},{"instruction":"Write me a haiku about health insurance","output":"It's here just in case Protecting of my pockets Health is important"},{"instruction":"Retrieve the rhyming words from the end of each line, and group together comma-separated with a semicolon between each pair.

In the morning, when he awakened and saw that the American flag was still flying after the shelling and rain had stopped, he wrote the poem titled \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", which mentions the Star Spangled Banner and which of course has become our national anthem. 3.

I need potential ideas for sustainable, eco-friendly packaging materials. Can you provide a detailed list of ideas?","output":"Sure! Here are some ideas for eco-friendly, sustainable packaging material: 1. Edible Packaging: Develop packaging material made from edible substances, such as seaweed, starch, or fruit peels. This would eliminate waste and provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional packaging. This idea aligns to reduce waste and offers an innovative solution where packaging can be consumed along with the product, minimizing the effects on the environment. 2. Biodegradable Packaging: Create packaging materials that can easily decompose in natural environments, reducing environmental impact and waste accumulation. Biodegradable materials break down naturally, reducing waste accumulation in landfills and oceans, while promoting a circular economy. 3. Plant-based Plastics: Explore the use of bioplastics derived from renewable resources like corn, sugarcane, or algae. These materials have a lower carbon footprint and can be recycled or composted. Using renewable resources for plastic production decreases reliance on fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. 4. Mushroom Packaging: Investigate the use of mycelium, the vegetative part of mushrooms, as a sustainable packaging material. It is biodegradable, requires fewer resources to produce, and can be molded into various shapes. Mushroom packaging is a biodegradable and sustainable alternative to traditional packaging materials, utilizing agricultural waste as a resource. 5. Minimalist Packaging: Design packaging that minimizes the use of materials and focuses on the essential aspects of product protection. This approach reduces waste and promotes a more sustainable supply chain. By focusing on essential packaging elements, waste is minimized. 6. Reusable Packaging: Develop a system that encourages consumers to return packaging for reuse, similar to how glass milk bottles were collected and refilled in the past. This approach reduces waste and engages consumers in the sustainability process. This option promotes a circular economy and reduces the overall demand for new packaging materials. 7. Smart Packaging: Explore the integration of sensors or indicators on the packaging that can monitor food freshness, temperature, or quality. This would help reduce waste by providing accurate information to consumers. Providing real-time information about quality and freshness helps prevent food waste by enabling informed decisions. 8. Upcycled Packaging: Investigate the use of upcycled materials, such as recycled paper or discarded textiles, to create unique and eco-friendly packaging solutions. Using discarded materials for packaging reduces waste and repurposes resources that would otherwise be sent to landfills."},{"instruction":"What is the fastest breed of dog and how fast can it go?","output":"The Greyhound was bred in the past to hunt large and small game and their breed has been further developed for speed for Greyhound racing.

People feel more paranoid about their health. Can you please brainstorm three solutions for people suffering from paranoia about their physical health? How can they feel more relaxed about their physical state and not trigger a placebo effect to make them think there's something wrong with them?","output":"Here is a list of three ways people can reduce their medical anxiety: 1) Work with a Primary Care Physician. By developing a relationship with a single doctor who can access all of your health records, you are gaining access to someone who can help ease any sense of paranoia you may be experiencing. Not only can they give you answers to possible problems you're having, but they are trained to help you through all sorts of concerns you have regarding your health and they will be able to refer you to a therapist if necessary. It's helpful to disclose that you are experiencing health anxiety so they can work with you on record keeping, tracking the actual state of your health, and avoiding costly and unnecessary screening tests. 2) Live a healthier lifestyle. If you are worried about your physical health, it may help to improve your lifestyle. When your body feels good, your mind does too. Try exercising, eating healthier, and drinking more water. There's also more that goes into a healthier lifestyle, like interaction. Stay active in your community, make new friends, try new hobbies, and go out of your comfort zone. 3) Regularly attend check-ups. Don't miss any check-ups, whether it be for a doctor, dentist, or another specialist. While you're at these check-ups, ask any questions you have about your health and share your concerns with them. They can help you feel better about any medical anxiety you have. 4) Meditate. Meditation is a way to feel your body and appreciate it, even when it doesn't feel perfectly comfortable. By meditating, you are practicing looking deeper within and experiencing what your body is feeling. You'll have a better understanding of your body and what's going on with it through meditation. Meditation is also relaxing and can help ease your feelings of anxiety. Along with that, meditation can help you to understand the signals your body is sending so that you can practice regular and effective self-care rather than rushing to a doctor's office to address every passing ache and pain."},{"instruction":"In fencing, where does a foil need to touch an opponent to score a hit? Please reference the following information. The foil is a light thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams. The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs. The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs. As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). Touches that land outside the target area (called an off-target touch and signaled by a distinct color on the scoring apparatus) stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be awarded to either fencer at the end of a phrase. If both fencers land touches within a close enough interval of milliseconds to register two lights on the machine, the referee uses the rules of \\"right of way\\" to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a valid hit, in which case no touch is awarded. If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.","output":"In order to score, a foil needs to touch the tip of the blade (not the sides) to the opponent's torso excluding arms and legs."},{"instruction":"Write a synopsis for a Southern gothic novel involving a bigamist.","output":"Ellen Deutsch is a vibrant empty nester living in a remote area of a Florida panhandle community.

It is very experimental and the sound is very unconventional. Despite this, it is cited as the most influential album in Rock and Roll history. 2.)

He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious. One day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers. The octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish. A couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared to go near. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid. Without hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks, like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life. He grabbed the little fish, and swam off back to hide in the rocks. Everything happened so fast that the big fish had no time to react. However, he soon recovered from the surprise. Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish. Now he really wanted to gobble them down! Soon, though, he began feeling a terrible itch; first in his gills, and then in his fins, and then all over his body. It turned out that this giant fish had a very artistic nature, he adored colours; and the octopus's dark ink had given him a terrible allergy!! So the big fish swam away, irritated all over. As soon as he was gone, all the fish who had been hiding came and congratulated the octopus for being so brave. Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous. Hearing this, the other fish discovered how nice the shy octopus was, and everyone around was keen to be the friend of such a brave and honourable octopus.","output":"Once upon a time, there was a shy and quiet sea turtle.

What kind of cake are you in this dream? Patient: I'm a vanilla pound cake. I'm a classic cake that families love. Psychiatrist: I see. Okay, describe your dream to me. Patient: Well, there's a woman who makes my batter by beating one cup of room-temperature butter and one cup of sugar together at high speed with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. She then adds four large eggs, one at a time, and beats well after each one. Then the woman adds two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and half a teaspoon of salt.

The story should end just as the battle is about to begin.","output":"Titus awoke to the sound of trumpets blaring throughout the camp. Titus was a soldier in the army of the Roman Republic; he was part of a force assembled to oppose Hannibal of Carthage. Hannibal was an incredibly skilled and intelligent general leading an army comprised of native Carthaginians and foreign soldiers from Spain and Gaul. He had not yet lost a battle in his war with Rome. But Titus had felt encouraged while marching from Rome to the town of Cannae. The force that Rome had assembled was massive. Surely such an overwhelming numerical advantage would bode well for Titus and his countrymen. The trumpets were sounded to rouse the Romans and get them ready for a pitched battle. Titus donned his armor, left his tent with his tentmates, and headed to the road leading out of the Roman camp's gates. Soon, the entire army was assembled. The heavy infantry was positioned in the center of the army with the cavalry on the wings. Across the field, the Carthaginian battalions filed into position. For some time, the two armies gazed at one another across the plains. The sun was rising in the sky, bringing a sweltering heat with it. Sweat dripped down Titus's brow. Finally, the order came for the Romans to advance. Their forces dwarfed the opposition, and there was a great sense of determination amongst the Romans to avenge Hannibal's prior victories against their fellow citizens. Titus was near the front line and was looking forward to proving himself. The skirmishers from each army volleyed stones and javelins at one another, then retreated behind their respective frontlines. The two groups of infantry were very close now; the battle was about to begin."},{"instruction":"Robert ran a seedy alehouse in medieval times, but today is his last day as he retires the alehouse. Write about his last day from start to finish","output":"Robert sighed as he rubbed down the counter at his alehouse. The walls were in worse shape than ever, the floors creaked awfully, and the ale never got any better, but it was his alehouse - and nobody had ever managed to take that away from him. Today was his final day, and instead of a big celebration, all he wanted to do was to run it like any other day, for one last time. His usual pair of thin, cloaked patrons came in first thing in the morning, dropped enough coin for a pair of mugs of ale, and took their mugs to the corner of the alehouse, as they once more muttered quietly between themselves. Then Matthew walked in, but his face was forlorn, and his eyes were bloodshot as if he had been crying. \\"Say it ain't so!\\" exclaimed Matthew, who firmly grasped Robert with both hands. Robert, who was used to Matthew's overly-familiar reactions, let him know that this would be the final day for the alehouse. He had grown much older, and the alehouse was now in terrible condition and would soon end up unsafe for patronage. So he was selling the land to a wealthy baron, who would do whatever he wanted with it. Matthew, who had also grown older with many new scars in the years he'd been coming, started bawling loudly at the counter, so Robert sympathetically left a mug of ale for him. \\"This one's on the house,\\" Robert said, touched that anyone would care so much for this old place, even if it was Matthew. \\"Though I'll be having you pay back the rest of your tab.\\" Slapping himself, Matthew wiped away his tears, pulled himself together, and gave Robert a big, cheeky smile. He assured him that he'd see every penny, as he was being paid today from his latest mercenary job. Robert smiled briefly at him, confident that he was true to his word, and started cleaning mugs once more. Evening came, and as the last customers left and he finished up what he needed to do, he locked the door from the outside and looked at the old building. He'd miss the weathered walls, and the noisy floorboards, but from this point on, it was no longer his alehouse.

The ingredients I already use are dry roasted almonds, peanuts, raisins, chocolate chips, and cashews.","output":"Here are some ingredients you could add to make your trail mix more exciting: *Pistachios: Opt for some that are already shelled for easy snacking on the go. *Different nuts: Pecans, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, chestnuts, or hazelnuts all make for tasty and protein-rich additions. *Blanched almonds: When almonds are boiled and their skins are removed, their texture gets softer and a little buttery, which makes for a refreshing change. *Dried fruits: If you’re bored with raisins, try dried cranberries, cherries, blueberries, apricots, or goji berries, just to name a few options. You can also dice up larger dried fruits like mangoes or pineapples for a fun tropical twist. *Spiced or flavored nuts: Almonds, peanuts, and cashews can be more exciting if they’re coated in interesting flavors such as Chile lime, salt & pepper, wasabi, honey roasted, maple glazed, or cinnamon sugar. *Dehydrated vegetables: Dried peas, green beans, carrot slices, beets, and other root vegetables make a healthy and tasty snack. *S’mores flavor: Add mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, and mini graham crackers to your regular mix. *Cereal or granola: Pick any flavor you prefer, whether it’s a sugary major brand cereal or artisanal granola with organic ingredients. These will add a satisfying, crunchy texture and some carbohydrates, which will help boost your energy on a hike. *Chocolate-covered nuts: You can add chocolate-covered almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, or anything else you can find.

Why isn’t one style best?","output":"The first thing you have to understand is that a positive dihedral (a wing that angles upward from the fuselage) creates roll stability – in other words, it will make the plane less inclined to roll to the left or right. The physics behind this so-called \\"dihedral effect\\" is complicated, but the basics are fairly easy to visualize; a positive dihedral moves the overall center of lift a little higher, placing it closer to – or sometimes above – the aircraft’s total center of mass. Effectively, with enough dihedral effect, the weight is hanging under the force that’s holding it up (as opposed to balancing on top). As you might expect, this sort of stability is often beneficial. You don’t typically want your airliner or cargo plane to flip upside-down, after all. But there are reasons to angle the wing the other way. Oftentimes, when the wing is mounted high, the center of mass is already far below the center of the lift. This can make some roll maneuvers excessively difficult. A negative dihedral angle (often called an anhedral) can reduce this roll resistance to more reasonable levels. Many military cargo aircraft, like the An-124 and C-5, are designed this way. Some planes are built with a dihedral angle that intentionally reduces their roll stability. Though it sounds counterintuitive, fighter aircraft are most maneuverable if they are at least slightly aerodynamically unstable. The proper dihedral angle can help them hit the right balance between stability and instability."},{"instruction":"Classify the following as negative or positive: \\"Sarah is an inspiration\\".","output":"The statement is positive."},{"instruction":"Who invented Apple?","output":"Here's the tea babe.

Here is the information: Retinoid: The term \\"retinoid\\" is a catch-all for an array of vitamin A-based products used on skin. It can treat mild fine lines and wrinkles, acne, and dark spots. It can also improve skin texture. If you’re looking to treat uneven skin tone, dark spots, or your skin’s texture, look for the word “retinol.” It’s a type of retinoid that’s used for these purposes. Retinol can give you younger-looking skin by speeding up new skin cell turnover, which starts to slow in your 20s. To treat acne, dermatologists prescribe one of these retinoids – adapalene, tazarotene, tretinoin, or trifarotene. You’ll also find adapalene in an acne-fighting product available without a prescription. When spread on acne-prone skin, a retinoid can unclog pores. This can give you clearer skin and allow other acne gels and creams to work better. When to apply a retinoid: Dr. Baxt recommends applying a retinoid before bed. After washing your face, wait 20 to 30 minutes and then apply it. If you find the retinoid too drying, apply a moisturizer immediately after washing your face, using a moisturizer that won’t clog your pores. Then apply the retinoid 20 to 30 minutes later.","output":"Retinoids are vitamin A-based products.

They used this system to save fuel that is used for electricity for the war. The United States followed, adopting this policy in 1918. The government created a bill that shifted the time by one hour, which only lasted for seven months. Daylight Savings Time made a return during World War 2, and was referred to as \\"War Time\\". Daylight Savings Time, as we know it today, started in 1966 with the passing of the Uniform Time Act.

A pre-internet software engineering firm. Boom! went our stocks. Father tsked his tongue and muttered things like House of Cards and Icarus. But I was pigheaded and grew the company fast and furiously. I secured bank loans, spoke at California conferences with Steve Jobs, and got a sprawling cherry desk with a view of Boston's harbor. Then a cold wind blew in, huffed and puffed, and kaboom! went our stocks. The next house I built was in 1999, a bonafide urban walk-up love nest. Stan and I moved in together within three months of meeting. Mother tsked her tongue and called it a house of fire. But I was pigheaded and didn't listen - and Stan was hot. Neighbors carrying groceries smiled at me in the stairwell. We drank wine and played chess at night and made love till dawn. Then a cold northerly blew in. Her name was Ilse. She huffed and puffed till he moved out. I licked my wounds and didn't call my mother for a month. Then I built my third house. Both parents tsked their tongues but said little. It's smaller than the others - more modest than the first, more secure than the second. And it can stand up to the wind.

Items you'll want to use for decorating include a cake scraper, an icing spatula, a cake disk, and a piping bag. 2. Freeze your cake for 15 minutes after assembling and applying the first thin layer of frosting, the crumb coat. The crumb coat holds your cake together, so if you see cake layers mixing into the buttercream, you need to freeze your cake for a few more minutes to allow the crumb coat to set. 3. Use your cake scrapper at a 45-degree angle to create lovely smooth edges for your cake. Using your scrapper at this angle will let you be almost eye level with your cake to see what is happening as you smooth it out closely. 4. Make clean-cut edges on your cake using an acrylic cake disk when applying your buttercream. An acrylic cake disk will help you make the flat cake top and straight edges you want on your cake. 5. When piping your cake, keep it from the edge of the cake. Instead, you'll want to decorate the cake by holding the piping bag slightly toward the middle to ensure that the frosting doesn't fall off the edge of the cake."},{"instruction":"Write a numbered list of 7 quick costumes that I could incorporate into the “Week of Halloween” costume contests at work this year.

In addition to erosion and damage caused at the base of the tree, there are secondary issues that come from an influx of people. “There was trash, and people were creating even more side trails to use the bathroom. They leave used toilet paper and human waste – it’s not a good thing,” Arguello said.","output":"Tourists cannot visit Hyperion for the following three reasons: 1.

I draw a bit wider to the sidewalk before my front step. I watch the space. I wait. Footsteps in. Another. Out. Shoes with mud on them. Worn shoes. Working shoes. When will I go back to work? My stronghold quakes. I take a breath and look up. A face flits through. Laughing on the phone. When will I make friends again? My stronghold cracks. Leans. I draw the circle close to me.

I'm glad they're enjoying the nice day. My castle flings open its shutters. I draw the circle a little further. My neighbors, who I've never invited over, still smile at me.

This is my second pair. Hard time Connecting. Then constantly disconnecting. Case never charges. Save your money!!! 4. I’ve always heard great things about this brand, but after using this tonight I don’t think I will ever try them again. The product would not lather at all. Didn’t feel like it cleaned anything. I don’t use any products but shampoo on my hair. It just gets oily quickly. The scent was so strong that I used my regular shampoo and washed it twice to try to get rid of the smell and actually clean my hair. I do not recommend because it didn’t clean, was too strongly scented and overpriced. Definitely taking it back. 5. I’ve had my series s for a little over a year at this point and have been loving it! It plays games really well and I haven’t had many problems with it. I would absolutely suggest getting an external hard drive because you only have a little over 300 gb when it’s fully set up.

I have two vintage items for sale, an analog alarm clock with radio and a 29” tube television. The clock radio is by Realistic, a Radio Shack brand. I think it was from around 1985 or so. It is in excellent condition and still works well after nearly 40 years. The volume control has a touch of static on it, but that’s to be expected after so long. The AM/FM radio works well, and the manual tuning dial is good for getting harder-to-reach stations. If you are an AM radio fan, you know that these are being made less and less every year, so if you’ve been looking, this might be your find. The alarm clock is analog with flip-style numbers and keeps time as well as it ever did. Alarm tones and radio functions work as wake-up settings, and the snooze button works. Asking for 50 or best offer. The television is a 29” Magnavox from the late 1990s. I don’t have the original remote, but I do have a programmable one that works just fine. The big draw of these old tube TVs is for vintage video game consoles. There is a certain look to the games that can only be achieved on these kinds of sets, and have been a big hit with retro gaming fans. Zero input lag, great colors, and RCA audio outputs on the back for hooking into a modern sound system. It’s only about 40 pounds, but it is bulky, so make sure it will fit in your vehicle.

Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body. They also help control muscle and nerve activity, heart rhythm, and other important functions. An electrolyte panel, also known as a serum electrolyte test, is a blood test that measures levels of the body's main electrolytes: Sodium, which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure. Potassium, which helps your heart and muscles work properly. Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance. It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream. Abnormal levels of any of these electrolytes can be a sign of a serious health problem, including kidney disease, high blood pressure, and a life-threatening irregularity in heart rhythm.

A little-understood backlash against higher education is driving an unprecedented decline in enrollment that experts now warn is likely to diminish people’s quality of life and the nation’s economic competitiveness, especially in places where the slide is most severe. “With the exception of wartime, the United States has never been through a period of declining educational attainment like this,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University’s Miller College of Business. There are 4 million fewer students in college now than there were 10 years ago, a falloff many observers blame on Covid-19, a dip in the number of Americans under 18 and a strong labor market that is sucking young people straight into the workforce. But while the pandemic certainly made things worse, the downturn took hold well before it started. Demographics alone cannot explain the scale of this drop. And statistics belie the argument that recent high school graduates are getting jobs instead of going to college: Workforce participation for 16- to 24-year-olds is lower than it was before Covid hit, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reports. Focus groups and public opinion surveys point to other, less easily solved reasons for the sharp downward trend. These include widespread and fast-growing skepticism about the value of a degree, impatience with the time it takes to get one, and costs that have finally exceeded many people’s ability or willingness to pay. There has been a significant and steady drop nationwide in the proportion of high school graduates enrolling in college in the fall after they finish school — from a high of 70% in 2016 to 63% in 2020, the most recent year for which the figure is available, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The decline is even worse in some states, though not all have data for the same periods of time. The proportion of high school graduates in Tennessee who are going directly to college, for example, has fallen to 53% — down 11 percentage points since 2017. In Indiana, it dropped to 53% in 2020, down 12 percentage points from five years earlier and a pace state Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery has called “alarming.” Americans are increasingly dubious about the need to go to college. Fewer than 1 in 3 adults now say a degree is worth the cost, according to a survey by the nonprofit Strada Education Network, which conducts research into and financially supports ways of expanding access to higher education. Meanwhile, months of discussion about whether the Biden administration will forgive all or some student loan debt has had the unintended consequence of reminding prospective learners how much people before them had to borrow to pay for college. So has the fact that many of their parents are still paying back their own student loans. From 2015 to 2019, Americans’ faith in higher education dropped more than their confidence in any other institution measured by the Gallup polling organization — an extraordinary erosion of trust, considering that this list includes the presidency, Congress, big business and the criminal justice system. “There’s anti-elitism, anti-institutionalism, a perception that cost is out of control,” said Stephanie Marken, a partner in Gallup’s education division. The problems have been evident for years, but colleges and universities in general have done little to address them. They continue to advertise prices that few consumers actually pay but that discourage many from applying. They bury students in red tape, which is especially confounding for the increasing number of would-be applicants whose parents never went to college. And they often fail to make clear connections between academic disciplines and careers or keep up with the demands of the fast-moving labor market. A degree does, in fact, still pay off. Workers with bachelor’s degrees earn 67% more than people with only high school diplomas, according to the BLS. More than half of “good jobs” — those with salaries of at least 35,000 for workers under age 45 and 45,000 for people 45 to 64 — call for bachelor’s degrees, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce estimates. Yet since the start of the pandemic, the proportion of 14- to 18-year-olds who think education is necessary beyond high school has dropped from 60% to 45%, the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation. The pandemic only deepened the fears of students already struggling with self-confidence and skeptical about college, said Thea Cole, who also counsels students for Advise TN. “Their GPAs have suffered. So some of them are, ‘I don’t know if I can get in,’ or, ‘It will be too hard.’ ” Her colleague, Portia Cook, was more blunt: “My kids have a shorter fuse. When things start getting complicated, they’re done.” It’s not only recent high school graduates who are turning their backs on higher education. The number of Americans over 24 who are going for the first time or returning to college has also steadily declined, by 12% in the five years from the spring of 2017 to the just-ended spring semester. The United States has already fallen from second to 16th since 2000 among developed nations in the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with bachelor’s degrees. Countries ahead of it have increased their bachelor’s degree attainment during that time by an average of 177%, an analysis by an institute at the University of Pennsylvania found. Even before the pandemic, the nation was facing a shortage of more than 9 million college-educated workers over the next decade, affecting nearly every state and costing nearly 1.2 trillion in lost economic output, the center-right American Action Forum estimated. Economic rivals “could wish nothing better but to see the share of [American] adults who go to college drop by 12 percentage points,” Hicks said. “It is literally cataclysmic.”","output":"Even as I embark on this journey of college, I can tell you I'm nervous. I've read all about the decline of high school graduates going to college. No one wants their parents or themselves to spend all that time and money. I had no idea why there was so much news about this topic. I got down to business and started researching. After all, I'm about to go on this journey and I want to know what I'm getting myself into. First, the economy stinks. The U.S. economy has been on a downward slope for some time. What does that mean? While scouring the internet, I found some information from the Director of the Center for Business and Economic Research and Ball State University. Michael Hicks stated, \\"With the exception of wartime, the United States has never been through a period of declining attainment like this.\\" What does this mean? I'm not sure, so I had to dig some more. Currently, there are 4 million fewer students in college than a decade ago. Of course, Covid-19 hurt these numbers. More young people went into the workforce, instead of going to college. That concept does not agree with me. I wanted a gap year off before college but not one that involved working. Even before the pandemic, college applications started declining. We can't blame the pandemic for everything. Different focus groups and surveys showed that people were skeptical that the college degree would prove results that some were willing to pay for. Statistics show that one in three don't think the degree is worth the amount of money shelled out. Think about it. When my parents went to college, the cost was less than 30,000 in some states. Now, my college education will cost closer to 50,000 with loans that will haunt me until the day I die. The conversations about worth keep coming up time and again with my friends and their parents. When my parents went to school, everyone went to college. If you didn't go to college, you were considered a bum. Not anymore. Now parents seemed relieved if their child opts out of college. Student loans. Don't get my father started. He has been paying off his loans for the past 20 years. It seems like he will always be paying. While my parents wait to find out if the government will forgive student debt, they pay every month like clockwork. This does not appeal to me in the least. Imagine if you bought a car, but never paid it off, no matter how many years passed. Why would you want to pay off a car for 20 years? College is no different. People who don't even graduate from college still have to pay off student loans. That is a real insult. Do you think the universities are addressing this issue? Nope. Having a degree is indeed necessary in some industries. It is also true that college grads tend to make more. However, the attitude about college being necessary has dropped from 60% to 45% according to the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation. Even the ones who are already committed to college are doubting the decision."},{"instruction":"Show me how to import my threading.csv to Python, then plot the \\"threads\\" and \\"data\\" columns as a linear regression up to 1000 with test size of 10% a scatterplot and a line with matplotlib.","output":"We'll need to use MatPlotLib, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Pandas DataFrames for that. # Import the modules from sklearn import datasets, linear_model import matplotlib import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Load the CSV file df = pd.read_csv(\\"threading.csv\\") # Define the x and y values y = df[\\"threads\\"] x = df[\\"data\\"] x = x.reshape(len(x),1) y = y.reshape(len(y),1) # Split the data into training and testing data x_train = x[:-100] x_test = x[-100:] y_train = y[:-100] y_test = y[-100:] # Plot the data plt.scatter(x_test, y_test) plt.xlabel(\\"Threads\\") plt.ylabel(\\"Data\\") plt.xticks(()) plt.yticks(()) # Train the model and create the regression line regr = linear_model.LinearRegression() regr.fit(X_train, Y_train) plt.plot(X_test, regr.predict(X_test)) # Show the plot plt.show() The code above first imports the \`sklearn\`, \`matplotlib\`, and \`pandas\` modules.

He was truly a vile person, but the animals got the worst treatment. He starved them, chained them in tiny cages, and beat them daily to keep them submissive and afraid. Even the lions and tigers cowered when he approached. While he was putting on a show, spectators thought he was a great ringleader, and they really enjoyed the circus acts, but they didn't see what happened when the lights went out and the crowds dispersed. One day, an older, mysterious woman stayed behind. She saw beyond the forced smiling faces and saw how all the animals cowered in fear when he was around or when they heard his booming voice. She knew there was something wrong with this circus, and she aimed to find out what it was. As she quietly snuck around the tents, she heard the ringleader screaming at his employees. Her suspicions were founded, and she continued to watch and listen. When she saw him kick a skinny, starved dog chained outside his tent, she knew she had to take action. She wasn't going to report him to authorities, though; she had another plan. She knew dark magic. The way to teach this horrible man a lesson is to turn him into what he despises the most. The old woman waited until he went to bed, then she started her chant. She watched as a dark mist entered his tent. It glowed briefly to let her know the magic was successful. When the ringleader woke up the next morning, he found he was chained to a post outside. He was cold, tired, and hungry, and when he tried to speak, there were no words. Only barks, whines, and whimpers exited his throat. The ringleader had been turned into a dog and now would live the rest of his life as a poor, mistreated animal."},{"instruction":"Hello. I would like you to extract the following information about the three women in computer science: name, education, employment, contributions and awards. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller Born in 1913 in Ohio, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller joined the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1932. Keller became the first woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D. in computer science in 1965, after previously earning degrees in math and physics from DePaul University. She also completed graduate work at other universities, including at Dartmouth College's computer lab, which typically excluded women at that time. While at Dartmouth, Keller helped develop the BASIC programming language, which made coding more accessible to people in fields beyond math and science. After graduating with her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin Madison, she founded the department of computer science at Clark University in Iowa and remained there for about 18 years. Keller worked to attract more women to the computer science field and invited students to bring their children to class. Margaret Hamilton Margaret Hamilton played a key role in helping astronauts land on the moon. Creator of the term \\"software engineer,\\" Hamilton was one of the first computer software programmers. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Earlham College in 1958. After graduating, she got a job at MIT to help support her family while her husband attended law school. While there, she taught herself programming and created software to aid in predictive meteorology. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she wrote code for the onboard software that made Apollo missions to the moon possible. She was the first computer programmer and woman that NASA hired to work on the Apollo project. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 from President Barack Obama to acknowledge her role in the Apollo moon missions. LEGO immortalized her and a few other NASA women by creating figurines of their likenesses in 2017. Adele Goldberg Born in 1945 in Ohio, Adele Goldberg liked math from an early age. She earned a bachelor's degree in math from the University of Michigan and worked at IBM in the summer between her junior and senior years. While at IBM, Goldberg taught herself to program unit record machines and began considering a career in computing. In 1973, she completed a Ph.D. in information science from the University of Chicago. After graduating, she started working at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, where she helped develop Smalltalk, an object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk was one of the first programming languages that could create graphic user interfaces like menus, icons, and windows. Goldberg co-founded ParcPlace Systems and later created a consultancy group. From 1984-1986, she served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 1990, Goldberg won a lifetime achievement award from PC Magazine.","output":"1. Name Adele Goldberg Margaret Hamilton Sister Mary Kenneth Keller 2.

It was a learning management system, built to revolutionise how tech companies managed to create a learning culture. The entire idea came to Ilie while trying to find a good tool to use within Thinslices to help organise learning, which is a core value at Thinslices, throughout the company. Browsing through an already crowded market of over 2000 LMSs, we couldn’t find a tool with the desired functionalities, the modern look and in the right price range. So, the natural question for a serial entrepreneur came up: why not build one ourselves? And we did. Moreover, if we, a software development company, had a real need for a modern, swift LMS, it made sense to think that other tech companies needed it as well. Soon after, a small team formed around Teamfluent, covering all departments: software development, sales, marketing, customer success, finance & admin. The sales discussions were great, people liked our MVP, our functionalities roadmap and our business model. But it’s a long and winding road from discussions to actual contracts. Moreover, the clients we were discussing with were already using learning management systems inside their companies. So, although they liked our product, putting into balance the effort it would have taken to switch to a new tool - however better the new one might be - and the difficulty to gain wide adoption among colleagues, the math simply didn’t add up. After 2 years of enthusiastic and hard work, with numerous tech customers, we decided to end Teamfluent’s journey, not without important learnings.","output":"Teamfluent was found in 2016 while examining different tools in Thinslices to revolutionize the learning systems for tech companies. It was quite challenging to find a useful tool due to the oversaturated market and specific requirements for our idea, so we just decided to build it ourselves. We reflected on the high demand for an effective LMS and formed a small team called Teamfluent to bring this system to life. Initially, many people were intrigued by our visions, blueprints, and business plans, but persuading them to join us and form contracts wasn't as easy. Most of our clients were already accustomed to powerful LMS, but even though they admired our efforts and ideas, they couldn't see it as a widely-used tool. Thus, after 2 years of consulting tech-customers, Teamfluent realized its weaknesses and came to an end."},{"instruction":"Write an exactly 170-word blog post in the form of a list about 4 benefits of asparagus, starting every sentence with the word \\"The\\".","output":"The benefits of asparagus are numerous, and it provides a lot of the nutrients you need to live a healthier life. 1. The first benefit is that it is low in calories and high in vitamins! The asparagus plant is a fantastic source of vitamin K, folate, vitamin A, and many others. 2. The second benefit is that asparagus is packed full of antioxidants. The compounds called antioxidants help protect your body's cells from the harmful effects of free radicals and oxidative stress. 3. The third benefit is that this vegetable can improve your digestive health. The fiber content in just half a cup of asparagus is 1.8 grams, which is 7% of your daily needs and helps support regular bowel movements. 4. The fourth benefit of asparagus is that it can help support a healthy pregnancy. The asparagus plant is high in folate, otherwise known as vitamin B9.

He looked out the window and saw the light in his treehouse was on. When he climbed up the ladder to turn the light off, he noticed something huddled in the corner. It was a little fuzzy creature he had never seen before, like a small bear with rabbit ears. He carefully walked towards it and scooped it up. The creature was initially frightened but seemed to warm up to Alan quickly. The boy tried to talk to him to see if he could understand, but the creature just made purring noises. Alan knew he had to help save him. He looked around to see where he came from and there was a hole in the backyard. Alan looked in the hole and he found a little spaceship, broken. Alan went back and told the creature he would help repair the spaceship. The creature purred in happiness. A couple of days went by, and they worked in the spaceship together. In their spare time, they watched movies, listened to music together, and even found some human food the creature liked. After working hard in the spaceship, they got it to finally work. The creature was able to return home, and, even across the galaxy, the two were strong friends. The creature never forgot what Alan did for him, and, every once in a while, the creature would return to visit Earth. They watch movies, listen to music and eat the creature's favorite food: a rare Earth delicacy known as Cheeto Puffs."},{"instruction":"Is the following news report about love, conflict, or religion? Please explain your reasoning. Serbian troops on the border with Kosovo were put on high alert Friday following clashes inside Kosovo between police and ethnic Serbs that injured more than a dozen people. Ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo, who are a majority in that part of the country, had tried to block recently-elected ethnic Albanian officials from entering municipal buildings earlier Friday. Last month’s snap election was largely boycotted by ethnic Serbs and only ethnic Albanian or other smaller minority representatives were elected in the mayoral posts and assemblies. Kosovo police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd and let the new officials into the offices. Several cars were set ablaze. Kosovo Serb hospital officials said about 10 protesters were injured. Police said five officers were injured as protesters hurled stun grenades and other objects. A police car was burned. In response to the clashes, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he put the army on the “highest state of alert” and ordered an “urgent” movement of troops closer to the border. He also demanded that NATO-led troops stationed in Kosovo protect ethnic Serbs from the police.","output":"The news report is about a conflict.

However, while this is a great way to live to obtain pleasure, this path will ultimately lead to pain. In the pursuit of the greatest happiness, or the greatest pleasure, people inevitably try to gain more happiness and more pleasure until they become numb to it and have to go to further extremes to obtain it. For instance, people who enjoy the taste of food may end up on a path to obesity if their pursuit of happiness through food leads them to excess intake. People who look for physical pleasure in the form of sex may become lustful in their search for more pleasure, and they may also begin to entertain more perverse and twisted sexual fantasies. Still, others may be adrenaline junkies who love the thrills of bungee jumping, skydiving, or traveling fast in a car, but as they attempt to push themselves to find bigger and better thrills, they ultimately put themselves in dangerous and deadly situations that could end their lives. In contrast to utilitarianism, living a healthy life and avoiding excesses is a better way to live a happier, more fulfilling life. There may still be some discomfort or pain in the pursuit of a healthy life (i.e. dieting, exercising, demonstrating discipline), but these short-term discomforts pale in comparison to the long-term benefits of living longer and being healthier. One would argue that those who practice a lifestyle of moderation - like those who travel the \\"middle road\\" of Taoism - end up going with the flow of life, careful to balance in the middle of its scales rather than leaning to one side and tipping those scales in one direction."},{"instruction":"According to this text, what year did British Alpine goats become a breed and what countries have Alpine goats been introduced in? In 1903, Alpine goats brought from Switzerland were crossed with domestic goats to create the British Alpine breed. In 1958, the first British Alpines were transported to Australia, although there weren’t many due to quarantine rules. The ancestors of modern goats came from the group Aegodontia, which includes all bovids outside of the subfamily Bovinae. In general, the behavior of modern bovids varies greatly, with some being solitary and others traveling in groups. The alpine goat became well established in the US in the early 1900s by breeding goats. Thus, Rock Alpine goats were bred for further development. Via Frenchman Joseph Crepin, Alpines, including Saanens and Toggs, were imported into Canada in 1904.","output":"British Alpine goats were first bred in 1903 when Alpine goats were brought from Switzerland to England.

Then he went down a bank to the frozen path of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek and he knew he was ten miles from where the stream divided. He looked at his watch. It was ten o’clock. He was traveling at the rate of four miles an hour. Thus, he figured that he would arrive where the stream divided at half-past twelve. He decided he would eat his lunch when he arrived there. The dog followed again at his heels, with its tail hanging low, as the man started to walk along the frozen stream. The old sled trail could be seen, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last sleds. In a month no man had traveled up or down that silent creek. The man went steadily ahead. He was not much of a thinker. At that moment he had nothing to think about except that he would eat lunch at the stream’s divide and that at six o’clock he would be in camp with the boys. There was nobody to talk to; and, had there been, speech would not have been possible because of the ice around his mouth. Once in a while the thought repeated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his face and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this without thinking, frequently changing hands. But, with all his rubbing, the instant he stopped, his face and nose became numb. His face would surely be frozen. He knew that and he was sorry that he had not worn the sort of nose guard Bud wore when it was cold. Such a guard passed across the nose and covered the entire face. But it did not matter much, he decided. What was a little frost? A bit painful, that was all. It was never serious. Empty as the man’s mind was of thoughts, he was most observant. He noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and the bends. And always he noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around a bend, he moved suddenly to the side, like a frightened horse. He curved away from the place where he had been walking and retraced his steps several feet along the trail. He knew the creek was frozen to the bottom. No creek could contain water in that winter. But he knew also that there were streams of water that came out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top of the ice of the creek. He knew that even in the coldest weather these streams were never frozen, and he also knew their danger. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there was both water and thin ice, and when a man broke through he could get very wet. That was why he had jumped away so suddenly. He had felt the ice move under his feet. He had also heard the noise of the snow-covered ice skin breaking. And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, because he would be forced to stop and build a fire. Only under its protection could he bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins. He stood and studied the creek bottom and its banks. He decided that the flowing stream of water came from the right side. He thought a while, rubbing his nose and face. Then he walked to the left. He stepped carefully and tested the ice at each step. Once away from the danger, he continued at his four-mile pace.","output":"Through the forest, he trekked a while, Down a bank, on a frozen stream, with a smile. Henderson Creek, ten miles he knew, His watch read ten, his pace steady and true. Four miles an hour, his travel speed, At half-past twelve, the divide he'd heed. Lunch awaited at the stream's embrace, No thoughts to ponder, a peaceful space. The dog trailed behind, tail hanging low, Along the frozen stream, they continued to go. Sled tracks concealed beneath snow's deep cover, No man had passed, no sound did hover. He pressed onward, not much of a thinker, With lunch and camp as his mind's only blinker. Silence surrounded, no words to be spoken, Frozen ice prevented his voice from being awoken. The cold persisted, a thought would arise, Unfamiliar chills, an icy surprise. His mittened hand against his face he pressed, Yet, numbness followed, freezing each crest. His face would freeze, he was well aware, Regretting the nose guard he didn't wear. But it mattered little, frost was a mere pain, Not a grave concern, just a temporary strain. Thoughts absent, observant he remained, Noting creek changes, each curve, each bend. Mindful of his steps, where his feet would tread, A sudden shift, avoiding a hidden thread. He veered away from the treacherous sight, Retraced his path, cautious and contrite. Frozen was the creek, down to its core, But hidden streams lurked, water's silent roar. Underneath snow and ice, they slyly flowed, Pools concealed, a danger unbeknownst. Thin layers of ice sometimes deceived, A man's misstep, a chance to be relieved. That's why he leapt, avoiding the break, Ice shifting beneath, the noise awake. For wet feet in such cold spelled trouble and woe, Delay or danger, he didn't wish to bestow. He gazed at the creek, studied its terrain, Water flowed from the right, he could ascertain. After thought and reflection, he made his choice, To the left he ventured, heeding ice's voice. Careful steps, testing the frozen ground, Away from peril, onward he bound. At his steady pace, four miles he'd stride, A lone traveler, in nature's embrace, he'd abide."},{"instruction":"Could you provide me with three helpful practices to help me regain control of my finances?","output":"Here are some ideas I have for you to get back on top of your finance: 1. Budgeting - this is extremely helpful in gaining an idea of your income and where you're money is going. It will also help you lay out any short or long-term goals you would have regarding your finances. A good rule to follow when it comes the budgeting is known as the 50/30/20 rule. What this means is you should allocate 50% of your after-tax income to expenses you consider essential, then you would want to allocate 30% to the things you want such as amenities in the last 20% should go towards your savings. 2. Financial safety net - this practice will allow you to have money set aside for emergencies. Doing this will allow you to not rely on using a credit card for paying for major unexpected expenses. It's common practice to save about three to six months of your current living expenses to build that emergency fund. 3. Paying existing debts - existing debt can be a major contributing factor to the drain on your finances especially when faced with high interest rates. It's a good idea to make a plan to know how long realistically it would take you to pay off any loans or debt you may have. Cards that have the highest interest rates are the ones you're going to want to prioritize making extra payments on. You'll want to make sure you're only charging what you're capable of paying each month."},{"instruction":"Write the introduction to a short story about a woman who gains powers.

A team of volunteers supported the ambitious expedition by regularly dropping off food, fresh clothes, and water near the cave's entrance. They also used the daily video recordings to monitor Flamini's physical and mental condition. About 300 days into the challenge, Flamini was forced to leave the cave due to a technical issue. She spent eight days in a tent in complete isolation before returning to resume her quest. Flamini spent her days exercising, preparing meals, reading, knitting, and drawing.

There are a number of multiplayer games that work with Chromecast designed specifically to take advantage of the big screen for party gaming. DrawParty and PictoParty are digital takes on the classic party game Pictionary. Puzzle Cast allows you to put together a jigsaw puzzle without all the mess and missing pieces. If you’re partial to word games, Wordcast is a big-screen multiplayer equivalent of the classic Scrabble.

These clauses typically set boundaries for the performers that prevent them from being forced to perform in the nude, whether this is requested fully or partially. Sometimes, when this clause is in place, a body double will take the place of the actor, and the nude portions of the body double will be shown as if they belonged to the actor or actress.

Talk specifically about whether to replace rain gutters or not. Give some pros and cons of repairing instead of replacing an item.","output":"One valuable tip for homeowners is to decide if it’s cheaper to just replace an item than repair it. Rain gutters are a good example. Each spring, it’s important to get your ladder out of the garage and climb up to check out your rain gutters. Over the winter, they can become full of leaves, and they should be thoroughly cleaned out before the first hard rain of spring. If the gutters are over 10 years old and showing signs of wear, it might be time to replace them. This is usually a judgment call. It might be possible to clean them out, tighten the brackets and use them one more year. Today, you’ll find products that claim they never need cleaning. Check these out if you’re one of those people who hate gutter cleaning. Some of the vinyl brands now offer a lifetime warranty and never need to be painted. Though products like this often cost more initially, they save you money down the road. Of course, if you are simply making a few repairs before selling your home, it’s best not to plunk down thousands of dollars for the very best flooring, gutters, etc. If you and your family know that you are going to be staying in the house for at least five more years, then it might be worthwhile to buy a better-grade product."},{"instruction":"I want to plant vegetables in my garden but it's autumn now. What can I plant so it will still grow well? I don't like parsnips or broad beans.","output":"Growing your own vegetables is a great idea and there are several varieties that won't mind cold weather in winter: 1. Brassicas: Cabbage, bok choy, cauliflower, and broccoli are all great options for winter gardening. Not only do they like cooler temperatures, but they tend to bolt in warm weather so it's better to plant them in autumn. 2. Leafy Greens: Spinach, kale, lettuce, and Swiss chard are very hardy vegetables that thrive in cold weather. Plant seeds in early autumn or get seedlings later and you will have fresh vegetables in your garden for most of the winter months. 3. Root Vegetables: Radishes, carrots, beetroot, and turnips are all vegetables harvested for their roots, which are very well protected underground. Unless your region gets a lot of snow, these vegetables are a great choice for winter gardening. 4. Peas: Snow peas are a wonderful variety that can be grown outside in most weather conditions. Just make sure to sow them in early autumn so they can grow to establish healthy roots before the frosts start. 5. Garlic is one of those vegetables that can't be grown at any time of year--winter is the only chance you get. Plant the cloves in autumn and watch them grow throughout the winter months. If you have a greenhouse or solarium, you have even more options with vegetables like tomatoes and peppers thriving well into the winter months.

For example, a tree in a humid environment will need less water than a dry environment and in the summer trees need more water than they do in the winter due to heat and sun. A good rule of thumb is to water the tree when the soil becomes dry in the top 1-2 inches of the soil. To test how often to water in any given season, water the tree thoroughly and check it daily by poking your finger into the soil to test for dryness. Once dry, water again. You may find that in hot summer months, you need to water your tree 2-3 a week, while in the winter, watering may be required much less frequently. Pay attention to your tree and monitor it for signs of over or under-watering. If you notice yellowing or spotted leaves these may be symptoms of poor health.

Use information only from the following part of the article: What Is Big Data? Big data refers to the large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates. It encompasses the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered (known as the \\"three v's\\" of big data). Big data often comes from data mining and arrives in multiple formats. How Big Data Works Big data can be categorized as unstructured or structured. Structured data consists of information already managed by the organization in databases and spreadsheets; it is frequently numeric in nature. Unstructured data is information that is unorganized and does not fall into a predetermined model or format. It includes data gathered from social media sources, which help institutions gather information on customer needs. Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins. The presence of sensors and other inputs in smart devices allows for data to be gathered across a broad spectrum of situations and circumstances. Big data is most often stored in computer databases and is analyzed using software specifically designed to handle large, complex data sets. Many software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies specialize in managing this type of complex data.","output":"Big data refers to massive, rapidly growing sets of diverse information from multiple sources.

Today, Ryoto Matsuzawa says there are 1,250 farms left, most of which are under one hectare in size. “We want to preserve those at all costs.” The city recently made a crucial decision to do so. Eighty percent of the farms protected under the Law on Productive Green Areas were registered the year that law was enacted, in 1992. The law stipulates that after 30 years, the landowners can ask the city to buy their land at market price. But most cities, strapped for cash, can’t afford to. If they don’t, the land loses its tax subsidy and can be sold for commercial development.

We here at Project: Sword and Shield are thrilled to give you this new update for the game and to let you know about what we have in store for the future. First of all, as you know, we have reached the beta testing phase of development for Project: Sword and Shield. This means anyone who has contributed to our crowd-funding campaign will be sent a code within the next 48 hours of this email, which will allow you to log into the game and play the campaign in its current form. We want to get enough of you to play the game to stress-test our servers for the upcoming multiplayer campaign expected to be released in two months and to also give you the chance to check out the work we've been doing and what you have paid to support. Secondly, we'd like to provide a roadmap and timeline for the completion of the game and its subsequent roll-out to you, the supporters, and those players who purchase the game when it is released soon after. Our current outlook on the release of the game looks to be on time, with the original intended release date (August 1, 2023) being the target date for release to you, the supporters. On September 1, 2023, the game is anticipated to be ready for wide release to the public. We are releasing the game to supporters before doing a wide release to everyone to show our appreciation to you (the supporters) by giving you a chance to experience the game before anyone else and to get a head start on creating and leveling up your characters. In addition, we will be giving all campaign supporters several in-game items for free which will not be available to the public, just as another token of our appreciation. Another reason we will be providing early access to supporters is to make sure the completed game (including multiplayer) works perfectly before we do the wide release on September 1. This gives you an entire month of playing the game and offering any tips or suggestions, or pointing out any bugs that might exist. That's all for now. Thank you all for your support!"},{"instruction":"What are some ways I can eliminate trash being littered in my community? I don't want to tackle this issue alone so the proposed ideas shouldn't be solo solutions I have to do by myself. FYI, I live in a condo community, within a suburban metropolitan region.","output":"Trash littered within a community is unpleasant and can be hard to prevent if the culprits are unknown. Here are some ways to prevent trash from being littered in your community. 1) Engage the HOA HOA groups often create and enforce policies for the residential communities they manage. Most likely, you are not the only resident observing the trash being littered around your neighborhood and there is a high chance that other neighbors share the discontent. If your townhouse community has an HOA, bringing this issue to their attention at the next HOA meeting may be a good way to start. With enough support from other residents and approval from the HOA board, guidelines can be set restricting any trash to be littered. HOA often also have the power, written into the contractual agreements signed by residents before move-in, to enforce rules they set. Penalties for residents refusing to comply with rules may range from thousands of dollars in fees to eviction. If new HOA rules making improper disposal of trash can be set, then residents will have to eventually comply, assuming the root cause is from within the community. HOAs may even help lead preventative strategies attempting to proactively address the problem. Some strategies include the installation of waste baskets for general use, increasing the frequency of waste management services, installing street signs, and/or employing third-party street cleaning services. 2) Establish a Neighborhood Watch Group A neighborhood watch, also called a crime watch is an organized group of civilians devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood, including littering. Similar to HOA organizations, members of watch groups are often intrinsically motivated to maintain a clean neighborhood and share the same common goals. Neighborhood watch groups can be as informal or formal as one would like, although informal methods may be easier to start if your community does not have such a group in place already. Typically, informal watch groups involve select community residents patrolling and monitoring the community looking out for any suspicious activity, crime, or other behavior breaking rules. A schedule is usually shared between volunteers listing out availabilities, procedures in case of emergencies, and contact information, including local law enforcement. Having an active neighborhood watch group monitoring the community will likely deter the culprits. Although the initial purpose of starting a watch group may be to catch and deter litterers, it is possible that the group also inadvertently encounters more serious and dangerous criminals who have gone unnoticed in the past. Depending on the danger of the threats, and if the watch group volunteers are inexperienced or untrained in handling more threatening situations, then risks can quickly escalate beyond what was anticipated. Therefore, the safety of the volunteers within the group is an important concern and should remain a high priority. 3) Contact local law enforcement Law enforcement will likely be able to assist in preventing trash to be littered in your community. Law enforcement is a public service and it can be argued that trash is impeding the well-being of the local public. A big advantage of involving law enforcement over creating a local neighborhood watch group is that the former has extensive experience and training in dealing with a wide range of threats, while the latter may not. For example, if the litterers also coincidentally happen to be wanted fugitives then law enforcement would be prepared to apprehend the criminals safely away from the community residents. Another advantage of involving law enforcement to eliminate trash being littered in your community is that they can adjust their levels of engagement depending on the severity of the issues. If the trash being littered is largely immaterial or non-threatening, then they may elect to install street signs warning culprits of the consequences of littering or occasionally patrol the street in marked police cars. Law enforcement may even leave a marked police car in plain sight within the community since the sight of a police car is known to reduce the chances of criminal activity in most cases. However, if trash being littered is significantly harming the residents (e.g., hazardous materials, food waste, heavy items, etc.), then law enforcement will likely elect to increase their engagement and may even dedicate an officer present at all times. As illustrated, some of the benefits of contacting law enforcement are the flexibility of engagement, the depth of their expertise, and nearly unlimited resources in combatting the littering issue."},{"instruction":"Compose an Amazon product review for a shrink-ray gun.","output":"Five Out of Five! Buy this item! It has been about a week since I received the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun that I purchased here from Amazon. I was a little hesitant because all of the reviews here are so glowing. It makes you think that some of them might be fake! I am pleased to report, though, that this product is well-deserving of its high marks. I’ve been having some issues with ex-boyfriends going on social media and trashing me. It is so obnoxious. They say things like \\"She’s a weirdo,\\" \\"Stay away from her,\\" and \\"She talks about revenge all of the time!\\" And clearly, that’s not true! I talk about soap operas sometimes, too. My first purchase of a shrink-ray gun from Amazon was a disappointment. If you look at the reviews for the Widget Company Shrink-Ray Gun (my alias is @uwillpay), you’ll see that this was a far inferior product. The degree of shrinkage on that gun was a low 75%. I’m sorry, but an ex-boyfriend who's 2 feet tall is still way too big—are you with me? I donated it to charity. It was like a kid's toy or something. But the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun far outperformed the competition. When I waited in the shadows at Jerry’s house until he came outside with the trash, the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun got the job done! Jerry shrank from 6 feet to one inch. I’m serious, this is a great product! Well, of course, I did zap him again, and he’s probably riding on the back of a flea right now or something.

Opinion My father, Henry Kissinger, is turning 100. This is his guide to longevity. On Saturday, my father, Henry Kissinger, celebrates his 100th birthday. This might have an air of inevitability for anyone familiar with his force of character and love of historical symbolism. Not only has he outlived most of his peers, eminent detractors and students, but he has also remained indefatigably active throughout his 90s. Even the pandemic did not slow him down: Since 2020, he has completed two books and begun work on a third. He returned from the Bilderberg Conference in Lisbon earlier this week just in time to embark on a series of centennial celebrations that will take him from New York to London and finally to his hometown of Fürth, Germany. My father’s longevity is especially miraculous when one considers the health regimen he has followed throughout his adult life, which includes a diet heavy on bratwurst and Wiener schnitzel, a career of relentlessly stressful decision-making, and a love of sports purely as a spectator, never a participant. David Von Drehle: My neighbor lived to be 109. This is what I learned from him. How then to account for his enduring mental and physical vitality? He has an unquenchable curiosity that keeps him dynamically engaged with the world. His mind is a heat-seeking weapon that identifies and grapples with the existential challenges of the day. In the 1950s, the issue was the rise of nuclear weapons and their threat to humanity. About five years ago, as a promising young man of 95, my father became obsessed with the philosophical and practical implications of artificial intelligence. ADVERTISING As the Thanksgiving turkey was passed around in recent years, he would ruminate about the repercussions of this new technology, in ways that occasionally reminded his grandchildren of storylines in the Terminator films. While immersing himself in the technical aspects of AI with the intensity of an MIT grad student, he infused the debate over its uses with his singular philosophical and historical insight. The other secret to my father’s endurance is his sense of mission. Although he has been caricatured as a cold realist, he is anything but dispassionate. He believes deeply in such arcane concepts as patriotism, loyalty and bipartisanship. It pains him to see the nastiness in today’s public discourse and the seeming collapse of the art of diplomacy. As a child, I remember the warmth of his friendships with people whose politics might have been different from his, such as Kay Graham, Ted Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. Kennedy loved to play practical jokes that my father thoroughly enjoyed (including inviting Dad to his home office and claiming to have a mongoose hidden in a closet). Even as Cold War tensions persisted, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin was a frequent guest at our house. The two of them would occasionally play games of chess between negotiating issues affecting the entire planet. My father had no illusions about the repressive nature of the Soviet regime, but these regular conversations helped de-escalate tensions at a time when the nuclear superpowers appeared to be on a collision course. If only such regular dialogue occurred between the top players in today’s global tensions. Chess aside, diplomacy was never a game for my father. He practiced it with a commitment and tenacity born of personal experience. As a refugee from Nazi Germany, he had lost 13 family members and countless friends to the Holocaust. He returned to his native Germany as an American soldier, participating in the liberation of the Ahlem concentration camp near Hannover. There, he witnessed the depths to which mankind can sink unconstrained by international structures of peace and justice. Next month, we will return to Fürth, where he will lay a wreath at the grave of his grandfather, who did not escape. I know that no son can be truly objective about his father’s legacy, but I am proud of my father’s efforts to anchor statecraft with consistent principles and an awareness of historical reality. This is the mission he has pursued for the better part of a century, using his rare brain and unflagging energy to serve the country that saved his family and launched him on a journey beyond his wildest dreams.","output":"The 10 Keys to Longevity by Henry Kissinger 1) Cultivate a forceful character throughout your life. 2) Never forget an offense and determine to outlive your adversaries and neigh-sayers. 3) Make sure you have a stressful career where you make decisions with global, historical, and life-and-death consequences every day. 4) Eat bratwurst daily - preferably twice a day. 5) Have a mind like a heat-seeking missile and remain curious. 6) Care deeply about the world, but maintain a cold, dispassionate, and skeptical view of everything. 7) Assume new technology is harmful until proven otherwise, and even then... 8) Play chess while negotiating nuclear deals. 9) Believe in public institutions, even though you know the people in them to be corrupt and evil. 10) Don't forget to laugh because life is short, even if you live to be 100."},{"instruction":"write a love song that is a to-do list of things for the summer","output":"Got a list of things to do Not surprising that they're all with you You're on my list and I'm gonna check it Come along I know you won't regret it Let's ride our bikes to the beach Watch the sunset out of reach Take a hike, find a trail Let's make this summer one for the tale I'll take you camping out in the woods Spend the night, just like we should Sleeping bags in a lil ole tent Now that's a night that is sure well spent Let's spend a lazy day in bed Read books, forget what lies ahead Let's dance under the stars at night Hold each other tight, make it right Got my list, gonna make it count Do all the things we've talked about Let's make memories that last all time Happening as long as you are mine"},{"instruction":"Write the classic scene of a kid finding a doorway to another world.

It’s an ethos from which Link’s new Ascend ability was formed — as a debug feature that Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi used to easily exit the depths of Tears of the Kingdom’s caves. “When I was exploring the caves, I would get to the destination where I was trying to get to, and once I checked it out, I would just use the debug code to get to the top,” Fujibayashi told Polygon. “And I thought, Well, maybe this is something that can be usable in the game.” Aonuma agreed with Fujibayashi that it was a “pain” to go all the way back through Tears of the Kingdom’s labyrinthine caves. “When I heard that, I thought, Oh, I guess he would feel the same way that I would be feeling,” Fujibayashi said. “That’s how we got to implementing Ascend.

Dogs of course made the transition first when wolves became human's companions and protectors. Cats, however, waited to join human society until around 8,000 years ago. Cats hung around villages and cities to catch rodents after the latter quickly learned that crops were an easy meal. Humans accepted cats after noticing they kept the rodent population in check, and cats decided that living among people wasn't all that bad. What do cats like to eat on a hot day? A mice-cream cone. Today cats and dogs have shed their predator and prey images and even their pet status. Dogs spend their days at doggie daycare, serve as ring bearers for weddings, enjoy a trip to the beach and dress up for Halloween. Cats own the internet with rumba-riding cat videos, sleep on their human's beds and eat food fit for people. Owning a pet has been shown to help lower blood pressure, relieve stress and depression and increase the human life span. But perhaps the greatest benefit of having a pet is the unconditional love and companionship they provide. In return, cats and dogs are loved and cherished and considered vital family members.

With the password converted to binary, the function uses \`with open\` to open \\"passwords.txt\\", clarifying append mode with \`a\` to prevent previous entries from being overwritten, and writes the password to a new line. At the end, outside the function, the password is accepted as input to define the \`mypassword\` variable, and the function is called with \`mypassword\` as an argument."},{"instruction":"Hey Amy, I’m having some issues with my poetry.

Epidermis: The outside layer of the skin. New skin cells form at the bottom of this layer and then go to the top within two to four weeks. Each day, people naturally lose approximately 30,000 to 40,000 dead skin cells. This layer also has melanin, which gives skin its color. 2. Dermis: The middle layer of the skin. This layer has nerve endings that send messages to the spinal cord or brain to tell people how things feel. This layer also has tiny blood vessels that bring nutrients and oxygen to skin cells and remove waste. 3. Subcutaneous Layer: The bottom layer of the skin. This layer is mainly fat to help bodies stay warm and absorb shocks when hitting something. This layer also helps attach the skin to other tissues and has hair follicles to help body hair grow."},{"instruction":"Write the story of The Milkmaid and Her Pail for an elementary child.

Here is a Python script that will calculate the number of yards of fabric to make your bean bags: # Define a function to calculate yardage based on number of bean bags def yardage(beanbag_count): # Convert bean bag inches of fabric to yards beanbag_inches = beanbag_count * 49 beanbag_yards = beanbag_inches / 36 return beanbag_yards # Get the number of bean bags beanbag_count = float(input(\\"How many beanbags are you making? \\")) # Call the function yards_fabric = yardage(beanbag_count) print(f\\"You will need {yards_fabric} yards of fabric for {beanbag_count} bean bags.\\") This script defines the function \`yardage(beanbag_count)\` to calculate the yards based on the number of bean bags you are making. It converts the bean bag number to inches by multiplying it by 7 x 7 = 49 inches per bean bag, then converts inches to yards by dividing the number by 36 inches per yard. These could be consolidated into one line of code, but separating them makes the code more comprehensible. The function then returns the yards of fabric needed for the bean bags. The bean bag count is requested with an \`input()\` function that is converted to a floating point decimal from a string with \`float()\`, then it is passed as an argument to \`yardage()\` to get the variable \`yards_fabric\`.

He decided to hike up the Sacred Mountain in the hope that by reaching the mountaintop he will gain a new perspective and ultimately achieve inner peace. The monk gathered himself and began his hike from the bottom of the mountain 3,000 below the believed source of his nirvana. As the monk hiked up the mountain, he came to a crossing where he was met by a tiger that was trapped in a thorny hedge. The tiger growled as the monk approached it; the monk, unafraid of the tiger and instead feeling compassion for its plight, began pulling the thorny vines away from the tiger in an attempt to free it from its bonds. The tiger continued to growl but became more curious as the monk freed it from the bush's grasp. Once the tiger was free, the monk bowed before it and offered a peaceful smile. The tiger, rather than attack the monk, laid down in front of the monk, appearing to be grateful for the monk's assistance. The monk, pleased with the outcome, got up and continued on his path. Further up the mountain, the monk was intercepted by two bandits who were obstructing the path. The bandits appeared menacing and looked like they were ready to pounce on the monk. The monk, on the other hand, was calm and assured of himself. The bandits produced knives from their robes, thinking they would take the monk's possessions with force. However, the monk reached into his robes and produced a loaf of bread and a clay bottle containing water; he offered the items to the bandits, who received the items with a sense of gratitude. The monk walked past the bandits, who offered no resistance and instead bowed to the monk with humility and respect. The monk was within a few hundred yards of the mountaintop when a dark cloud formed around it and threatened to drench the monk in water. Lightning began striking the ground below the clouds, but this did not deter the monk from continuing on the path. As the monk walked through the storm clouds untouched, he reached the top of the mountain and was greeted with a view of the entire world; the view immediately gave him a sense of peace."},{"instruction":"Please create a short review for me of the book poor dad rich dad.

You'll have to take some creative liberties in Dennis's inner thoughts but make sure they feel authentic based on the article. Include the term \\"American Dream\\" somewhere. Dennis C. would rather retire than return to the office full time — and that's exactly what he did. The Alabama-based 65-year-old, who verified his last name, former employment, and salary range with Insider, but asked that they be withheld to protect his privacy, got a taste of working from home years ago. In 2018, higher-ups at his job handed a day of remote work out as a reward. By 2019, he was working two days remotely, and three days in the office. He said that schedule was \\"fantastic,\\" and he thought he'd never retire: \\"This is perfect, this is heaven.\\" But as 2020 rolled in and sent everyone home, he discovered he loved full-time remote work even more. \\"We went to five days a week and it was like, 'Oh, I thought two was good, five is the sweet spot,'\\" Dennis said. \\"There's no reason to go back to the office.\\" He loved remote work for the same reasons he thinks other people do: more time to concentrate, and fewer meetings. He could turn off his camera, mute, and still plug away. His commute went from 20 minutes to five minutes. \\"If I wanted to do something and it wasn't time constrained, I could stop work and pick it up later that evening,\\" he said. He's not alone in that: Some remote workers are living like college kids again, using their afternoons for leisure activities or errands, and then picking work back up later in the day. \\"The more choice we have, the more autonomy we have, I think, the happier we are,\\" Dennis said. But then, in April 2021, Dennis was called back to the office. The company wanted him to come in for three days a week. Dennis, who was technically eligible to retire and had already been looking for new roles, said it was the straw that broke the camel's back. \\"When they said that I was going to have to come back, I sent them an email saying I'm retiring,\\" he said. Dennis had already secured a job offer elsewhere as a defense contractor. With the new role, he'd be taking a slight pay cut, bringing his salary from six figures to a little less. But since he receives new monthly retirement benefits from his old federal job, he's still technically bringing in more than he was before. His new role is also fully remote, a must-have for him. He said that it's been, in a word, \\"fantastic.\\" Bosses are made obsolete by remote work Dennis isn't alone. Felicia, an administrator in Arizona, previously told Insider that she too was leaving behind a six-figure salary over a forced return to the office. Her bosses were suffering from productivity paranoia and could not believe that people working from home were actually working. Dennis said that he thinks the only people who fully fail at remote work are those who went to meetings in person, walked around with a piece of paper, and looked busy — but weren't actually getting much done. But self-starters and motivated people with goals can excel with remote work. But remote work also calls into question the purpose of a boss, he said. A boss's model, whether they voice it aloud, is to make sure their employees get work done. And so those employees have to be there, in front of them, so the bosses can ensure they're working. \\"It's almost, 'If I don't see you working, then I don't have anything to do. What's my purpose?'\\" Dennis said. \\"So, I think that's the main driver of bringing people back.\\" With the pandemic, the remote-work genie is out of the bag, Dennis said. At his old job, higher-ups once doled out remote work as a reward. Now, there's a \\"bunch of people\\" who know they don't need to be in the office to do productive work. And that's going to lead to a reckoning for bosses. \\"The managers, especially the mid-level managers, still are going to want to see people. That's kind of justification for their job,\\" he said. \\"If everybody can work remote, it's a new model for the manager.\\" Even as remote work has fallen off slightly in the near term — the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently found that nearly 73% surveyed of companies offered little to no telework in September, compared to 60% surveyed in 2021 — Dennis still thinks it will slowly take over, especially as office leases expire. \\"I'm a baby boomer, so we're starting to die out,\\" he said. He added that as baby boomers \\"leave the scene, so to speak,\\" so will some of their traditions. \\"I think a lot of people that have exposure to remote work will say, 'Hey, that worked,'\\" Dennis said.","output":"There was no going back after Dennis got his first taste of remote work. Forty years in the workforce had come and gone as he worked his way up the corporate ladder, and things never really changed. Not until 2018, when his Alabama employer began to offer a brand new benefit: As a reward for good work, employees would be offered one day of remote work. Though the concept was foreign, it intrigued Dennis, and he worked towards gaining as many remote days as possible. As his first day of work at home passed, he felt like this was something he could get used to. The convenience was unmatched -- who wouldn't prefer a five-minute commute to the home office over twenty minutes in traffic? Dennis continued to strive towards earning more of this reward and by the next year, his work week consisted of two days at home and three days in the office. Settled into the new routine, he felt he could do this forever. If he could always experience this much flexibility, maybe he didn't even have to retire... The split allowed him the flexibility to run errands before the stores closed while picking his work up again at a time that felt more convenient. Things couldn't possibly be better. Then, in 2020, his work became fully remote. Five days of work at home seemed too good to be true; it improved his concentration and productivity, and there were far fewer meetings. For the first time since joining the workforce, Dennis had autonomy over his schedule. Working remotely for two days was fantastic, but he quickly realized that five days was the sweet spot. There was no reason to return to the office now. When talking with other people, Dennis seemed to notice a pattern. All of his coworkers that failed at remote work were the types of people that would attend meetings with paper and pen, pretending to look busy the entire time. But anyone who was a self-starter, who could find their own motivation, seemed to be thriving. Still, there was one more group of people he had yet to consider: The bosses. What was a boss's purpose, anyway? Did they actually do anything but micromanage their underlings? He couldn't help wondering what all of the bosses and higher-ups were doing during their remote working time, since there was nobody for them to watch or manage. If they don't see people working... what's their purpose? Sure enough, another year came and went, and Dennis learned the answer. The managers and bosses needed employees back in person so desperately that they drove everybody back to the office. Well, everybody who didn't quit. After he had a taste of full-time remote work, Dennis knew he could never go back. When he got his call to return to his 2019 schedule of two days home and three days in-office, that was the final straw. The camel's back broke. He knew it was time to move on. Sending an email back to the company, Dennis announced his retirement and decided to accept another job offer. Even though this new offer had a smaller salary than his previous position, it didn't matter. A fully remote position made up for that. Not to mention, his old employer would be paying out his monthly retirement benefits now, bringing his income to a higher level than before. This was the new American Dream."},{"instruction":"What are the causes of male pattern baldness?","output":"Male pattern baldness has to do with your genes and male sex hormones.

They can often remember information better if it's presented visually rather than delivered orally. These individuals might benefit from strategies like using flashcards, taking notes, or watching videos to grasp and retain new information. -Auditory learners, as the name suggests, learn best through listening. They are good at remembering things that they hear, like spoken words, music, or ambient sounds. These individuals may prefer lectures, group discussions, and audio resources for learning. When studying, they might benefit from reading text aloud or using a tape recorder to playback information. -Kinesthetic learners prefer a more physical style of learning through doing and moving. They learn best when they can use tactile experiences and carry out a physical activity to understand a concept. This could include role-playing, building models, or using physical objects that can be touched or manipulated. Kinesthetic learners often prefer a 'hands-on' approach to learning, rather than sitting still for long periods."},{"instruction":"I'm throwing a garden party this June and I'm not going to have alcohol at the party.

They loved their walks, especially Fido, who would often observe their surroundings with a keen eye, identifying all kinds of animals and objects with his keen intellect. It was good, after all, to work the mind as well as the legs, though Fido enjoyed working his legs a great deal as well, especially when they played fetch. One afternoon, Ed and Fido encountered the most peculiar object in their path. It was a stick, but no ordinary stick. No, this stick had only one end. Ed picked it up and turned it around, trying to find the other end. Try as he might, he could not. Fido whimpered, staring at the stick as if wanting a closer look. Ed obliged, holding it down to Fido's nose for him to smell. To Fido, it smelled like any other stick, but he could not deny that it looked very strange, having only a single end. He bit down on it and pulled, prompting Ed to let go, and then dropped it. He tried dropping it again and again from multiple angles, but to no avail - only the one end of the stick ever hit the ground. So Fido did the only sensible thing that one would do upon finding such a strange object. He picked it up to hand to his human to throw. And throw it he did, again and again, long into the evening, and Fido would go running after it. This much Fido understood - no matter how many ends it has, no stick is too strange for a game of fetch."},{"instruction":"Who is the first Super Bowl Champion?","output":"The Green Bay Packers were the first Super Bowl Champions.

It should have a concerning tone, while still being technically informative.","output":"Let’s face facts, children aren’t always the most meticulous when it comes to brushing their teeth. Especially on the biting surfaces of the molars and premolars in the back of their mouth. Unfortunately, the contours of these teeth can sometimes be hard to clean from your child’s twice-daily brushing efforts. It’s all too easy for bacterial deposits to accumulate in the natural pits and fissures found on the tooth enamel layer of your back teeth. Over time, these bacterial deposits can gradually start to demineralize the local tooth enamel causing a serious cavity to form. These areas of tooth decay can sometimes be large and lead to more significant complications in the future. Not the least of which being major cavities that can require large fillings or even a dental crown restoration. If your dentist notices bacterial deposits in these areas during your child’s routine dental exam, they might recommend cleaning them away before applying dental sealants. In fact, there are some dentists who recommend dental sealants for any child between the ages of 6 to 16. They are a special type of dental grade resin that the dentist carefully paints onto the biting surface of your child’s molars and premolars. Then a special ultraviolet light to harden the resin creating a protective layer. This way even if bacterial deposits start to accumulate in the textured and contoured areas, the durable dental sealants will keep bacteria from direct access to the tooth enamel. Many dental sealants can provide up to 10 years of protection, which will help your child keep healthy teeth long into their adult life!"},{"instruction":"I need you to come up with ideas for a new game of Monopoly that is based on the Super Smash Brothers video game.

Dodo birds were flightless, fearless birds native to Mauritius, an island off the coast of Madagascar that was largely uninhabited from the human population until the 1500s. This made them an easy target for humans to hunt due to their inability to fly and because of their fearlessness to humans. Not only did humans hunt them, but the animals they brought with them did as well. Dogs, pigs, cats, and rats ate their eggs and destroyed their nests. Because the Dodos had no known natural predators, they did not fear these animals, had no way to defend themselves, and had no means of escape. The presence of these animals created more competition for food and resources and the Dodo birds were simply outnumbered. At the same time, humans were destroying their natural habitats. Explorers cut down trees to make way for paths across the island, pushing the dodo birds into a smaller area. This created an even greater lack of food and ultimately, extinction."},{"instruction":"How many mountain ranges are there in Alaska, and where is the most difficult summit?

Kennedy by name.","output":"Believe me, a man who assassinates a US President is not someone who had a pleasant life or was well in the head. Lee Harvey Oswald had issues with spelling and reading as a child, though grew to become an avid reader. He declared himself a socialist after reading a good deal of socialist literature, even writing to America's Socialist Party to ask about joining their programs. However, one of his friends at the time disputes that his reading habits were especially sophisticated. I could never judge a man for how he gets into reading, though I can and do judge him for how he would repeat the history of what happened to me. Regardless of how true his claims to read socialist theory were, he was so vocally pro-Soviet that when he joined the US military, he gained the nickname \\"Oswaldskovich.\\" Over three score ago, Oswald taught himself Russian and traveled to the USSR. He insisted to Soviet officials that he loved the Soviet Union and wanted to join. They initially rejected his citizenship application, so he forced them to keep him in the country with a self-inflicted wound. He offered his knowledge of the American military to the Soviets and became a laborer in Belarus. He lived somewhat comfortably for a Soviet worker, though was constantly watched. After only two years, Oswald decided he would rather return to America. I can certainly remember a handful of Confederates who had second thoughts back in my time.

Oswald had made a show of his defection but had never actually renounced his citizenship, so he asked the US embassy to return his passport and help his new wife and child immigrate back home. When they returned, they made far less of an impact in the headlines than Oswald had thought they would get."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this article but use lists for the products and corresponding information if available.

Unfortunately, the MSRPs on the latest generation parts are sometimes quite a bit higher than their previous gen equivalents — like the 799 RTX 4070 Ti compared to the 599 RTX 3070 Ti.

Consider the following script: Value = 4 ValueMinusTwo := value - 2 Msgbox % ValueMinusTwo The first line of the script defines Value as an integer. The second line is defining ValueMinusTwo as a variable in function mode - if the colon was not used with the equals then the variable might interpret Value as a string and math functions would not work as expected. Then it is a simple matter of defining the variable as Value - 2 , which is 2, and this will be stored in the variable ValueMinusTwo. The third line of the script returns 2 as above."},{"instruction":"I have a group that wants to camp somewhere in Arizona near water. We would need a group site that is family and dog friendly.

Mabel is too common, and so is Spike, he thought to himself. Page 4: Upon arriving at the shelter, a nice lady met them at the door, introduced herself as Joyce, and asked if we wanted to take a look around. “There are so many pets available for you to adopt!” she said. Page 5: Joyce walked them through the shelter and showed them the different animals that needed a good home. There were so many dogs and cats in cages that Tommy didn’t know how he could possibly choose one. Page 6: Then, Tommy spotted a baby kitten in one of the smaller cages. This kitten had all-white fur with blue eyes and stared directly into his eyes. He felt an instant connection. Page 7: “This is the one!” Tommy exclaimed as he pointed at the white kitten. His parents beamed back proudly and turned to face Joyce. “I believe we have found our new pet,” Tommy’s mother told her. Page 8: “Great! I will get the adoption paperwork ready for you. Would you like to hold your new kitten while you wait?” Joyce asked Tommy. “Of course I would!” he said excitedly. Page 9: Tommy sat down on the floor as Joyce put the kitten into his lap. The kitten immediately started purring, and Tommy couldn’t help but to have the biggest grin on his face. Page 10: “I think I’ll name you Cloud.

He always took them on a long drive when he had something heavy on his mind; seeing the scenery of their rural town always seemed to help him unload and talk about what was bothering him. Carter had been acting distant ever since Maggie said she got a job in another state. He brought the jeep to a stop by Gopher’s Creek and shut the engine off. The only sound for some time was the trickling of water. Finally, he turned to her. “Mag, how will we keep a long-distance relationship? Do you think we’ll be able to?” Maggie looked down and bit her lip pensively. She hadn’t really thought about the impact her move would have on their relationship, and now she felt ashamed about how lightly she had taken it. “I don’t know, Carter,” she finally replied. “To be honest, I just don’t know.” “Do you want to?” Maggie lost herself in her thoughts again. Carter had been her friend since middle school, and the two dated from high school all through college. She loved and cared for him deeply, but as far as romantic partners went, he was someone she had always known. He was safe, he was home, like her small hometown. Unexciting, but reliable. She was leaving her state to pursue the career of her dreams, and it felt so thrilling. She realized she wanted the same from her relationship as well. “Maybe long-distance won’t work. Maybe we should get a chance to explore more options.” Carter smiled sadly, reading Maggie like a book. “I thought you might say something like that. So are we calling it quits?” “Maybe it’s for the best.” “Yeah, maybe.” “But Carter?” “Yeah?” Maggie smiled. “If it doesn’t work out for us in our separate endeavors, we’ve always got a home with each other, right?”"},{"instruction":"I need a grocery list written for me.

You should stir it frequently, getting to the bottom of the saucepan to make sure nothing is sticking, but you don’t have to coddle it. “To make this a heartier main course, you could top it with a fried egg,” McDowell continues, “or you could serve it family-style as a side dish alongside a bigger meal like a roast or a braise.” Erin, are you asking us to…put an egg on it?

Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a medium saucepan, cook the bacon over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the fat renders out and the bacon is crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reserve the bacon fat for step 2. 2. PREPARE THE MUSHROOMS: Use a paring knife to trim the mushrooms into medium-large pieces, leaving medium and small mushrooms whole. On an unlined baking sheet, toss the mushrooms with the bacon fat; season with salt and pepper. 3. Spread the mushrooms in an even layer on the baking sheet and then transfer to the oven. Roast until the mushrooms are tender and beginning to brown around the edges, 25 to 35 minutes. 4. WHILE THE MUSHROOMS COOK, MAKE THE POLENTA: In the same saucepan that you cooked the bacon, bring the broth, milk and shallot to a simmer. Gradually whisk in the polenta, then reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until the polenta is thick and tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in the butter and Parmesan, then season to taste with salt and pepper. 5. To serve, spoon the polenta into shallow bowls and top with the roasted mushrooms and bacon.

When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. His invention was known as the Electric Arc lamp. And while it produced light, it didn’t produce it for long and was much too bright for practical use. Over the next seven decades, other inventors also created “light bulbs” but no designs emerged for commerical application. More notably, in 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial production. In 1850 an English physicist named Joseph Wilson Swan created a “light bulb” by enclosing carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. And by 1860 he had a working prototype, but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a bulb whose lifetime was much too short to be considered an effective prodcer of light. However, in the 1870’s better vacuum pumps became available and Swan continued experiments on light bulbs. In 1878, Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using a treated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackening. On July 24, 1874 a Canadian patent was filed by a Toronto medical electrician named Henry Woodward and a colleague Mathew Evans. They built their lamps with different sizes and shapes of carbon rods held between electrodes in glass cylinders filled with nitrogen. Woodward and Evans attempted to commercialize their lamp, but were unsuccessful. They eventually sold their patent to Edison in 1879.

Since I am a college student, I don't have much time or money. Still, I want to learn to be a better cook. What are four easy, cheap, and quick ways I can improve my cooking?","output":"Here are four ways you can improve your cooking: 1) Experiment. If you don't experiment with different flavors and dishes, you won't improve. Don't cook the same thing over and over again, otherwise, you won't see any progress. 2) Try different seasonings. Seasoning gives the food a rich flavor. You should try new seasonings and spices to broaden the flavors you like. Buying small samples of spices can be an affordable way to try new things. 3) Cook for others. Cooking for others is the fastest way to get feedback on your skills. Cook for others whenever you can, and never back down from the challenge. Try cooking for friends so you're cooking in a comfortable environment. 4) Add more to simple dishes. If you like simple dishes, like ramen, try adding a few things to them. For example, try adding an egg to the top of your ramen, or parmesan cheese. Add new ingredients to strengthen your understanding of how ingredients blend. Along with that, you can use your new knowledge and apply that to different dishes. Find another dish you like that's similar to ramen, then try adding the same ingredients."},{"instruction":"Turn this product description into an obituary.

Derrick would also go shopping for new toys, try different parrot calls, read him the daily newspaper, and give massages. One particular morning, as Derrick was reading the morning newspaper articles for Iago, an article describing recent odd bird migration to Northern states was written on the front page. Iago only knew of warmth given that he lived in New Mexico for as long as he could remember. Iago never imagined life anywhere outside of this, nor life without Derrick. For as far as Iago was concerned, the love and life with Derrick were more than enough. However, Iago felt peculiar and strange when hearing about birds that were migrating North for mysterious reasons. Iago, for the first time in his life, was feeling instinctively adventurous. Derrick and Iago could never directly talk with each other given the gap in species between the two, but they always had an indescribable way of somehow knowing what the other was feeling. When Iago was feeling adventurous for the first time, Derrick sensed it and dreaded the meaning of the impulse. For the next couple of days that followed, Derrick stopped giving Iago massages, bought no new parrot toys, and most importantly, stopped reading the daily newspaper to him. Iago felt betrayed and heartbroken. Something about their relationship had changed, and it didn't seem to be for the better. One day, Derrick came home with a few bags of goods from an arts and crafts store. Iago, as curious as ever hopped into one of the bags and looked around. There were bags of thread everywhere and of multiple types: thread made of nylon, thick threads, skinny threads, and even multi-colored threads. Derrick then plopped down in their favorite chair and began knitting a small hat and scarf set for Iago. With tears in his eyes, Derrick put the recently-knitted hat and scarf on Iago and kissed him on the cheek. Iago, feeling overwhelmed with love, embraced Derrick and took off to head North."},{"instruction":"I want to write a scene where a character is trying to invite a friend to hang out.

Last year, I was miserable! What are four ways I can beat the heat this summer and cool off when it gets too hot? No air conditioning suggestions!","output":"The climate in North Carolina is considered one of the most temperate in the United States, but that doesn’t mean that it’s exempt from heat waves. While the average temperature hovers around 90 degrees Fahrenheit through most of the summer, the rising humidity can make it feel well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, humidity adds a sticky quality to the air, which increases how much you sweat and how much your body temperature rises in response to the heat outside. While many North Carolinians opt to stay inside in air-conditioned homes for most of the summer, those that love being outdoors, or have to be outdoors for work, need ways to beat the heat. Below you’ll find four ways to cool down and stave off rising temperatures in NC this summer. • Sip ice water throughout the day. Being properly hydrated will replenish your body’s water supply, encouraging stabilization of body temperature. You could also suck on ice chips to get the same effect. Side Tip: At the height of heat waves, steer clear of sugary drinks, like sweet teas, lemonades, and sodas. Sugar increases thirst and raises body temperature, which can lead to heatstroke and dehydration. • Limit outdoor activities to early mornings or as the sun is going down. These are the coolest times of the day because outdoor temperatures will drop with the setting of sunshine. • Use cold water to spritz your face, wash your hands up to the wrists, and dip your feet up to the ankles. You could also drape a cold rag around your neck for up to 10 minutes at a time. Do this several times a day when you feel the hottest and most bothered. The quick splashes of cold water on these major pulse points will slightly lower your body temperature. • Eat cold fruits and vegetables that are dense in nutrients with high water content. Watermelons, mangoes, cucumbers, and grapes are delicious, nutritious, and perfect for helping your body's core temperature cool down by a couple of degrees with beneficial hydration."},{"instruction":"Who wrote the Star Spangled Banner, and when was it written?","output":"\\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" the national anthem of the United States of America, was written by British composer John Stafford Smith.

Please create a numbered list style post that gives tips and best practices.","output":"Tips to Get Luscious Locks and Grow Your Hair Stronger and Faster Yes! Getting luscious locks and strong hair is possible for anyone. You just have to try the right things. Here’s how: 1. Avoid Heat: Avoid using hot tools excessively as the heat can damage and weaken your hair. Try cooler settings when styling and rinse your hair with cold water to seal in moisture and prevent breakage. 2. Keep it Nice and Trimmed: Contrary to popular belief, regular trims encourage hair growth as they remove split ends and prevent breakage from traveling up the hair shaft. Aim for a trim every 6-8 weeks to maintain healthy and strong hair. 3. On Any Condition: Proper conditioning is crucial for promoting hair growth as it nourishes and strengthens your strands from the inside out. Look for conditioners containing keratin, biotin, and/or other hair-boosting ingredients to maximize growth potential. 4. Tender Caring: Be gentle when brushing or combing to avoid damaging your hair. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle and minimize pulling, and avoid tight hairstyles (like tight ponytails or braids) that can put additional stress on your locks. 5. Don’t Dry it: Wet hair is more prone to damage and breakage, so avoid brushing or styling until it's dry. Instead, use a microfiber towel to gently pat your hair dry and then let it air dry, which is the healthiest method for your tresses. 6. Meddling Meds: Some medications may cause hair loss, while others may help promote growth. Talk to your doctor to find out if your medication regimen is affecting your hair health. 7. De-Stress Tress: Stress can take a toll on your hair. Incorporate relaxation techniques into your daily routine, like yoga or meditation, to reduce stress and promote healthy hair growth. 8. Coloring Conundrum: Frequent hair coloring can damage hair and inhibit growth. Choose natural dyes or give your locks a break from coloring for a while. 9. Braids to Breaks: Wearing tight hairstyles or extensions for extended periods can cause damage to your hair follicles. Give your hair a break and switch up your hairstyle frequently to prevent breakage. You can try these yourself and watch the results. You won’t have to do anything else. As a bonus tip, eat healthy and grow stronger from the inside out."},{"instruction":"Write a video script for a commercial ad for an internet provider called “Avalon.” Make the script for this video about 30-45 seconds long.

You’ve heard of the hoverboard, a highly maneuverable electric scooter. Put the two together, and you get...the HoverDrone! The HoverDrone combines two technologically advanced products into one amazing, new, patented invention! Here’s how it works: A foot platform like a hoverboard is attached to powerful propellers slightly below the level of the platform. The operator of the HoverDrone can then use similar movements to a hoverboard to shift their weight from front to back and side to side to determine their direction of flight! What happened to the remote control that drones use, you ask? The remote control operates as an override for parents. If your child won’t park their HoverDrone and come inside for supper, Mom and Dad can use the remote control feature to bring them back home, quickly and safely! For daredevils who’d like to take the HoverDrone concept one step further, we also offer the HoverDrone Deluxe! The HoverDrone Deluxe has boots built into the platform, firmly securing the rider and making it possible to do mid-air flips! Are you a snowboarder or skateboarder with experience performing flips and other tricks? This model is for you! (The HoverDrone Deluxe is not recommended for riders under 16 or those with a novice skill level with the original HoverDrone.)
