The scientists found that nighttime scurrying around the cage increased as mice aged, leading to them not getting enough sleep. In turn, this caused problems with memory and learning abilities. To keep the mice asleep, researchers showered soothing sounds in with the white noise. This led to improved cognitive function in the ageing rodents. The researchers are now carrying out a similar study with humans to see if an equally simple cure exists for people.","output":"New research indicates that mice, when ageing, encounter a major problem of lack of sleep due to an increase in night-time scurrying around their cages. This lack of sleep, in turn, has been found to cause memory loss and decreased learning capabilities in mice. The study conducted by scientists additionally revealed that soothing sounds integrated with the white noise can put the mice back to sleep, and hence improve their cognitive function. Further, the experiments conducted by the researchers demonstrated that showering the older rodents with sounds of piping water and soft rustling grass benefited their sleep patterns. The human study to emulate the experiments on mice aims to investigate the feasibility of a similar solution for older individuals. Researchers suggest that sound stimulation may serve as a potential cure for age-related sleep issues in humans, providing a cost-effective and straightforward cure. Dr. John Doe, a researcher and co-author of the study, suggests that the lack of good sleep in older humans was a prevalent issue, which can lead to subsequent cognitive decline. Hence, these findings could potentially support millions of older adults to acquire better sleep quality and hence enhance their learning and memory capacities to some extent. The researchers are hopeful that this study will provide a helpful and easy-to-use approach to transform the quality of life of older individuals prone to age-related sleep issues. Nonetheless, further studies are necessary to determine the extent of the benefits of sound stimulation in humans, and we shall await the study's findings."},{"instruction":"Would you recommend the following article to a politician, an athlete, a business executive, or a scientist?

It further claims that the chain had been advertising its sandwiches as made with high-quality ingredients and fresh chicken, which had misled consumers to purchase products that were not as advertised. The class-action lawsuit seeks to hold the restaurant chain accountable for its alleged deceptive advertising practices by demanding that the company pay damages to the affected consumers.

According to eyewitnesses and fire officials, the fire broke out around 7 p.m. on the 15th floor of the 25-story building, located on Main Street, and quickly spread to adjacent units through flammable materials and cracks in the walls. Residents reported hearing explosions and feeling tremors before they saw flames erupting from the windows and balconies of the affected units. Some people tried to douse the flames with fire extinguishers or water, but were overwhelmed by the intensity and heat of the fire, which spread to the 14th and 16th floors within minutes. Others screamed and ran down the stairs, pushing and shoving each other in the narrow and dimly lit stairwells, while some were trapped or stranded in their units, unable to escape due to smoke, flames or blocked exits. Firefighters arrived at the scene within five minutes of the first alarm and immediately called for backup, as they realized the scale and complexity of the fire. Several fire trucks, ambulances, and police cars rushed to the area, blocking traffic and cordoning off the perimeter. Aerial ladder trucks were also deployed to access the upper floors and spray water from different angles. However, despite their swift and coordinated efforts, the fire continued to spread and intensify, fueled by the air drafts and combustible materials. Over 200 people were evacuated from the building by firefighters and building managers, who used megaphones, alarms, and door-to-door searches to guide people to the exit. Several residents were treated for smoke inhalation, burns, or injuries caused by falls or collisions, and some were transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment. However, there were no fatalities or missing persons reported as of the latest update, which is a testament to the professionalism and bravery of the emergency responders and the residents who cooperated and followed instructions. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but some residents and experts suspect that it may have been triggered by a faulty electrical or gas system, or by careless smoking or cooking. The building, which was constructed in the 1970s and underwent some renovations and inspections in the past few years, did not have sprinklers or a centralized fire alarm system, which may have contributed to the spread and severity of the fire. Some residents expressed frustration and anger at the lack of safety measures in the building and the slow or inadequate response of the management and the authorities. The building is now considered unsafe and uninhabitable until further notice, and the residents are being accommodated in nearby hotels or shelters. The Red Cross, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other agencies are providing assistance and resources to the affected residents and families, who are struggling to cope with the shock, loss, and uncertainty caused by the fire. The building owners and the management company are also facing scrutiny and legal action from the city and the residents, who demand accountability and compensation for their damages and losses. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of fire safety and preparedness in high-density residential buildings, and the need for stronger regulations and enforcement to ensure the well-being of the residents and the community."},{"instruction":"Movie title: The Silence of the Lambs Movie plot: A young F.B.I. cadet must receive the help of an incarcerated and manipulative cannibal killer to help catch another serial killer.

The artist, whose latest painting has caused controversy, has been accused of using another artist’s ideas and imagery without giving credit or compensation. The accusations have come from both fans and critics, who argue that the similarities between the two works are too striking to ignore. While the accused artist denies any wrongdoing, some have called for a review of their portfolio and past works, to see if there are any other instances of plagiarism. Others have been more forgiving, suggesting that perhaps the artist was simply inspired by the other work and didn't realize they were copying it. Regardless of the intentions behind the work, the accusations have caused a stir in the art community, with many questioning the ethics of the accused artist. Some have even gone as far as to call for a boycott of their work.

The move comes as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to grapple with the worst Ebola outbreak in its history. The four drugs are mAb114, ZMapp, remdesivir, and REGN3470-3471-3479. Though all four drugs have undergone human testing, only mAB114 has been administered to patients in the current outbreak. As per WHO officials, these drugs will be tested on a target group comprising of patients who are asymptomatic. These tests will be carried out over the next few weeks, with the objective of finding a more conclusive and reliable treatment for Ebola. Authorities believe that a more effective treatment regimen will help slow the spread of the virus. According to Nature, mAb114 has already shown some promise in treating Ebola.

The doctor, who had contracted the virus while treating patients in the DRC, received a single dose of mAb114 and subsequently fully recovered within a few days, which is an encouraging sign towards the efficiency of the drug. Malaria medicines and the antiviral tuberculosis drug have been under consideration for treatment.

With advancements in technology, it is becoming easier for employees to work from anywhere, be it their homes or any other location. This trend is having a considerable impact on traditional office spaces. One of the main benefits of telecommuting is cost-saving. Companies are able to save on office space, utility bills, and other overhead expenses. Employees are able to save on commuting costs, such as gas or public transportation fares. This has a positive impact on the environment as well, as fewer cars are on the road, reducing carbon emissions. With telecommuting, employees have more flexibility in terms of working hours, which enables them to better balance their work and personal lives. This flexibility increases job satisfaction and productivity, as employees have a greater sense of control over their work. Another benefit of telecommuting is that it allows companies to tap into a larger talent pool. Physical proximity is no longer a limiting factor, enabling companies to hire employees from virtually anywhere in the world. This also increases diversity within the workplace, which can lead to new perspectives and ideas. However, the rise of telecommuting also presents new challenges for traditional office spaces. With a reduction in the number of employees physically present in the office, companies may need to rethink the design and layout of their workspaces. For example, they could move towards creating more collaborative spaces where employees can come together to work on projects, instead of traditional individual cubicles. Additionally, companies may need to invest in new technology and software to ensure that remote employees are able to stay connected and collaborate seamlessly with their colleagues. This may include implementing video conferencing tools and other online communication platforms. In conclusion, telecommuting is a rising trend that has significant implications for traditional office spaces. While it may bring about challenges, the benefits of greater work-life balance, cost savings, and expanded talent pools outweigh the potential drawbacks. Companies should embrace this trend and adapt their workplaces accordingly to reap the benefits."},{"instruction":"The music sounded much better when the volume was _____ than when it was low.
