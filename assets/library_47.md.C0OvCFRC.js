It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels. Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.30.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.38.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop...  - Newborn screening is a public health program of screening in infants shortly after birth for a list of conditions that are treatable, but not clinically evident in the newborn period. Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done, in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease. Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper, however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant's pediatrician or primary care physician.  - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life.  - Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability, and mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disability affects about 23% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic cases account for 3050% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013.  - Jean H.

Usage: The passage is about a situation where Larijani, presumably a political figure, has asked the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany in early November to resume nuclear negotiations. The European Union requires that Iran implements a resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before resuming the talks. There's also mention of how the United States accuses Iran of secretively developing nuclear weapons, which Iran denies as politically motivated. Understanding the content and context of the passage is crucial for generating relevant questions. Part #2: Identifying a temporal relation. Usage: The temporal relation present in the passage is between Larijani forwarding a letter in early November for resuming bilateral nuclear negotiations and the EU insisting that the IAEA resolution must be implemented by Iran before the reopening of nuclear talks. The temporal relation 'before' signifies a sequential order of events- one event happening before another. Part #3: Generating a question about an event.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less oxygen is switched with carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect more oxygen enters alveoli.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less oxygen being switched with carbon dioxide in the bloodstream can have an indirect effect on the process of more oxygen entering the alveoli. Step by step analysis: 1. When less oxygen is exchanged with carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, it implies that the oxygen concentration in the blood is reduced and the carbon dioxide concentration is increased. 2. An elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood can cause a decrease in blood pH, making it more acidic. This condition is known as respiratory acidosis. 3. The body, in response to respiratory acidosis, will try to maintain homeostasis by stimulating chemoreceptors that detect changes in blood pH. 4. As a result, these chemoreceptors send signals to the brain to increase the respiratory rate. An increased respiratory rate means that the diaphragm and other muscles will contract more frequently, pushing more air out of the lungs and subsequently drawing more air into the lungs. 5. With increased airflow into the lungs, more oxygen will enter the alveoli. This increase in oxygen supply may help alleviate the initial problem of reduced oxygen exchange in the bloodstream. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of less oxygen being exchanged with carbon dioxide indirectly affects the process of more oxygen entering the alveoli through the body's regulatory mechanisms attempting to restore homeostasis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century  Do you have any questions?","output":"and directed at provocative and alluring women who led respectable men to destruction), has been applied to a variety of literary characters from many periods and genres. The femme fatale is often seen as a figure of sexual liberation and agency in a repressive society, which Madame White Snake embodies in a certain sense. Her transgressive behavior and eventual punishment can be seen as both a warning against sexual temptation and societal disobedience and an expression of desire for freedom and autonomy. In \\"The Lust of the White Serpent,\\" we see Madame White Snake as a more passionate and even predatory figure, actively pursuing a man and using her supernatural abilities to lure him into a lascivious relationship. While her actions seem to lead to disaster and punishment, they also highlight her power and the possibility of breaking free from societal norms and expectations. In \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda,\\" Madame White Snake is portrayed as a more nuanced and sympathetic character, willing to do everything for her husband and child, even as her true nature is revealed. This depiction allows readers to see her as both a loving wife and mother and a dangerous supernatural figure, all while recognizing her dual nature and the impossibility of her continued existence in human society. The enduring popularity and influence of these stories and the figure of Madame White Snake in East Asian literature and culture are rooted in her transgressive behavior and the societal strictures she represents and defies. As a supernatural being, she brings excitement, danger, and the taboo into the domestic sphere, turning ordinary life into something extraordinary. As a passionate and ambitious figure who defies societal expectations, the character of Madame White Snake becomes both a cautionary tale and an expression of fascination with beauty, power, and danger, and the limits of human and supernatural connection. The moral lessons taught in these stories may revolve around the risks of indulging in forbidden desires, but the true pleasure and interest in these tales lie in the excitement and appeal of transgression, and the opportunity to explore worlds beyond conventional boundaries. Modern retellings and adaptations of these stories, whether in literature, film, or television, have continued to engage with the themes of seductive power, transgressive behavior, and the challenges of attempting to reconcile the supernatural with the human world. In this way, Madame White Snake remains an enduring and captivating East Asian femme fatale and continues to capture the imagination of audiences across generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: In estimating the resources necessary to put new control technology capacity in place (labor, steel, etc.), the Multipollutant  and  Current Rule Retrofits MWe values of Tables 6-1a, b and c are of greatest interest. Hypothesis: You can estimate the resources you need to do a new control technology capacity. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. To elaborate further, let us first understand the key terms and components of the given premise and hypothesis to provide a more detailed response. 1. Multipollutant and Current Rule Retrofits MWe: These terms refer to the megawatt electric (MWe) capacity of power plants that would be subjected to the retrofit process, which involves upgrading and installing new control technology to reduce their emissions and comply with regulatory standards. 2. Tables 6-1a, b, and c: These tables presumably contain data or information about the MWe values of power plants that need to apply the multipollutant and current rule retrofits, including factors like labor, steel, and other materials required for the implementation process. 3. Control technology capacity: This refers to the capacity of a power plant or facility to efficiently control and mitigate emissions, mainly pollutants as per the required environmental standards. 4. Resources: In this context, resources refer to the workforce, raw materials, and other factors necessary to retrofit power plants and install control technology systems. Now, let's examine the premise and hypothesis: Premise: Essentially, the premise states that to determine the resources required to install new control technology capacity, we should focus on the MWe values given in Tables 6-1a, b, and c. This is because these tables contain the key data regarding the power plants' retrofit capacity, which directly impacts the magnitude of resources required. Hypothesis: According to the hypothesis, it is possible to estimate the resources needed for the installation of new control technology capacity in power plants. When we analyze the premise, it suggests that Tables 6-1a, b, and c contain the most relevant data needed to estimate the required resources for installing new control technology capacity. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, as it supports the idea that it is possible to estimate the resources needed for such an installation based on the information provided in these tables. By considering the MWe values from the tables, along with other factors such as the type of control technology, regulatory requirements, and existing infrastructure, one can estimate the necessary labor, steel, and other materials required to effectively implement new control technology capacity in power plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"However, unemployment is at 32 percent, and the average black income is one-sixth the average white one.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Despite this age, America still remains racist and unjust.\\" Step 2: Evaluate whether the premise supports the hypothesis. The premise provides statistics on unemployment and income disparities between black and white Americans. This information showcases an economic disparity between the two racial groups. Step 3: Consider if the premise necessarily entails the hypothesis. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to assess whether the given economic disparities alone can conclusively prove that America still remains racist and unjust. It is important to consider other possible explanations for these disparities, such as historical factors, educational opportunities, and regional economic differences, among others. Step 4: Conclusion While the premise highlights a significant economic disparity between black and white Americans, it does not necessarily entail that America still remains racist and unjust in its entirety.

Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital.

I am planning to go back to India. I am ashamed to be asking for money again. What should I do? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"No, the two questions don't have the same meaning. They are different in nature but still interconnected since they are both related to going back to India. The first question asks about the changes in India between 2010 and 2015, while the second question seeks advice on handling a personal issue related to finances and returning to India. Here, I will provide answers for both questions. 1. Differences between India in 2010 and 2015: Economic Growth: In 2010, India was still recovering from the global economic crisis. During this period, India's growth rate was around 8.8%, whereas in 2015, the growth rate was approximately 7.4%. The economy has faced some ups and downs, but overall, there has been economic growth and development between these years. Government & Policies: The Indian government changed significantly in 2014 when Narendra Modi, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won the general elections. His government has brought several policy changes like Goods and Service Tax (GST), financial inclusion initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), and schemes like Make in India aimed at making India a global manufacturing hub. Technology and Digitalization: During this period, India experienced rapid digitalization with increased access to the internet, smartphones, and e-commerce. In 2015, the government launched the ambitious 'Digital India' initiative to improve the nation's digital infrastructure and promote digital literacy. Urbanization and Infrastructure: Between 2010 and 2015, the pace of urbanization increased with rising migration to cities. Consequently, the demand for better infrastructure led to the development and expansion of metro rail systems, highways, and airports in various cities across the country. Social Issues: There have been continuous efforts to address social issues such as poverty, gender inequality, and education. Additionally, initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan aimed at improving the cleanliness and hygiene of the country were introduced. 2. Advice for managing finances and returning to India: Develop a Plan: First, create a plan for your return, considering factors like your living arrangements, job prospects, and reintegration into society.  Save Money Before Leaving: It's essential to save as much money as possible before returning to India to avoid financial issues. Set aside part of your income for savings and control your expenses. Look for Job Opportunities in India: Utilize online resources and your professional network to look for job opportunities in India. Target industries or sectors that align with your skillset and experience, which will increase your chances of getting a job quickly. Consider Freelancing or Remote Work: If finding a job in India may take time, consider freelancing or remote work, as they offer flexibility and a potential income source while searching for a full-time job. Reach Out to Family and Friends: Talk to your family and friends about your situation. It's essential to have a support system in place when going through difficult times. They might offer temporary financial assistance or help you in finding job opportunities. In conclusion, while the two questions don't have the same meaning, they are related in their concerns of returning to India. It's essential to be aware of the changes that occurred in India between 2010 and 2015 to make the best decision for your reintegration. Furthermore, managing your finances and seeking job opportunities will help ensure a smoother return to India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It's a big country with lots of grasslands and animals in Asia. And do you know that people there have very beautiful and special clothes that they wear on important days? Well, a talented artist named Asya Kozina loves their clothes too, and she decided to make something special out of it. Asya Kozina creates amazing wedding gowns that look like they came straight from a fairy tale, but they are not made of fabric, like most clothes. Instead, she uses a special material that we all know and love – paper! That's right; she makes the gowns out of paper, inspired by traditional Mongolian clothing! So, how does she know what these clothes look like? Well, she studied very old pictures and drawings to learn all about Mongolian culture and the beautiful dresses people wore long ago. You might have seen these kinds of pictures in grandma's photo album, where everything looks brownish, like it's from a very long time ago called sepia photos. Asya chose to use paper to create her gowns because she wanted to show that life and art are connected, just like when you draw pictures or make things out of paper. When you think about it, paper is used for many things in our lives, like drawing, writing, and even making beautiful art, like Asya's gowns. Now, imagine going to a wedding where the bride is wearing one of these incredible paper dresses! It would be like stepping into a magical world where art and life come together.

Alpacino McDaniels, the alleged gunman, and Charles Fuller were charged late last month in the death of Teric Traylor on July 6, 2013.      McDaniels, 29, is facing additional charges of being a felon in possession of a gun, according to court documents. He has previous convictions for drug dealing and evading police.      Both he and Fuller, 31, are scheduled to enter pleas July 14 in Alameda County Superior Court. ||||| OAKLAND -- Two men have been arrested and charged in a July 2013 fatal shooting of a man in West Oakland who had just beaten up one of the suspects, authorities said Wednesday.      Alpacino McDaniels, 29, whose street name police said is Capone, and Charles Fuller, 31, have been charged with murder in the death of Teric Traylor, 23.      McDaniels, who police said is the suspected gunman, is also charged with possession of a firearm by a felon.      Authorities said he has four prior felony convictions, three for drug offenses and the fourth for felony evading between 2004 and 2009.      Police said McDaniels and Fuller were good friends and hardly knew Traylor. All lived in Oakland.      Officer Jason Andersen said Fuller and Traylor were involved in a personal dispute that turned into a fist fight about 7:30 a.m. July 6 in the 800 block of Mead Avenue. The subject of the dispute was not released.      Andersen said that after Fuller lost the fight he told McDaniels to shoot Traylor. Traylor was shot on Mead but ran to the 2200 block of San Pablo Avenue around the corner, where he collapsed and died.      McDaniels and Fuller were identified by witnesses and police began looking for them.      McDaniels was arrested June 17 in Rancho Cordova by U.S. marshals. Fuller was arrested June 26 in West Oakland by Officer Mike Osanna.      Andersen said Fuller admitted being in the fist fight but denied being involved in the shooting.

The premise is a direct quote from Jamie Hamon, the executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, saying, \\"This is a major funding crisis for legal aid throughout the state.\\" This statement clearly communicates that Jamie Hamon believes there is indeed a major funding crisis for legal aid in the state. Furthermore, the premise also provides context about Jamie Hamon's position and affiliation with the Access to Justice Foundation, a statewide poverty-law resource center in Lexington, which further validates the perspective. Jamie Hamon is in a position of authority and possesses the relevant knowledge to make an informed statement about the funding situation of legal aid throughout the state. To further emphasize the point, let's break the premise down to analyze its components: 1. Jamie Hamon's statement: The quote from Jamie Hamon is the most important part of the premise, as it is a direct quote reflecting their belief about the state of legal aid funding. 2. Jamie Hamon's position: As the executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, Jamie Hamon's role involves overseeing the organization and addressing statewide issues related to poverty and law. This indicates that they are knowledgeable about the topic and that their statement should be seen as highly credible. 3. The Access to Justice Foundation: The premise specifies that the Access to Justice Foundation is a \\"statewide poverty-law resource center in Lexington,\\" which implies that the scope of the foundation covers the entire state. This further supports the validity of Jamie Hamon's statement, as it reflects their awareness of the funding crisis for legal aid services on a larger scale. It is crucial to understand not only what the statement says, but also the position and context behind it. In this case, the belief expressed by Jamie Hamon is in direct contradiction with the hypothesis in question.

The Pope last night backed military action in Iraq to stop the bloody persecution of thousands of Christians by Islamist fanatics. In a dramatic intervention, Pope Francis said military force could be justified against the murderous extremists of Islamic State in order to counter their ‘unjust aggression’. He also revealed he is considering making an extraordinary visit to northern Iraq to show solidarity with Christians who are being murdered, raped and driven from their homes by the terrorists who have seized control of large swathes of Iraq. Pope Francis has stated military intervention in Iraq is justified to prevent extremists' 'unjust aggression' His intervention came at the end of another day of fast-moving developments in which:. Church leaders have criticised the slow response of the West to the persecution of Christians in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East. But the Pope last night went much further, giving conditional backing to the use of military force to halt the march of Islamic State. Speaking to journalists while returning from a trip to South Korea, Pope Francis indicated he would prefer military action to be backed by the United Nations. Asked if he approved of the unilateral American action on militants he said: ‘In these cases, where there is an unjust aggression, I can only say that it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor. ‘I underscore the verb “stop”. I’m not saying “bomb” or “make war”, just stop. And the means that can be used to stop them must be evaluated.’ He has also claimed he could take a trip to northern Iraq himself to show solidarity with persecuted Christians. A Peshmerga fighter pictured in battle with Islamic State forces 20km east of Mosul, Iraq. Kurdish forces driving near the town of Makhmur, south of Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. The Pope also said he and his advisers were considering whether he might go to northern Iraq himself to show solidarity with persecuted Christians. His comments represent a remarkable about-turn for the Vatican, which has vehemently opposed any military intervention in recent years. Only last year Pope Francis staged a global prayer and fast for peace when the West was threatening air strikes against Syria. But the ferocity of the attacks against Christians in recent weeks has raised the issue of whether intervention in Iraq could be considered a ‘just war’. Mr Cameron yesterday risked charges of complacency after quietly departing for a second summer holiday. The Prime Minister insisted he would remain in charge of Britain’s response to the Iraq crisis during a week-long break to Cornwall. Mr Cameron said he would remain ‘within a few feet’ of his BlackBerry mobile phone even while on the beach. ‘I always make sure there are senior ministers on duty in Westminster,’ he said after delivering a speech in central London. ‘But I don’t hand over the Government to a deputy. Wherever I am, wherever I am in the world, I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry and an ability to manage things should they need to be managed. ‘For the next few days I shall not be terribly far away, so if that’s necessary you will find me at my desk.’ Cameron has been criticised for going on holiday while the atrocities and humanitarian crisis in Iraq intensifies. David Cameron and his wife Samantha at a market on the southwestern coast of Portugal earlier this month. But Labour MP Ann Clwyd, Britain’s former special envoy to Iraq, said it was extraordinary that Mr Cameron was pressing ahead with his holiday at a time of crisis. She told the Daily Mail: ‘The Prime Minister should not be going on holiday at such a volatile time. He’s been sounding off, saying Islamic State is a threat to the West. He is right to do that but it just not acceptable to then push off on holiday.’ Miss Clwyd said Parliament should be recalled to debate the crisis. She said she would back some form of military intervention, including the rescue of an estimated 3,000 women and girls of the Yazidi sect captured by fanatics. Some Tory MPs also added to pressure for a recall of Parliament. Conor Burns said: ‘Parliament should be recalled ... so MPs can debate what is going on in Iraq, and we are very naive if we think that what is unfolding on the streets of Iraq has nothing to do with us.’ Earlier, Mr Cameron insisted the Government has a ‘fully worked through’ strategy to deal with the threat of Islamic State, including police action to tackle supporters in this country. He said Britain was ‘not going to get involved in another war in Iraq’. ‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground,’ he said. ‘Yes, we should use all the assets that we have – our diplomacy, our political relationships, our aid, the military prowess, the expertise that we have to help others ... to put pressure on Islamic State and make sure ... it cannot cause mayhem on our own streets.’ Number 10 said a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’ unless the situation changes. Discussions are currently taking place with authorities in Kurdistan about what military equipment Britain could provide.

Usage: Once installed, the wheel carrier impacted the bolt heads holding the 2nd rail brackets. This problem occurs even after following the instructions and installing the product, which creates further difficulties for the user. Part #5: Inadequate instructions about installing door stops. Usage: There is no explanation about installing the door stops. The customer struggles with installing door stops due to the lack of instruction, leading to issues with the sliding doors. Part #6: Difficulty in making adjustments. Usage: Making an adjustment after the fact requires significant disassembly. The customer points out that adjusting the product after installation is challenging due to the need for substantial disassembly. Part #7: Insufficient number of washers. Usage: The number of washers provided is insufficient to prevent the end of the bolt on the inboard most rail from extending through the bracket so far that it impacts the slider for the inboard door. This statement highlights the insufficient number of washers provided, resulting in the need to add extra washers and paint them to match the hardware. Part #8: Quality of the hardware. Usage: The ONLY reason that I gave this a 2-star instead of 1 star is because the actual hardware is solid and well-finished. The customer acknowledges the quality of the hardware as the only redeeming aspect of this product, preventing a lower rating."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  Which would have higher specific gravity, item A or item B? Answer:","output":"Item A (the Earth) would have a higher specific gravity than item B (the sample of surface rock)."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches enable comprehensive pathogen detection in the clinical microbiology laboratory and have numerous applications for public health surveillance, outbreak investigation, and the diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, practical deployment of the technology is hindered by the bioinformatics challenge of analyzing results accurately and in a clinically relevant timeframe. Here we describe SURPI (''sequence-based ultrarapid pathogen identification''), a computational pipeline for pathogen identification from complex metagenomic NGS data generated from clinical samples, and demonstrate use of the pipeline in the analysis of 237 clinical samples comprising more than 1.1 billion sequences. Deployable on both cloud-based and standalone servers, SURPI leverages two state-of-the-art aligners for accelerated analyses, SNAP and RAPSearch, which are as accurate as existing bioinformatics tools but orders of magnitude faster in performance. In fast mode, SURPI detects viruses and bacteria by scanning data sets of 7-500 million reads in 11 min to 5 h, while in comprehensive mode, all known microorganisms are identified, followed by de novo assembly and protein homology searches for divergent viruses in 50 min to 16 h. SURPI has also directly contributed to real-time microbial diagnosis in acutely ill patients, underscoring its potential key role in the development of unbiased NGS-based clinical assays in infectious diseases that demand rapid turnaround times.   Title: A cloud-compatible bioinformatics pipeline for ultrarapid pathogen identification from next-generation sequencing of clinical samples Output:","output":"True To come up with the answer, I first analyzed the provided paragraph and tried to understand the main points and focus of the research. The paragraph mainly discusses the development and deployment of SURPI, a computational pipeline for pathogen identification from complex metagenomic NGS data, its applications, speed, and accuracy in detecting pathogens, comparison with existing tools, and its potential in clinical settings. Next, I examined the given title, which is \\"A cloud-compatible bioinformatics pipeline for ultrarapid pathogen identification from next-generation sequencing of clinical samples\\". The title clearly describes the core idea of the paragraph – mentioning the primary elements like \\"bioinformatics pipeline\\", \\"ultrarapid pathogen identification\\", \\"next-generation sequencing\\", and \\"clinical samples\\". Additionally, it mentions the \\"cloud-compatible\\" aspect, which relates to the deployment of SURPI, as explained in the paragraph.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy.  But I can use this background: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired.  The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases.  What is an answer for this question: Which camera would have higher beam quality? A:","output":"Based on the provided background information, we can determine that the camera with a smaller aperture, or Camera A, would likely have higher beam quality.  In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on various factors such as focal length, diameter and quality of the input beam, and wavelength. A smaller aperture, like the pinhole in Camera A, will generally lead to better beam quality due to less light being allowed into the camera, resulting in a smaller amount of aberrations. This is because a smaller hole will allow only the most collimated light rays to pass through, thus reducing distortions and improving the beam quality. However, this comes at the cost of reduced power or brightness of the light entering the camera, which might affect the overall exposure and illumination of the photograph. On the other hand, a larger aperture, like the one in Camera B, will let in more light and may enhance some aspects of the image, such as lower noise levels and better performance in low-light situations. However, with the increased light entering the camera, there is a higher likelihood of optical aberrations which may adversely affect the beam quality by allowing uncollimated light rays to enter the camera. In conclusion, Camera A with the smaller pinhole aperture will likely exhibit higher beam quality due to the reduced amount of light allowed to pass through and lower chances of optical aberrations. However, it is essential to consider how the aperture size may affect the overall photographic outcome, as well as other factors such as lens quality, lens focal length, and how these decisions may impact the images that David will be capturing for his photography class."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009.  - Adult Swim is a programming block of the American cable network Cartoon Network that operates at night from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Eastern and Pacific Time. It is programmed by Williams Street Productions, a subsidiary of Turner, which also developed two prior television programming blocks seen on Cartoon Network: Toonami (which later became a block on Adult Swim in 2012) and Miguzi. The name comes from a phrase used by public swimming pools in the United States to label designated times when children are restricted from using the facilities in favor of adults.  - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation.

The series was based on the British sitcom \\"The Worst Week of My Life\\". The show was adapted for American audiences by Fox under the title \\"Worst Week of My Life\\", but a series failed to materialize after the pilot was filmed.  - Childrens Hospital (originally titled Children's Hospital as webisodes) is a satirical American comedy television series and web series that parodies the medical drama genre, created by and starring actor/comedian Rob Corddry. The series began on the web on TheWB.com with ten episodes, roughly five minutes in length, all of which premiered on December 8, 2008. Adult Swim picked up the rights to the show in 2009 and began airing episodes in 2010.  - Cartoon Network is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that operates daily from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM (ET/PT) and is owned by Time Warner through the Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary. It was launched on October 1, 1992.   - A medical drama is a television program in which events center upon a hospital, an ambulance staff, or any medical environment and most medical episodes are one hour long and set in a hospital. Most current medical dramatic programming go beyond the events pertaining to the characters' jobs and portray some aspects of their personal lives. A typical medical drama might have a storyline in which two doctors fall in love. Communications theorist Marshall McLuhan, in his on the nature of media, predicted success for this particular genre on TV because the medium \\"creates an obsession with bodily welfare\\".   - Toonami is a brand name geared towards action-oriented programming, primarily consisting of American animation and Japanese anime. Originally an afternoon and evening block on Cartoon Network and ended on September 20, 2008, it is now (as of May 18, 2012) a late Saturday night adult-orientated animation block on Adult Swim.

Question: Who does Yu suspect as the leak? Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: An elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Later, Park calls Yu and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. It is revealed that Park...

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in the process is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let's analyze each step of the process to better understand how a smaller body size might affect the oxygen reaching the body. 1. Air is taken through the mouth: A smaller body size does not impact this step directly. However, smaller bodies may have smaller airways, affecting the volume of air inhaled during each breath. This reduced volume of air can decrease the amount of oxygen reaching the lungs. 2. Enters the lungs: A smaller body size may result in smaller lungs, which can limit the surface area available for gas exchange. Fewer oxygen molecules can be exchanged in the lungs, leading to a possible decrease in oxygen reaching the body. 3. The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs: In a smaller body, the size of the alveoli (the sacs in your lungs) might be unchanged. However, the total number of alveoli may be reduced due to the smaller overall lung size. This reduction in the number of alveoli can decrease the capacity for oxygen absorption. 4. Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled: A smaller body size may also impact this step indirectly. Smaller lungs may have a reduced capacity for expelling carbon dioxide efficiently. This can lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which, in turn, may impede oxygen transport. 5. The oxygen is passed throughout your body: A smaller body size means less overall tissue and cells that require oxygen. However, with the possible decrease in oxygen absorption and transport due to the factors mentioned in the previous steps, the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues may still be affected. In conclusion, a smaller body size typically indirectly impacts multiple steps in the process. This could initially lead to reduced oxygen absorption and subsequently affect the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. The key factor is that smaller bodies have less overall surface area available for gas exchange, which could result in less oxygen reaching the cells and tissues throughout the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Next, let's move the 42 over to the other side to make it easier. We do that by subtracting 42 from both sides: 0 - 42 = -7 * w + 42 - 42 -42 = -7 * w Now, we want to find out what \\"w\\" is!

Here are some concepts: ray, reflect, sunlight, water What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"The concept of a ray can be easily connected to the natural phenomena of sunlight and reflection, particularly when interacting with a medium such as water, which further highlights the underlying scientific principles in our everyday experiences. A ray, in the context of physics and optics, is an abstract and idealized representation of the propagation of light or electromagnetic radiation through space, depicted as a straight line traveling in a particular direction. Rays are used to model and analyze the behavior of light as it traverses different media and encounters various surfaces or boundaries. Sunlight, as most of us are familiar with, refers to the radiant energy emitted by the sun that reaches the earth as visible and invisible light waves, providing warmth and illumination in our daily lives. The solar spectrum includes a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to visible light and infrared (IR), which play a significant role in various natural processes such as photosynthesis, weather phenomena, and the sustenance of life itself. Reflection, on the other hand, is a fundamental optical process that occurs when light waves encounter a surface or boundary separating two different media. Depending on the angle of incidence and the properties of the materials involved, a portion of the incoming light (called the incident light) may bounce back into the same medium, giving rise to the phenomenon known as reflection. This process is responsible for the formation of images in mirrors, for instance, where light rays from an object are reflected by the mirror's surface before reaching our eyes. Water, a ubiquitous and essential substance on our planet, not only serves as a life-sustaining medium for living organisms but also possesses unique optical properties that enable various light-based phenomena to occur. When sunlight interacts with water, several things happen: some of the light rays may be reflected off the water's surface, while others may be refracted or bent as they enter or exit the liquid medium. As a result, a complex dance of light takes place, giving rise to diverse optical effects such as sparkling reflections, shimmering patterns, and rainbow formations, depending on the specific conditions and viewing angles. Bringing all these concepts together, we can construct a sentence that embodies their essence and interconnectedness: \\"As sunlight reaches the surface of a serene lake, its rays are reflected and refracted by the water, producing a breathtaking spectacle of shimmering light dancing across the rippling waves, accompanied by the vivid colors of a rainbow arching over the distant horizon.\\" This sentence showcases the fascinating interplay between sunlight, reflection, and water, offering a glimpse into the marvels of optical phenomena that enrich our natural world."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: \\"God of War (series)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Options: a. 5 liters, b. 10 liters, c. 15 liters, d. 9 liters, e. 6 liters A:","output":"To find the quantity of water that should be taken out to concentrate the 27 liters of 40% acidic liquid to 60% acidic liquid, we can use the concept of mass balance. Let's denote the volume of water to be removed as x liters. Initially, the total amount of acid in the solution would be 40% of 27 liters: 0.40 * 27 = 10.8 liters (acid content) Once the water is removed, the volume of the resulting solution will be (27 - x) liters. Since we want the acid percentage to be 60%, the amount of acid in the resulting solution should be 60% of (27 - x) liters: 0.60 * (27 - x) = acid content Since the amount of acid doesn't change during the process, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for x: 0.60 * (27 - x) = 10.8 Expanding and solving for x: 16.2 - 0.60x = 10.8 0.60x = 5.4 x = 5.4 / 0.60 x = 9 liters So, the correct answer is: D. 9 liters"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - For the Archdiocese in California , USA , please see Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco ( Latin : Dioecesis Franciscopolitanus ) is in Argentina and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Córdoba .  - A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.  - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.  - The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco (Latin: \\"Archdioecesis Sancti Francisci\\"; Spanish: \\"Archidiócesis de San Francisco\\") is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the northern California region of the United States. It covers the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of Marin and San Mateo. The Archdiocese of San Francisco was canonically erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.    What is the relationship between 'roman catholic diocese of san francisco' and 'diocese of the catholic church'? The answer to this question is:","output":"The relationship between 'Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco' and 'Diocese of the Catholic Church' is that the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco is a specific diocese within the larger structure of the Catholic Church.

In this case, the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the northern California region of the United States, covering the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of Marin and San Mateo.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? In our Hello World program, we printed out a string for the user to see, but the interactive part of programs is when the user gets to enter input into the program. We will now extend our program to prompt the user for his or her name and then greet the user by his or her name. In Java, we have some built in libraries that we have access to, but we have to import them. One of these libraries is java.util, which contains the Scanner object that we need to get user input. In order to import the Scanner class, we add the following line to the beginning of our code.   import java.util.Scanner;    This tells our program that we want to use the Scanner object which exists in the package java.util. If we wanted to have access to every object in the java.util package, we simply write import java.util.*; at the beginning of our code. Java is an object-oriented programming language, so it represents concepts using objects. The Scanner object is an example of an object that has fields and methods. In order to use the Scanner class, we have to create a new Scanner object that we can populate the fields of and use the methods of. To do this, we write:   Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);     userInputScanner is the name of the Scanner object that we just instantiated. Note that the name is written in camel case; this is the convention for naming variables in Java. We use the new operator to create a new instance of an object. So, in this instance, we created a new instance of the Scanner object by writing new Scanner(System.in). The Scanner object takes in a parameter that tells the object what to scan. In this case, we put in System.in as a parameter. System.in tells the program to scan the input from the system, which is the input that the user will type into the program. We have to prompt the user for an input so that the user knows when to type something into the console. This can be accomplished with a System.out.print or a System.out.println.   System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\"); The Scanner will always be taking in data on what the user is typing in. The following line will ask the Scanner to take what the user has typed in for his or her name and store it in a variable:   String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine();    In Java, the convention for using an object's method is objectName.methodName(parameters). In userInputScanner.nextLine(), we are calling our Scanner object by the name we just gave it and then we are calling its method nextLine() which does not take in any parameters. Note that we are storing the next line in another object: the String object. We have named our String object userInputName Now that we have the user's name stored, we can print out a greeting to the user. Remember the System.out.println(\\"Hello World.\\"); that we wrote in the main class? All of the code that we just wrote should go above that line. Now we can modify that line to say:   System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\");    The way we chained up \\"Hello \\", the user's name, and \\"!\\" by writing \\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\" is called String concatenation. What's happening here is that we have three strings: \\"Hello \\", userInputName, and \\"!\\". Strings in Java are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed. So when we are concatenating these three strings, we are essentially created a new string that contains the greeting. Then we take this new string and feed it as a parameter to System.out.println. Our code should now look like this:   import java.util.Scanner;  public class HelloWorld {     public static void main(String[] args) {         Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);         System.out.print(\\"What's your name? \\");         String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine();         System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + userInputName + \\"!\\");     } } Go into command prompt or terminal and run the same commands as we ran for our first iteration of HelloWorld.java. We have to first compile the program: javac HelloWorld.java. Then we can run it: java HelloWorld.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – Two months after police in Salt Lake City, Utah, shot and killed 50-year-old black man Patrick Harmon, the Salt Lake County district attorney determined Wednesday their use of deadly force was justified. Soon after, the police department released body cam footage of the shooting, sparking outrage among many in the community who believe Officer Clinton Fox shot Harmon in the back unnecessarily, CNN reports. Even District Attorney Sim Gill says when he first saw the video he thought, \\"Oh my god, this isn't right,\\" CBS News reports. But after slowing the video down Gill says one could see Harmon pivoting toward the officers. Since Harmon was shot in the side, and since a knife police claim Harmon was holding was found at the scene, Gill determined the officers feared for their safety. Members of Harmon's family say they see things differently, especially after viewing the footage Thursday. They say Harmon, who had been pulled over by the officers after riding his bicycle across six lanes of traffic without a red tail light on Aug. 13, was bipolar and schizophrenic. One of Harmon's nieces, Alisha Shaw, told the Guardian, \\"They just murdered him flat-out.\\" The Salt Lake City Police Department had received praise before the shooting for its implementation of de-escalation training, which had resulted in more than two-and-a-half years without a fatal officer-involved shooting in the city. But, according to a local Black Lives Matter activist, that training failed Patrick Harmon. “That officer disregarded his de-escalation training,” Lex Scott says. “How could anyone with eyes and ears believe that that officer was justified?”","output":"A man named Patrick Harmon was shot by a police officer in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was 50 years old and African-American. The people in charge of the city decided that the police officers were allowed to do this because Patrick made them scared for their safety. They said he was holding a knife and turned towards the officers. Many people in the community are really upset about this, because they think the police officer didn't need to shoot Patrick. When the people in charge first saw the video of the shooting, they thought it was wrong too. But after watching the video more slowly, they decided that it was okay for the police officer to shoot Patrick because he turned towards them. Patrick's family is very sad and angry. They say that he had some problems with his mind, like being bipolar and schizophrenic, which means he might have been acting strange or confused. Patrick's niece, Alisha, says that she thinks the police officer just killed her uncle without a good reason. Before this happened, the Salt Lake City Police Department had been doing a good job at not hurting people when they didn't have to. They had been practicing how to calm situations down without using violence. But some people, like Lex Scott from the Black Lives Matter group, think that the police officer didn't use this special training when he shot Patrick. She says, \\"How could anyone with eyes and ears believe that that officer was justified?\\" This means that she doesn't understand how anyone could think that it was okay for the police officer to shoot Patrick."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment , to human health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the hazardous lead components.  Now, I have a new situation: John is trying to buy a house. Today, he saw two houses, house A and house B. House A was build in the 1920s. It has lead plumbing pipes and lead based paint. House B was build recently. It does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead based paint.  Answer this question please: Would house A less likely or more likely cause brain damage than house B? A:","output":"House A would be more likely to cause brain damage than House B. Reasoning: From the information given, we understand that lead is known to cause brain damage, particularly in small children who are more likely to chew on objects painted with lead-based paint. Furthermore, it's mentioned that House A was built in the 1920s and has lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint, both of which are potential sources of lead exposure. On the other hand, House B, which was built recently, has neither lead-based paint nor lead plumbing pipes. Therefore, occupants of House A are more likely to be exposed to lead, and consequently, have a higher risk of brain damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: With Shipwreck Treasure Easier to Reach, a Duel Is On MIAMI — The Spanish galleon San José was overloaded with 200 passengers and 700 tons of cargo on a summer night in 1631 when it smashed into a rock off the Pacific coast of Panama, spilling silver coins and bars into the Gulf of Panama. More than 400,000 coins and at least 1,417 bars were lost over a 40-mile trail. Four hundred years later, that shipwreck has become one of the latest to land in a legal quagmire over who should have the rights to historic artifacts trapped under the sea. This one involves the United Nations, the United States Department of Homeland Security, the government of Panama and Americans accused of being pirates. At issue is whether private companies should be able to claim and profit from historic treasures. Those questions are of particular interest to businesses in South Florida at a time when technology is making it easier to find and recover sunken loot. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that there are over 1,000 shipwrecks in the Florida Keys alone. In the case of the San José booty, commercial treasure hunters, financed in part by an adventure entrepreneur who runs tours to the Titanic, spent over 2 million and 10 years recovering portions of the treasure, only to see their permits questioned and bounty confiscated. “They called us thieves, looters, plunderers and pirates,” said Dan Porter, a Florida captain who led the expedition to find the San José. “That’s an insult. I hold this work in the highest regard.” But the industry is engaged in a battle with academic marine archaeologists and Unesco, the Paris-based United Nations agency that tries to protect cultural treasures around the world. Critics say buried coins and loot should be studied and preserved in a museum, not sported around an investor’s neck. “Treasure hunters are to maritime archaeologists what astrologers are to astronomers,” said Filipe Castro, a nautical archaeologist at Texas A&M University. The Department of Homeland Security has opened an investigation into the case, and several criminal complaints are pending in Panama. Those actions underscore the perils that often accompany maritime salvage recovery, particularly as nations become increasingly sensitive to the cultural significance of underwater treasures. In the colonial era, Spain sent fleets to the new world to excavate gold and silver from places like Bolivia and Peru, but hurricanes and other mishaps often sent ships and the gold they carried to unreachable depths. Pirates and plunderers have long sought to recover them. As technology to find them has improved in recent decades, many legitimate companies have begun hunting, too, only to find their discoveries challenged in court. Panama was so committed to preventing plundering that in 2003, it became among the first countries to sign a United Nations treaty protecting underwater cultural heritage. But at the same time, Panama’s Ministry of Economy and Finance granted a contract giving salvage rights along its waters to a company called Investigaciones Marinas del Istmo, or IMDI. Investors included a former Panamanian governor; a Mexican-American engineer; Mike McDowell, an Australian adventure entrepreneur; and — for a different IMDI salvage project — Pat Croce, a former owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. IMDI spent about 10 years fighting legal challenges. The company prevailed, and, with permits and court verdicts in hand, the subaquatic dig for the San José went on. Panamanian government inspectors supervised the project, and a “world class” conservation lab was built to log and preserve each discovery, the company said. Among other items, divers found gold and diamond jewelry, pottery, and nearly 10,000 silver coins, worth up to 1,000 each. Only one 60-pound silver bar was recovered. Based on the contract, the government got to keep anything it considered historically relevant, plus 35 percent of everything else. Some Panamanian government officials objected to the deal and brought in Unesco, which sent a task force to Panama to review the project. Excavation stopped. Even after the haul was divided and the government received its share, the country’s comptroller noted a number of irregularities in the contract, questioned its validity and requested an investigation into how it had been obtained. “The government stopped us, even though we did everything by the book,” said Alberto Vásquez, an IMDI vice president. This summer, when Mr. Vásquez emerged from a bank in Panama City where he had gone to retrieve some of the company’s share of coins that were stored in a safe deposit box, the government seized 3,000 coins, saying he did not have permission to transport it. In September, Captain Porter, who led an expedition, returned to Florida with his 100 coins, worth about 500 or 600 each. The United States Border Patrol boarded his salvage vessel, searched it with dogs for six hours and confiscated the coins. Citing an open investigation, Nestor J. Yglesias, a spokesman for Homeland Security Investigations, the criminal investigation arm of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to comment. Panamanian government officials requested a list of questions from The New York Times, but did not respond to them, despite repeated requests. Ulrike Guérin, who runs Unesco’s underwater culture program, said it was not up to the United Nations to determine the legality of IMDI’s contract, but she stressed that the agency was pleased to see Panama stepping up to stop treasure hunting. Ms. Guérin said Unesco was trying to stop commercial salvagers around the world because they regularly destroy sites without giving any consideration to historical preservation or environmental damage. The divers take special care to preserve valuables such as coins, but disregard precious pottery if it looks too cracked to sell, she said. “This is a fishy business of treasure hunting,” she said in a telephone interview. “I have not seen any case that was a success and everyone liking it. It ends up in a slaughter, destroying the heritage.” James A. Goold, a lawyer in Washington, often steps in on Spain’s behalf when commercial shipwreck divers try to claim long-lost treasures, including some the government believes were fakes. “These ships are time capsules that are irreplaceable and should be preserved for public benefit for study by cultural authorities and archaeologists,” Mr. Goold said. In October, Mr. Goold sent notice to a Tampa company, Global Marine Exploration, which is looking for ships from a 1715 Spanish fleet lost in a hurricane, warning that Spain has not given up its rights long-lost vessels. In 2009, a leading Tampa treasure-hunting company was ordered to return 17 tons of gold and silver from the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes, which sank off Portugal in 1804. Treasure hunters are hoping for a compromise. “You should look at these more like an airplane crash or car crash,” said James J. Sinclair, a marine archaeologist hired by IMDI to evaluate the finds. “You don’t leave them at the side of the road and preserve them forever.”","output":"The recovery of treasure from shipwrecks is leading to legal conflict. Spanish galleon, the San José, wrecked off Panama in 1631 resulting in the loss of several million dollars’ worth of silver coins and bars. A legal dispute is now taking place involving the United Nations, the US Department of Homeland Security, the Panamanian government and US entrepreneurs over whether private firms should be able to claim and profit from such treasure. This controversy is particularly significant in areas like South Florida where new technology is making it easier to locate and salvage sunken valuables."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Tai Wo Station is a station on Hong Kong 's East Rail Line .

Given the question: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.  Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress.  Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","output":"The northern region of Italy has fewer species inhabiting it due to the higher levels of abiotic stress. Abiotic stress refers to the negative impact of non-living factors, such as extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, or pollution, on the living organisms in a specific environment.  In the context of the two distinct regions in Italy, the northern region exposes animals to a greater amount of abiotic stress than the southern region. This heightened level of stress results in a less hospitable environment for living organisms, thus reducing the number of species able to thrive in that area. Additionally, the northern region's harsher conditions make it more difficult for species to adapt and maintain stable populations. Conversely, the southern region of Italy experiences a more moderate climate and fewer abiotic stressors, creating a more welcoming environment for species. As a result, this region tends to have a higher level of biodiversity. When an environment is less stressful, it can support a greater variety of species, as those species are not under constant pressure to survive and can instead focus on reproduction and adaptation to their surroundings. The relationship between abiotic stress and endangered species is essential to understanding how ecosystems function and how human actions can impact biodiversity. An increase in abiotic stress often leads to a decline in species populations, putting them at risk of becoming threatened, endangered, or even extinct. For instance, as the northern region of Italy experiences more abiotic stress, the number of species declines in comparison to the southern region. Consequently, the species in the northern region face a higher risk of becoming endangered or extinct. Beyond the case of Italy, it is crucial to study and address the causes of abiotic stress in ecosystems worldwide. Factors such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution can exacerbate abiotic stressors, resulting in further loss of biodiversity and the destabilization of ecosystems. Conservation efforts must focus on mitigating these stressors and implementing strategies to help species adapt to changing conditions, ultimately preserving and promoting biodiversity across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"While it is clear that both sentences are referring to the same rule that became effective in the year 2000, the second sentence provides additional information not present in the first sentence. Specifically, it mentions that the rule was approved by the Senate. Therefore, to evaluate the truth value of the second sentence, given that the first sentence is true, we need to examine the information provided in both sentences. The first sentence states that the new rule became effective on December 7, 2000. We can assume this is true. Given this information, we know the following: 1. There is a rule. 2. It became effective in the year 2000. 3. The specific date it became effective is December 7, 2000. Now let's examine the second sentence. It states that the rule became effective in 2000 after being approved by the Senate. This sentence provides additional information not found in the first sentence, mainly the approval by the Senate. However, we can still evaluate the parts of this sentence given what we know from the first sentence: 1. The rule we're discussing is the same rule as in the first sentence. 2. It also became effective in the year 2000, which matches the information from the first sentence. From this evaluation, the only part we cannot determine the truth value of is the approval by the Senate statement. However, as both sentences agree on the rule becoming effective in the year 2000, and the main part of the second sentence refers to its approval, it is plausible that the second sentence is true. Thus, given the information provided in the first sentence, and assuming there is no contradictory information about the Senate approval, we can reasonably assume that the second sentence is likely true. To be absolutely certain, though, we would need external confirmation about the Senate approval."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the east coast of Nicaragua, the North Atlantic Fleet protected cruiser USS Tacoma  was ordered to Bluefields, Nicaragua, where she arrived on August 6 and landed a force of 50 men to protect American lives and property. A force of 350 U.S. Marines shipped north on the collier USS Justin from the Canal Zone and disembarked at Managua to reinforce the legation guard on August 15, 1912. Under this backdrop, Denver and seven other ships from the Pacific Fleet arrived at Corinto, Nicaragua, from late August to September 1912, under the command of Rear Admiral W.H.H. Southerland. USS Denver, commanded by Commander Thomas Washington arrived at Corinto on August 27, 1912, with 350 navy bluejackets and Marines on board.

Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action. A sleeping gas, which one of the hijackers secretly installed before the flight, is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers moves forward with the hijacking, and Stevens' Flight 23 \\"disappears\\" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at nearly 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle.

Q: Sasha threatened everyone in the room with detention if they kept talking.  Given the context: How would you describe Sasha? Choices: - irritated - laid back - threatened A:","output":"In the given context, Sasha could be described as irritated. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that when people are in a position of authority or responsibility, such as an educator or manager, they often need to maintain a certain level of control in order to effectively communicate important information or maintain a conducive environment for learning or work. When their surroundings are noisy or chaotic, this typically interferes with their ability to carry out their tasks effectively, which can lead to feelings of frustration and, ultimately, irritation. In this question, Sasha resorts to threatening everyone in the room with detention if they continue talking. This action implies that they have reached a point where their patience has worn thin, and the noise or disruption must be addressed immediately to restore order. Threatening detention is a means to convey the message that the disturbance caused by the issue at hand is not tolerable, and that strict measures will be taken to quell it. Thus, based on the available information, it is reasonable to infer that Sasha is irritated. The other provided choices – laid back and threatened – are not accurate descriptors of Sasha's behavior in the given context. A laid back individual is typically more casual and relaxed, unlikely to resort to such strict measures as threatening detention, while someone who feels threatened may still be assertive or afraid but is not necessarily irritated by the situation. In conclusion, evaluating the context and understanding Sasha's actions, it becomes evident that the appropriate description for Sasha's state in this situation is \\"irritated.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Option (a): Yes - If we choose this option, we would be saying that Sentence 2 is also true if Sentence 1 is true.

Option (c): No - If we choose this option, we would be saying that if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 is false. However, this is not necessarily accurate either because these sentences don't contradict each other directly. Sentence 1 is talking about the niceness of the vans while Sentence 2 is talking about the riskiness, and these traits aren't mutually exclusive. It's possible for big vans to be both nice and risky at the same time. So, our answer is: Option (b): It is not possible to tell - This option fits best since Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 assess different traits of big vans.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\".  - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\").  - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs.  - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.  - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.  - The Union Association was a league in Major League Baseball which lasted for only one season in 1884 . St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season . Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August , and four teams folded during the season and were replaced . Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league , this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians , most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract . The league had a number of major league players ( on the St. Louis franchise , at least ) , but the league 's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues . James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league either . The earliest record he could find of the Union Association as a major league was Ernest Lanigan 's The Baseball Cyclopedia , published in 1922 . For example , the league 's only \`\` star '' player , Fred Dunlap , led the league in batting average with .412 ( 86 points higher than his second - best season and 120 points higher than his career average ) , on - base percentage , slugging percentage , runs scored , hits , total bases , and home runs ( with just 13 , typical for the era ) . After the league folded , Dunlap never hit more than .274 or more than 10 home runs until he retired in 1891 , another measure of the inferior quality of the Union Association . Of the 272 players in the Association , 107 ( 39.34 % ) never played in another major league , while 72 ( 26.47 % ) played very briefly ( less than 300 at bats and / or 50 hits ) in other major leagues , and 79 ( 29.04 % ) had longer careers but little success in other major leagues .

Seeing the car rolling towards the group, she instinctively jumped into action and pushed a 2-year-old girl out of the path of the oncoming vehicle, protecting the young child from potential fatal harm. Tragically, however, Kiera was unable to avoid the vehicle herself and was struck by it. She was transported to a nearby hospital, but she ultimately succumbed to her injuries. Praise and Remembrance: The California Highway Patrol officer who responded to the incident shared candid admiration for Kiera's heroism, stating, \\"A child died heroically...she sacrificed herself for another small child.\\" This sentiment was echoed by Alissa Jenkins, the mother of the 2-year-old Kiera saved, who said, \\"She is truly a hero. She will forever be my kids' guardian angel...she saved both my daughters' lives.\\" Financial Support for Kiera's Family: In the wake of Kiera's untimely passing, a GoFundMe page was set up to help her family cover funeral costs. The overwhelming support the family received resulted in more than 45,000 raised, demonstrating the profound impact Kiera's brave actions had on both her local community and beyond. Investigation and Prevention: As the community mourns the loss of a young hero, authorities are working tirelessly to determine how the parked car, which was off at the time, shifted into neutral and began rolling down the driveway. Understanding the circumstances surrounding this tragic event is vital in preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future. Conclusion: While no words can truly capture the magnitude of Kiera Larsen's heroic actions, her memory will live on through the lives she saved and the hearts she touched. The strength and selflessness she displayed in the face of imminent danger remind us that even the youngest among us can make an incredible impact on the world. Kiera leaves a lasting legacy of heroism, and her story serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lilith is a character that some people believe was in the Bible, but she is not mentioned directly in it. According to a story outside of the Bible, she was thought to be Adam's first wife before Eve. Some describe her as a powerful, independent woman, but there isn't much information about her in the Bible. Question 2: Why is Lilith, the first wife of Adam, not mentioned in the Bible? Lilith is not mentioned in the Bible because she is mostly part of a legend or story separate from the Bible. The Bible talks about Adam and Eve as the first man and woman, and Lilith is not included in those teachings. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, they are not the same question. Question 1 asks who Lilith was in the Bible, and Question 2 asks why she is not mentioned in it.

Answer choices: - congestion  - anemia  - constipation  - sweating  - hives  - energy usage  - dehydration  - heat energy A:","output":"Caffeine consumption can cause several side effects, including dehydration. The consumption of caffeine can lead to the following effects: 1. Dehydration: Caffeine is a mild diuretic, which means it increases the production of urine and can lead to dehydration if you don't consume enough water alongside it. 2. Sweating: Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, which can lead to an increase in body temperature and an increase in sweating as the body tries to cool itself down. 3. Energy usage: Caffeine acts as a stimulant, increasing alertness and energy levels in the short term. This effect can lead to increased work capacity and endurance, but it may also result in energy crashes or fatigue later on. 4. Constipation: Caffeine can sometimes cause constipation by slowing down the movement of the gut or by increasing dehydration if not enough water is consumed. 5. Anemia: While caffeine doesn't directly cause anemia, it can interfere with iron absorption. If a person drinks large amounts of caffeine, they might be at a higher risk for anemia if they don't have a balanced diet and proper iron intake. 6. Congestion: Although caffeine can have a decongestant effect in some cases, excessive consumption may lead to symptoms similar to congestion, such as headaches, sinus pressure, or difficulty focusing. 7. Hives: In some cases, hypersensitivity or allergy to caffeine can manifest in symptoms such as hives, itching, or skin rashes. 8. Heat energy: Caffeine increases metabolic rate, which means the body generates more heat energy. This can contribute to sweating and a sense of increased internal temperature. While caffeine is not directly responsible for all of these side effects, excessive consumption or individual reactions might lead to one or more of them. It is essential to consume caffeine in moderation to minimize the risk of these negative outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The cat of Joseph had bad behavior compared to that of Jeffrey because  Choose your answer from: (A). Joseph took care of it.; (B). Jeffrey took care of it.;","output":"(B). Jeffrey took care of it. Joseph always wondered why his cat had a worse attitude than Jeffrey's. Upon closer observation, he finally figured out that it was because Jeffrey took care of it. Jeffrey, being an animal lover, often spent time caring for Joseph's cat when Joseph was not at home. He would feed the cat, play with it, and even clean up after it. It was clear that the cat had grown fond of Jeffrey and behaved better when he was around. In contrast, Joseph had a busy schedule and often neglected his cat. He would forget to feed the cat properly and rarely spent quality time with it. Over time, the cat grew distant and bitter towards Joseph, resulting in its bad behavior. Joseph knew that he needed to address the issue immediately. Here is how he planned to do it: Step 1: Spend more time with the cat. Joseph realized that one major cause of the cat's bad behavior was a lack of attention from him. He decided to set aside at least 30 minutes each day to play with the cat and cater to its needs. Step 2: Improve the cat's living environment. Joseph decided to invest in a more comfortable bed, better quality toys, and a scratching post for his cat. He believed that providing a better environment would improve the cat's mood and, therefore, its behavior. Step 3: Follow a proper feeding routine. Joseph acknowledged that inconsistent feeding was another cause of his cat's frustration. He planned to set specific meal times to ensure that the cat would not be left hungry or overfed. Step 4: Seek professional advice. If the cat's behavior did not improve, Joseph considered consulting with a veterinarian or a pet behaviorist to explore potential underlying issues. Step 5: Monitor the cat's behavior changes. Finally, Joseph decided that he would closely monitor the cat's behavior over the next few months. He would keep a record of any incidents and observe if there were any improvements. By following these steps, Joseph hoped to mend the bond between him and his cat, resulting in better behavior and a happier relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jennifer’s actions are solely taken in the best interest of their son,” the statement concluded.      Hudson, 36, and Otunga, 37, are parents to 8-year-old David Daniel Otunga Jr.      Otunga’s attorney, Tracy M.

Kevin Mazur/WireImage      “Mr. Otunga has never abused or harassed Ms. Hudson or their son, and it is unfortunate, especially in today’s climate, that she would feel the need to make these false allegations against him. Mr. Otunga looks forward to his day in court and in being awarded the residential care of the parties’ only child,” a part of the statement read.      Former pro wrestler Otunga proposed to Hudson in September 2008 after less than a year of dating. The couple welcomed their only child nearly a year later in August 2009.      About a month after becoming engaged, Hudson’s mother, Darnell Donerson, and her brother, Jason Hudson, were found fatally shot in a Chicago home.

Sources familiar with the case tell TMZ, Hudson went to court Thursday without telling Otunga and got an order of protection, claiming he is a risk to both her and their 8-year-old son, David Jr.      The police came, allowed Otunga to pack a bag and ordered him out.      Sources tell TMZ the catalyst for the order of protection is turf and custody war. Our sources say the couple has been broken up for several months ... after David allegedly found out Hudson was dating someone else.

We're told the couple has been negotiating a custody arrangement for the last few weeks, but the negotiations broke down after both David and Jennifer dug in ... each wanting primary physical custody of their son.      Our sources say Jennifer demanded that David leave the home, and when it became apparent he wasn't going to comply she went to court for the order of protection. She's also filed a petition for full physical custody. ||||| Jennifer Hudson may not have her fairytale ending with David Otunga after all.

Step 2: Evaluate the options - Based on the given context, we need to examine each proposed ending to see if it reasonably completes the paragraph. (A). blow dry his legs - It is unlikely that they would blow dry his legs after having just applied wax. This choice does not present a logical conclusion to the process of waxing. (B). rip the wax off his legs one strip at a time - This choice is both logical and relevant. Waxing involves applying wax to a person's body, then quickly removing the wax to pull out hair from the follicles. This ending correctly describes the next step in waxing.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Select from the following.  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"2). yes; According to the paragraph, the post Revolutionary War kings of the Netherlands were Napoleon's brother Louis and William of Orange. First, Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland. Later, after French power started to decline, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. The other option, no, is incorrect because the paragraph clearly states these two as the post Revolutionary War kings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The House on Sorority Row Context: Seven sorority sisters pull a prank on their strict house mother, Mrs. Slater, who is known for carrying a sharp walking cane. Their plan is to put her cane out in their dirty pool and force her at gunpoint to retrieve it. The prank goes awry when Vicki, believing the gun to be loaded with blanks, shoots Slater who collapses and appears to be dead. The girls agree to hide the body in the pool until their graduation party is finished. As the party begins, a guest wanders around the pool and an unidentified figure stabs him through the throat with Slater's cane. When other guests attempt to throw Jeanie in the pool, they are stopped by the sorority sisters. The girls realize that if the pool lights get switched on they will reveal Slater's body, so Stevie goes into the power room to disable them. While doing so, she is brutally stabbed to death by the same cane-wielding figure. Later, the pool lights do come on, but Slater's body is no longer in the pool.

Write a summary based on this article: A zoo in the Egyptian capital Cairo has vehemently denied claims that it tried to pass off donkeys as zebras by painting them black and white.      Egyptian student Mahmoud Sarhan exposed the alleged masquerade in a Facebook photo, in which he is seen posing next to one of the offending animals at Cairo’s International Garden park.      The beast appears to have unusually large ears as well as suspicious blotches of black on its snout and body, but Sahran wrote in the photo caption that it was the animal’s recognizable braying sound that well and truly gave it away.

However, a veterinarian told news outlet Extranews that he concurred with the disgruntled student, pointing out that real zebras have dark snouts, not striped ones.      Follow @Kalvapalle ||||| A zoo has denied painting black stripes on a donkey to make it look like a zebra, following a series of images which appeared online.      Mahmoud Sarhan, an Egyptian student, posted pictures of the animal on Facebook after visiting Cairo’s International Garden park. He said the donkey enclosure featured two painted animals.      Experts were quick to agree with Mr Sarhan’s assessment.      Alex Adams, a wildlife biologist and researcher at Colorado State University, said there was no doubt it was something other than a zebra.      “The stripes (on a zebra) are always defined, never smudged, and zebras can be small but never that small,” he told The Independent.      “The ears are rounded, not oblong and pointy, and of course zebras have black skin, answering that age-old question of them being black with white stripes.”      World news in pictures 51 show all World news in pictures 1/51 26 July 2018 Former cricketer Imran Khan has claimed victory in Pakistan's general election, following the nation's violent day at the polls yesterday.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose anger and frustration over his marriage can be evidenced in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904?  While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie.

Please answer this question: when did the nashville predators become a team?","output":"The Nashville Predators joined the National Hockey League (NHL) as an expansion team in 1998. The journey towards the establishment of the franchise began several years prior to their debut in the NHL. The idea of forming a major league hockey team in Nashville, Tennessee, can be traced back to Craig Leipold, a businessman and passionate hockey fan.  In the early 1990s, Nashville was undergoing significant growth and development, which prompted Leipold to envision the potential of bringing professional hockey to the city. In June 1995, Leipold and other investors submitted an application to the NHL to establish a hockey team in Nashville. At the time, the league was already looking to add new teams to reach its expansion goal of 30 franchises by the year 2000. Nashville's thriving economy and the construction of a new arena, later named the Bridgestone Arena, were key factors that supported the bid. On June 25, 1997, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman formally announced that Nashville would be one of the four cities awarded an expansion franchise. This announcement marked the beginning of the Nashville Predators organization. The team's name was selected following a \\"Name the Team\\" contest that drew proposals from thousands of fans. The name \\"Predators\\" was inspired by the remains of a saber-toothed tiger that was found in the city in 1971 while the construction of a skyscraper was underway. The saber-toothed tiger has since become the emblem of the team's logo. The Nashville Predators officially took the ice for the first time on October 10, 1998, in their inaugural regular-season game against the Florida Panthers. The team won their first game on October 13 against the Carolina Hurricanes. The Predators' initial season saw them finish with a record of 28 wins, 47 losses, and 7 ties, which was considered a commendable result for a new expansion team. Since their inception, the Nashville Predators have become a competitive force in the NHL, continually improving their performance and making regular playoff appearances. One of their most notable achievements includes reaching the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Overall, the formation of the Nashville Predators can be attributed to the vision of Craig Leipold, the city's growth and development, and the NHL's expansion plans. The team now enjoys a strong fan base and has contributed greatly to the promotion of hockey in the Southern United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A:","output":"Although the exact context of the conversation is not provided, it is possible to infer that the discussion revolved around negotiations between two parties, most likely buyers and sellers. The topic of conversation could be related to the sale of a product or service, wherein the buyer requests a discount or special price for a bulk purchase. This could involve a wholesale transaction or even a business partnership, in which the buyer expresses their intention to support the seller. Prior to the statement provided, the buyer may have explained the following points to the seller: 1. The buyer's intention to purchase the product or service in large quantities, possibly with a frequency that would support the seller's business in the long run. 2. The buyer's reason for seeking a special reduction. This may include factors such as a limited budget, market competition, or additional costs like shipping and handling fees. 3. Some negotiation between the two parties may have taken place, with each side presenting their terms and conditions, and explaining the underlying rationale. The buyer may have suggested alternative discounts, while the seller may have initially been hesitant to lower the price further due to their profit margins or operational costs. 4. The buyer could have expressed the positive impact their support would bring to the seller's business, either through providing consistent sales, increased exposure, or future recommendations to other potential customers. 5. Since the two parties may have agreed upon a mutually beneficial business relationship, the seller has shown their willingness to offer preferential pricing as a token of their appreciation while emphasizing that they cannot reduce the price any further. In conclusion, the conversation before the statement likely involved a negotiation between a buyer and seller, with the buyer expressing a desire for a discounted price based on their support for the seller's business, and the seller offering a compromise in the form of a 0.50 per dozen reduction to maintain a positive and potentially long-lasting partnership."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: How Hip-Hop Is Becoming the Oldies Less than a year ago, the Indianapolis radio station WRWM, then known as Indy’s i94, was the 15th-most-popular station in the Central Indiana market. It played a forgettable mix of Maroon 5, Sam Smith and other staples of what in radio lingo is called hot adult contemporary — the sort of stuff that drivers might alight on for a song or two but rarely add to their presets. For the last six months of 2014, among listeners ages 6 and older, the station’s Nielsen ratings hovered around a 2.0 share, meaning roughly 2 percent of radio listeners in the market tuned in. I94’s corporate parent, Cumulus Media — a conglomerate that owns about 460 radio stations in 90 U.S. markets — thought it could do better. Last fall, Davey Morris, a Cumulus program director at one of the company’s branch offices in Providence, R.I., called Jay Michaels, the station program director at i94, to discuss a number of ideas for revamping the floundering station, up to and including a format change. Changing formats is something radio stations avoid as best they can: It’s expensive and, for corporate-owned stations, usually involves extensive market research. If i94 changed, it would be the station’s 10th switch in 21 years. The 93.9 slot in Indianapolis hadn’t enjoyed any real success since it first went live in 1993. That year, it began as Ecstasy (WXTZ), an independently owned easy-listening station. It switched to a solid-gold soul format in 1996, then to smooth jazz the next year. It switched again in 1997, to country, and that year it was acquired by a conglomerate called Susquehanna Radio. Susquehanna moved its country station (104.5 the Bear, WGRL) down the dial to occupy the 93.9 frequency, before switching it to ’80s hits in 2001, and from that to contemporary Christian in 2004. The station became syndicated talk radio in 2006, and later that year Susquehanna was acquired by Cumulus Media. Along the way, there were dalliances with stunt formats and place holders: Christmas music and TV-show themes for days on end; nothing but construction noises at one point; at another, ‘‘The Lonesome Road,’’ by Dean Elliot & His Big Band, and ‘‘Swans Splashdown,’’ by Jean-Jacques Perrey, played on a loop. Late in 2007, Cumulus switched to the somewhat gross call letters WARM, with 93 hours of commercial-free easy listening and soft-rock. In July 2009, after the station finished 21st in the local ratings, it switched to a Top 40 format and changed its name to i94. Two years later, the station became ‘‘Indy’s i94’’ and added older hits to its mix, thereby becoming hot adult contemporary. ‘‘We’d [flipped] so many times, it was really hard to build a fan base,’’ Morris said. ‘‘We were never anybody’s first choice. We were their fourth choice.’’ Morris and Michaels started talking about what Indianapolis radio needed. The market was saturated: Emmis Radio had country, news/talk, soft adult-contemporary stations and sports; iHeartMedia had classic rock, alternative and sports covered; Radio One had a gospel station, plus three contemporary hits stations; Entercom had two of those, plus sports. One of the ideas the two came up with was a variation on a new format: classic hip-hop, pioneered just a month earlier by a Radio One station in Houston called Boom 92.1. By playing hit ’90s rap records, Boom tripled its audience, and Radio One had begun to duplicate the strategy in other markets. The two men brought the idea to Cumulus’s executive vice president of content and programming, John Dickey. Around the same time, Dickey caught word that Radio One was planning to launch a Boom clone in Indianapolis. He was determined to beat them to market. He told Morris to do a ‘‘classic hip-hop holiday weekend,’’ to test listener reaction and stake their claim to the format in Indianapolis. Michaels dropped the needle on Naughty by Nature’s ‘‘Hip Hop Hooray’’ at 3 p.m. on Dec. 19. LL Cool J’s ‘‘Around the Way Girl’’ followed, then ‘‘Move,’’ by Ludacris. ‘‘We set up a voice-mail box for listener feedback,’’ Michaels said. ‘‘I was expecting lots of complaints. We went from playing Maroon 5 to ‘Me So Horny.’ ’’ The phone rang so much they had to clear the mailbox every day. Callers were ecstatic. The station never returned to its old format. In three weeks, 93.9 made the improbable jump from 15th place in Central Indiana to first. Two weeks later, i94 officially became 93.9, the Beat. Ratings for January showed 93.9 with a 7.7 share. It ranked first among people ages 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; women 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; and men 18-49 and 25-54. ‘‘Literally nobody in the Top 50 markets in this country has ever done a format change, then in the next full month shot to No. 1,’’ Tom Taylor, the publisher of a popular radio-industry newsletter, told Indianapolis Business Journal. ‘‘Certainly no station in the last decade has done what [WRWM] has.’’ The Beat stole a huge piece of the listenership of Radio One’s top urban stations in Indianapolis, too: WTLC-FM 106.7, ‘‘Indy’s R & B Leader,’’ dropped to 4.5 in January from a 6.6 in December. WHHH-FM 96.3, Radio One’s mainstream urban station, saw its share plummet to 3.9 in January from 5.1 in December. Meanwhile, the Beat’s advertising rates grew by 150 percent. Ever since the earliest days of rock ’n’ roll, time has corroded yesterday’s musical radicalism into today’s pabulum. Thirty years ago, young listeners of hip-hop, with its predilection for violent imagery and unprintable language, might have thought it impervious to this process. But radio conglomerates are proving them wrong. As its listeners grow up and memories of Tipper Gore grow dim, hip-hop is now taking its final step toward respectability: It now qualifies as oldies. I sat with Jay Michaels one morning this spring while he worked on the Beat’s weekend playlist. His office is tiny, airless and cluttered with Hello Kitty lunchboxes, promotional teddy bears, novelty coffee cups and rubber duckies. On his computer, he had loaded Stratus, Cumulus’s proprietary music-­scheduling software. He pressed a button, and dozens of songs populated a grid on the screen, color-coded in a pattern that Michaels refused to explain. Michaels and Morris are cagey about Stratus, which is used companywide but customized by each station. They refer to the software as their ‘‘secret sauce.’’ What I gleaned through later conversations is that Michaels has broken hip-hop down by region and into subgenres, and the Beat uses these metadata tags to keep its playlist diverse. On Cumulus’s version of the format, you’ll never hear back-to-back-to-back Southern rap hits or a cluster of R & B songs with female vocalists; the Beat will break up a block of tunes by harder artists like Ice Cube or DMX with a Mariah Carey track. ‘‘Without flow, this format is a train wreck,’’ Michaels said as he sifted through the computer’s selections, massaging the playlist. ‘‘It’s me being overly anal. I have my own rules.’’ Among them: Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac should never be played back to back (it might call to mind their deadly feud), and a Biggie song should never be played before or after ‘‘I’ll Be Missing You,’’ the tribute song Puff Daddy recorded after Biggie was killed. Michaels also won’t play Outkast next to Ludacris — it just feels weird. The Beat is just one of several stations experimenting with the format now, and certainly such rules differ in each city. But the basics of the formula are the same that were developed by Radio One in October. That was the month the company unplugged a failing news station in Houston, 92.1 KROI-FM, dismissed all the employees and started playing Beyoncé songs, commercial-free, 24 hours a day. Beyoncé’s fans — the BeyHive — went bonkers. News outlets from all over the country called with questions about the odd format. On the afternoon of the fifth day, the station paused for a commercial and then played ‘‘Mind Playing Tricks on Me’’ by the Geto Boys, arguably Houston’s most famous contribution to rap music. Notorious B.I.G. followed, then Tupac, then Salt-N-Pepa. The early ratings returns were astounding. The station’s audience shot to 802,000 from 245,000, and its Nielsen share went to 3.2 from 1.0. Shortly after that, Radio One started similar stations in Philadelphia and Dallas and saw a gain of 200,000 listeners in each of those cities. Soon, 15 more stations, including 93.9, made the switch. A cynical but not inaccurate way of thinking about radio formats is as a tool to segment the population for advertisers. Ancient and unglamorous as it may be, radio remains a potent vehicle for advertisers to access consumers. According to a 2015 Nielsen Audio Today report, 91 percent of Americans age 12 or older listen to the radio each week, and the vast majority of those listeners are in the work force (which means they have money to spend). According to another Nielsen study, advertisers achieve more than 6 of incremental sales for every 1 spent on the radio. For radio-station owners, the business plan is simple: Attract the broadest possible audience to your programming and then do everything you can to keep them listening. This is why radio professionals talk about musical genres in ways normal human beings do not; no one believes she listens to rhythmic adult contemporary, but in aggregate, millions of people between the ages of 25 and 54 do. The Beat, and stations like it, target listeners in their mid-20s to mid-40s: people who grew up during rap’s golden era. This is a subset of the population that is outgrowing contemporary hip-hop radio (which targets the 18-34 demographic) but is mostly too young to be nostalgic for ’70s and ’80s stations and too hip for adult contemporary. They are also entering the prime spending years of their lives — marriage, children, car buying and homeownership — and radio, like all forms of media, is figuring out how to catch them. In a sense, classic hip-hop is following a radio trend that began in the early 1970s, when the first dedicated FM oldies stations started up in Phoenix, playing records by old crooners and doo-wop quartets. The format was a hit, and it quickly spread to Los Angeles and New York, and everywhere else. Oldies reached its zenith in the 1980s, just as classic rock — a new iteration of the same concept — was born. Same story: The format grew as programmers looked for new ways to keep grown-up baby boomers tuned in. Over the years, people in the radio business have discovered that even these seemingly static formats are quite pliable. Davey Morris told me about B101, a once-venerable oldies station in Providence, R.I. ‘‘When I first started listening, they were playing hits from the ’50s and early ’60s,’’ he said. ‘‘Now they’re playing the Police.’’ The Crests, the Platters and the Chordettes are being shoved aside, saved for Saturday-night specialty shows. At the same time, the leading edge of classic-rock stations continues to slide forward, and many are adding ’90s acts to their rotation: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Green Day and others. ‘‘If classic rock wasn’t careful, it was going to age itself out of the buying demos,’’ Jon Miller, vice president of audience insights at Nielsen, told me. ‘‘It would be left with an aging audience that isn’t appealing to Madison Avenue.’’ One person at the Beat told me that the station’s ideal listener is a woman between 35 and 44 who is a homeowner and her family’s decision maker. As of now, around 50 percent of the Beat’s audience is white, 45 percent is black and 4 percent is Hispanic (just 10 percent of Indianapolis is Hispanic). By contrast, the city’s top contemporary hip-hop station, WHHH, has an audience that is 68 percent black, 6 percent Hispanic and around 25 percent white. With the Beat, Dickey said the station had achieved universal likability. ‘‘The format is multicultural,’’ he said. ‘‘Anybody — black, white or Hispanic — can claim ownership of this music.’’ Though they’re in the odd position of creating something like a canon for rap music, Morris and the other programmers I spoke with made it clear that they don’t see themselves as stewards of the genre. Their job is to play the hits. Morris, in particular, is looking forward to the summer, when he thinks the Beat’s true potential will be realized. ‘‘People are going to drive around with their windows down and this music blasting,’’ he said. ‘‘They’re going to play it at the beach and at parties. It’s going to be like popcorn and bonbons: We’re just going to keep feeding them hits.’’ Today, that’s easier than ever. Using something called a Portable People Meter, which looks like a beeper, Nielsen collects listening data from its survey participants by detecting hidden tones in a station’s audio stream. The meters can tell which station the panelists are listening to, whether they’re at home or away and how long a listener stays on a station. Independent analysts can provide even more granular data than that, allowing radio programmers to gauge which songs people respond well to and which tracks push them to change the station. Nielsen recently analyzed four months’ worth of airplay data at 11 new classic hip-hop stations all over the country (including Boom), from Philadelphia to the San Francisco Bay Area, to determine the Top 50 songs in the format. The songs cover the 13 years from 1991 to 2004, with a pronounced feel-good bent and subtle West Coast bias. The Top 5 are: Luniz, ‘‘I Got 5 on It’’; Ice Cube, ‘‘It Was a Good Day’’; Snoop Doggy Dogg, ‘‘Gin and Juice’’; Notorious B.I.G., ‘‘One More Chance’’; and 50 Cent, ‘‘In Da Club.’’ Tupac’s ‘‘How Do U Want It,’’ ‘‘I Get Around’’ and ‘‘California Love’’ are in the Top 25; his more barbed songs, like ‘‘Brenda’s Got a Baby’’ and ‘‘2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,’’ aren’t even in the Top 50. The Wu-Tang Clan is represented only by Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s crossover hit ‘‘Got Your Money.’’ Somehow, Chingy’s ‘‘Right Thurr’’ has the No. 33 spot. There has always been a tension in hip-hop between those songs that are made for radio play and songs that were made for the real fans. But the classic hip-hop format seems to act like a sieve that catches only the most radio-friendly of the past’s radio-friendly records. Take, for example, ‘‘It Was a Good Day.’’ That song wasn’t even Ice Cube’s biggest hit in 1993, the year it came out; ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ was. But ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ is a song typical of early ’90s Ice Cube — angry and violent, with jokes about S.T.D.s, guns and prison rape — and ‘‘Good Day’’ is downright happy go lucky. In it, Ice Cube eats a halal breakfast; wins at basketball, dice and dominoes; and sees his name written in lights on the Goodyear blimp. In May, I visited WRWM and sat in on its drive-time program. Notorious B.I.G.’s ‘‘Juicy’’ played as we approached the 3 o’clock hour. Manning the boards was Zack Babb, a.k.a. Zakk, who hosts a show, weekdays from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Zakk, who is 27, tall and blond, wore board shorts and canvas sneakers and spent his downtime watching the traffic on Interstate 465 out the window. He watches it stack up every day, he told me. He seemed thrilled by it. There are just three on-air personalities at the Beat, including Zakk, who did just about everything but decide which song came next. While the music played, he recorded and edited the other elements that go into radio: sweepers, bumpers, ramps, promos. In preparation for a prescheduled spin of Mark Morrison’s ‘‘Return of the Mack,’’ Zakk recorded a ramp: ‘‘Remember hearing this one at United Skates of America? Some guys at the rink used to do a cool backward shuffle to this song. Every time I tried it, I fell on my butt.’’ (Roller-skating, he explained to me, was huge in and around Indianapolis in the 1990s.) As hours in the studio glided by, so did the utterly irresistible blend of rap and R & B hits: Outkast’s ‘‘Hey Ya!’’ led to Wreckx-N-Effect’s ‘‘Rump Shaker.’’ Then Keith Sweat’s ‘‘Make You Sweat’’ played into Coolio’s ‘‘Fantastic Voyage.’’ When ‘‘Still Fly,’’ by Big Tymers, came on, Zakk fondly recalled blowing out his dad’s speakers as a kid. Each hour was announced by a new classic hip-hop standard. At 4 p.m., it was Tupac and Dr. Dre’s ‘‘California Love.’’ At 5, as traffic on Interstate 465 slowed, it was Jay Z and UGK’s ‘‘Big Pimpin’.’’ Snoop took us into cocktail hour with ‘‘Gin and Juice’’ at 6. The traffic on the Interstate had halted by then, and I marveled out loud at the symmetry of the scene. We were sitting in a radio station, gazing out at people held prisoner with nothing to do but listen. I asked Zakk to look out the window and tell me the first thing that came to mind. He grinned widely and said, earnestly: ‘‘I imagine all of those people in their cars dancing.’’ A version of this article appears in print on July 19, 2015, on page MM26 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: Back in the Day.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -2878*n + 565 = -111677 for n, we will perform several mathematical operations to isolate the variable n. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 1. Start with the given equation:    -2878*n + 565 = -111677 2. Subtract 565 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant on the left side:    -2878*n = -111677 - 565 3. Simplify the right side:    -2878*n = -112242 4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the n term (-2878) to isolate n:    n = -112242 / -2878 5. Simplify the right side:    n = 38.96539279869067 The value of n is approximately 38.965. Due to the decimal being a non-terminating decimal, we could round off to a more appropriate number for the context if needed. For example, we could round off to two decimal places (38.97), but for now, we'll leave it as an exact value.  Therefore, the answer is: n ≈ 38.965."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) In his text Alciphron, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.

Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast.

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Article:","output":"Title: Implementing Proper Citation Techniques: A Guide to Accurate Academic Referencing Author: Smith, Jane Publication Date: March 1, 2022 Publisher: XYZ Publishing, New York, NY Source: The Journal of Academic Writing and Research, Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 321-334 URL: http://www.xyzpublishing.com/journal-articles/proper-citation-techniques Introduction Citations are essential in academic writing, as they acknowledge the intellectual contributions of others and highlight the foundation of one's research. A proper citation increases the credibility of the author and demonstrates scholarly diligence. This article provides a comprehensive guide to citing sources accurately and appropriately in academic work, focusing on key principles such as correctly listing the author's last name, providing publication details, and comprehensively presenting publication data. Listing the Author's Last Name The first step in citing a source is listing the author's last name. This properly attributes credit to the original creator of a specific work. In different citation styles, the author's last name may be followed by the author's first initial, first name, or by a comma or a period. When citing multiple authors, it is crucial to follow the guidelines of the specific style manual and separate each author by commas or semicolons as required. In cases where a work’s authorship is unknown or anonymous, the guidelines of the style manual being used should be followed for proper citation format. Publication Date The publication date is an essential piece of information for academic citations, as it establishes the chronology of the cited work and its place in the progression of knowledge. Dates should always be provided in a clear and consistent manner, according to the style manual being employed. Typically, the year of publication is listed, but some citation styles may require the month or day to be included as well. Title of the Source The title of the source is an essential component of a citation, as it allows readers to locate and identify the work being cited. Titles may vary based on the material being cited, as journal articles, books, and online resources may have varying title requirements. It is crucial to provide the complete title, ensuring that it is accurately and consistently presented according to the guidelines of the chosen citation style. For example, some styles require the title to be italicized while others may require the use of quotation marks. Publisher's Location and Name The publisher’s name and location contribute valuable information that identifies the specific edition, version, or imprint of a cited work. This data helps distinguish between various editions and versions of a work and contextualizes the information within the citation. Adhering to the guidelines of the specific citation style used, the publisher's location and name should be included, typically in the following format: city, state, and/or country, followed by the publisher's name. Publication Titles in Full For periodicals such as journals, newspapers, and magazines, it is crucial to provide the complete title. Abbreviating or truncating titles can lead to confusion and difficulty for readers seeking to locate and consult the source. When citing a periodical, ensure that the title is spelled out completely, and maintain consistency with other sources cited within the same document. Volume, Issue, and Page Numbers Volume, issue, and page numbers are essential elements of citations for periodicals. These details provide precise information on where the cited material can be found within a specific journal or periodical, allowing readers to locate and read the original source for context and accuracy. Be mindful of citation style requirements, as some may require the use of abbreviations for volume and issue, while others do not. URL for Online Publications Finally, for online publications, the citation should include the specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available. This ensures that the reader can access the cited material directly and verifies the legitimacy of the source. URLs should be accurate, up-to-date, and reliable to facilitate ease of access. Conclusion Proper citation techniques are imperative for maintaining the integrity of academic work and respecting the intellectual property of others. By following the guidelines presented in this article, authors can ensure that their citations are accurate, consistent, and adhere to academic conventions, ultimately contributing to an enhanced level of quality and credibility in their research."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It just gives vague advice about having fun and not being serious, which doesn't contribute to the paragraph's main point.  (d) is incorrect because it talks about not inviting her to one's house and choosing alternatives without providing any specific suggestions.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. the youth, whether immigrant offspring, young immigrants or refugees experience discrimination as they are met with prejudice and not seen as independent persons. Make this proper case.","output":"Young individuals, encompassing immigrant offspring, young immigrants, and refugees, frequently encounter discrimination as they face prejudiced attitudes and are frequently not perceived as independent entities deserving of equal opportunities and respect. This compelling issue warrants an in-depth investigation to understand the roots of this discrimination, its repercussions on the targeted youth groups, and the ways in which society can address and rectify this inequity. To comprehend this multifaceted issue, it is crucial to recognize the various factors that contribute to discrimination. The primary cause stems from the perpetuation of stereotypes and stigmatization of immigrant youth and refugees. Often, these young individuals are automatically associated with negative characteristics, such as being a burden on the social and economic systems, potential involvement in crime or terrorism, and being perceived as resistant to integrating into the host culture. Consequently, these assumptions lead society to view them as undesirable or even as threats, rather than seeing them as individuals with their unique experiences and aspirations. Furthermore, language barriers and cultural differences hinder the smooth integration of immigrant and refugee youth into mainstream society. In many cases, these young individuals may not possess an adequate command of the local language, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and impede access to educational and employment opportunities. Additionally, unfamiliar customs and ways of life can create a lack of understanding or appreciation for their cultural background, further contributing to their marginalization. Moreover, institutional discrimination plays a significant role in perpetuating inequity for immigrant and refugee youth. This may manifest in various forms, including biased law enforcement practices, preferential treatment for native-born youth in educational settings, and limited access to essential services for refugees and children of immigrants. Such systemic disparities often result from implicit biases or deeply entrenched xenophobic attitudes, which can further jeopardize the well-being and future prospects of these young individuals. The consequences of this discrimination are far-reaching and have a profound impact on the targeted youth groups. It can lead to a sense of hopelessness and alienation, adversely affecting their mental and emotional well-being. They may experience difficulties in acclimating to their new environment, developing relationships, and participating in social, educational, and professional pursuits. This, in turn, can impede their ability to flourish and contribute positively to society, potentially wasting valuable talent and resources. In addressing and rectifying this issue, several steps must be taken to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for immigrant and refugee youth. Firstly, raising awareness and fostering understanding through educational programs can help combat stereotypes and challenge prevailing misconceptions about these individuals. Educators, for instance, can incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into their curricula, promoting empathy and broadening students' cultural horizons. Secondly, implementing targeted resources and support systems for affected youth, such as language classes and cultural integration programs, can empower them by equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to prosper in their new society. Encouraging intercultural exchange and dialogue also helps build bridges between native-born and immigrant communities, fostering mutual respect and understanding. Lastly, addressing institutional discrimination is vital to creating meaningful change. This involves evaluating and revising policies that contribute to systemic disparities, as well as holding institutions accountable for their actions and decisions that impact the lives of refugee and immigrant youth. Advocacy groups, community organizations, and local governments must work collaboratively to create policies and initiatives that promote equality and diversity. In conclusion, immigrant offspring, young immigrants, and refugees experience profound discrimination in numerous ways and on multiple levels. By recognizing the causes and consequences of this discrimination, society can take crucial steps towards rectifying this injustice and fostering an environment where these youth are regarded as independent individuals deserving of respect and equal opportunities. Through awareness, education, targeted resources, intercultural dialogue, and policy reform, a truly inclusive society can be achieved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose husband committed suicide? ?  College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Some relatives of homicide victims want morgue photos as keepsakes It’s unusual, but not unheard of, for medical examiners to provide families with photos of departed kin, although most often it’s done only after the autopsy, the police investigation and court proceedings are complete. Practices differ across the country: As a rule, Maryland does not release photos to relatives or to anyone else; Virginia does, free, under tightly controlled circumstances. Families of D.C. homicide victims aren’t criticizing the District for providing photos of the faces of the deceased. Some embrace the chance to have what they consider an important keepsake, even one that might make others cringe. It might be the only way to come to terms with the death. Or it might help fill an agonizing void for parents unable to witness their child’s last breath or even see the body at the funeral home. “I want to see my baby,” said JoAnn Lee, who pulled out a morgue photo as she talked with a reporter about her daughter, Candance Reed, who was stabbed to death in November outside a bar in Northwest Washington. Lee, a 66-year-old Ohio resident, carries the photo with her in an envelope. Tinamarie Spencer rushed to a hospital after her son Robert was shot in the chest in September, but staff workers denied her access to the 21-year-old’s body. She identified him from a photo at the D.C. medical examiner’s office that shows just his face, his lips taut. His mother says it shows that her son died smiling. “Myself, and my son’s godmother needed that for reassurance that my son was at peace,” Spencer said after buying two photos. Beverly Fields, a spokeswoman for the D.C. medical examiner’s office, said that photos are available to families and that the fee covers administrative and processing costs. The money goes into the city’s general treasury. The District morgue relies on photos to make identifications. Relatives, she said, are “not able to see the body in person, so many do want a photo. That’s the closest thing they have.” Officials were unable to say how many photos have been requested and sold. The medical examiner lists the prices — 10 for glossy or laser prints, 15 for 35mm slides — on the same fee schedule that lists charges of 150 for “body storage” and 75 for a report explaining a stillbirth. The District is poised to get a new chief medical examiner, Roger Mitchell, currently an assistant state medical examiner in New Jersey. “We don’t provide photos to family members,” a spokesman there said. He declined to say what Mitchell’s policy might be once he arrives in the District, possibly in February. He said Mitchell would not consent to an interview until after the appointment is confirmed in Washington. People mourn in different ways, some privately, others with public memorials such as flowers left on a tree at the scene of a car crash or a portrait on a T-shirt. Many compare a morgue photo to an open coffin at a funeral home, although in the latter the decedent is presented in a more peaceful way. Gregory G. Davis, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, said there is no one accepted practice. In Jefferson County, Ala, where he is the chief coroner, he said relatives sometimes request the photo used to identify the body. “We decline,” Davis said. But, he said, relatives who want photos can get them once the autopsy report and police investigation are complete. The request has to come from an attorney, and all the photos are sent to the attorney, who can decide how to distribute them. “This is the last photo taken of the person, and people want to see it,” Davis said. “I know what’s involved in an autopsy, and I don’t want to see my wife or my children or my parents that way. But others clearly think differently.” In Los Angeles County, a coroner who runs a gift shop called Skeletons in the Closet, which raises money for a program to prevent drunken driving and sells beach blankets with chalk outlines of bodies, says his office would not sell photos of the dead to be used as family relics. “You can buy towels but no photos,” said Ed Winter, the assistant chief. Upon request and at no charge, New York authorities provide photos used for identification to relatives. Virginia also gives photos to the next of kin. But Maribeth Brewster, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Health, said a pathologist sits down with the relative to review the images — which can be brutally clinical and gruesome — to explain what was done and why. In Maryland, the public can review autopsy reports but not photos. Spokesman Bruce Goldfarb said that only on rare occasions will officials bend the rules. Unlike in other states, Maryland’s medical examiner’s office does not handle identifications, leaving that task to law enforcement. Goldfarb said an exception was made for a woman who “was really in denial and could not believe her son had died.” She was allowed to see a photograph but not take it home. “We encourage people to do viewing at funeral homes, where there are family members and grief counselors,” he said. Julia Dunkins, who runs a District support group called Survivors of Homicide, said she believes that only a fraction of relatives want postmortem images of loved ones. She said some might not have other photos of the person. “They didn’t get a chance to talk to them. This last photo is all they have to remember them by,” she said. Dunkins’s then-28-year-old husband, John Baxter, was shot and killed in Northeast Washington in 1969, and her 24-year-old son, Jonathan Baxter — born the year his father was killed — was shot to death in Northwest Washington in 1993. She identified both at the medical examiner’s office. Survivors now look at photos in which a shroud covers everything below the neck. Just the face is visible, and death is unmistakable. “I don’t want a picture like that,” Dunkins said.

A: A:","output":"Mitosis and meiosis are both processes of cell division, with dramatically different products and functions within an organism.  Mitosis refers to the type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is crucial in the growth, repair, and general maintenance of the body. It occurs in somatic cells, which are all cells in the body except the sex cells. Mitosis is divided into several phases, including interphase, prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. Each phase plays a crucial role in ensuring that the genetic information is accurately copied and distributed to the daughter cells. On the other hand, meiosis is a form of cell division that results in four non-identical daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is vital for sexual reproduction, as it creates gametes (sperm and egg cells) in animals and spores in plants. Gametes produced through meiosis are haploid, meaning they carry a single set of chromosomes, while somatic cells are diploid, carrying two sets of chromosomes. Meiosis ensures genetic diversity among offspring, as the chromosomes from each parent are recombined to create a unique genetic mix. Meiosis is a two-step process, which includes meiosis I and meiosis II. Both of these stages further consist of several phases. Meiosis I involves prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I. During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up in a process called synapsis, and genetic material may be exchanged between them through crossing over. This exchange increases genetic diversity in the offspring. Then, the homologous chromosomes line up and separate during metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I, resulting in two daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosome pairs. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis in terms of the phases involved, but instead of producing identical daughter cells, four non-identical haploid gametes are produced. The stages of meiosis II include prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II, and cytokinesis. The process notably lacks any further DNA replication and ensures that the gametes produced will have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. In summary, mitosis and meiosis are two distinct types of cell division, each with different products and purposes within an organism. While mitosis results in two identical daughter cells for growth, repair, and maintenance, meiosis generates four non-identical gametes with half the number of chromosomes for sexual reproduction and genetic diversity. Understanding these processes is vital to understanding the life cycle and reproduction of living organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Artis Leon Ivey Jr. (born August 1, 1963), known professionally as Coolio, is an American rapper, actor, chef, and record producer. Coolio achieved mainstream success in the mid-to-late 1990s with his albums It Takes a Thief (1994), Gangsta's Paradise (1995), and My Soul (1997). He is best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit single \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\", as well as other singles \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" (1994), \\"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)\\" (1996) and \\"C U In 1995, Coolio made a song featuring R&B singer LV for the movie Dangerous Minds, titled \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\". It would become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 3 weeks. It was the #1 single of 1995 for all genres, and was a global hit, as it reached #1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that parody artist \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic had not asked for permission to make his parody of \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\", titled \\"Amish Paradise\\". At the 1996 Grammy Awards, the song won Coolio a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance.  Originally \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" was not meant to be included on one of Coolio's studio albums, but its success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album but also making it the title track. The title track sampled the chorus and music of the song \\"Pastime Paradise\\" by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly 20 years earlier on Stevie Wonder's album Songs in the Key of Life. The album Gangsta's Paradise was released in 1995 and was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA. The album contained two other major hits in \\"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)\\" and \\"Too Hot\\" with J.T. Taylor of Kool & the Gang doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album Curb Servin', on the song \\"In a Twist\\". In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song \\"It's All the Way Live (Now)\\" from the soundtrack to the movie Eddie. He was also featured on the song \\"Hit 'em High\\" from the soundtrack to the movie Space Jam with B-Real, Method Man, LL Cool J, and Busta Rhymes.

Question: Question: \\"How did the Valide Sultan rule?\\"  Context: \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The Valide Sultan ruled by exercising significant influence and power within the Imperial Harem and the Ottoman court.

FINAL EXAM  Question 1. how is Tristram of Lyonesse and William Morris related? A:","output":"To answer this question, I need to research the relationship between \\"Tristram of Lyonesse,\\" a long narrative poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, and \\"William Morris\\", a renowned British poet, novelist, and craftsman.  1. Research on the poem \\"Tristram of Lyonesse\\": I need to conduct a search on the topic to learn about the context, themes, and influences of the poem.      Results: \\"Tristram of Lyonesse\\" is a Victorian epic poem about the Arthurian knight Sir Tristram and his lover Iseult, written by Algernon Charles Swinburne. 2. Research on William Morris: I need to conduct a search on William Morris to learn about his works, influences, and connections in the literary world.     Results: William Morris was a dominant figure in the British Arts and Crafts Movement. As a poet and author, his works were profoundly influenced by medieval themes. 3. Cross-reference \\"Tristram of Lyonesse\\" with William Morris: Once I have information on both the poem and Morris, I compare the two to identify any potential connections or relationships.     Results: Both Swinburne and Morris were known for their passion for medieval themes and Arthurian legends. They were contemporaries, and their works often drew from similar sources.  So, the connection between \\"Tristram of Lyonesse\\" and William Morris can be identified as the shared ideological and thematic basis. Both Swinburne and Morris demonstrated a profound interest in chivalry, medievalism, and Arthurian legend, which heavily influenced their works. However, it must be stated that William Morris did not write \\"Tristram of Lyonesse\\" and to the best of my knowledge, Morris had no direct involvement with the creation of the poem. Any connection would be thematic, contextual, or based on contemporaneous historical and literary trends of the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the lead single from the 10th album of the band that were content to work without deadlines?  Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had \\"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\\". For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \\"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\\". The album's other singles were worldwide hits as well; \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\", \\"Elevation\\", and \\"Walk On\\" reached number one in Canada, while charting in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia.

Unitas and Helen Superfisky, who both were of Lithuanian descent; he grew up in the Mount Washington neighborhood. When Johnny was five years old, his father died of cardiovascular renal disease complicated by pneumonia, leaving the young boy to be raised by his mother, who worked two jobs to support the family. His surname was a result of a phonetic transliteration of a common Lithuanian last name Jonaitis. Attending St. Justin's High School in Pittsburgh, Unitas played halfback and quarterback. The 1964 season would see the Colts return to the top of the Western Conference. After dropping their season opener to the Minnesota Vikings, the Colts ran off 10 straight victories to finish with a 12-2 record. The season was one of Unitas' best as he finished with 2,824 yards passing, a league-best 9.26 yards per pass attempt, 19 touchdown passes and only 6 interceptions. He was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by the AP and UPI for a second time. However, the season would end on a disappointing note for the Colts as they were upset by the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, losing 27-0.  Unitas resumed his torrid passing in 1965, as he threw for 2,530 yards, 23 touchdowns and finished with a league-high and career best 97.1 passer rating. But he was lost for the balance of the season due to a knee injury in a week 12 loss to the Bears. More postseason heartbreak would follow in 1965. The Colts and Packers finished in a tie for first place in the Western Conference and a one-game playoff was played in Green Bay to decide who would be the conference representative in the 1965 NFL Championship Game. The Colts lost in overtime 13-10 due in large part to a game-tying field goal by Don Chandler that many say was incorrectly ruled good. Backup quarterback Gary Cuozzo also suffered a season-ending injury the following week and it would be running back Tom Matte who filled in as the emergency QB for the regular-season finale and the playoff loss to the Packers.  Unitas, healthy once more, threw for 2748 yards and 22 touchdowns in 1966 in a return to Pro Bowl form. However, he posted a league-high 24 interceptions.

The 26-member International Energy Agency said, Friday, that member countries would release oil to help relieve the U.S. fuel crisis caused by Hurricane Katrina. Can we draw the following conclusion? The United States has asked member states of the International Energy Agency to provide oil.","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be reasonably inferred that the United States may have requested assistance from International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries to help address the fuel crisis caused by Hurricane Katrina. The IEA committing to release oil supplies in response suggests a likelihood that the request came from the United States. It is important to understand the role of the International Energy Agency in such situations. The IEA was established in 1974 as an autonomous intergovernmental organization in response to the 1973-74 oil crisis. Its primary objective is to coordinate the energy policies of its member countries, particularly to ensure energy security and manage global oil supplies in case of need. The 26-member organization's membership is composed of major oil-consuming countries, including the United States, to stabilize markets and coordinate collective action during energy crises. When natural disasters or emergencies affect a country's ability to meet its energy needs, the IEA may intervene by utilizing its authority to coordinate the release of emergency oil stocks. In the case of Hurricane Katrina, the implications were severe as the US Gulf Coast is a major hub for oil production and refining. The hurricane led to a significant reduction in domestic oil production capacity and had a considerable impact on fuel availability in the United States. Considering the circumstances and the purpose of the IEA, it is reasonable to conclude that the United States likely asked for assistance from other member countries. The international collaboration and commitment to helping the US during this crisis can be seen as an example of the IEA's role in maintaining global energy security and supporting its member nations during challenging times. It is also worth mentioning that the gravity of the situation, the anticipated impact on the fuel markets and the potential for price spikes could have prompted the IEA to take such steps, even in the absence of a formal request. The IEA may also act preemptively to mitigate the risks and consequences tied to oil supply disruptions. However, in this specific scenario, it seems plausible that the United States sought support from the IEA and other member countries to alleviate the fuel crisis arising from Hurricane Katrina."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Plot title: The Grey Zone Movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \\"delousing\\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer (Daniel Benzali), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the childrenâs camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, SS-OberscharfÃ¼hrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Keitel) suddenly walks in. Noticing that one of the prisoners present, Abramowics (Buscemi), is there illegally, he shoots him, prompting the girl... My question: Who plays Hoffman?

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness.

Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region).

It later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek). Thus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\". \\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, \\"De Principatibus\\" (\\"About Principalities\\"). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but \\"long before then, in fact since the first appearance of \\"The Prince\\" in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings\\".  - The Black Rose is a 1950 20th Century Fox Technicolor film starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles, loosely based on Thomas B. Costain's book. It was filmed partly on location in England and Morocco which substitutes for the Gobi Desert of China. The film was partly conceived as a follow-up to the movie \\"Prince of Foxes\\", and reunited the earlier film's two stars.

Costain, published in 1945, introducing an anachronistic Saxon rebellion against the Norman aristocracy as a vehicle for launching the protagonists on their journey to the Orient.   - Duke of Valentinois, formerly Count of Valentinois, is a title of nobility, originally in the French peerage.

Reviewers noted that this mode actually broke from recent pop trends  spurning the influence of hip-hop and R&B  as well as some of the grim moodiness creeping onto the charts. The video for âShake It Offâ even poked fun at the idea that  Swift  might start imitating Nicki Minaj like some of her contemporaries. Two songs didnât quite fit that pattern  though. One was âBlank Space â a masterwork of hip-hop-adjacent sarcasm. The legendary pop producers Max Martin and Shellback threaded together a high  whistling harmony and kick-drum/snare pattern over which  Swift  sneered rapid clusters of syllables about being a man-eater. âBad Blood â too  waged war in what sounded like a personal feud over modern jock-jam thump. It got an extra layer of syncopation for the Kendrick Lamar remix that  like âBlank Space â enjoyed a run at No. 1 on the Hot 100. The rumors about the recording sessions for  Swift âs forthcoming album Reputation were that theyâd see her  finally  diving into hip-hop and R&B. Those reports drew immediate skepticism  as it was hard to imagine how such a change might work for  Swift  without  her  seeming ridiculous. But it now appears the rumors were true  though the question of ridiculousness hasnât quite gone away. Where 1989 was sleek and stiff and retro  Reputationâs songs so far have been busier  choppier  and decidedly modernâwhich is to say  rap-influenced.

Summarize this article: An examination of digital equipment recovered from the home of the couple who killed 14 people in San Bernardino last week has led FBI investigators to believe the shooters were planning an even larger assault, according to federal government sources.      Investigators on Thursday continued to search for digital footprints left by Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, scouring a downtown San Bernardino lake for electronic items, including a hard drive that the couple was hoping to destroy, sources told The Times.      FBI agents will probably spend days searching Seccombe Lake and canvassing the neighborhood for clues after receiving a tip that the couple may have visited the area on the day of the attack, according to David Bowdich, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.      Farook and Malik were in the final planning stages of an assault on a location or building that housed a lot more people than the Inland Regional Center, possibly a nearby school or college, according to federal sources familiar with the widening investigation.

A memorial to victims of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino continues to grow near the Inland Regional Center. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)      Investigators have based that conclusion on evidence left behind on Farook and Malik's computers and digital devices, not all of which the couple were able to destroy before they were killed in a firefight with police, the sources said.      Images of San Bernardino-area schools were found on a cellphone belonging to Farook, according to a law enforcement source. But the source cautioned that Farook may have had a legitimate reason to have the images because his work as a county health inspector involved checking on school dining facilities.      On Thursday, one of the federal government sources told The Times that Farook asked his friend and neighbor, Enrique Marquez, to buy two military-style rifles used in the attacks because he feared he \\"wouldn't pass a background check\\" if he attempted to acquire the weapons on his own. The rifles were bought at a local gun store, the source said.      The timing of the rifle purchases is significant to FBI investigators. Another federal government source previously told The Times that Farook may have been considering a separate terror plot in 2011 or 2012.      Farook was self-radicalizing around that time, FBI Director James Comey said, and met Malik soon after, eventually escorting her to the United States. Farook was a practicing Muslim. Marquez converted to Islam around the time he purchased the weapons, sources have told The Times.      FBI agents believe Farook abandoned his plans to launch the earlier attack after a law enforcement task force arrested three men in Chino in November 2012. The men were later convicted of charges related to providing material support to terrorists and plotting to kill Americans in Afghanistan. A fourth man arrested in Afghanistan also was convicted in the scheme.      Bowdich said federal agents are investigating whether the men had ties to Farook.      Marquez has emerged as a central figure in the investigation. The FBI had been conducting interviews with 24-year-old, who checked himself into a mental health facility after the attacks.      The former Wal-Mart security guard has waived his Miranda rights and cooperated with the inquiry, and it was Marquez who told FBI agents about Farook's earlier plans, according to one of the government sources, who also requested anonymity.      (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times)      \\"They were talking generally about something, but I don't think it made it to anything specific,\\" one of the sources said of the earlier plot. \\"I don't think it got to a time or a place.\\"      The source said it remains unclear whether Marquez had any involvement in the planning of the shooting or had any prior knowledge that an attack was pending.      Marquez, a cycling enthusiast who wanted to join the U.S. Navy, was a longtime friend and neighbor of Farook. He also married the sister of Farook's sister-in-law last year, although the circumstances of the union are now under investigation, a government official previously told The Times.      There was no paperwork transferring ownership of the assault rifles from Marquez to Farook, as required by California law, government officials told The Times.      Hours after the shooting, Marquez posted a cryptic message on his Facebook page.      \\"I'm. Very sorry sguys,\\" the message read. \\"It was a pleasure.\\"      Bowdich on Thursday declined to answer questions about Marquez, who has not been charged with a crime.      Marquez told FBI agents that the Facebook post has been \\"misunderstood,\\" according to one of the government sources. Agents are concerned that Marquez's mental and emotional state may affect what he has been telling interrogators, the source said.      While Marquez has spoken to agents about his ties to Farook, federal officials are still working to verify the information he has provided, the source said.      Marquez's mother, Armida Chacon, addressed reporters on Thursday from her Tomlinson Avenue home in Riverside, sobbing as she said she hadn't been in contact with her son since the day of the massacre.      \\"I don't know how this happened.... My world is upside-down,\\" she said. \\"My life changed Wednesday.\\"      Chacon was outside with one of her sons, cleaning up the broken glass and twisted panels of their garage door. The damage occurred when federal agents raided the stucco home over the weekend.      As she combed through the wreckage of the garage door, Chacon eventually turned to the reporters camped out on the street and agreed to an off-camera interview.      Marquez was his mother's \\"right hand at home,\\" helping take care of his brothers, she said.      She said her son loved to hang out with friends and go to parties.      \\"My son is a good person,\\" she said.      When asked about Farook, Chacon said her son was friends with him and \\"nothing more.\\" ||||| SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (Reuters) - A week-old investigation into the shooting rampage that left 14 people dead at a holiday party in Southern California turned on Thursday to a small lake near the scene of the massacre, where divers searched for evidence.      FBI agents pack up diving gear after searching in the water at Seccombe Lake Park, after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon      The FBI also revealed investigators were looking into any connections there may have been between one of the two killers in San Bernardino last week and four men arrested in 2012 in a separate federal terrorism case brought in nearby Riverside, California.      Thursday’s underwater search stemmed from unspecified leads indicating the married couple who carried out the shooting spree had been in the vicinity of Seccombe Lake in San Bernardino on the day of the killings, said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI field office in Los Angeles.      Bowdich said he would not discuss the “specific evidence we’re looking for.”      CNN reported investigators were seeking a computer hard drive that belonged to the couple, who the FBI has said were inspired by Islamic extremists. Bowdich said investigators already have combed the surrounding park, and that the search of the lake by FBI and Sheriff’s Department divers could take days.      Seccombe Lake Park lies about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of the Inland Regional Center, the social services agency where 14 people were killed and 22 others injured when Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, stormed a holiday gathering of his co-workers there on Dec. 2 and opened fire with assault rifles.      Farook, 28, a U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native he married last year in Saudi Arabia, were slain hours after their attack in a shootout with police.      The FBI said it is treating the mass shooting as an act of terrorism, citing the couple’s declaration that they were acting on behalf of the militant group Islamic State, as well as a large cache of weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials seized in the investigation.      The couple’s motives remain unclear. But if the crime proves to have been the work of killers driven by militant Islamic ideology, as the FBI suspects, it would mark the deadliest such attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2011.      The latest slayings and disclosures about the killers’ backgrounds have put law U.S. law enforcement on heightened alert and reverberated into the U.S. presidential campaign, intensifying debates over gun control, immigration and national security.      POSSIBLE LINKS TO 2012 PLOT EXAMINED      Speaking to reporters at Seccombe Lake on Thursday, Bowdich disclosed the FBI was examining whether Farook had any links with the four conspirators in the Riverside case, as CNN and other media outlets have reported.      A jury last year convicted two of those men, including Afghan-born ringleader Sohiel Omar Kabir, of conspiring to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda and plotting to attack U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. Their two co-defendants pleaded guilty in the case.      CNN, citing unnamed officials, reported Farook had been a member of Kabir’s social circle. Asked whether the FBI knew of any ties between Farook and the four convicted Riverside conspirators, Bowdich said: “It would be irresponsible not to investigate.” He stressed the four Riverside defendants were never accused of planning attacks within the United States.      FBI Director James Comey told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday that the couple were discovered to have been discussing jihad and martyrdom online with each other as far back as 2013, a year before they met in person.      Flowers and candles are displayed at a makeshift memorial after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon      Comey said the precise origins of the couple’s radicalization were as yet unknown but appeared to predate the rise of Islamic State, the militant group that has seized vast swaths of Iraq and Syria and last month claimed responsibility for the assaults on Paris that left 130 dead.      U.S. government sources told Reuters on Thursday that Malik tried in vain to contact multiple Islamic militant groups in the months before she and Farook staged their attack, but her overtures were ignored.      The organizations Malik sought out likely shied away out of extreme caution in communicating with individuals unknown to them and a fear of being caught up in a law-enforcement “sting” operation, sources said.      The number of organizations that Malik attempted to approach and how she sought to reach them were unclear, though the groups almost certainly included al Qaeda’s Syria-based official affiliate, the Nusrah Front, the government sources said.      One source said investigators have little, if any, evidence that Malik or her husband had any direct contact with Islamic State.      Slideshow (22 Images)      LAWMAKERS BRIEFED      While the militant group has since embraced the couple as among its followers, U.S. government sources have said there was no evidence Islamic State even knew of the couple before the San Bernardino killings.      Comey, along with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and John Mulligan, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, briefed members of both houses of Congress on Thursday about the investigation in closed, classified sessions.      “The current impression is that these two people were acting alone,” U.S. Senator Angus King of Maine told CNN after the briefing. But he added that he was troubled by the fact that the couple had tried to cover their tracks by destroying their cell phones and other electronic equipment.      Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters afterward that there were people in the community who saw suspicious activity at the shooters’ house but decided not to tell authorities “for a variety of reasons.”      New York Representative Peter King, a senior Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, emerged from the session calling for “more surveillance in the Muslim community here in the United States.”      He drew comparisons to heightened scrutiny law enforcement placed on Italian-American and Irish-American communities during past investigations of organized crime.      “You look where the terror is going to come from, and right now, it is going to come from the Muslim community,” he said. “It’s a small percentage, but to me, the only way you find out about it in advance is having sources and informers on the ground, having constant surveillance.”      Investigators also have been looking into the couple’s ties with Enrique Marquez, a boyhood friend of Farook and Muslim convert who bought the two rifles used in the attack. A federal law enforcement source said Marquez and Farook appear to have contemplated some sort of attack around 2012 but abandoned the idea.      Marquez, who is related to Farook’s family by marriage - his wife and the wife of Farook’s older brother are sisters - has not been charged with any crime. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government appears not to have picked up on extremist messages exchanged during the online courtship two years ago between the American-born man accused in the California shootings and his then-fiancée in Pakistan, according to lawmakers detailing closed-door briefings by federal officials on Capitol Hill.

(Associated Press)      American officials say 28-year-old Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, 29-year-old Tashfeen Malik, discussed martyrdom and jihad online as early as 2013. But the couple never surfaced on law enforcement's radar and Malik was able to enter the U.S. on a fiancée visa last year despite having professed radical views online.      Meanwhile, the investigation into the shootings that left 14 dead last week continued in San Bernardino, where an FBI dive team searched a small, urban lake about 3 miles north of the shooting site. Authorities said the shooters, who killed 14 people at a holiday gathering on Dec. 2, had been in the area.      The couple died in a shootout with law enforcement hours after the attack and left behind a 6-month-old daughter.      FBI Director James Comey and other senior American officials briefed members of Congress Thursday. Lawmakers repeatedly questioned officials on whether any red flags may have been missed in the last two years.      One official said information that the FBI has been able to glean came from an examination of the pair's electronic devices after the attack, rather than intercepts.      \\"Everyone's asking the same questions about how it is that law enforcement didn't know, or intelligence officials didn't know — that they could have flown under the radar and nothing gave an indication that they were a threat,\\" said Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode island Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee.      Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Malik was subjected to an in-person interview during the application process for a visa.      He noted that while there were some indications that might have alerted law enforcement to Farook, he declined to detail what those might have been.      \\"I don't think we know yet enough to say these were apparent without the advantage of hindsight,\\" Schiff said.      Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said there's currently no evidence Malik's radicalization would have been readily apparent when she was evaluated for a fiancée visa.      \\"I don't think there was missed information,\\" he said. \\"It appears that there was not any evidence that would have been discoverable during an interview for a visa.\\"      He declined to discuss what specifically led investigators to conclude that the couple had radicalized independently as early as 2013, but suggested the information did not come from intercepts. Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar.      \\"It's safe to say that the information about what happened prior to their marriage and to the attacks in San Bernardino was acquired through forensic investigations of these individual lives,\\" Hurd said, adding: \\"These people weren't on the radar.\\"      Multiple lawmakers raised the fact that neighbors saw suspicious activities but failed to mention them to investigators until after the attack.      \\"There were people who were aware of things, thought they were suspicious, but did not want to be accused of being discriminatory for reporting something,\\" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He said these people saw activity around the garage that they thought was suspicious.      Asked repeatedly whether any hints could have led law enforcement to prevent the attack, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. replied, \\"Explain to me how you do that without any bread crumbs that are obvious, without somebody that's inside a mosque, that's inside a person's family that tips you off. In this particular case there was nothing like that that gave them a reason to look at this couple sooner than after the attack.\\"      More than three years ago, Farook's longtime friend and relative-through-marriage Enrique Marquez bought the assault rifles used in the shooting.      Marquez, who checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack, told investigators that he and Farook were plotting an attack in 2012. Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, a Republican who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said they had an actual plan, including buying weapons, but became apprehensive and shelved it because of law enforcement activity and arrests in the area. Marquez hasn't been charged with a crime.      Lawmakers said the FBI wouldn't provide details about his ties to the case, citing an \\"ongoing criminal investigation.\\" Marquez's mother Armida Chacon told reporters Thursday that her 24-year-old son is a good person.      ___      Associated Press writers Brian Melley, Michael R.

Question: Information:  - A sounding rocket, sometimes called a research rocket, is an instrument-carrying rocket designed to take measurements and perform scientific experiments during its sub-orbital flight. The rockets are used to carry instruments from above the surface of the Earth; the altitude generally between weather balloons and satellites (the maximum altitude for balloons is about and the minimum for satellites is approximately ). Certain sounding rockets, such as the Black Brant X and XII, have an apogee between ; the maximum apogee of their class. Sounding rockets often use military surplus rocket motors. NASA routinely flies the Terrier Mk 70 boosted Improved Orion lifting payloads into the exoatmospheric region between .  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space.  - In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - In mathematics, an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. As such, it is a generalization of a circle, which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location. The shape of an ellipse (how \\"elongated\\" it is) is represented by its eccentricity, which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to arbitrarily close to but less than 1.  - In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The Thor - Delta , also known as Delta DM - 19 or just Delta was an early American expendable launch system used for 12 orbital launches in the early 1960s . A derivative of the Thor - Able , it was a member of the Thor family of rockets , and the first member of the Delta family . The first stage was a Thor missile in the DM - 19 configuration . The second stage was the Delta , which had been derived from the earlier Able stage . An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage . The Thor - Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage . This configuration was reused for a large number of later rockets , and a derivative , the Delta II , remained in service into 2011 . The Thor - Delta launched a number of significant payloads , including the first communications satellite , Echo 1A ; the first British satellite , Ariel 1 ; and the first active direct - relay communications satellite , Telstar 1 . All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17 . The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B , while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight , which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due a problem with the second stage .  - A natural satellite or moon is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another Small Solar System Body).  - An expendable launch system is a launch system that uses an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) to carry a payload into space. The vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once (i.e. they are \\"expended\\" during a single flight), and their components are not recovered for re-use after launch. The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed.  - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).  - The Thor-Able was an American expendable launch system and sounding rocket used for a series of re-entry vehicle tests and satellite launches between 1958 and 1960. It was a two stage rocket, consisting of a Thor IRBM as a first stage, and a Vanguard-derived Able second stage. On some flights, an Altair solid rocket motor was added as a third stage. It was a member of the Thor family, and an early predecessor of the Delta.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'subclass of' with 'launch vehicle'.

Article: Students who get tired of looking at the four walls of a classroom might like to take the nature course being offered by Carvel College again this summer. Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there. Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities. At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected. But they don't mind at all. What they do mind is leaving the beauty of the wilderness and the good friends they've made to return to their normal lives in the city. Question: How far does a student have to walk throughout the course? Answer: A:","output":"About five to ten miles each day.

News article: âTalk That Talkâ by Rihanna Distinctionlessness has become something of a calling card and a weapon for Rihanna, the most consistent pop star of the last five years. Last month she became the fastest solo artist in history to have had 20 Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, slower only than the Beatles. And she has pumped out these hits with little regard for style or mood — breezy dance tracks rub up against poignant, gothically ruptured rock-soul ballads. Her voice is, for the most part, certifiably blank, which is to say it belongs everywhere. But it hasn’t always had a home. “Talk That Talk” (Island Def Jam), her sixth album, is maybe the first to suggest the place that’s been hiding in plain sight all along, placing Rihanna squarely at the center of the pop genre best suited for a singer of her fundamental evanescence: dance music, which conveniently is the mode du jour of contemporary R&B and pop. Rihanna’s version of this sound dates to the club music of the early 1990s, an era in which she would have shone. The best songs on this lively and often great album sound synth-perfect for that time. “We Found Love” almost criminally recalls the swinging Crystal Waters singles, with triumphant percussion somewhere between church and seventh-inning stretch. “Where Have You Been” is even better, with hard, chilly synths, snares from the poppier side of house music, and Rihanna moving in and out of a curled Siouxsie Sioux tone. “I been everywhere, man/looking for someone/someone who can please me,” she sings. “Are you hiding from me yeah/somewhere in the crowd?” “Talk That Talk” is the blithest Rihanna album, which is saying a lot. It has none of the dark, wounded subtext of her more recent albums, almost no sign of scarring left by her tumultuous and abusive relationship with Chris Brown that seemed to hover over her more recent work. It also signals the extent to which the work of polyglot post-soul, post-dance artists like Santigold and M.I.A. have been absorbed into the mainstream. It’s here on songs like “Red Lipstick” (on the deluxe edition) and “Cockiness (Love It),” on which Rihanna is channeling Neneh Cherry, all pseudo-melodic sass. “Cockiness (Love It)” is a particular triumph, its beat by the producer Shondrae a booming industrial jumble, and Rihanna easing out come-ons as if she were lapping up milk. That’s followed immediately by “Birthday Cake,” 80 seconds of squelchy bounce and consumption metaphors. Like Jay-Z and Kanye West’s recent “Watch the Throne,” this album has major parts recorded in hotel rooms, a testament to the globalization and rootlessness of pop, to the outlandish prices of conventional studio time, to the desire to create in an environment of luxury, a liminal space with no repercussions. But that can make for an ungrounded overall experience. When Rihanna veers from the fleet stuff, she’s less certain. “Watch n’ Learn,” which has flickers of Beyoncé’s recent “Party,” has good mouth feel but no taste. And on songs like “Farewell,” the most bombastic one here, it’s tough to tell if the words have feeling, because Rihanna’s voice doesn’t. When she wants to convey emotion, as on “Drunk on Love,” she essentially shouts the lyrics — “I wear my heart on my sleeve!/Always let love take the lead!/I may be a little naïve!” — but staggers around the melody, a victim of trying to feel too hard. “My Life II ... The Journey This record begins with an echo of “My Life,” from 1994, the album often thought to be Mary J. Blige’s best, the one that outlined her as R&B’s gravest diva. On the first track of “My Life,” Sean Combs, her producer, calls Ms. Blige and yells into her answering machine. When she picks up, he jolts her into ambition: he challenges her, warns her against haters, tells her to be on time for the session in the morning. She complies, sounding sleepy but combative. On the first track of this one, she calls Mr. Combs. He is not the producer of this record or anything on it. But he has a stake in its legacy, so she asks him if he minds her recording a follow-up. “It’s not a competitor,” she explains. “It’s a sequel, and an extension of how far we’ve come.” Mr. Combs murmurs something about honesty and life being a marathon, and plugs the older record. As a conversation, even a staged one, it’s so sleepy, so meaningless.

After Blazing Trail, Li Na Exits and Leaves a Gap Despite all of her evident athletic talent and all of her personal sacrifices, Li Na was a late bloomer in tennis, which is one reason — but only one reason — it feels as if she retired too soon. In stepping away because of major knee problems at age 32 years 6 months, she lasted longer on tour than many of the best women’s players of the modern era: longer than Monica Seles or Steffi Graf; longer than Amélie Mauresmo, Kim Clijsters or Justine Henin. But Li had to wait to hit her peak, to shore up her once shaky forehand and confidence, to find the right blend of Eastern and Western expertise. To be frank, which is Li’s way, she never inspired complete confidence under big-match pressure. Even when she was in full flow, gliding powerfully into the corners and generating astonishing flat pace with her strong legs and quick hands, one could never rule out an abrupt shift of focus and fortune. Watching her could be both suspenseful and maddening, and one suspects that if she had chosen to wear a mood ring on court, it would have been flashing a new color with great frequency. In light of all this, she deserves only more credit for finding a way to punch through the doubts and the demons and win her first two Grand Slam singles titles after age 29, something no other woman has managed since the Open era began in 1968. Though she saved the best for late, winning the French Open in 2011 and the Australian Open this year, her timing was still impeccable, and she became a rich woman because of it. Chinese athletes who excel in sports that the West traditionally dominates have a special place in the pantheon: See Liu Xiang in the high hurdles, Yao Ming in the N.B.A. and now Sun Yang in the Olympic swimming pool. Li, once a badminton prospect, will always be the first Chinese and first Asian to win a Grand Slam singles title, and like Yao, she had a personality to which the Western world could warm. A language barrier was no obstacle to perceiving her sense of humor and mischief even if she also could be, on the rough days, as walled off as a hutong courtyard. Like many a funny person, Li had a flip side, as when she stared down a Chinese reporter for a minute that felt like an hour at a Wimbledon news conference in 2013. “She surprised people,” her agent Max Eisenbud said Friday, “because everybody has this stigma of what a Chinese athlete is or should be or should look like. And here she is with a tattoo and an earring on the top of her ear. There was a little bit of the maverick about her, and you don’t really expect that. Her personality, even her feistiness, she was very real.” It was hardly a given that Li would be the first Chinese woman to become a tennis superstar. Frustrated with the rigid national training system, she retired for the first time at 20 to go to college and live unfettered with her future husband, Jiang Shan. And though she later became the first Chinese player to win a WTA singles title, ticking that box in 2004, Zheng Jie, a sturdy and smaller counterpuncher who plays on at 31, blazed a few trails of her own. Zheng and Yan Zi became the first Chinese women to win a Grand Slam doubles title in 2006 at the Australian Open. And in 2008, Zheng, as a 133rd-ranked wild card at Wimbledon, became the first Chinese player to reach a Grand Slam singles semifinal. But Li ultimately won the biggest prizes first, with the help of European coaching, and had the personality to make it doubly memorable. “I think it was because of the whole package,” Eisenbud said. “If Peng Shuai or Zheng Jie would have done the same thing, I honestly don’t think it would have been the same.” We will never know, and though the natural conclusion is that young Chinese players inspired by Li will soon be holding up more major trophies, there are no guarantees. Germany once ruled the tennis world and marketplace with Graf and Boris Becker only to see the sport all but disappear from the radar in a hurry. Since Yao’s retirement, Chinese players are hardly taking the N.B.A. by storm. “The tennis boom in China is not a given,” said Paul McNamee, the former Australian Open tournament director who was part of that event’s push into China and Asia. “It will require nurturing and support. However, with the aura of Li Na and her desire to stay involved, I can see future Grand Slam champions from China within a decade.” Li does intend to remain involved: commercially, philanthropically and developmentally, with an academy in the works and IMG, the sports and media talent agency that has recommitted to tennis under new ownership, looking to leverage her success for the long term. But her forced retirement does once again deprive the WTA Tour of more star power and the opportunity to create what it sorely lacks: a genuine rivalry at the top. Serena Williams has seen plenty of prospects exit the stage earlier than could have been expected: Martina Hingis, Elena Dementieva, Dinara Safina, Henin and Clijsters. “Put it in chronological order, it’s pretty mind-boggling,” said Williams’s childhood coach Rick Macci. Li beat Williams only once in 12 matches and never in a Grand Slam. When Li lost to her for the last time in this year’s Miami final in a summit meeting between No. 1 and No. 2, Carlos Rodriguez, Li’s coach at that time, gave her another pep talk. “ ‘Listen,’ I told her, ‘You are evolving more and more,’ ” he said. “ ‘It takes time. You cannot do what you didn’t do in 17 years in a hurry. You have to believe in it, and if you believe, it will work.’ ” Six months later, Li, the late bloomer, has run out of time and the ability to play through the pain. But her career path was still quite an evolution, and it will be fascinating to see how the game she once rejected evolves from here: in China and beyond.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. Question: What kind of feelings did Steve have for Miss Tennessee? Options: - Very positive feelings.   - Ambivalent feelings.   - Very negative feelings.   - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"The correct answer is \\"Very positive feelings.\\" The text provides ample evidence to confirm that Steve, the dog, harbored very positive feelings towards Miss Tennessee. He is described as loving her a lot, demonstrating the strength of his emotional attachment to her. His affection for her surpassed the bond he shared with the male narrator, as it is articulated in the text that with Miss Tennessee, \\"it was everything else.\\"  Steve exhibits a variety of behaviors that showcase his deep affection for her. He would stand with his paws on the side of the tub while she took a bath, which implies a desire to be close to her and participate in her routines. Additionally, when Miss Tennessee went somewhere Steve couldn't access, he would wait where he last saw her, demonstrating an unwavering loyalty and longing for her presence.  Even when left alone in the car, Steve would stand with his paws on the dashboard, waiting, crying and looking at the male narrator as if the latter were to blame for her absence. These reactions signify not just positive feelings but a deep emotional dependence on Miss Tennessee. His actions do not point towards ambivalent feelings, which would infer mixed emotions or uncertainty about Miss Tennessee, nor indicate any negative feelings, as there is no evidence that he dislikes or fears her in any way. Therefore, based on the context given, it must be inferred that Steve's feelings for Miss Tennessee were indeed very positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To understand the differences, it's essential to analyze the terms used and the structure of both sentences. (1) A rational curve \\"is\\", however, not a curve parameterized over the rational, but a curve that can be defined by rational functions. In this sentence, the definition of a rational curve is established as not being a curve parameterized over the rational. Instead, it emphasizes that a rational curve is a curve that can be defined or described by rational functions. Rational functions are mathematical functions created by dividing two polynomials. Consequently, this sentence implies that a rational curve can be understood or represented using rational functions in its description, allowing for convenient mathematical representation and analysis. (2) However, a rational curve \\"is not\\" a curve defined over the rationals, but a curve which can be parameterized by rational functions. This sentence highlights that a rational curve is not a curve defined over the rationals, meaning it is not restricted to having its coordinate values in the rational numbers set (fractions of the form p/q, where p and q are integers). Instead, this sentence focuses on the fact that a rational curve can be parameterized by rational functions. In this context, parameterization refers to the process of expressing the curve by associating each of its points with a unique parameter value, often using rational functions. Thus, this definition implies that you can use rational functions to parameterize a rational curve in a way that simplifies its representation and computation. To summarize, both sentences describe different aspects of rational curves. The first sentence focuses on the idea that a rational curve can be defined by rational functions. In contrast, the second sentence conveys that a rational curve can be parameterized by rational functions but is not limited to having coordinates within the rational numbers set. While related, these two sentences address distinct facets of rational curves' nature and representation through rational functions."},{"instruction":"Q:Aubrey loved the doll very much, because it was the last thing her mother gave her before dying.

Little does she know that this quaint town hides a terrifying secret, one that has haunted its residents for generations – a deadly curse linked to Leslie Mancuso, a violent serial killer from the past. The movie opens with Kelly settling into her new life in Ravenwood, making new friends and trying to cope with her recent loss. As time passes, she starts hearing rumors about mysterious disappearances and unsolved murders, all believed by the townsfolk to be the work of Leslie Mancuso's vengeful spirit. Kelly, a rational thinker, initially dismisses these superstitions as mere urban legends. However, as the townspeople continue to succumb to gruesome deaths, Kelly starts noticing a series of unsettling coincidences and inexplicable events. Among them is a reoccurring, chilling dream she has about Leslie. Her interest is further piqued when she discovers her mother's old diary, which contains cryptic references to Leslie Mancuso, suggesting a connection between the family and the cursed murderer. Seeking answers, Kelly gradually unravels the tragic history of Leslie Mancuso. Born to an abusive family, Leslie embraced a dark path filled with violence and bloodshed, her rampage coming to an end when she was finally caught and executed by the townspeople. However, before being put to death, she vowed to return and wreak vengeance on the descendants of those who caused her demise, the Thompson family being among them. With the help of her new friends, Kelly dedicates herself to find Leslie Mancuso's remains and destroy them, hoping to end the curse and protect her loved ones. In their quest, they encounter numerous supernatural encounters, unsettling suspects, and unexpected plot twists, all of which test their resolve and their friendship.

Question: What does Naylor promise to do? Movie title: Thank You for Smoking Movie plot: Nick Naylor is a handsome, smooth-talking tobacco lobbyist and the vice-president of a tobacco lobby called the \\"Academy of Tobacco Studies\\", which for 15 years has been \\"researching\\" the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. They claim that their researchâfunded primarily by tobacco companiesâhas found no definitive evidence of any linkage. Naylor's job consists mainly of reporting the questionable research of the \\"Academy\\" to the public and defending Big Tobacco on television programs by questioning opposing health claims and advocating personal choice. Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, meet every week and jokingly call themselves the \\"Merchants of Death\\" or \\"The MOD Squad\\". As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor suggests that product placement of cigarettes could once again boost cigarette sales. Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to Los Angeles to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son Joey in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the cancer-stricken man who once played the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes. As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence. During the drive back, Nick and Joey discuss the beauty of argument. Senator Finistirre, one of Naylor's most vehement critics, is the promoter of a bill to add a skull and crossbones POISON warning to cigarette packaging.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Valerie  for the following movie plot:  Alain Delon stars, as Jeff Costello is an assassin who lives a solitary life with no friends. Costello begins his new assignment stealing a car, obtaining new license plates and a gun from his associate. He then drives to a nightclub at night and shoots the owner, accidentally being seen by the club pianist Valerie (Cathy Rosier). The police pick up Costello and with the investigation led by a determined Police Inspector (Francois Perier), subject him and many others to a line up. Costello is released because he has set up an alibi with Jan Lagrange (Natalie Delon), and also because Valerie lies and states that she did not see him. When Costello goes to collect his money for killing the club owner, his employer attempts to kill him. Police Inspector (Francois Perier) puts together a team of undercover cops to trail Costello through the Paris Metro, an underground labyrinth where Costello escapes. Costello thus seeks to get paid for his killing job and get revenge on the shadowy businessman who hired him, and stay one step ahead of the police Inspector but makes a decision that brings about surprising results.

Input: TL;DR - my SO of 12 years fails to meet me with his side of the bargain when we decided to be better about giving gifts. I’m getting frustrated.  To start out, I’m 26F and my fiancé is 27M, and we have been together for 12 years. We’ve lived together for the past 7 years, and have two small children, 5 &amp; 2. We have a mostly happy life, but the past few years, we’ve gone through a bit of a rough patch financially, so we stopped giving each other gifts for holidays and birthdays, except for the kids. We share finances.  Two years ago, we decided we would get back to giving each other gifts, even if it was a card, trinket, etc. Nothing crazy, small gifts. He agreed and seemed excited. Since then, I have given him gifts for his birthday, Father’s Day, Christmas, and sometimes for no other reason than I love him. Most recently for Valentines Day, I gave him a beard care kit (10), a mug (3), a card from the kids and I, and some candy. I set it up as a surprise for him to go into his office and find and I was really excited for him to see it because I enjoy doing special things like that for him. He showed no emotion, gave a half hearted thanks, and hasn’t made any motion towards reciprocating the gift giving. I’m getting increasingly frustrated because it is now past V-Day with no signs of any kind of plan in motion.  He does work night shift. I’m trying to be accommodating and understanding, but I’m really sad. I’ve talked to him several times over the past year about it, and his response is that he has no idea what I like.  I understand that gift giving might not be his love language, but I have communicated how much it means to me that he meet me in the middle of our deal and he tells me he will get better, but it doesn’t change. I’m not trying to be selfish, and I feel conflicted because should I really be this upset over material things? Probably not, but I can’t help it.  AITA? Output:","output":"OTHER In this situation, the fiancé (27M) seems to be in the wrong based on the anecdote provided. The author (26F) clearly communicated her wishes to resume gift-giving, even if they are small tokens of appreciation, and both parties agreed on the new arrangement. She has made efforts to uphold her end of the agreement, but he has not reciprocated despite being reminded of their agreement. It is important to acknowledge that gift-giving may not be his love language, but since they agreed to try this method of showing appreciation and love, he should make an effort to meet her halfway. The author has tried to communicate their feelings and has demonstrated understanding and patience, especially considering his night shift work schedule. However, the fiancé has not made a genuine effort to live up to their agreement, causing frustration for the author.

Context: Austria-Hungary precipitated the Bosnian crisis of 1908-1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878. This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron, the Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the \\"powder keg of Europe.\\" In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33-day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond. Question: How many years after the Bosnian crisis was the First Balkan War fought? Answer:","output":"The Bosnian crisis occurred in 1908-1909, and the First Balkan War was fought in 1912. To find the number of years between the two events, subtract the starting year of the Bosnian crisis (1908) from the starting year of the First Balkan War (1912). Years = 1912 - 1908 Years = 4 So, the First Balkan War was fought 4 years after the Bosnian crisis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Background: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.  Paragraph: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor? Answer:","output":"To determine which ocean on Planet X had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor, we have to consider the presence and distribution of submarine volcanoes. In the given paragraph, it is stated that the Ice Ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while the Tropical Ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor.  Hydrophones are devices used to detect underwater sounds, such as those produced by submarine volcanoes. As a result, they are typically placed in areas with a higher concentration of submarine volcanic activity to monitor and study these phenomena. Given that the Tropical Ocean has a much higher number of submarine volcanoes compared to the Ice Ocean, it is likely that more hydrophones would be installed in the Tropical Ocean. This allows researchers to gather more data on the numerous submarine eruptions occurring in that part of Planet X. Consequently, it can be inferred that the Ice Ocean, with fewer submarine volcanoes, would have fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor compared to the Tropical Ocean. The limited number of submarine volcanoes in the Ice Ocean would necessitate a lesser number of hydrophones, as there are fewer events to monitor and study in this region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The provided statement, \\"A son and his father are shopping in the mall for a new skateboard helmet,\\" gives us some clues regarding the situation; however, it is insufficient to reach a decisive conclusion that \\"A boy skateboarding off a concrete slab.\\" From the given information, we can deduce that the boy is likely involved in skateboarding, as he is shopping with his father for a new skateboard helmet. This implies that he either currently skateboards or is planning on participating in the activity shortly. Skateboard helmets are essential safety gear, which lends credence to our assumption that skateboarding is involved. Nevertheless, the information provided does not verify the specific scenario, \\"A boy skateboarding off a concrete slab.\\" We cannot definitively conclude that he is currently skateboarding or has just done so. There is no context relating to the boy's activities involving skating off the concrete slab. Additionally, the fact that the father and son are shopping for a helmet does not tell us anything about the boy's skills, experiences, or the type of terrain he usually encounters while skateboarding.

Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the  maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described...

Mr. Rochester's room on fire Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Inferno of Secrets\\" Plot: Jane Morton, a young, aspiring artist, lands a job as a nanny for a wealthy family residing in the mysterious, Victorian-era mansion, Thornhill Manor. The head of the household, the enigmatic recluse Mr. Charles Rochester, is rarely seen, and the staff speaks of him in hushed whispers. When he does make an appearance, Jane is equally perplexed by his charm and standoffish demeanor. One fateful night, Jane stumbles upon Mr. Rochester's room engulfed in flames. She heroically pulls him out of the fire, but not before he sustains several burns. As he recovers, Jane learns that the fire was caused by an anonymous letter sent to Mr. Rochester, revealing dark family secrets that tear at the very fabric of the Thornhill legacy. Determined to get to the bottom of the mysteries surrounding Thornhill Manor, Jane gradually uncovers the truth about Mr. Rochester's first wife, Cordelia, who tragically died in an \\"accidental\\" fire some years ago. Jane finds evidence suggesting that Cordelia's death may have not been an accident. As Jane delves further into the family's history, Mr. Rochester struggles with the conflicting aspects shrouded in his past, still harboring secret love for his late wife. The two of them form an unlikely bond, and Jane finds herself falling for Mr. Rochester despite his haunted past and horrifying secrets. Together, as they search for the sender of the letter and the truth behind the fire that killed Cordelia, they uncover an intricate web of deception and betrayal within the Thornhill family and its circle of friends. As they come closer to discovering the truth, another fire mysteriously erupts in the manor. This time, Jane and Mr. Rochester barely escape with their lives. It becomes increasingly evident someone is trying to silence them. With danger lurking around every corner, they find solace and trust in each other and develop a passionate, yet agonizing romance. In a climactic final confrontation with the truth, Jane and Mr. Rochester confront those responsible for the Thornhill family's downfall, unmasking the true mastermind and finally avenging Cordelia's untimely death. The revelation profoundly changes how Mr. Rochester perceived his first wife, allowing him to let go of the past, freeing his heart for love once more. The story concludes with the rebirth of Thornhill Manor from the ashes, as Jane and Mr. Rochester rebuild their lives together, emerging stronger and more connected than ever. The haunting past is now put to rest, and the two characters embark on a future full of love, hope, and redemption."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy.

Russian spelling, which is quite phonemic in practice, is a mix of the \\"morphological\\" and \\"phonetic\\" principles, with a few \\"etymological\\" or \\"historic\\" forms, and occasional \\"grammatical\\" differentiation. The punctuation, originally based on Byzantine Greek, was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reformulated on the French and German models.  - The letter  (italics \\"\\", \\"\\") of the Cyrillic script, also spelled jer or er, is known as the \\"hard sign\\" (  ) in the modern Russian and Rusyn alphabets, as \\"er golyam\\" ( , \\"big er\\") in the Bulgarian alphabet, and as \\"debelo jer\\" ( , \\"fat yer\\") in pre-reform Serbian orthography. The letter is called back yer or back er in the pre-reform Russian orthography, in Old Russian, and in Old Church Slavonic. Originally the yer denoted an ultra-short or reduced middle rounded vowel. It is one of two reduced vowels that are collectively known as the yers in Slavic philology.  - Old Church Slavonic, also known as Old Church Slavic (often abbreviated to OCS; self-name , \\"slovnsk jzyk\\"), was the first Slavic literary language. The 9th-century Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius of Slavic, Greek descent, or both, are credited with standardizing the language and using it in translating the Bible and other Ancient Greek ecclesiastical texts as part of the Christianization of the Slavs. It is thought to have been based primarily on the dialect of the 9th century Byzantine Slavs living in the Province of Thessalonica (now in Greece). It played an important role in the history of the Slavic languages and served as a basis and model for later Church Slavonic traditions, and some Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches use this later Church Slavonic as a liturgical language to this day. As the oldest attested Slavic language, OCS provides important evidence for the features of Proto-Slavic, the reconstructed common ancestor of all Slavic languages. History. The language was standardized for the mission of the two apostles to Great Moravia in 863 (see Glagolitic alphabet for details). For that purpose, Cyril and his brother Methodius started to translate religious literature to Old Church Slavonic, allegedly based on the Slavic dialects spoken in the hinterland of their hometown, Thessaloniki, in the today's Greece.  - Neutral Yer ( Majuscule :  , Minuscule :  ) is used in transcribing documents when it is hard to tell the difference between a  and a  .

They originally represented phonemically the \\"ultra-short\\" vowels in Slavic languages (including Old Church Slavonic), collectively known as the yers. In all Slavic languages they either evolved into various \\"full\\" vowels or disappeared, in some cases leaving palatalization of adjacent consonants. At present, the only Slavic language that uses \\"\\" as a vowel sign (pronounced //) is Bulgarian (although in many cases it corresponds to earlier \\"\\", originally pronounced /õ/). Many languages using the Cyrillic alphabet have kept one or more of the yers to serve specific orthographic functions.  - The Bulgarian alphabet is used to write the Bulgarian language.  - The Cyrillic script is a writing system used for various alphabets across eastern Europe and north and central Asia. It is based on the Early Cyrillic, which was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School. It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages, past and present, in parts of southeastern Europe and northern Eurasia, especially those of Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. , around 252 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages, with Russia accounting for about half of them.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself.

Sometimes the product feels like an invasive species, especially when using it is required to benefit from the coolest features in other Google products. \\"One of the core insights we had when we started OPTIONS: - CNN was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. - Facebook was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. - Gmail was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. - Google was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. - Google+ was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. - Twitter was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. - Vic Gundotra was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. - YouTube was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra.","output":"- Google+ was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,\\" said Gundotra. The correct answer is Google+ because the news story is talking about how Google has integrated Google+ into its other products and services. The other options, like CNN, Facebook, and Twitter, are unrelated companies and wouldn't be talking about Google's fragmentation. Gmail and YouTube are Google products that are mentioned in the passage, but they are not the focus of the story. Vic Gundotra is a person, not a product, and would not be a logical completion for the sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already. She is a woman after my own heart. Her book inspires you to give it a go. Question: What is true about julia?

This package includes happiness and sorrow, failure and success, hope and despair. Life is a learning process. Experiences in life teach us new lessons and make us a better person. With each passing day we learn to handle various situations. Love Love plays a pivotal role on out life. Love makes you feel wanted. Without love a person could go hayward and also become cruel and ferocious. In the early stage of our life, our parents are the ones who shower us with unconditional love and care, they teach us about what is right and wrong, good and bad. But we always tend to take this for granted. It is only after marriage and having kids that a person understands and becomes sensitive to others feelings. Kids make a person responsible and mature and help us to understand life better. Happiness and sorrow Materialistic happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others face gives a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away. Failure and success Failure is the path to success. It helps us to touch the sky, teaches us to survive and shows us a specific way. Success brings in money, fame, pride and self-respect. Here it becomes very important to keep our head on out shoulder. The only way to show our gratitude to god for bestowing success on us is by being humble, modest, courteous and respectful to the less fortunate ones. Hope and despair Hope is what keeps life going.

Please answer this question: what is the region between mars and jupiter called?","output":"The region located between Mars and Jupiter is known as the Asteroid Belt. The Asteroid Belt is a circumstellar disc in the Solar System that is occupied by numerous irregularly formed bodies called asteroids or minor planets. This is a peculiar feature in our solar system, a swath of space that contains a large number of substantial chunks of rock that never came together to form a planet. The Asteroid Belt is situated roughly between the orbits of the two planets Mars and Jupiter. It's approximately 1.2 to 2.2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun; one AU is the average distance from the Sun to Earth, about 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles. As with planets, asteroids also orbit the Sun in elliptical paths. The vast majority of the objects in the belt are not large, planet-like bodies but rather space debris of varying sizes. The largest object in the Asteroid Belt is the dwarf planet Ceres, which has a diameter of about 940 kilometers. Other substantial bodies of the belt include Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea, all of which have diameters exceeding 400 kilometers. The total mass of all the objects in the Asteroid Belt is quite small compared to Earth. If combined, they would equate to less than 4% of the Earth's total mass, underscoring the relatively small scale of these objects. While there are several hundreds of thousands of asteroids of varying sizes, the distances between individual asteroids are vast, so the likelihood of spacecraft collision is relatively small. The Asteroid Belt is of considerable interest to scientists as it is believed to house materials left over from the early Solar System. These primitive remnants hold vital clues about the formation and evolution of the solar system. For this reason, several missions have been launched to study asteroids in the belt, including NASA's Galileo and Dawn missions. Our understanding of the Asteroid Belt has changed significantly since it was first discovered in the 1800s. Once thought of as a failed planet, it is now understood to be a complex and diverse region of space, which holds much scientific interest for future exploration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Monique, a skilled climber and hiker, has always dreamt of conquering the world's most daunting peaks. Step 2: Establish the setting and the main conflict The story is set in a small, remote village nestled amidst towering mountains. A legendary mountain peak, known as \\"The Whispering Summit,\\" has captivated the attention of climbers from around the world. However, nobody has ever reached the top due to a mysterious, supernatural force manifesting near the summit, causing climbers to vanish without a trace. Step 3: Present the supporting characters As Monique embarks on her journey, she forms an unlikely alliance with a team of seasoned climbers, each with their own unique set of skills and expertise. Their leader is a wise, experienced mountaineer named Malcolm, who has attempted to reach the summit several times but always come up short. There's also Amelia, a gifted geologist who believes there's a scientific explanation behind the supernatural occurrences. Finally, there's Jonas, Malcolm's goofy yet lovable nephew with a knack for comedic relief in tense situations. Step 4: Monique secures the harness and embarks on the adventure The team prepares for their ascent, with Monique securing her harness with utmost determination. Amidst a fierce blizzard, the climbers face numerous challenges: treacherous terrain, unpredictable weather changes, and sudden encounters with mountain wildlife.

Step 6: The climax and resolution Monique, having gained the respect and trust of her fellow climbers, devises a plan to outsmart The Guardian. She combines her climbing skills, harness, and the knowledge of her team members to create a diversion, leading The Guardian into a high-stakes chase through treacherous ground.

Information:  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - The River Torrens is the most significant river of the Adelaide Plains and was one of the reasons for the siting of the city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It flows from its source in the Adelaide Hills near Mount Pleasant, across the Adelaide Plains, past the city centre and empties into Gulf St Vincent between Henley Beach South and West Beach. The upper stretches of the river and the reservoirs in its watershed supply a significant part of the city's water supply. The river's long linear parks and a constructed lake in the lower stretch are iconic of the city.  - Adelaide city centre is the innermost locality of Greater Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. It is known by locals simply as \\"\\"The City\\"\\" or \\"\\"Town\\"\\" to distinguish it from Greater Adelaide and from the City of Adelaide (which also includes North Adelaide and the parklands). The locality is split into two key geographical distinctions: the city \\"square mile\\", bordered by North, East, South and West Terraces; and the section of the Adelaide Parklands south of the River Torrens which separates the built up part of the city from the surrounding suburbs and North Adelaide.   - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - The Onkaparinga River is a river located in South Australia south of the Adelaide city centre . It runs from its source between Mount Torrens and Charleston in the Mount Lofty Ranges , and flows south westerly to an estuary at Port Noarlunga . The catchment is over 500 square kilometres ( 190 sq mi ) in area , and in part includes the following protected areas - the Encounter Marine Park , the Onkaparinga River National Park , the Onkaparinga River Recreation Park and the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve . The Onkaparinga River is the second major river within the Adelaide metropolitan area , after the River Torrens . The name derives from the Indigenous Kaurna name Ngangiparri which translates as \`\` The Women 's River '' . In 1837 Surveyor General Col William Light named it Field 's River , or the Field River , after Lieut William George Field RN ( 1804 - 1850 ) of the brig Rapid , who carried out the first surveys in the vicinity of its estuary , but subsequent Governor George Gawler soon reinstated the Indigenous name . The first Europeans to explore its sources and the Onkaparinga Valley were the party of Dr. George Imlay and John Hill in January 1838 . It is a source of fresh water for Adelaide . Mount Bold Reservoir was constructed between 1932 and 1938 along a section of its path approximately 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) inland . Much of its flow is diverted via a tunnel from the Clarendon Weir to the Happy Valley Reservoir , that in turn supplies some 40 per cent of Adelaide 's water supply . Most years the flow to the reservoir is supplemented by water pumped from the River Murray via a pipeline from Murray Bridge .

Celebration: Brash and friend at the Greenwich party on Monday. He said he hoped winning a gold medal would improve his chances with the ladies. But show-jumper Scott Brash yesterday admitted it hadn’t quite worked out. The single 26-year-old – who won a team gold in the show-jumping on Monday – was seen out celebrating that night in Greenwich. But yesterday, the day he competed in the individual event, he revealed he ended that evening without a lady in tow. He had earlier told BBC presenter Claire Balding, who asked him how the win would change his life: ‘I really hope this win improves my pulling power with women, if I’m honest! That’s about it.’ But yesterday the rider from Peebles said things hadn’t gone to plan. ‘The medal hasn’t had the good effect I hoped for,’ he admitted – adding: ‘I had too good a celebration and a sore head the next day.’ Brash, 26, was one of the British riders who won gold in the team show-jumping on Monday. Both he and veteran Nick Skelton competed again yesterday for individual medals – but both narrowly missed out after incurring faults on the final round. Skelton’s hopes were dashed in Greenwich Park when he hit a fence called Cutty Sark. It was his first error over six rounds of team and individual jumping but it meant he slipped from a potential gold medal jump-off to finish equal fifth with Brash. Despite his disappointment, popular Skelton, who became Britain’s oldest medallist on Monday, received a standing ovation after his performance. Competing: Scott Brash on Hello Sanctos during the Individual Jumping Final Round A at Greenwich Park. Feeling confident: Brash talks to media at a press conference at Greenwich Park. Although he had a hip replacement last year, a shoulder operation the year before that, and has ‘problems walking about’, Skelton was instrumental in Team GB’s victory in team show-jumping on Monday. It was an amazing comeback for the colourful rider, who feared he would never ride again after he was thrown from his horse 11 years ago, broke his back and almost died. When asked about his injuries, Skelton joked: ‘I’ve had two cartilage operations, a shoulder replacement, a hip replacement, a broken neck and I’ve got to get a back replacement – but apart from that I’m fine.’ After finishing his round, the rider shrugged and smiled before taking his hat off for the crowd and clapping the spectators. He was rewarded with an enthusiastic send off, with 23,000 spectators cheering and stamping for the popular rider.

Give English regions the same powers as Scotland, says Local Government Association The call from the LGA, which which represents councils in England and Wales, follows Nick Clegg’s insistence that there would need to be changes in the way English and Scots MPs vote in parliament if Scotland rejected independence and acquired more devolved powers. The issue of English MPs getting a greater say on English legislation – the so-called West Lothian question – will also need to be settled, added the Deputy Prime Minister.

Some parents were killed, others were unharmed when soldiers came calling. Investigators examined period between 1977 and 1989, 'peak' adoption period. Reports says many more could have been taken, investigation underway.","output":"Title: The Dark Reality of International Adoption: A Look into Children Stolen for Adoption Introduction An alarming report has recently shed light on the disturbing phenomenon of children being abducted for the purpose of adoption in the United States, Sweden, Italy, and France. With the investigation focusing on a twelve-year period between 1977 and 1989, considered the 'peak' adoption period, this article will help uncover the unsettling truths behind these horrific acts and discuss the ongoing attempts to address this unimaginable cruelty. The Abductions and Adoptions During the height of the adoption period, unsuspecting parents in various countries faced the unthinkable as their children were kidnapped by soldiers or other individuals involved in these illicit acts. In some instances, parents were tragically killed, while others were left physically unharmed but emotionally devastated. The stolen children were then taken to the aforementioned countries to be adopted by families who remained largely unaware of the sinister origins of their new family members. Investigators Delve Into the Past In order to understand the scope of these atrocities, a team of investigators has been diligently examining the period between 1977 and 1989. As they work to uncover the details of these heinous acts, the investigators hope not only to bring justice to the families affected but also to shed light on hidden human rights violations from around the world. The Possibility of Many More Cases From the information currently available, it is clear that the number of children stolen during this period is substantial. However, the report also includes an ominous warning about the investigation's limitations—there may be many more cases yet to be discovered. As the investigation continues, we should brace ourselves for the chilling fact that the true scale of child abduction for adoption purposes could be far greater than what has been presently uncovered. Conclusion The recent report on children stolen for adoption in the U.S., Sweden, Italy, and France between 1977 and 1989 is a stark reminder of the unfathomable cruelties that can be perpetrated under the guise of assisting orphans and vulnerable children. As the investigation proceeds, it is essential for the international community to come together and find ways to address, prevent, and mitigate such despicable acts. For the sake of the countless families who have been torn apart by these crimes, we must work together to end this dark chapter in history and ensure it never happens again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content.  Question: suppose less chemical compounds produced happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"If human industry produces fewer chemical compounds, it is likely to result in less damage caused by acid rain. To better understand this, let's break down each step of the process and see how reducing chemical compounds can improve the situation. 1. Human industry produces chemical compounds: It is mainly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas that release pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These are the primary precursor compounds for acid rain. 2. Chemical compounds rise into the air: Once sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are emitted, they ascend into the atmosphere and can be transported over long distances depending on wind patterns and other meteorological factors. This means that the effects of acid rain can occur far away from the initial emission source. 3. Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds: When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with water vapor, oxygen, and other elements in the sky, they form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, making the clouds more acidic. 4. The affected rain falls to the earth: When clouds containing these acidic compounds release precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or fog), the resulting liquid is acidic. This is commonly referred to as acid rain. 5. The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content: Acid rain has various damaging effects on the environment and man-made structures. It can cause soil and water pollution, damage to plants, trees, and aquatic life, and corrode buildings, statues, and other infrastructures. Now, if we assume that less chemical compounds are produced due to changes in human industry – for example, through increased use of renewable energy sources or cleaner technologies – the concentration of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere will decrease. This reduction in precursor compounds will lower the formation of acidic compounds in the clouds, resulting in less acidic rain. With less acidic rain, we can expect a reduction in damages caused by acid rain, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and weakened vegetation or forest ecosystems. Moreover, with a lower acidic content in precipitation, the corrosion of buildings and infrastructure will also lessen, ultimately leading to less damage to both natural and man-made objects. Therefore, the correct answer is B: less damage by acid rain. By reducing the production of chemical compounds responsible for acid rain, there will be a decrease in the environmental and structural damages associated with this phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose  is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious  attempt on the part of the liar to...

A total of 9 bullets was found, and the various tests and analysis have confirmed that they were indeed fired at the animal in the 19th Century. Nine of the wounds on the animal are believed to have been caused by Enfield Pattern 1853 muskets. These old injuries were concentrated around the animals tail and hind legs, suggesting that the alligator could have possibly been used as a target for shooting practice by Confederate troops. The huge animal also bore five other bullet wounds from three different calibers  of hunting guns, as well as many dents and scars, which shows that it survived many firearm injuries in the past. It did not however, survive the six 50-caliber bullets fired at him by the group of amateur hunters from Jackson, who were finally able to take it down. The bullets were confirmed as true musket from between 1850 and 1870. This incredible animal brings a whole new view on this large animal native to the southeastern United States.

Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. After signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single \\"Creep\\" in 1992. Radiohead recorded their debut release, the Drill EP, with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with US indie bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992. With the release of the \\"Creep\\" single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; NME described them as \\"a lily-livered excuse for a rock band\\", and \\"Creep\\" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 because it was deemed \\"too depressing\\".  Radiohead released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in February 1993. It stalled at number 22 in the UK charts, as \\"Creep\\" and its follow-up singles \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" and \\"Stop Whispering\\" failed to become hits. \\"Pop Is Dead\\", a non-album single, also sold poorly. Some critics compared the band's early style to the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them \\"Nirvana-lite\\", and Pablo Honey failed to make a critical or a commercial impact upon its initial release. Despite shared influences with popular guitar acts, and some notice for Yorke's falsetto, Radiohead toured only British universities and clubs.  In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. \\"Creep\\" had been played frequently on Israeli radio by influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and in March, after the song became a hit in that country, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first live gig overseas. Around the same time, the San Francisco alternative radio station KITS added \\"Creep\\" to its playlist. Soon other radio stations along the west coast of the United States followed suit. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for \\"Creep\\" was in heavy rotation on MTV. The song rose to number two on the US modern rock chart, entered the lower reaches of the top 40 pop chart, and hit number seven in the UK Singles Chart when EMI rereleased it in the UK in September.  Unexpected attention for the single in the US prompted EMI to improvise new promotional plans, and the band shuttled back and forth between continents, playing more than 150 concerts in 1993. Radiohead nearly broke up due to the pressure of sudden success as the Pablo Honey supporting tour extended into its second year. The band members described the tour as difficult to adjust to, saying that towards its end they were \\"still playing the same songs that [they had] recorded two years previously ... like being held in a time warp\\", when they were eager to work on new songs. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects about this article.

John Pulman was the king of the 1960s, when the world championship was played on a challenge basis. However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper.  Ray Reardon became the dominant force in the 1970s, winning six titles, with John Spencer (snooker player) winning three. Steve Davis first world title in 1981 made him only the 11th world champion since 1927, including the winner of the boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the 14th in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). Ronnie OSullivan is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). Mark Williams (snooker player) has won three times (2000, 2003, and 2018) and John Higgins (snooker player) four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but since the beginning of the century, there has not been a dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player raising the bar. Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985. By retaining his title in 2013, OSullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row, and then later by Mark Selby in 2017.

Write highlights for this article: Vladimir Putin has said that a war between Russian and neighbouring Ukraine is unlikely and that he hopes it 'never happens'. Speaking to Russian state TV, the President called a military conflict between his country and Ukraine 'an apocalyptic scenario'. This comes as an international security watchdog has warned of several breaches of the ceasefire agreed between Ukranian state troops and separatist rebels. Anti-war: Vladimir Putin, pictured yesterday, called a military conflict between his country and Ukraine 'an apocalyptic scenario', adding that he hopes it 'never happens' 'I think that such an apocalyptic scenario [war] is unlikely and I. hope this will never happen,' he told a reporter with Russia. State TV company. This weekend's prisoner swap between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels took place after Putin agreed to use his influence on the separatists during a conference call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. Today, Putin said he did not see the need for another meeting with the leaders of France, Germany and Ukraine on resolution of the conflict. This follows a statement by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that although the current cease-fire has 'very significantly' lowered the level of military exchanges in Ukraine, violations are still taking place. Lamberto Zannier, head of OSCE, said Monday there have been a number of violations in the south, and some limited incidents around the town of Debaltseve and around the Donetsk airport, both seized by separatists. Vladimir Putin, seen at a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier, during the 'Day of the Fatherland's Defender'-celebrations yesterday, said he 'did not see the need' for more peace meetings. Zannier called the agreed ceasefire 'the best chance ... to de-escalate and bring this conflict to an end,' but he stressed that 'there is work to be done.' Today, Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine said they have begun a large-scale pullback of heavy weapons in line with the peace plan. The claim by Eduard Basurin, a top rebel commander, couldn't immediately be confirmed. Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the observer mission that is monitoring the fighting in eastern Ukraine, said he couldn't comment until receiving monitors' reports at the end of the day. The peace plan that was signed February 15  calls for heavy weapons to be pulled back by each side from the front line by 25 to 70 kilometers (15 to 45 miles), depending on their caliber. Disturbing the peace: The OSCE has reported that although the cease-fire has 'very significantly' lowered the level of military exchanges in Ukraine, violations are still taking place. Pro-Russian: Locals greet separatists during a rally to mark the 'Defender of the Fatherland Day' in Donetsk, following several reports of cease-fire violations. The cease-fire has been troubled by violations, leading to concern that it wouldn't solidify and that fighting would continue. A rebel website cited Basurin as saying about 100 122-mm howitzers would be moved on Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian side, but military officials have said that they won't pull back weapons until a cease-fire fully takes hold. On Tuesday, military spokesman Lt. Col. Anatoliy Stelmakh said rebels had shelled the town of Popasna seven times and launched one barrage on the village of Luhanske. Stelmakh also said rebels tried to storm Ukrainian positions near the southern village of Shyrokyne, which is near the strategic Azov Sea port of Mariupol. Concerns persists that rebels aim to take Mariupol to help establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed last March.","output":"1.

Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%. With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well.

They wanted to erase, or \\"wipe out\\", illiteracy - that's when people can't read or write. They said that anyone from 12 to 40 years old who couldn't read had to go to classes to learn.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Marion Eleanor Zimmer Bradley (June 3, 1930 - September 25, 1999) was an American author of fantasy, historical fantasy, science fiction, and science fantasy novels, and is best known for the Arthurian fiction novel The Mists of Avalon, and the Darkover series. While some critics have noted a feminist perspective in her writing, her popularity has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations against her of child sexual abuse and rape by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, among many others. Zimmer Bradley's first child, David R. Bradley, and her brother, Paul Edwin Zimmer, also became published science fiction and fantasy authors. In 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of three to 12. In an email to The Guardian, Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because:  I thought that my mother's fans would be angry with me for saying anything against someone who had championed women's rights and made so many of them feel differently about themselves and their lives. I didn't want to hurt anyone she had helped, so I just kept my mouth shut.  Greyland also claimed that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, Walter H. Breen, for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions. By her own admission, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him.  In response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, announced that it will donate all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity Save the Children. The author Janni Lee Simner, who has continued to write works in Bradley's Darkover series, announced on June 13, 2014 that she would be donating advances from her two Darkover books, her Darkover royalties and at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley's magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.  Since the allegations were made public, Greyland and her brother Mark have spoken at length about their experiences  and a number of famous science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who within a day of the allegations being made public, described the allegations as \\"horrific\\". Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote \\"All of which makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.\\" G Willow Wilson, World Fantasy award winner, said she was \\"speechless\\". Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley's death, said that she was \\"shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland's posts about her mother.\\" Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"This article sheds light on several interesting aspects, beyond the literary achievements of Marion Zimmer Bradley, an American author known for her works in fantasy and science fiction genres. The most significant aspect that stands out is the controversy that surrounds her personal life, specifically the allegations of child sexual abuse and rape brought forth by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland. Moira Greyland's accusation in 2014 reveals the complexities of coming forward with such allegations, especially against a well-regarded public figure. She mentions her hesitation to speak up against her mother because of the potential backlash from her mother's fans who held her as a champion of women's rights. This highlights the challenge faced by survivors of abuse in cases involving influential individuals. Furthermore, the article notes Marion Zimmer Bradley's knowledge and inaction regarding her husband, Walter H. Breen's child molestation activities. This brings into focus the issue of enabling and complicity in situations involving abuse. In response to these allegations, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, announced that they would donate proceeds from her e-book sales to the charity Save the Children. This indicates how the publishing industry can take a stand and support causes by taking actions against authors facing such serious accusations. Another fascinating dimension is the impact of these revelations on fellow authors, particularly those who have worked with or have been influenced by Bradley. Authors like Janni Lee Simner, Diana L. Paxson, John Scalzi, Jim C. Hines, and G Willow Wilson are mentioned as expressing their shock, disappointment, and condemnation of Bradley's actions, and some even going as far as donating their earnings from related works to organizations fighting against sexual assault. In summary, this article offers a striking look at the darker side of a renowned author's life, while also shedding light on the intricacies of coming forward with abuse allegations, the reactions of the literary community, and the potential consequences for individuals involved in such scandals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It took longer to read the book than the letter because the","output":"book was an extensive, thought-provoking exploration of the human experience, delving deep into the hearts and minds of the characters it followed. The letter, on the other hand, was a concise, to-the-point missive, quickly conveying the desired message without unnecessary embellishments. Therefore, the sheer disparity between the two texts elucidates why it took far longer to read the book in comparison to the letter. From the moment the first page was turned, the book captivated its reader with richly drawn characters, each with their own intricately woven backstories and complex motivations. The narrative unfolded at a leisurely pace, allowing the reader ample time to immerse themselves in the tapestry of the fictional world. The author took great care to unravel the intricate plotline, offering surprising twists and turns that kept the reader eagerly engaged. Each chapter introduced new concepts and ideas that required careful contemplation; the prose was beautiful and, at times, even poetic, ensuring that the reader had to pause and appreciate the craftsmanship that went into every sentence. In contrast, the letter was written with a clear, specific purpose in mind: to convey a certain message or compelled action from the recipient. The language was straightforward and unadorned, with a focus on getting the point across in as few words as possible. There was no backstory to uncover, no deeply-developed characters to follow as they navigated their lives. The letter was merely a tool of communication, intended to be read, understood, and then discarded once it had achieved its goal. Additionally, the nature of a book often lends itself to being read over a longer period of time. It can be a source of pleasure or solace, as one delves into another world or universe, escaping the mundane and experiencing something extraordinary. A book can be a companion, there in moments of solitude, to be picked up and put down as time and emotions allow. It can be read at leisure, its words absorbed, its ideas pondered, and its impact felt long after the final page has been turned. On the other hand, the letter's brevity and directness mean that it can be read in a matter of minutes, with the reader often able to absorb and respond to its contents without delaying or breaking stride. The letter does not ask for an investment of time or emotional energy, because it is meant to be concise and efficient, avoiding any unnecessary complexity that might obscure its intended meaning. All these factors contribute to the undeniable fact that the book took far longer to read than the letter. The difference in their length, complexity, language, and even the emotional connections built while reading them all played crucial roles in determining the amount of time required to sift through their pages. While the letter served its purpose and left little to contemplate, the book was a journey, a powerful exploration of human experience and all its complexities, carried out over countless hours spent absorbed in its well-crafted narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: North and South Korea fired hundreds of artillery shells into each other's waters Monday in a flare-up of animosity that forced residents of five front-line South Korean islands to evacuate to shelters for several hours, South Korean officials said. South Korean Marines fired artillery shells across a disputed sea border after North Korean shells from a live fire drill conducted by Pyongyang fell into the water south of the frontier, Seoul officials told the Associated Press. There were no reports of any injuries. Residents on front-line South Korean islands spent several hours in shelters during the firing, and officials temporarily halted ferry service linking the islands to the mainland. Kang Myeong-sung, speaking from a shelter on Yeonpyeong island, which is in sight of North Korean territory, said he didn't hear any fighter jets but heard the boom of artillery fire. North Korea fired 500 rounds of artillery shells over more than three hours, about 100 of which fell south of the sea boundary, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said later Monday. South Korea responded by firing 300 shells into North Korean waters, he said. No shells from either side were fired at any land or military installations, but Kim called the North's artillery firing a provocation aimed at testing Seoul's security posture. There was no immediate comment from North Korea. The exchange of fire followed Pyongyang's earlier, unusual announcement that it would conduct the drills, a move seen as an expression of Pyongyang's frustration at making little progress in its recent push to win outside aid. The world is watching the artillery exchange between the Koreas with concern. White House spokesman Jonathan Lalley called North Korea's actions \\"dangerous and provocative\\" and said they will only deepen its isolation. The U.S. remains steadfast in its commitment to the defense of its allies and is working in close coordination with South Korea and Japan, Lalley said Monday. Russia also urged restraint. \`\`We are worried about the mutual toughening of rhetoric, including the declaration by North Korea that it could conduct a new nuclear test,'' Reuters reported the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday. The Russians also criticized the U.S. for holding military exercises with South Korea which it said were aggravating the situation. The poorly marked western sea boundary has been the scene of several bloody naval skirmishes between the Koreas in recent years. In March 2010, a South Korean warship sank in the area following a torpedo attack blamed on Pyongyang that left 46 sailors dead. North Korea denies responsibility for the sinking. In November 2010, a North Korean artillery bombardment killed four South Koreans on Yeonpyeong. The North has gradually dialed down its threats since last year's tirade and has sought improved ties with South Korea in what foreign analysts say is an attempt to lure investment and aid. There has been no major breakthrough, however, with Washington and Seoul calling on the North to first take disarmament steps to prove its sincerity about improving ties. Recent weeks have seen an increase in threatening rhetoric and a series of North Korean rocket and ballistic missile launches considered acts of protest by Pyongyang against annual ongoing springtime military exercises by Seoul and Washington. The North calls the South Korea-U.S. drills a rehearsal for invasion; the allies say they're routine and defensive. \\"The boneheads appear to have completely forgotten the fact that Yeonpyeong island was smashed by our military's bolt of lightning a few years ago,\\" a North Korean military official, Yun Jong Bum, said Monday, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. Pyongyang also threatened Sunday to conduct a fourth nuclear test, though Seoul sees no signs it's imminent. Wee Yong-sub, a deputy spokesman at the South Korean Defense Ministry, said the North Korean warning about the live-fire drills Monday was a \\"hostile\\" attempt to heighten tension on the Korean Peninsula. Recent threats are an expression of anger and frustration over what the North sees as little improvement in progress in its ties with South Korea and the U.S., said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University. Lim said the North might conduct a fourth nuclear test and launch other provocations to try to wrest the outside concessions it wants. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same because they are asking about the strengths and weaknesses of MongoDB. Each question focuses on a different aspect of the platform: what it does well and where it is not suitable. Let me provide you with detailed explanations for each question. Question 1: What is MongoDB good for? MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database designed for modern applications requiring flexibility, scalability, and high-performance. It is particularly good for the following applications: 1. Big Data and Analytics: MongoDB can handle a massive volume of data, allowing it to process and analyze huge datasets in real-time. 2. Real-time Processing: MongoDB is designed to handle high-velocity data with low latency, making it suitable for real-time applications, such as social networks, IoT, and gaming. 3. Highly Flexible Schema: MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, which allows for easy and efficient management of data structures as they evolve over time. This feature makes it a great fit for applications with complex or changing requirements. 4. Content Management Systems (CMS): MongoDB is an excellent choice for building scalable and flexible CMS platforms that can handle large amounts of content and support different media types. 5. Geospatial Data: MongoDB has built-in geospatial indexing, making it an ideal choice for location-based applications, such as mobile maps and logistics management platforms. 6. Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scalability through sharding, which divides a large dataset across multiple servers. This capability allows for virtually limitless growth of your database, making MongoDB well-suited for applications with huge amounts of data. Question 2: What is MongoDB not good for? Although MongoDB is a powerful and versatile database solution, it may not be the best fit for certain types of applications or use cases: 1. Applications Requiring Complex Transactions: MongoDB doesn't support multi-document ACID transactions until version 4.0. While the recent versions provide support for ACID transactions, it's not as mature as its counterparts in traditional relational databases. Hence, if your application relies heavily on complex transactions, it might be better to use a relational database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle. 2. Strictly Structured Data: MongoDB excels when handling semi-structured or unstructured data, but if your application requires highly structured data with a stable, predefined schema, using a traditional relational database might be more suitable. 3. Heavy Reliance on Joins: MongoDB employs a document-based model, and while it does support joins, the performance can degrade if your application frequently requires complex joins between multiple collections. In such cases, a relational database could be more appropriate. 4. Full-Text Search: Although MongoDB has some text-search capabilities, it is not as powerful or flexible as dedicated full-text search engines like Elasticsearch or Apache Solr. If your application requires advanced full-text search capabilities, consider using these technologies alongside MongoDB. 5. Applications with Single-Server Constraints: MongoDB performs best when deployed across a cluster or on multiple servers. However, if your application is constrained to a single server, the performance benefits and scalability of MongoDB might be limited, and a different database solution might be more suitable. In conclusion, while the answers to these two questions are not the same, each response highlights the distinct advantages and limitations of MongoDB. Understanding these strengths and weaknesses will help you determine if MongoDB is the right choice for your specific application needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]  Now, I have a new situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.  Answer this question please: Was the breakdown of complex molecules lesser or greater in Valley Forest? A:","output":"The breakdown of complex molecules was lesser in Valley Forest. This is because it had a drier environment due to the drainage system composed of ditches dug by the locals. Even though both forests experienced similar rain amounts, the drainage system in Valley Forest reduced the water saturation, which led to a lower rate of wood decay compared to Peak Forest. Wood-decay fungi require excessive moisture for colonization and proliferation, so the lesser moisture in Valley Forest resulted in fewer fungi and lesser breakdown of complex molecules."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"The cake was eaten,\\" can be analyzed from various perspectives such as grammar, semantics, pragmatics, and stylistics. By considering these aspects, we can evaluate the sentence's overall integrity and effectiveness in conveying its intended meaning. 1. Grammar: From a grammatical standpoint, the sentence is well-constructed. It follows the standard English language sentence structure, which consists of a subject, verb, and object. In this case, \\"The cake\\" is the subject, \\"was\\" is the auxiliary verb, and \\"eaten\\" is the main verb in the passive voice form. The sentence employs the passive voice to emphasize the action (cake being eaten) and deemphasize the agent who performed the action. Overall, it is grammatically correct and coherent. 2. Semantics: In terms of semantics, the sentence conveys a clear and straightforward meaning, stating that the cake was consumed. The individual words used in the sentence – \\"cake\\" and \\"eaten\\" – have specific meanings that are easily understood in context, and the auxiliary verb \\"was\\" effectively establishes the passive voice. Therefore, the sentence is semantically sound and communicates its message effectively. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics refers to the context and the way language is used to communicate in specific situations. While the sentence \\"The cake was eaten\\" is grammatically and semantically correct, its pragmatic value depends on the intended context. If this statement is in response to a question about the cake's whereabouts, it effectively answers the question. However, if mentioned without any context, it may leave readers wondering who ate the cake, for what occasion, or when it happened. It lacks specificity about the event, which could limit the sentence's pragmatic value. 4. Stylistics: Stylistically, the sentence is simple, concise, and easy to understand. It employs the most basic sentence structure and uses clear, everyday language. While the passive voice can sometimes be considered less engaging or less informative than the active voice, in this case, it works well, as it conveys the action and focuses on the cake. However, depending on the context and purpose, the sentence may benefit from additional details, embellishments, or a more engaging narrative style. In summary, \\"The cake was eaten\\" exhibits strong linguistic integrity in terms of grammar, semantics, and stylistics. However, its pragmatic effectiveness depends on the context in which it is used. Overall, it is a clear and concise sentence, but it may require additional information or context to convey a more complete and engaging narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Seizing the opportunity at the local butter carving competition, they unite and get ready to compete against Brooke, their biggest competitor.  Laura never romanced the idea of butter carving before, she was more of a pragmatic woman, but when Destiny expresses an interest in this peculiar art form, she takes it up, not just to develop her artistic side but also as a way to build her relationship with Destiny. Carol-Ann provides emotional support and well-needed comic relief. Laura's unknown talent for butter carving gets released and she becomes an overnight sensation in their small town.  Brooke, the antagonist, is a blue-blooded, high society, reigning champion of the butter carving competition. With some many times champion butter carving mom, she’s inherited the talent and the pompous attitude that feels threatened by Laura and Destiny's passionate talent. The whole district knows that standing against Brooke means a battle against years of dedication and perfection. Their quiet life takes an unexpected turn when Laura's butter sculpture catches the eye of the butter carving committee. Suddenly she is invited to participate in the town's biggest competition. Brooke is not pleased with the new competition, and this sets the stage for a deliciously intense butter carving rival story. Brooke goes out of her way to sabotage Laura's work, provoking dramatic confrontations and mounting tension.  Destiny dreams of overthrowing Brooke's reign and delivering the championship to her mom, who she sees as the most deserving. She provides a unique insight into the carvings, their meanings, and vibrant imagination that sets their artworks apart.

Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86).  Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec.  Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22).

By Associated Press A 56-year-old woman who was found living in filth had been held captive for years by her brother in dungeon-like conditions inside their Connecticut home, police said Friday. The frail, malnourished woman was covered in urine and human feces when police conducting a welfare check found her Thursday night, according to Paul Satkowski, deputy chief of the Seymour police. A lock was on the outside of her bedroom door and the room's windows were blacked out with paint. The woman's brother, Arthur Gauvin, 58, was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment and cruelty to persons. The brother and sister lived in the same house with other relatives, including children. House of horror: Arthur Gauvin allegedly kept his own sister a prisoner in the home they shared in","output":"Seymour, Connecticut, subjecting her to appalling conditions and unimaginable cruelty. When police officers arrived at the scene for the welfare check, they were shocked by the squalid environment the victim was forced to live in. It was apparent that she had been isolated from the outside world, with her movements meticulously controlled and restricted by her captor. The investigation revealed that the situation had been ongoing for several years, as the victim languished in her makeshift cell while her abuser maintained a facade of normalcy within the rest of the house. Despite other family members residing in the same home, the extent of the victim's suffering was seemingly hidden from them. As the case unfolded, the local community was left reeling, questioning how such a horrific scenario could transpire right under their noses. Neighbors expressed shock and disbelief at the events, with many claiming no suspicion of any wrongdoing at the residence.  Following Gauvin's arrest, the victim was immediately taken to a nearby hospital for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment. Medical professionals assessed her physical and mental well-being, working to ensure a smooth transition to a safe and supportive environment. In the aftermath, the Connecticut Department of Children and Families was also involved to review the welfare of the other residents in the house, mainly the children. This harrowing case serves as a stark reminder of the hidden atrocities that can occur behind closed doors. It is a call to action for communities to be vigilant and proactive in reporting any suspicious activity or concerns regarding their neighbors' well-being. The swift intervention by law enforcement in this case has brought an end to the victim's nightmare. Meanwhile, Arthur Gauvin will face the full weight of the justice system for his heinous actions, answering for the years of suffering he imposed on his sister."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Walter Wetzel had met Ryan Lamantia nearly eight years ago in a hospital waiting room. Both were very sick----Ryan with brain cancer, Walter with leukemia  . Ryan, who was 3 at the time, began making silly faces at Walter and chatted about going home to change into his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles costume. Several days later, Ryan moved to another hospital. Though they saw each other only a handful of times after that, Walter never forgot Ryan. \\"He inspired me to fight against my cancer,\\" said Walter, now 17, a football player. Then one day, Walter saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt at a mall, which made him decide to search out Ryan. Back home, Walter typed in \\"Ryan Lake in the Hills brain cancer\\" on his computer, and a link to a Facebook page for Ryan came up. But, the news was shocking. Ryan had died on Sept. 8, 2005. He was 6. The Facebook  page  was  for  the  Ryan  Lamantia Foundation, a non-profit organization that Ryan's family formed after his death to raise money for brain cancer research. Walter left this message right away: .\\"Ryan is my hero. My trips to the hospital were always horrible, until the day I met Ryan.\\" Ryan's mom's eyes were filled with tears as she read Waiter's message. \\"We always knew Ryan was special, but to hear it from somebody else, it really means the world to us,\\" Lamantia said. Walter wasn't the only person who was greatly impressed with Ryan. \\"He was a little superhero,\\" said Wendy Stellpflug, a nurse at Children' s Memorial Hospital. \\"Ryan always kept his spirits high, even after he suffered hearing loss and experienced 14 operations.\\" \\"Ryan didn' t let his illness stop him. He always had a smile on his face,\\" said Dr. Stewart Goldman, the doctor who treated Ryan. Walter and his family have been in touch with the Lamantias for the past few weeks. And last week, they met for the first time since Ryan's death. The families told stories of being affected by cancer so young and Walter expressed his hope to volunteer with Ryan' s foundation.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Where in the castle was the last room that was completed by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan?, using the article: In the early nineteenth century, the original Norman castle had been enlarged and refashioned by Henry Holland for the 1st Marquess, the 3rd Marquess's great-grandfather. The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work.  The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase.

I stayed at Pittsburgh for 5 days, and one of my most memorable experiences was eating at Burgatory. When you look at the menu, you must start off with the shakes, and I will guarantee that you'll have a hard time deciding which one to get. They also have hard shakes with amazing descriptions, but sadly I am under 21 :( It didn't really matter because the salted nutella crunch (nutella with nestle crunch bars) was ridiculously addicting and I could have been happy at the restaurant just eating the shake.  However, this place is a burger joint so we obviously have to mention those too. You can either choose a burger from the menu or you can make your own by marking off on a paper menu the kind of meat, bun, rub, cheese, sauce, and toppings you want for your burger. You should try the truffled shallot aioli sauce and add avocados to your burger if you like them! The burgers were juicy and the beef was a perfect medium rare. Because there are so many toppings, they are stabilized with a mini pitchfork, which is so suitable because my whole meal was just really sinful. The burgers come with regular and sweet potato chips on the side but trust me and order the truffled gorgonzola fries to eat with your burger.   We didn't get our burgers for a long time, but my boyfriend and I didn't really notice since we were talking the whole time and were distracted by how good the shake was.

This is unacceptable, and changes my review of a 5 star \\"album\\" to a 1 star \\"CD.\\" Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the review to determine the overall sentiment. In this review, the user talks about the latest CD version of \\"Axis Bold As Love\\" by Jimi Hendrix. They express disappointment with the changes made to the opening lyrics of the song \\"If 6 Was 9\\" and the remixing on other songs and albums. Step 2: Identify positive and negative points. Positive: They mention that it is a \\"great album on vinyl\\". Negative: The remixing and changes to the lyrics are considered \\"unacceptable\\", and they change their review from 5 stars to 1 star. Step 3: Compare the positive and negative points. The negative points are more prominent and carry more weight in the review, as they lead to a significant downgrade in the rating from 5 stars to 1 star. Step 4: Determine if the product is depicted in a flattering or unflattering light. Based on the prominence of the negative points and the change in star rating, I would say that this review depicts the product in an unflattering light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"yeah well we've we've gotten to the point where you know if if if well\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"At this point you know\\" true?","output":"To address the hypothesis \\"At this point you know\\" based on the provided premise, we need to first dissect the premise and understand its meaning and context. The given premise appears to be a fragment of a conversation and lacks a full context. While it is challenging to draw conclusions from such a fragment, it is still possible to offer an analysis and interpretation. The phrase \\"yeah well we've we've gotten to the point where you know if if if well\\" seems to indicate that the speaker has reached a certain point in time or understanding, suggesting that they believe the listener is also aware of the circumstances leading up to this point. The repetition of \\"we've\\" and \\"if\\" could imply hesitation or uncertainty, as if the speaker is somewhat tentative in asserting this claim, or it might simply be a verbal filler. From this analysis, we can attempt to address the hypothesis \\"At this point you know.\\" The original premise suggests an assumption that the listener has a shared understanding or knowledge of the given situation. In this interpretation, the hypothesis holds true to a certain extent, as the premise seems to assume that the listener is aware of the circumstances or context surrounding the subject. However, it is essential to note that the initial premise is fragmented and lacks definite context. As a result, it is challenging to affirm the hypothesis with absolute certainty. If we had more context or a larger portion of the conversation, we could better establish the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. In summary, based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"At this point you know\\" appears to be true to some extent, as it seems the speaker assumes the listener is aware of the context surrounding the subject.

The United States is planning to deploy about 150 soldiers for military exercises to begin in Poland and Estonia in the next few weeks, a Western official said Saturday. The exercises would follow Russia's buildup of forces near its border with Ukraine and its annexation last month of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said earlier this week that the U.S. is looking for ways to reassure its NATO allies of its strong commitment to collective defense. Exercises: The U.S. already has two warships docked in the Black Sea capable of launching a missile-defense system. Russia: The U.S. wants to reassure its allies that it is committed to defending against a threat from pro-Russian forces (pictured) in the Ukraine. The Pentagon's press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said in a statement Friday that American officials are considering a range of additional measures to bolster air, maritime and ground readiness in Europe. Ground exercises in Poland and Estonia would last about two weeks but such exercises would continue on a rotating basis off and on over time, the official said, and other locations in Eastern Europe would be considered. The official was not authorized to discuss the plan by name because it has not been made final and requested anonymity. No specific date for the deployment of an Army company, which usually consists of 150 soldiers, has been set but an announcement was expected next week, the official said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says 'there's an entire range of possibilities and measures that are being considered. Kirby's statement about additional measures didn't offer specifics. 'Some of those activities will be pursued bilaterally with individual NATO nations. Some will be pursued through the alliance itself,' he said. On Thursday, Hagel met at the Pentagon with his Polish counterpart, Tomasz Siemoniak, and told reporters that they had identified new areas of military-to-military cooperation, including special operations forces, air forces and additional military exercises and training, as part of their discussion of closer defense ties. 'Thereâ€™s an entire range of possibilities and measures that are being. considered,' Hagel said on Thursday in a joint. news conference with Siemoniak. 'Rotational basis of training and exercises are always part of that.' Unstable: Ukrainian troops killed three pro-Russian fighters who attacked a National Guard base in the Ukraine. Three additional Russian militants were killed in a gun battle near the eastern Ukrainian town of Slavyansk. In an interview with The Washington Post, Siemoniak said the decision to deploy U.S. ground forces to Poland had been made on a political level and that details were being worked out, the newspaper reported. 'The idea until recently was that there were no more threats in Europe and no need for a U.S. presence in Europe any more,' Siemoniak said, speaking through an interpreter during a visit Friday to the newspaper. 'Events show that what is needed is a re-pivot, and that Europe was safe and secure because America was in Europe,' he continued. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

Plot title: The Cyclops Movie plot: The movie opens with credits and title over a black background. The setting is Guayjorm, Mexico. Inside an administration building is Susan Winter (Gloria Talbott). She is asking for permission from the Governor (Vincente Padula) to fly over a restricted area of his state--the Tarahumare Mountains. She explains that she has been planning three years to rescue her fiancée, Bruce Barton, whose airplane crashed in the area. The Governor asks about her colleagues and their reasons for helping. Despite her best efforts, the Governor is adamant--the answer is no. To make sure his orders are followed he tells her he will place a police escort on the plane. As their airplane is a four place model, this means someone must stay behind.Russ Bradford (James Craig) is at a magazine stand trying to buy a sports magazine. He doesn't speak Spanish and the salesgirl (Marlene Kloss) doesn't speak English. He joins the pilot, Lee Brand (Tom Drake) and Marty Melville (Lon Chaney, Jr.) at an outdoor table for lunch. They are waiting for Susan to return from her meeting with the Governor. Susan arrives and joins them at the table. They ask how things went. She responds, \\"I couldn't do a thing with the Governor.\\" Lee doesn't think there will be any problems. He has a plan for the security escort. They drive out to the landing strip and are met by a policeman (Manuel Lopez). Lee gets in the airplane and starts the engine. It would appear that Marty will stay behind as Russ and Susan board the plane. Marty lures the policeman away from the plane, a Stinson Voyager, and then decks him and boards. The prop wash wakes the policeman and he fires at the departing airplane. The tower calls the plane and orders it to return to the field. Against orders, they continue their flight towards the restricted area of the Tarahumare Mountains. During the flight, Marty explains his reason for financing part of the trip, namely Uranium exploration. Marty brought a scintillator to locate his claim. When the scintillator tops out the airplane... My question: What tries to prevent the rest of the group from flying to safety? A:","output":"In the given movie plot, the primary obstacle that tries to prevent the rest of the group from flying to safety is the Governor of Guayjorm, Mexico (played by Vincente Padula). The Governor denies Susan Winter's request for permission to fly over the restricted area of the Tarahumare Mountains, where her fiancée Bruce Barton's airplane crashed. To ensure that his orders are followed, the Governor assigns a police escort to the plane, who must accompany the group on their journey. However, the group devises a plan to circumvent the Governor's orders and the police escort. Marty Melville (Lon Chaney, Jr.) lures the policeman away from the plane and manages to board the aircraft without the escort. As they take off, the policeman fires at the departing airplane and the tower orders them to return to the field. Despite these attempts to prevent them from continuing their flight, the group decides to go against the order and fly toward the restricted area of the Tarahumare Mountains. It is important to note that while the given plot does not provide a specific antagonist or creature actively trying to prevent the group from flying to safety, the actions of the Governor and the police escort act as significant obstacles in their quest. Additionally, as the group ventures into the restricted area, they may encounter other unforeseen challenges or adversaries that would try to impede their progress and threaten their safety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. The exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each, and each one affects the other reciprocally. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and, unlike oxygen and nitrogen gas, reacts with water molecules to form ionic compounds. Some of these ions combine with calcium ions in the seawater to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a major component of the shells of marine organisms. These organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. Over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on Earth. On land, carbon is stored in soil as organic carbon as a result of the decomposition of living organisms or from weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals. Deeper under the ground, at land and at sea, are fossil fuels, the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. Fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. A non-renewable resource is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. Another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within Earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents. Carbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans. The large number of land animals raised to feed Earth’s growing human population results in increased carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere caused by their respiration....   Q: The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon where?

Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\"När löven faller\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\"So Good\\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \\"Naughty Boy\\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement. The wildcard (joker) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semi-final, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards.

We will also have to reduce the environmental impacts from our farming practices, which have caused widespread damage to soils, ecosystems, waters and even the atmosphere. In fact, agriculture's impacts are as bad as climate change as an environmental concern. Besides, we will have to improve food security for the world's poor. While the Green Revolution of the 1960s made it possible to feed hundreds of millions more people than in earlier eras, the number of the under-nourished in the world has started to rise again. Finally, we will have to increase the recovering ability of agriculture from shocks. Today, our high-efficiency, globalized world has many benefits, but it is vulnerable   to destruction, whether from droughts, diseases or sudden price rises. We must start building better food systems to better keep us away from future shocks. Currently, there are two models of agriculture: local and organic agriculture vs. globalized and industrialized agriculture. Each has been strongly supported and severely criticized, but neither of these models, standing alone, can fully meet our needs. Organic agriculture teaches us important lessons about soils, nutrition and pest management. Unfortunately, organic food provides less than 1% of the world's calories, mostly to the wealthy. It is hard to imagine organic farming developing to feed 9 billion. Globalized and industrialized agriculture has benefits of high output and low labor demands. Without it, billions of people would have starved. However, it has come with enormous environmental and social costs, which cannot be sustained. Rather than voting for just one solution, we need a third way to solve the crisis. Let's take ideas from both sides, creating new, hybrid solutions that increase production, save resources... We can learn from the passage that   _  . A) everyone can afford to enjoy organic food at will B) we will vote to decide which farming system to take C) the writer is quite optimistic about future agriculture D) only experts can find a better agricultural solution Answer:","output":"C) the writer is quite optimistic about future agriculture"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Our Community One Tuesday evening in the beginning of the fall 1996 semester   at Shippensburg University, sirens sounded. These sirens were not in celebration; they were a cry to the university that something was wrong. A house, only one block away, was on fire. Nine of the university's students lived there. From the minute the word got out that help was needed, it seemed like everyone showed up. The victims   of the fire were offered endless invitations for housing for the night. The very next day, everyone got into gear to do their part in helping them. Flyers  were posted with items that were immediately needed, just to get these students through this next couple of days. Boxes for donations   and money jars were placed in every residence hall  . As a residence director, I went before the students in my hall to ask them to do what they could. I knew that college students don't have much, but I asked them to do their best: \\"Every little bit will help.\\" I really didn't think they could do much. I was proved wrong. At the hall council meeting the night after the fire, my residents decided to have a wing competition, where each wing of the building would team up to see who could bring in the most donations. I announced that the wing who won would receive a free pizza party. Thursday evening we announced over the PA system that we were beginning the wing competition. Within minutes, the place exploded. The single large box that I had placed in the lobby   was overflowing. We quickly grabbed more boxes, and we watched as they, too, filled to the brim(;).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Thomas was born in Woodington, Darke County, Ohio, to Harry and Harriet (nee Wagoner) Thomas. His father was a doctor, his mother a teacher. In 1900, the family moved to the mining town of Victor, Colorado. Thomas worked there as a gold miner, a cook, and a reporter on the newspaper. Thomas's most amusing on-air gaffe occurred during one of his daily broadcasts in the early 1960s. He was reading a story \\"cold\\" (going on the air without pre-reading his copy, contrary to his usual practice) which contained the phrase \\"She suffered a near fatal heart attack\\". The line came out of Thomas's mouth as \\"She suffered a near fart ... err fatal heart attack\\". Realizing instantly what he had said, he tried to continue but eventually collapsed into gales of laughter, which continued into - and beyond - his announcer's chuckling sign-off for the day.  Thomas' long-time friend and ghostwriter Prosper Buranelli wrote the nightly newscasts. The day's script was sent by teletype to Thomas' home in Pawling, NY from which he usually did his broadcast. One evening, Buranelli's final story was about an actress going into a Los Angeles hotel with a Great Dane. The dog's tail got caught in the revolving door and she sued the hotel for 10,000. Buranelli added a comment to the story to give Thomas a laugh before going on air, but Thomas read the story as written with Buranelli's comment, \\"Who ever thought a piece of tail was worth 10 grand?\\"  Another on-air mishap had Thomas reading a story about President Eisenhower's visit to Hershey, Pennsylvania \\"where he was greeted by the folks who make chocolate bars, with and without nuts.\\" (\\"Nuts\\" is a euphemism for \\"testicles.\\") As Thomas read the next story, he could hear the announcer breaking up with laughter in the New York City studio, which caused Thomas to break up, as well. Air checks of some of Thomas' gaffes (as well as recreations of his \\"bloopers\\") are available to collectors. What is this","output":"This is a story about a man named Thomas, who was from Ohio and later moved to Colorado where he did different jobs. Then he became a news reporter on the radio and sometimes he would accidentally say funny things on-air. One time, he got mixed up while reading a story and said something that made him and others laugh a lot. He had a friend named Prosper who would write the news stories for him. Once, Prosper wrote a joke in a news story, but Thomas didn't know it was a joke and he read it on the air, which made everyone laugh again. Another time, Thomas said something funny while reading a story about a visit by President Eisenhower and it made everyone in the studio break into laughter as well.

Summarize this article in one sentence. This will typically be a separate track in your software. Depending on how fast or slow you want the song to be, the speed of the click can be divided into halves, thirds, or quarters. You can experiment if you’re unsure.  The click track will help to ensure that with all of the copy and pasting you’ll do, the song stays on tempo. Your tempo will vary according to the mood and style of the song, and is typically between 80 and 120. More likely than not, you'll turn the click track off once you have a basic beat made -- this is just a guide right now to keep you on tempo. The drums are your backbone, providing the structure that all other instruments fall on. They usually come first. That said, you don't have to use drums for percussion -- gunshots, car doors slamming, synth blasts, pots and pans, and much more have been used to provide rhythm in songs of all genres.  Hip-hop beats have a classic trio -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat. That's it. Check out DJ Premier's famous beats on the album Step in the Arena for a classic example.  You can download drum packs, which are recordings of different percussion sounds, to use in your songs for free online. Search the drums you want on a search engine, like \\"Steel Drum Sounds Pack,\\" or \\"Led Zeppelin Drum Sample Pack.\\" Together, the bass and drums form the rhythm section of every song. While the drums set the tempo and beat, the bass locks into this rhythm and hints at the melody, often with simple, danceable lines. There are many songs that are almost all drums and bass -- so don't disregard the bass because it is harder to hear in the final mix -- it's the instrument that gets people dancing.  Bass lines can be a simple, like Nas' \\"Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),\\" or complex, like Common's \\"Be (Intro).\\" A bass line doesn't need a bass guitar, though they help. Listen to what Daft Punk is able to do with deep synthesizers for another example. Your bass line and kick drum (the deepest sounding drum) should mesh for the maximum effect. Most producers like to have them alternating. The bass and the drums should be unique to make your song unique. Still, the melody line is where most songs come to their own and become new, big beats. Build melodies around your mood, using synths and electronic sounds for EDM or techno music, horns and guitars for R&B, even odd \\"found sounds\\" from weird sources (see \\"Windows Media Player\\" by Charles Hamilton for an example). The possibilities are endless. Play around with sounds constantly-- the only way to find out what sounds best is to try out as many different orchestrations as possible. Looping is taking at least one bar of music, like a drum line, and repeating it flawlessly so it sounds like the drummer is playing the exact same thing the whole song. You can, and should, loop everything -- making the perfect smaller section and then dragging it out to save time and get the perfect tempo for your entire beat. Great loops don't feel like loops -- they perfectly come back around so it sounds like a real musician is playing the instrument over and over again. A straight beat is great. But most songs are made up of several related beats, each coming together to provide excitement and movement. The new beats, however, are almost always closely related. Some ideas for breakdowns and changes include:   Add a new melody line: A new sample, some brief vocals, or the re-emerging melody line usually signals a \\"chorus\\" or sing-along section of the beat. This is usually the most memorable part of the beat.  Drop to a minimal beat: Dropping to just drums and bass, or even just drums, is a great way to lower the energy. You can then blast the beat back to pump the song back up and get the crowd really moving.  Building and dropping: Add volume, new instruments, and drums to grow tension and energy, then drop out to a big, bassy, and danceable section. These are more nebulous concepts of music composition, and every producer has different preferences. No matter what you choose, think about these three concepts to make interesting, layered beats.   Tension: Found in juxtaposition, tension is what pulls the song forward. It is the difference between the intense moment before a \\"drop\\" in dubstep and the cathartic, slower boom after the drop -- this difference creates tension, which creates greater songs.  Energy: What is the tempo of the song? How does it change or evolve, and does it bring the crowd with it? Some songs need full energy the entire time, plowing ahead. Others songs benefit from slow builds, changes, and swings in energy.  Space: What is the beat for? If it is for a rapper, you best leave some moments of near \\"silence\\" so that they can get the words out. Think of how \\"full\\" your ears feel -- sometimes simpler is good, allowing one instrument to shine. Sometimes you need all 30 tracks at once.

Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds. While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff.

(CNN)  -- It's interesting how many people have swallowed the BP public relations' bait to call the explosion from Deepwater Horizon oil rig the Gulf oil spill. We need to call it what it is: the BP oil spill. The federal government needs to take control and take punitive action against BP and any negligent government regulators immediately. As a concerned citizen, preparedness speaker and author, and former commander of federal troops in disaster response, I watched with interest as BP brought out its big PR guns to protect its brand and its platoon of expert engineers, paid by BP to talk about how it happened and how they intended to fix it. BP's reaction was much like Toyota's when it was confronted with safety issues. It, too, focused on PR to protect its brand, versus telling the truth, and sent out its engineers to talk about the problem and the fix. The U.S. Coast Guard was the first responder. The Coast Guard's priority always is to save lives. They spent days looking for the 11 missing men. Meanwhile, BP took advantage of this time to make itself the authoritative voice in the news about the spill and blame other companies. The  U.S. government response was based on laws and rules that were created after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. After Valdez, the law changed to make the offending company responsible for the cleanup. A fund was created that all oil companies contributed to. If there was an emergency oil spill, a company could draw  up to 75 million from this fund to fix the problem.  But the fund was meant to help small wildcat operations, not huge conglomerates like BP. Sticking to that regulation was part of the problem. The No. 1 rule when dealing with disaster is to figure out which rules you need to break. Rules are designed for when everything is working. A democracy is based on trust. BP has proved it can't be trusted. iReporters share views on oil spill response. The government needs to change the game and make this a punitive effort. The government has been too friendly to oil companies. The government should immediately freeze BP's assets and start to charge the corporation -- say 100 million -- each day the oil flows. The money could be held in a fund that U.S. government draws on to take care of the people along the Gulf Coast and pay the states for doing the cleanup. Next, BP and the government bureaucrats who broke a law and put the public at risk need to go to jail. I remember when we were evacuating New Orleans on Saturday following Katrina. We pushed the survivors to the airport and a major called and said the pilots refused to fly the plane without a manifest and there was trouble with weapons scanners. I told him to direct everyone to put the people on the planes as fast as possible, and we would to do the manifest en route or on landing. As a result, we flew 16,000 people out of NOLA airport in less than seven hours. The priorities of the response to the spill must be to stop the flow of oil, prevent the oil from getting into the shoreline as much as possible, mitigate the effects of the oil in the ocean, and take care of the people who have lost their source of employment, such as  fishermen and those in the tourist industry. BP's job is to focus on stopping the flow of oil. The government needs to provide more military \\"command and control\\" of the situation. As BP works to stop the gusher, the government must address the problem of the oil coming ashore and take care of the people affected, possibly retraining them in other jobs. The government could do this by using the Stafford Act to fund the states so they can  protect their shoreline and clean up the oil. Then, the long-term effects of the spill must be mitigated. The people of the Gulf Coast, particularly South Louisiana, are still recovering from Katrina. They've been through hurricanes Rita, Gustav and Ike. They know hurricane season is right around the corner and this BP oil spill has the potential to get much worse. And they don't trust BP. In fact, the latest curse going around in southern Louisiana today is, \\"BP you.\\" Punitive action must start immediately, with BP supplying the money, from fines, to help the Gulf Coast get over this catastrophe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russel Honoré. Write highlights for this article.","output":"The BP oil spill, also known as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, occurred in 2010 and was the largest marine oil spill in history. The author of this article argues that the federal government needs to take control and take punitive action against BP and any negligent government regulators. They suggest that the government should immediately freeze BP's assets and start charging the corporation 100 million per day that the oil flows, with the funds being directed towards cleanup efforts and supporting those affected in the region. Furthermore, the author believes that any BP employees and government bureaucrats who broke the law and put the public at risk should face legal consequences. The priorities of the response to the spill should focus on stopping the flow of oil, preventing the oil from reaching the shoreline, mitigating the effects of the oil in the ocean, and assisting those who have lost their sources of employment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is a notable legal case involving open source and IBM?

No Although the statement provided does stress on IBM's involvement in open source, it doesn't answer the question correctly as it doesn't mention any legal case involving open source and IBM.  A better answer would include a mention of such a case, for instance, the SCO Group versus IBM case.  The SCO vs. IBM lawsuit is one of the most notable legal cases that involved IBM in the realm of open source. Filed in 2003, the SCO Group, formerly known as Caldera Systems, accused IBM of contributing SCO's intellectual property (Unix operating system) to the Linux kernel, which is open-source. This according to SCO violated the license agreement between AT&T (the original developer of Unix) and IBM. SCO was seeking billions of dollars in damages, asserting that IBM's contributions to the Linux kernel, notably the enterprise-level capabilities which fostered Linux's adoption in the corporate sphere, contained code from the Unix System V that SCO controlled. This case was considered as a direct threat to the open-source community due to the implications it could potentially have on the legalities and operations of open source distribution and copyright law. In essence, SCO was challenging the premises of open-source software wherein code can be freely shared and modified. The case was dragged on over the years, and IBM and the open-source community took up a rigorous legal defense. In 2007, a ruling was issued that Novell, not SCO, was the rightful owner of the Unix copyrights, which largely defused the case. However, it continued to drag on for several more years due to various legal procedures and complications. In 2016, SCO's claims were finally denied completely, ending the long-drawn legal battle. IBM's victory was seen as a triumph for the open-source community, as it safeguarded the process of open-source contribution and distribution. Importantly, it cemented the legal basis for corporations to use, contribute to, and build businesses around open-source software. This case illustrates the potential legal challenges that can arise in the realm of open source and the importance of diligent legal defense and responsible open-source practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The second Powerball ticket holder in last month's record jackpot has come forward to claim winnings worth nearly 200 million before taxes, the Arizona Lottery said Friday. \\"It is difficult to express just how thankful we are for this wonderful gift,\\" said the winner, a married man in his 30s whom the lottery said it would not identify publicly, at his request. \\"We are extremely grateful and feel fortunate to now have an increased ability to support our charities and causes. Obviously, this has been incredibly overwhelming, and we have always cherished our privacy.\\" The message directed reporters to the law firm Rhoads & Sinon LLP in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which did not immediately return a call on Friday night. The winner lives in Fountain Hills, northeast of Phoenix, said Karen Bach, director of budget, communications and products at the Arizona Lottery. He and his wife relocated there about a year ago from Pennsylvania and had played Powerball in Arizona only twice, she said. The 587.6 million jackpot from the November 28 drawing had a cash option of 384.7 million before taxes. The Arizona winner has opted to take cash, 192.5 million, before taxes. Fake lottery winner may be Facebook's most shared photo On the day of the drawing, he went to 4 Sons Food Store in Fountain Hills, \\"handed the clerk a 20 bill and he said, 'I'd like 10 in Quick Pick Powerball tickets,'\\" she told reporters. \\"The retailer tried to encourage him to spend the entire 20 and he said, 'No, 10 is all I want to spend.' Clearly, that was enough.\\" He left his ticket overnight on the sun visor in his vehicle and retrieved it the next day, after he and his wife heard there had been a winner in Arizona. Then they compared the numbers on the ticket against those posted on the lottery website, she said. \\"They checked the numbers over and over again and were just absolutely shocked,\\" Bach said. Since then, the couple has assembled a legal and financial team to guide them through the process and began meeting with them on Monday, going so far as to use a whiteboard to write down how they wanted to allocate their newfound assets, Bach said. Columns on the whiteboard included entries for financial, legal and \\"fun,\\" she said. The couple opted to claim the prize before the end of the year \\"because of concerns over the fiscal cliff in 2013,\\" she said. The winnings are to be awarded on about December 14, said Jeff Hatch-Miller, executive director of the Arizona Lottery. Hatch-Miller, who met Friday morning with the winner in a hotel suite in Scottsdale, said the winner likes what he does and has no immediate plans to change it. \\"The winner said, 'You know, I like my job; I'd like to continue working my job,'\\" Hatch-Miller said. He described the man's work as \\"just a regular job, like yours or mine -- it's not a high-level job.\\" The winner's anonymity is not likely to last. A spokeswoman for the Arizona Lottery, Cindy Esquer, said it would release his name on Monday to news organizations that file Freedom of Information Act requests for it. Two winners from Missouri claimed their half of the jackpot on November 30. The prize is considered income by the IRS, meaning that the highest federal tax rate of 35% will apply. Each winner would therefore owe 67 million to the IRS, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at tax research firm CCH, in an interview last month. State taxes will also apply. In Arizona, a resident who has the winning ticket will be charged a 5% tax on the prize money. If a non-resident bought the winning ticket, a 6% rate will apply. The resulting tax bill will be either 10 million or 11 million, according to CCH. Ohio cops share 1million Powerball prize Missouri charges residents and non-residents a 4% tax, making the tax liability there nearly 8 million. Taking both state and federal taxes into consideration means the Arizona winner would owe up to 78 million in taxes and take home 114 million. The Missouri winner's tax bill would total about 75 million, leaving a take of 117.5 million. However, in either case, the amount paid in state taxes could likely be deducted on the winners' federal tax returns, lowering the overall tax liability slightly.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique.

Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong.

The answer is:","output":"Hasan Ibn Zayd, also known as the Emir of Tabaristan, was a prominent figure in the Zaydid Dynasty during the latter part of the 9th century. Born to Zayd Ibn Muhammad, Hasan belonged to a lineage deeply rooted in Shia Islam, and his impact on the region's political and religious landscape was significant.  His reign as the Emir of Tabaristan began in 864 and lasted for two decades, ending in 884. During this time, Hasan's rule was characterized by a commitment to the principles of Shia Islam, which served as a guiding light for his governance. Though historical accounts regarding his specific accomplishments as the Emir may be sparse, it is clear that his rule left a lasting impact on the region. Not only was Hasan an influential leader, but he was also known for issuing currency, specifically silver dirhams. A surviving example showcases the breadth of his power and the reach of his rule, as the dirham issued by him locates him firmly within the broader tradition of Islamic history and culture. The dirham with his name exemplifies his authority during his time as the Emir of Tabaristan. Upon his death on January 6th, 884, Hasan Ibn Zayd was succeeded by his relative, Muhammad Ibn Zayd. The Zaydid Dynasty continued to play a significant role in the region's political and religious affairs, with Hasan's passing marking a notable moment in the dynasty's continued evolution. As a member of the Zaydid Dynasty and a leader within the wide landscape of Shia Islam, the Emir of Tabaristan is remembered as a central figure during this time. His rule was grounded in dedication to his faith, and his contributions, as seen through the still-existent currency, serve as a testament to the far-reaching effects of his governance. Hasan Ibn Zayd's legacy is firmly etched within the annals of Islamic history. His reign as the Emir of Tabaristan remains an integral chapter in the story of the Islamic world during the 9th century, reminding us of the importance of understanding these historical figures and the contributions they made to the development of the faith and the region during their reign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

UPDATED:. 18:58 EST, 2 December 2013. Chris Train said that in order to receive the 'luxury' of electricity, customers would have to pay for billions of pounds worth of infrastructure. A power boss sparked uproar yesterday by saying the amount of electricity families in Britain use is a ‘luxury’. The extraordinary claim by Chris Train, a senior director of the National Grid, coincided with energy companies refusing to rule out more price rises. Mr Train warned that providing ‘the luxury of electricity that we desire’ would mean customers paying billions more to upgrade the power network. His comments – described as ‘hugely misjudged’ by critics – came as the Big Six energy firms made a mockery of the Government’s latest attempt to bring down bills. Ministers unveiled measures which they promised would take £50 off the average bill. But power firms will not pass on the savings until deep into the winter months, leaving customers paying higher rates over Christmas. And despite trimming their tariffs, every major supplier yesterday left the door open for another crippling increase. It left Energy Secretary Ed Davey forced into the embarrassing admission that despite the £50 cut in green levies that energy firms have to pay, he was unable to promise that bills will not rise again. Mr Train made his comments when he was asked about the security of Britain’s energy supplies. Critics accused him of being ‘out of touch’ with the struggles ordinary families face in paying their bills. Labour energy spokesman Tom Greatrex said: ‘It’s a hugely misjudged comment. ‘Electricity is not a luxury. The reality is it’s hard for all but a handful of people to live without it. ‘If parts of the energy sector can’t understand that then little wonder that public anger over energy is the way that it is.’ Ann Robinson, director at price comparison site uSwitch, said: ‘To use the word luxury was misguided. Despite protests over sky-high bills last week, energy companies have refused to rule out yet more price rises. ‘That’s a very unfortunate was of describing something that’s absolutely essential to keeping the lights on.’ Family power bills have doubled in recent years as most have seen their incomes squeezed. Recent figures suggest 33,000 people will die from the cold in Britain this winter – many of them elderly and vulnerable. Subsidies. for wind farms and solar panels could face the axe after Energy. Minister Michael Fallon said it was ‘immoral’ to pin the cost on. taxpayers. The average household pays £30 a year for large-scale renewable schemes. They are the second biggest green levy on bills, after insulation schemes – which the Government has just cut. But subsidies often go to landowners who rake in thousands of pounds a year from green energy. Mr Fallon said wind farms and large solar farms were ‘mature technologies’ which no longer need to be subsidised. ‘It. is immoral for hardworking base-rate taxpayers to be lining the pockets. of landowners by funding large scale deployment of mature renewables. that shouldn’t need further subsidy. ‘Piling regressive taxes and green levies on to bills is unfair.’ Mr. Fallon said green policies are the only part of bills that could be. cut, as it is impossible to control world oil and gas prices. Five of the Big Six have already unveiled another round of inflation-busting price rises and the sixth, E.ON, will be announcing an increase on Friday. Mr Davey said he did not have the power to prevent prices rising again, despite the taxpayer-funded cut in green levies that are used to pay for homes to be insulated. ‘They [energy companies] are going to have to reduce bills for households compared to what they would have been,’ he said. But households will still face bills rising faster than inflation and critics said the move failed consumers. Clare Welton, from Fuel Poverty Action, said she ‘would not be surprised to see price rises in the coming months and years’ from ‘companies that have always put their shareholders’ returns before the right of their customers to keep warm and healthy’. And Miss Robinson said: ‘It’s vital that consumers do not walk away from this thinking that they have a cast-iron guarantee that they are protected from future hikes. They aren’t.’ And Adam Scorer from Consumer Futures. said £50 a year off bills ‘will not make a substantial difference to the. millions of people suffering fuel poverty’. British. Gas has said it will lower bills by £53 on January 1 as a result of the. green levy cut –  but that is not until customers have spent this month. paying full rates. Npower. – which announced the biggest recent price rise, 10.4 per cent – said. it would pass on the levy cut to consumers through a price freeze. Chief. executive Paul Masarra said: ‘We don’t plan to increase energy prices. before spring 2015 – unless there are increases in wholesale energy. costs or network charges.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey has admitted that even with the £50 cut to green levies for every customer, bill may still go up. Southern Electric owner SSE said it may not lower its prices until the end of March. ScottishPower boss Neil Clitheroe said: ‘We will continue to try and avoid further price rises in 2014, but this will depend on whether there are increases in wholesale energy prices or other costs outside our control.’ Experts have warned that Britain faces an energy crisis, with ageing power plants closing and plans to build new generators behind schedule. National Grid, which transports power and gas around the country, says it needs to spend billions upgrading its networks. A spokesman said: ‘In order to ensure that the UK continues to experience the secure and reliable electricity supplies that we need for homes and businesses, then there has to be investment in capacity and for that we need a stable investment environment.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

This statement was met with serious criticism, especially considering the impotent attempts by the government to reduce power bills.     3.

Answer:","output":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. Here's why: 1. Misleading title: The title of the review, \\"Difficult to get through,\\" implies that the user had a challenging time reading and enjoying the book. This may indicate that the content could be potentially unengaging or tedious, which may not be the type of book I would invest my time and money in. 2. Unbalanced content: The reviewer states that the historical parts of the book are great but are sparse. This would lead me to believe that the content might not be evenly distributed, focusing more on the author's personal experiences and decisions rather than providing an in-depth view of the historical aspects, thus making it less appealing. 3. Author's agenda: The review mentions that the book seems to be primarily about the author's attempt to justify her decision not to have children. This could indicate that the book is not objective or educational but rather focused on personal justification, making it less appealing to those who are looking for a balanced and comprehensive account on the topic. 4. Narrow target audience: The reviewer's statement that the book would be more suitable for women who fall into the category of missing their chance to procreate implies that the book may not be inclusive or applicable to a wider audience. If I'm looking for a book that offers valuable insights and perspectives for a variety of readers, this review would deter me from making the purchase. Taking these factors into account, the review would decrease my chances of buying the product, as the content and target audience as described seem limited and too focused on the author's personal experiences rather than providing an engaging and well-rounded exploration of the topic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Yes, the answer correctly identifies the co-hosts of American Idol as Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. However, it's important to provide a more detailed and extended response to the question for better understanding. American Idol is an American televised singing competition that debuted on Fox in June 2002. The show has been highly popular, spawning numerous seasons and versions worldwide. The aim of the contest is to find the most talented singers in the United States, who are selected by a panel of judges and voted for by the public. The show's original co-hosts were Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman, with the first season running from June to September 2002. Ryan Seacrest, born on December 24, 1974, in Atlanta, Georgia, is a television and radio personality, producer, and entrepreneur. He is best known for hosting American Idol, serving as the show's consistent host across all its seasons. Seacrest went on to become one of the highest-paid television hosts in the United States. Apart from American Idol, Seacrest is known for hosting the syndicated radio program 'American Top 40' and the nationally syndicated radio show 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest.' Brian Dunkleman, born on September 25, 1971, in Ellicottville, New York, is an actor, comedian, and television personality. He co-hosted American Idol only for its first season. Dunkleman decided to leave the show to pursue an acting career, a decision he later admitted to regretting in various interviews. Although he didn't achieve the same level of success as his co-host, Dunkleman did make appearances on television shows and worked as a stand-up comedian. After Dunkleman's departure, Ryan Seacrest continued to host the subsequent seasons of American Idol solo. The show became a cultural phenomenon and played a significant role in discovering and launching the careers of many successful musicians and singers such as Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson, and more. Throughout its run, American Idol has seen changes in its panel of judges, which initially consisted of Paula Abdul, Simon Cowell, and Randy Jackson. Over the years, other notable judges have included Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban, and Katy Perry, among others. The original American Idol series on Fox ended in April 2016 after 15 seasons. However, the show was later revived by ABC, with Ryan Seacrest continuing his role as the host since its new beginning in 2018. In summary, Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman served as the original co-hosts of American Idol. Dunkleman co-hosted only during the first season, while Seacrest continued as the show's host for all subsequent seasons, making him synonymous with the popular singing competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The law has just not caught up to technology: A Manhattan judge ruled this week that a man who shared naked photos of his girlfriend on Twitter — and sent them to her sister and her boss via email — did not technically do anything illegal. “This case appears to the first in which a New York court has considered criminal charges stemming from what has come to be known as ‘revenge porn,’” wrote Criminal Court Judge Steven Statsinger in his decision. “The Court concludes that defendant’s conduct, while reprehensible, does not violate any of the criminal statutes under which he is charged.”      The Daily News has a breakdown, touching on each of the three misdemeanor charges faced by 29-year-old Ian Barber — aggravated harassment, dissemination of unlawful surveillance, and public display of offensive sexual material:      Harassment entails sending communications to the victim, which Barber didn’t do; unlawful surveillance requires that the images be obtained illegally, which wasn’t alleged; and nudity alone does not equal offensive sexual material, a count that also requires public display, which doesn’t include a subscription service like Twitter, the judge found.      While the law says “public display” would include “any window, showcase, newsstand, display rack, wall, door, billboard, display board, viewing screen, moving picture screen, marquee or similar place, in such manner that the display is easily visible from or in any: public street, sidewalk or thoroughfare; transportation facility,” Twitter doesn’t count because you must “follow” someone to be likely to encounter their messages, according to the decision, which can be read in full here:      The terms of the statute clearly do not encompass either posting an image on Twitter - a subscriber-based social networking service - or sending images to a small number of private individuals, who might not even look at the email or open the attachments. Both of these are private acts.      As for the harassment:      In this case, however, the Information contains no factual allegation supporting the inference that the defendant had any communication at all with Ms. Batch. It does not even allege that she received a Tweet from him containing the pictures, only that she saw that defendant had posted them on his Twitter account and saw that he had emailed them to her employer and sister.      And yet, as the court states in a footnote, revenge porn is on the rise: “This phenomenon has become common enough to have its own Wikipedia page, which defines the conduct as ‘sexually explicit media that is publicly shared online without the consent of the pictured individual.’ That is precisely what is alleged in this case.”      Only two states, New Jersey and California, currently have laws directly addressing revenge porn, an issue covered in-depth by Maureen O’Connor at the Cut last year. “The only way that we’re going to get real change is if there’s a serious criminal statute on the books,” said a legal expert working with the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which grew out of the group End Revenge Porn. This case shows there’s a lot of work left to be done. ||||| Each case is different and, most often, complicated. Still, women everywhere will likely shudder at the news that a man who shared naked pictures of a girlfriend on Twitter has been exonerated in court.      Per a report by Oren Yaniv, who covers the Brooklyn courts for the New York Daily News, the defendant was excused even though he also directly sent the pictures to the girlfriend’s employer and sister. Like a penultimate scene in so many Hollywood courtroom dramas, the accused got off on, essentially, a technicality:      “The Court concludes that defendant’s conduct, while reprehensible, does not violate any of the criminal statutes under which he is charged,” Criminal Court Judge Steven Statsinger wrote in a decision published Wednesday. Ian Barber, 29, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn uploaded the naughty images of his ex in July 2013. He was slapped with three counts: aggravated harassment, dissemination of unlawful surveillance and public display of offensive sexual material, all misdemeanors.      The only states that currently have laws that would have punished Barber are New Jersey and California. Because he didn’t send the photos directly to the woman, harassment was not applicable. It also apparently takes more than straight nudity in photos for something in the 48 other states to be deemed “offensive sexual material.”      Read the full decision here. ||||| Summary:","output":"A judge in Manhattan decided that a man who shared naked photos of his girlfriend on Twitter and sent them to her sister and her boss by email did not break any laws. This is because the judge concluded that posting an image on Twitter, which is a subscriber-based social networking service, or sending images to a few private individuals are both private acts. The judge also mentioned that revenge porn is becoming more common. Only two states, New Jersey and California, currently have laws that directly address revenge porn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As he tried to make sense of the pieces, he decided to pick up the phone and call his colleague, Detective Brummel. When Brummel answered, they began discussing the gruesome murders in depth and the current state of the investigation. The case was proving to be quite the enigma, and they were both determined to crack it. Meanwhile, Brummel's overbearing mother constantly nagged him about his work-life balance. Despite her son's dedication to solving the murder cases, she believed that Brummel should follow in the footsteps of his younger brother, who had become a successful doctor. Unlike Brummel, his brother seemed to always make time for family and personal life. Frustrated by his mother's insistence on comparing him to his brother, Brummel became even more scornful of his career choice. He struggled to understand why his mother couldn't accept that he was passionate about bringing justice to the victims and protecting their community. Determined to make his mother understand the importance of his job, Brummel decided to bring her to the station, where he explained the intricacies of his work and the impact it had on the community. Moved by her son's dedication, his mother finally came to appreciate the significance of his career. As the investigation continued, a new victim surfaced: Palmer. But Palmer did not fit the profile of the previous victims, making the detectives wonder if they had been missing something crucial in their analysis. This unexpected twist pushed Gill and Brummel to reevaluate their approach and piece together the puzzle. The story should ideally include all the key facts in chronological order, focusing on Brummel's struggle with his mother while connecting it to the ongoing murder investigations. The relationship between the two detectives and the development of the mystery should weave together the different aspects of the story, giving readers an engaging narrative they will remember."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As someone with a keen sense of taste, she had always been drawn to foods that satisfied her palate, and in this instance, she was excited to savor the deliciously rich flavors of chocolate.  Her love for chocolate could be traced back to her childhood. Growing up, she remembered the days when her mother would bring home a small, elegantly wrapped package containing succulent Belgian chocolates. The beautifully crafted pieces of confectionery never failed to bring a smile to her face and a sense of comfort to her soul. She relished the velvety smoothness that melted in her mouth, releasing a cascade of exquisite cocoa flavors that danced upon her taste buds. On the other hand, her revulsion towards the fruit could be attributed to a rather negative experience she once had at a young age. Katia's family had an apple tree in their backyard, and one hot summer afternoon, she decided to pluck an apple straight from the tree. Unfortunately, she soon discovered that the seemingly ripe and juicy fruit was infested with worms. The sight of those wriggling creatures, juxtaposed against the once-delicious appearance of her luscious, red apple, left her traumatized. From that day forward, she could not find it in her heart to overcome her fear and loathing of that once-beloved fruit. As Katia grew older, she came to recognize that chocolate could not only bring her instant gratification but also have some potential health benefits. The abundance of antioxidants found in dark chocolate, for example, was something she believed made her occasional indulgence a justifiable act. The slightly bitter taste of dark chocolate awakened her senses with its rich cocoa flavors, while the fruity, acidic notes provided a pleasant contrast to the overall taste experience. In contrast, the fruit that she had initially thought to try as her snack was far from appealing. The uninspiring assortment consisted of overripe bananas with dark spots marring their peels, wrinkled and blemished pears, and apples that seemed to have lost their crisp, refreshing crunch. The pitiful display served only to remind her of her childhood trauma and reaffirmed her belief that the true delight lay in the guilty pleasures of chocolate. So, as she contemplated her options in deciding upon a snack, Katia inevitably chose the chocolate over the disgusting fruit. She reveled in the knowledge that she was not only indulging in her beloved treat but also boosting her spirits and, in a small way, perhaps even promoting her overall well-being. Her fond memories and the potential health benefits of chocolate far outweighed the repulsion she felt towards the lackluster fruit. Thus, her decision was made, and she smiled as she broke off a piece of that alluring dark chocolate bar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She is transferred to a Nazi-run POW camp where hundreds of injured and sick Allied soldiers have been imprisoned. Amidst the harsh living conditions, lack of medical supplies, and brutal treatment by the camp guards, morale is low and many of the prisoners are falling ill, physically and mentally. While in captivity, Margaret hears whispers of a secret network of inmates working together to obtain medicine, food, and other supplies from the local resistance movement. Intrigued and eager to help her fellow prisoners, she seeks out this group and becomes an important member of their operation. Through her quick thinking and incredible courage, Margaret manages to smuggle much-needed medical supplies, primarily antibiotics, into the camp. She forms a small team of trusted inmates, including a former pharmacist, a military doctor, and a mechanically-inclined prisoner who helps them create secret hiding spots and diversion tactics. Together, they discreetly distribute the life-saving medicine to those in desperate need and continue to save countless lives.  Realizing the need to keep their activities hidden, Margaret and her team devise carefully coordinated plans to smuggle the medicine into the camp. They utilize items such as hollowed-out loaves of bread, secret compartments in their shoes, and even the bodies of deceased prisoners to transport the precious medicine. Despite the ever-present danger of being caught, Margaret's compassion, empathy, and determination to help her fellow prisoners never waver. Her courageous efforts not only restore hope within the camp, but also become a beacon of solidarity that ultimately strengthens the prisoner's resolve to survive the ordeal. As the tide of war begins to turn in favor of the Allied forces, word gets out about Margaret's efforts to save lives in the camp. Her story inspires others within the network of resistance groups to take bolder actions, further contributing to the larger war effort. In the final act of the story, an Allied advance eventually liberates the POW camp. Margaret, weathered from her experiences but full of steadfast conviction, reunites with her team and the many men she helped save. They are hailed as heroes, their actions an indomitable testament to the power of the human spirit and the enduring hope it brings even amidst the darkest circumstances. Subplots: 1. Margaret forms a deep bond with a fellow prisoner, Jack, and their love grows stronger through their shared mission to save lives, providing a sense of hope and solace for both characters in this harrowing environment. 2.

Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened.

Summarize this article: You are family, though that doesn’t mean you should know everything about each other’s personal lives. Be respectful of personal space, like bedrooms, journals, or cell phones.   Remembering your sibling’s boundaries will show them your love and respect. Don't read their journal or snoop around in their room when they aren't home. When you feel angry or upset, you will likely start a fight. Work on your emotions in healthy ways rather than taking them out on the people close to you.  Try venting to a friend or to your parent about what is on your mind. This will get rid of your feelings so you don't carry them with you next time you talk to your brother. If you’re really angry with your brother, rather than yelling at him, try writing a letter. This is a safe place for you to vocalize your true feelings, without maybe saying harsh things to him right away. After you've written your letter, you'll be able to discuss your feelings calmly. It’s easy to forget your sibling’s friendship if you’re stuck fighting all the time. Show your brother or sister you appreciate them by doing something nice, for no reason. It’s easy to take your family for granted. You can do things like buy them ice cream or a coffee when you are running errands. Also try things like playing their favorite game together, or buy them a new coloring book or magazine. Whether you share a room with your sibling or you live across the country from each other, it’s important to spend time together when you can. Spend time together that is positive and fun, rather than spent arguing. This will strengthen your relationship and you are less likely to fight. Do an activity you both enjoy, like playing golf, walking in the park, or watching a sci-fi movie. If you tell your brother that you will stop teasing him, do it. Be accountable to what you agree upon, and your sibling will start to trust you. Trust is important to maintain healthy relationships and prevent fights.  If you both agree your fights are starting because you want to be the boss, stop ordering around your sibling and let them make decisions. If your sister doesn't trust you because you always shoot her with your Nerf gun, try shooting a stationary target outside instead.","output":"This article is about getting along with your brother or sister.

Article: LONDON, Feb. 18,2014 (Xinhua News agency) --Britain will send experts to East China's Shanghai to learn from the city's experience in maths teaching in an attempt to raise the teaching standards. British Education Minister Elizabeth Truss is to lead a delegation of experts on a fact-finding mission to Shanghai's schools next week to see how children there have become the best in the world at maths, to get a first-hand look at maths classes and teaching methods there, and particularly to investigate why the performance of almost all children in Shanghai is high, regardless of gender or income. Britain was last year placed 50th out of 148 countries and regions in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness ranking in quality of maths and science education. Two years ago, Shanghai topped the 2012 international PISA tables for maths, while England was ranked in 26th place. The top five were all in Southeast Asia, with 15-year-olds in Shanghai judged to be three years ahead of their peers in maths. The education department said: \\"England's performance in maths has lagged behind while other countries have improved and overtaken us, including Poland and Germany.\\" Actually, it is the latest step in the government's drive to raise standards in maths, looking at what has made schools in the far East the most successful in the world in teaching the subject. \\"Shanghai is the top-performing part of the world for maths--their children are streets ahead. Shanghai and Singapore have teaching practices and a positive mind that make the difference. They have a belief that diligence makes up for lack of ability,\\" Truss said. \\"Our new curriculum has borrowed from theirs because we know it works--early learning of key arithmetic, and a focus on times tables and long division , for instance.\\" She was determined to change the situation as performance in maths is weakening the country's skills base and threatening the productivity and growth. The government is emphasizing maths because of the importance of good grades in the subject... Question: What has made schools in Shanghai the most successful in teaching maths in the eye of Truss?

Neptune: Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

Ann Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961, in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926-2008), an FBI agent of Irish-German heritage, who was a native of Albany, New York; and Nell Husbands Coulter (nee Martin; 1928-2009), a native of Paducah, Kentucky. Her family later moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Coulter and her two older brothers, James and John, were raised. She was brought up in a conservative household in Connecticut by Republican parents, with a father who loved Joseph McCarthy. Coulter says that she has identified as a conservative since kindergarten. Coulter is a Christian and belongs to the Presbyterian denomination. Her father was Catholic and her mother was a Protestant. At one public lecture she said, \\"I don't care about anything else; Christ died for my sins, and nothing else matters.\\" She summarized her view of Christianity in a 2004 column, saying, \\"Jesus' distinctive message was: People are sinful and need to be redeemed, and this is your lucky day, because I'm here to redeem you even though you don't deserve it, and I have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it.\\" She then mocked \\"the message of Jesus... according to liberals\\", summarizing it as \\"something along the lines of 'be nice to people'\\", which, in turn, she said \\"is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity.\\"  Confronting some critics' views that her content and style of writing is unchristian, Coulter stated that \\"I'm a Christian first and a mean-spirited, bigoted conservative second, and don't you ever forget it.\\" She also said, \\"Christianity fuels everything I write. Being a Christian means that I am called upon to do battle against lies, injustice, cruelty, hypocrisy--you know, all the virtues in the church of liberalism\\". In Godless: The Church of Liberalism, Coulter characterized the theory of evolution as bogus science, and contrasted her beliefs to what she called the left's \\"obsession with Darwinism and the Darwinian view of the world, which replaces sanctification of life with sanctification of sex and death\\". Coulter subscribes to intelligent design, a theory that rejects evolution.  Coulter was accused of anti-semitism in an October 8, 2007, interview with Donny Deutsch on The Big Idea. During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants \\"Jews to be perfected, as they say\\" (referring to them being converted to Christianity). Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she didn't consider it to be a hateful comment. In response to Coulter's comments on the show, the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee and Bradley Burston condemned those comments, and the National Jewish Democratic Council asked media outlets to stop inviting Coulter as a guest commentator. Talk show host Dennis Prager, while disagreeing with her comments, said that they were not \\"anti-semitic\\", noting, \\"There is nothing in what Ann Coulter said to a Jewish interviewer on CNBC that indicates she hates Jews or wishes them ill, or does damage to the Jewish people or the Jewish state. And if none of those criteria is present, how can someone be labeled anti-Semitic?\\" Conservative activist David Horowitz also defended Coulter against the allegation.  Coulter again sparked outrage in September 2015, when she tweeted in response to multiple Republican candidates' references to Israel during a Presidential debate, \\"How many f--ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?\\" The Anti-Defamation League referred to the tweets as \\"ugly, spiteful and anti-Semitic\\". In response to accusations of anti-Semitism, she tweeted \\"I like the Jews, I like fetuses, I like Reagan.

New figures show more than a tenth of Britons have got it on up in the air and joined the Mile High Club. Revealing figures from a Lastminute.com survey says of that number, 30 per cent say their  attempt to get raunchy at 30,000-feet was been thwarted by the cabin crew. In the battle of the sexes, one sixth of British men admitted their 'achievement' compared to one twelfth of women. One tenth of Britons say they've joined the Mile High Club, reveals a survey by lastminute.com. A toilet tryst is not a mystery to one in 10 Brits, but one in three say they've been thwarted by cabin crew. French - 27 per cent. Germans - 18 per cent. Britons - 11 per cent. Italians - 6 per cent. Spanish - 4 per cent. Racy flyers from Birmingham are the most likely Brits to be members of the 'club' with one fifth of those surveyed from the West Midlands saying they've been there up there, double the national average. But compared to the frisky French and game Germans, we're relative prudes. One in four of the 1,000 French jet-setters have frolicked in the air while one in five Germans were wily enough to slip by the staff and into the loo. Surprisingly perhaps, Brits are ahead of Latino lovers with those from Italy and Spain lagging behind. Lastminute.com, who surveyed 2,000 British travellers, says food service time in the best to sneak away. Along with the survery, Lastminute.com has issued advice to wannabe Mile High Clubbers keen to follow in the footsteps of alleged Mile High pioneer, pilot Lawrence Burst Sperry. Mr Sperry, or so the story goes, made the most of his autopilot-equipped Curtiss Flying Boat with socialite Mrs Waldo Peirce near New York in 1916 and famously founded the MHC. Lastminute's tips include forking out the extra cash for business class, where the toilets are slightly more comfortable than the average three by three foot of economy and passengers get a bit more leeway. They add that a night flight taking off after sunset is a good choice for high-altitude romance as most passengers will be asleep, lights will be dimmed and flight attendants patrol the aisle less frequently. Engaged! One in four French flyers say they've got down and dirty in a plane's convenience. Time is also of the essence, according to their toilet tryst tips, with drinks and food service an opportune time to sneak into the lavatories while the staff are busy. Even seat choice can be factored in, with an empty row the optimum if it can be selected at time of check-in online. An anonymous lastminute.com spokesperson, who is a member of the Mile High Club, said the most important thing is to 'be strategic and don't walk down the aisle hand in hand.' Pioneering pilot Lawrence Sperry is said to be the founder of the Mile High Club. 'Rather let one person sneak in first and use a coded knock for the door to ensure your plans get a smooth flight,' the amorous staffer said, adding the poll lived up to stereotypes about French lovers. 'It doesn't come as much of a surprise to see the French top this poll, they are certainly doing what they can to live up to our expectations, proving to be the most amorous in Europe,' the spokesperson says. 'Perhaps these results will give Italy the shake-up they need to take on the French in the romance stakes. We always encourage travellers to be spontaneous and if that means getting jiggy in the sky then we're all for it!'

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant traps light from the sun - The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil - This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf - Carbon dioxide enters the leaf - Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together - This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats Answer:","output":"The final step in the process you've described is the production of glucose through the process of photosynthesis and the subsequent distribution of synthesized glucose throughout the plant for growth, reproduction and energy storage. To provide a more comprehensive understanding, let us take a step by step look at this process which is a vital function performed by plants: 1. Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant and other green parts trap light from the sun: These chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy and initiates the photosynthesis process. 2. The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil: The plant's roots extend into the soil, where they absorb water and essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are necessary for the plant's growth and productivity. 3. This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf: The water and dissolved nutrients are transported from the roots through specialized vascular tissues called xylem. The xylem carries this nutrient-rich water from underground up to the leaves and other green parts of the plant. 4. Carbon dioxide enters the leaf: Plants have small openings on their leaves called stomata. These stomata open and close to allow the exchange of gases, particularly the intake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the release of oxygen. 5. Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together: Inside the chloroplasts of the plant cells, water molecules are split into oxygen and hydrogen ions using the energy harvested from sunlight. Carbon dioxide is then combined with these hydrogen ions to create glucose, an energy-rich sugar, through a series of chemical reactions called the Calvin cycle. 6. This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats: The glucose produced through photosynthesis serves as the primary source of energy for the plant. This energy is used by the plant for growth, reproduction, and maintenance of its various life processes. The final step of the described process, after glucose is produced, is the distribution of glucose throughout the plant for its metabolic requirements and long-term storage. Glucose is transported to different parts of the plant through vascular tissues called phloem. Some glucose is immediately used for energy, while the excess sugar is converted into starch or other carbohydrates for storage in various parts of the plant, such as the roots, stems, and seeds. These stored energy sources can be later utilized by the plant as required, especially during periods of low light or adverse environmental conditions. Thus, the production and distribution of glucose derived from photosynthesis play a crucial role in the growth, reproduction, and overall performance of the plant, ensuring its survival and adaptation across diverse ecological niches."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - Oatka Creek Park , part of the Monroe County park system , lies near the center of the Town of Wheatland .

Understand how online poker differs from live poker. Decide to buy again if you lose. Leave the table when you're done. Get more chips.\\" Article:","output":"Title: An In-Depth Guide to Playing Texas Hold'Em Poker: Strategies for Success Introduction Texas Hold'em is a popular poker variant that has captured the attention of millions of card game enthusiasts worldwide. It is a game that requires skill, intuition, and an unrivaled ability to read your opponents. Whether you're an experienced poker player or a newbie looking to dip your toes into the world of competitive card games, this guide will take you through the essential steps of playing Texas Hold'em – from joining a table to understanding the subtle nuances of online poker and ultimately leaving the table as a winner. So let's get down to business and master the art of Texas Hold'em poker! How to play Texas Hold'em: The Basics 1. Selecting the Right Table Before diving into the game, it is essential to choose the right table. In live poker, physical casinos will often have several tables to choose from, with varying buy-ins and blinds. It's crucial to select a table that suits your skill level, bankroll, and playing style. The same applies to online poker platforms, as most will offer a variety of tables, each catering to different players. 2. Understanding the Game Structure Texas Hold'em is typically played with 2-10 players at a table. The game revolves around dealing two private cards (hole cards) face down to each player and then placing five shared community cards face-up on the 'board'. Players have to make their best five-card hand using a combination of their hole cards and community cards. The dealer button is used to indicate the dealer for that particular round. It moves clockwise around the table after each hand. The two players to the left of the dealer button are the small blind and the big blind – these are forced bets that help create action in the game. The first round of betting begins with the player sitting to the left of the big blind.  3. Formulate Your Strategy: Choose Your Action When playing Texas Hold'em, players have the option to either fold, check, call, bet, or raise during a given round. Understanding when to use each of these actions is critical to developing a sound strategy: - Fold: To give up your hand, avoiding putting any more money into the pot. Use this option if you believe your hand is not strong enough to compete with your opponents' hands. - Check: You can only check when no one else has made a bet before you. Checking allows you to see the next card or round of betting for free. - Call: Match the current highest bet on the table to stay in the hand. - Bet: Place a wager, putting money into the pot. This is used when you believe your hand is strong and want others to contribute more money to the pot. - Raise: Increase the wager after someone else has already bet. This can be done to force weaker hands out of the pot, capitalize on a strong hand, or bluff your opponents. 4. Online Poker vs. Live Poker Although Texas Hold'em rules remain the same, there are noticeable differences between playing poker online and in a live setting. Some of these differences include: - Speed of play: Online poker is significantly faster than live poker, as card dealing, betting, and shuffling are done instantly. - Telling Behavior: Live poker players rely heavily on reads and tells to make decisions. Online poker does not offer the same level of physical interaction, so players must rely on betting patterns, speed of play, and other subtle cues. - Anonymity: The anonymous nature of online poker can lead to looser play, as players are not as accountable for their actions as they would be in a live setting. - Multi-tabling: Online poker platforms allow players to play multiple tables simultaneously, increasing the ability to maximize potential winnings. 5. Recovering from Losses: Should You Buy-in Again? When you lose in Texas Hold'em – and inevitably, you will – it's crucial to evaluate your situation before deciding whether to re-buy at the same table. Consider your chip stack, the competition, your emotional state, and the overall dynamics of the game. It's essential to avoid impulsive decisions and going on tilt – playing recklessly, usually stemming from frustration or emotion. If you re-buy, make sure you do so with a clear mind and a solid plan moving forward. 6. Victory or Defeat: Leaving the Table Win or lose; always remember to exhibit good sportsmanship when leaving a Texas Hold'em table. Players should leave either after reaching their goal, feeling they have maximized their potential at the table, or identifying signs of fatigue or aggression seeping into their playing style. Conclusion Mastering the art of Texas Hold'em takes practice, discipline, and knowledge. It is not merely a game of luck, but rather a complex blend of skill, psychology, and strategy. By following these steps, budding poker players can start their journey in the exciting and challenging world of Texas Hold'em – ultimately striving for success at the table and accruing chips (and bragging rights) along the way. So grab a seat, shuffle up and deal, and may the cards be ever in your favor!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Input: Is NOBODY wrong in the post ? POST : My wife is a veterinarian and started at a new practice a couple months ago. This practice is much larger with a more formal structure than the one she left (left a one owner practice and went to a mid sized corporate group). Today was her day off, except she had to attend a doctor's meeting in the late afternoon. These meetings can take up to two hours. She kept floating the idea of taking our oldest to the meeting, which I kept saying was unnecessary as I stay home with our other two kids and regularly get him after school on days she's working. She eventually told him he might be able to come with her, which in his mind means he gets to go with Mommy to work. At this point I flatly told her no, he's not going. This upset him, as he doesn't understand that neither an hour plus meeting of professionals nor an active vet center is somewhere a 5 year old should be. I know she wants to spend more time with the kids, our son especially, but bringing him to a doctor's meeting where she needs to be actively participating isn't the way to do it.

On the other hand, the husband, who stays home with the other two kids, believes that the meeting and the active vet center are not suitable places for a child of that age. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that nobody is wrong in the situation, as both parents have valid concerns and motivations.

It was important, about a big project.  Where might Jenny be?  Here are possible answers to this question: - friend's house - hotel - school - party - office  I believe the correct choice is \\"office\\", here's why: A:","output":"Based on the context provided within the question and the possible answer choices, it seems highly likely that Jenny is at an office. Here is an extensive explanation to support the answer: First and foremost, the statement \\"Jenny answered the phone because this was what she did for a living\\" implies that answering the phone is her profession, which is a crucial part of her daily work activities. Such tasks are generally associated with administrative or customer service occupations, such as a receptionist, secretary, or call center operator, among others. Typically, these types of jobs are located in an office setting. Furthermore, the question mentions that Jenny \\"took a message and passed it on\\", indicating that her responsibility is to relay crucial information between different people, which is a common practice in an office environment. Office work often requires effective communication and organization, and having someone to manage phone calls can facilitate the flow of information within the company.  Additionally, the message she passed on was \\"important, about a big project.\\" Projects, especially big ones, often take place in professional settings where planning, coordination, and teamwork occur, such as in an office. This further reinforces the idea that the environment in which Jenny is working is that of an office. Now, let's analyze the other possible answer choices to understand why they are less suitable options compared to the choice of \\"office\\": 1. Friend's house - While it is possible for people to take phone calls or work remotely from a friend's house, it is highly unlikely that the context of the question points to Jenny doing her job on a regular basis from such a place. Making a living from answering phone calls at a friend's house seems implausible. 2. Hotel - It is true that some occupations involve working in a hotel, like a hotel receptionist or concierge. However, considering the overall context of the question, the term \\"office\\" seems more applicable and broadly accurate. Additionally, one could argue that a hotel's reception or front desk is an office-like setting. Therefore, between the two choices, \\"office\\" better encompasses Jenny's workplace. 3. School - Although answering phone calls may occur in a school setting (such as by a school receptionist or administrator), the context of the question focuses on an important message \\"about a big project.\\" This statement is associated more with an office environment than a school. 4. Party - This answer seems highly unlikely given that the context states \\"Jenny answered the phone because this was what she did for a living.\\" A party is generally a social, non-professional setting that doesn't align well with the notion of earning a living by answering phone calls. In conclusion, when considering Jenny's professional duties, the nature of the message she passed on, and the potential of other given locations, it is evident that the correct answer should be \\"office.\\" This choice accurately describes an environment where Jenny could fulfill her responsibility of answering the phone, receive and distribute crucial information, and work on important projects as her primary job function."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She married Antonio Bourque and lived in Shediac first before returning to the Villa Providence in Moncton .","output":"No, the two sentences do not have the same meaning. Each sentence speaks about the same events but in different locations.  In the first sentence, it is indicated that the woman in question married Antonio Bourque and initially resided in Moncton. Then, at some point in time, they moved back to Villa Providence, which is located in Shediac. This suggests that she might likely have lived in Villa Providence prior to getting married. On the other hand, the second sentence states that after her marriage to Antonio Bourque, she initially lived in Shediac before moving back to the Villa Providence, but this time, it is located in Moncton. This change in location for the Villa Providence between the two sentences is what creates the distinction in their meanings. In summary, each sentence relates to similar events (marriage to Antonio Bourque, living in two places successively) but assigns the events to different locations (Moncton or Shediac). Consequently, the two sentences do not bear the same meaning due to these geographical discrepancies.

Step 2: We want to move -15 to the other side of the equation, so we add 15 to both sides: -5*a - 15 + 15 = 0 + 15 When we do that, we get: -5*a = 15 Step 3: Now, we need to find the value of 'a'. To do that, we want to get rid of the -5 that's with 'a'. Since -5 is multiplied with 'a', we can divide both sides of the equation by -5: -5*a / -5 = 15 / -5 Now, we get: a = -3 So, the value of 'a' is -3.

Please answer the following question: Pakistan tried to control the foreign exchange market and India didn't. By creating the foreign exchange control department, Pakistan tried to stop the devaluation of their currency. India chose to not interfere and let the exchange market regulate itself.  Which country contributed more to the devaluation of their currency?  Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","output":"In order to determine which country contributed more to the devaluation of their currency, it is important to consider the different approaches taken by Pakistan and India in managing their foreign exchange markets, as well as the results and consequences of these policies. Pakistan established the Foreign Exchange Control Department to manage and control their foreign exchange market. This was done with the intention of preventing the devaluation of their currency, by maintaining a fixed exchange rate system. However, this rigid approach to exchange rate management often led to the emergence of black markets, resulting in an unfavorable situation where exchange rates for foreign currencies were much higher than the rates set by the government. This, in turn, promoted speculation and the creation of a shadow currency exchange market, which ultimately contributed to further devaluation. India, on the other hand, took a more liberal approach by allowing the foreign exchange market to regulate itself, without direct intervention from the government. This market-driven approach allowed exchange rates to be determined by the forces of supply and demand, thereby promoting a more stable and flexible foreign exchange market. Though India's currency has also experienced devaluation, the country's decision to avoid strict foreign exchange controls has arguably contributed less to these fluctuations, as market forces were allowed to self-correct. In comparing the two countries' strategies, Pakistan's effort to control the foreign exchange market likely contributed more to the devaluation of their currency than India's laissez-faire approach, for several reasons: 1. The creation of black markets and shadow currency exchange markets in Pakistan led to significant exchange rate distortions and the erosion of the currency's value, as arbitrage opportunities between the official and black market rates allowed speculators to profit. 2. The strict foreign exchange controls in Pakistan limited the availability of foreign currency, contributing to higher inflation and further eroding the value of the domestic currency. 3. India's market-driven approach allowed for a more flexible exchange rate system that could better adapt to changing economic conditions, which encouraged greater stability in the long term. 4. India's policy promoted stronger investor confidence, as foreign investors were more likely to invest in a country where the market was allowed to operate freely, rather than under strict government control. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that Pakistan's attempt to control their foreign exchange market through the creation of the Foreign Exchange Control Department likely contributed more to the devaluation of their currency, compared to India's more liberal approach of allowing the market to regulate itself. This is due to the unintended consequences of strict foreign exchange controls, such as the emergence of black markets and shadow currency exchange markets, which undermined the stability and value of Pakistan's currency, while India's liberal approach promoted greater market stability and investor confidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But after boarding her return flight Thursday she was told she needed to get off. Ash-har Quraishi reports. (Published Friday, Aug. 3, 2018)      For DePaul music student Jingjing Hu, her cello — worth nearly 30,000 — is priceless.      “Maybe I’m exaggerating, but it’s more than our life,\\" she told NBC 5 Friday.      So, for her trip to Miami to perform in a music festival, she and her husband booked two seats: one for her and a second for her prized cello. Hu said she called American Airlines and verified with the agent that both her departing and returning flights would be able to accommodate the cello in a set.      “When I flew from Chicago to Miami, I didn’t have any trouble with that,\\" she said. The flight crew gave her a special strap to hold the instrument in place.      But after boarding her return flight Thursday she was told she needed to get off.      “She said your cello is too big,\\" Hu recalled an America Airlines employee telling her. \\"This aircraft is too small to hold your cello.\\"      Hu was cleared by security and American Airlines representative to board the plane on her return flight, and given the strap again even though it was a slightly smaller plane, she said. But after securing the instrument, it appeared the airline had changed its mind.      Federal regulations allow musicians to carry oversized instruments like cellos in the cabin when passengers purchase an additional seat.      American’s own policy makes this clear on their website: as long as the instrument doesn’t weigh more than 165 pounds and meets unspecified \\"seat size restrictions based on airplane type.\\"      Hu’s weighs less than 10. Still, she says she was escorted off the plane by law enforcement.      This isn’t the first time it’s happened. Last year an American Airlines passenger was booted from a flight because the airline said his cello--also in its own seat--posed a security risk. The airline later said that was an error and apologized. The airline said it rebooked Hu for another flight the next morning on a larger aircraft and provided her with hotel and meal accommodations.      American Airlines told NBC 5 in a statement there was a \\"miscommunication\\" about whether the cello met the requirements to fit onboard the aircraft.      \\"We apologize for the misunderstanding and customer relations will be reaching out to her,\\" the statement read.      A tearful Hu finally made it back to Chicago Friday where her husband, Jay Tang, was waiting.      “I don’t think we did anything wrong here and I think the way they handled it was humiliating,\\" Tang said.      Hu says she hopes to get a sincere apology from the airline and hopes other musicians can learn from her experience.      “You had so many chances to tell me 'you cannot board' yesterday,\\" she said. \\"You never told me until I sat down.\\" ||||| This is how American Airlines treats musicians! So my wife Jingjing Hu, a DePaul University School of Music student, is scheduled to fly back to Chicago on American Airlines flight 2457 from Miami today. She is travelling with her cello in a hard case as a cabin baggage. I purchased two round trip tickets for her and her cello on Apr.2 on the phone directly from AA and told them specifically that one ticket is for the cello as cabin baggage. I was told it is abosolutely allowed and she won't have any problem. She flew from Chicago to Miami on American Airlines 335 on Jun. 19 without any problem. She checked in her flight back yesterday online for both herself and the cello. Today she arrived at Miami International Airport - MIA 3 hours ahead, checked in her luggage, went through security check, and boarded the plane normally. Just before the flight attendants were about to close the gate, she was told to get off the plane because \\"the aircraft is too small for the cello\\". She was assured that she could get on the next flight to Chicago about 1 hour later. When she was turning around and leaving the plane, her cello case touched the pilot. The pilot immediately claimed that he was bleeding because of the touch, while apparently there is no blood or injury to be found. My wife then took a picture of him and he was doing the victory sign to her and said \\"this is why we need to get her out\\". Interestingly my wife was travelling with a friend, who remained on the plane. She told us that after my wife left, two other passengers came and sat in her and her cello's seats. The story does not end here. After she got off the plane and trying to find the next flight that was guaranteed, she was told that the next flight was also \\"too small\\" for the cello, and they called the police because my wife was \\"not being understandable\\". Fairly speaking no one can understand what's happening. So surrounded by three law enforcement officers, my wife was told again that either she purchase first or business class tickets out of her pocket or she could not fly back to Chicago on an American Airlines flight because of Federal Aviation Administration regulations. So basically you either have to be rich to purchase the tickets, or just settle in Miami. I don't know how are musicians supposed to travel to comply with those \\"regulations\\". But clearly AA is just playing around with customers. They just kick off passengers when they oversell their tickets using FAA regulations as an excuse. I could have been told those regulations when purchasing the ticket. My wife could have been told those regulations when flying from Chicago to Miami, at check in counter in Miami International Airport, at the gate or even when boarding the plane. Yet they chose to kick her out last minute after she was seated and her cello safely secured. They even need law enforcement involved. What a shame. Please share and forward this if you can. We are so helpless when facing those giant companies. We demand American Airlines to offer my wife and her cello a flight back to Chicago, an explanation and an apology. CBS Chicago ABC 7 Chicago WGN TV Fox 32 Chicago DePaul University help my wife please. I just want her back safe and sound.      Please retweet this if you can as many of you tell me that they respond faster on twitter. https://twitter.com/Mr_JaYtanG/status/1025203805581918209      ****************** UPDATE ******************      I wrote the story when my wife was told that she either had to purchase two first or business class tickets to fly or she would never get on board. At the mean time I have made contact with news media about the ongoing story.      Hours later, she was booked flight 2796 back to Chicago today, and given a room at Holiday Inn. The police officer escorted her to the shuttle bus. Once she arrived at the Holiday Inn, she was told that she was at the wrong Holiday Inn. So she had to wait for another shuttle to another Holiday Inn. I wonder how many Holiday Inns are around MIA.      This morning, she was told she could only have breakfast for 12 or less, otherwise she had to pay by herself.      At the gate, she was denied pre-board and boarded the airplane in Group 5. She felt very anxious, constantly asked me if she would be kicked off the plane again.      The flight took off just now as scheduled and she is on the plane.      Interestingly minutes after take-off, I received a DM from AA saying the cello cannot fit into a 737 is the reason that she was kicked off. A screenshot is posted.      I’m hoping that I can pick her up at noon without further complications. Her luggage checked in yesterday was on the original flight. Not sure if they can keep that. Her music sheets are in that luggage and musicians know how important and value they are.      ****************** UPDATE #2 ******************      My wife is back home! Her luggage that arrived yesterday at ORD on the original flight was already there at the baggage claim help desk. I am not sure if this is the normal service they provide or because of the incident.

I am waiting to see what their \\"specialist\\" can give us after the \\"deep dive\\". Another screenshot posted. Please forgive me typos.      Thanks for everyone who shared this and supports us.

In a post on Facebook that has been shared more than 1,600 times, Jay Tang posted about his wife’s experience with American Airlines:      “So my wife Jingjing Hu a DePaul University School of Music student, is scheduled to fly back to Chicago on American Airlines flight 2457 from Miami today She is traveling with her cello in a hard case as a cabin baggage. I purchased two round trip tickets for her and her cello on [April 2] on the phone directly from AA and told them specifically that one ticket is for the cello as cabin baggage. I was told it is [absolutely] allowed and she won’t have any problem.”      “It was her first time traveling with the cello,” having its own seat Tang told CBS 2 about the trip.      As immigrants from China aware of prior incidents with passengers on airplanes, Hu read articles about traveling with a musical instrument.      “We read the news about how passengers are treated on American airlines. We just don’t want to get in any trouble,” Tang said.      Hu had flown from Chicago to Miami days earlier without incident, her cello secured in the seat beside her.      On the day of her flight home, Hu said she arrived at the gate and requested to pre-board.      Hu told CBS 2, “When I asked them can I pre-board, they never told me no.” She pre-boarded, requested and received a seatbelt extender, and settled in for the trip.      Hu said a flight attendant approached her before the airplane doors closed and told her she would have to leave the plane, as the aircraft was too small for the cello.      After she deplaned, Hu asked to see the regulations for traveling with a cello. She said they handed her a printout indicating that “bass violins/fiddles” are not permitted on a 737. Hu said the cello is not a bass violin or fiddle.      Beneath the rules about bass violins and fiddles, a section in the printout about the cello reads, “Cello must be assigned a bulkhead window seat on a non-exit row.” It goes on to state “This can be in any cabin.” There is also mention of “757 equipment.”      Another passenger on the plane, Sandy Schadt said, “Flight attendants from first class came back and said she would have to deplane because the plane was too small for the cello.” Schadt said as she boarded she had not noticed the cello in the row ahead of her.      After Hu was removed, Schadt says a man and a woman promptly sat in the seats previously occupied by Hu and the cello. “She was off and the next people were on,” said Schadt.      After deplaning, Hu learned the next American Airlines plane to Chicago was the same size as the one she had been removed from. “When I get off the plane they said the next hour plane is not available because it’s the same size,” Hu said.      American Airlines booked her on a larger plane, scheduled to leave the next day.      Her experience with the hotel also proved to be problematic, according to Tang’s update:      “Hours later, she was booked flight 2796 back to Chicago today, and given a room at Holiday Inn. The police officer escorted her to the shuttle bus. Once she arrived at the Holiday Inn, she was told that she was at the wrong Holiday Inn. So she had to wait for another shuttle to another Holiday Inn,” Tang posted.      “I cried alone in the lobby,” Hu said.      Hu spent the night in Miami. “She called me this morning and she was anxious about getting on the plane,” said Tang.      Tang posted an updated upon his wife’s return to Chicago:      “My wife is back home! Her luggage that arrived yesterday at ORD on the original flight was already there at the baggage claim help desk,” he wrote. “She is exhausted but physically OK. Her well being is the only thing I care [about].”      Hu said she is not sure she will fly again with her cello. “Will they kick me off again? I’m so scared.”      “I don’t think they handled it very well. We didn’t get any phone call from American Airlines,” Hu said. She said Tang has received messages from the company representatives on Twitter, letting him know they will take a “deep dive” into the situation.      American Airlines released a statement blaming the incident on a “miscommunication.”      “A passenger on flight 2457 from Miami to Chicago was traveling with her cello. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication about whether the cello she was traveling with met the requirements to fit onboard the particular aircraft she was flying, a Boeing 737,” spokeswoman Alexis Aran Coello stated in an email. “We rebooked our passenger on a flight the next morning on a larger aircraft, a Boeing 767. We provided her a hotel and meal accommodations for the inconvenience. We apologize for the misunderstanding and customer relations has reached out to her.” |||||Summary:","output":"A music student named Jingjing Hu was flying with her cello from Miami to Chicago. She and her husband had bought two plane tickets, one for her and one for her cello so it could sit next to her. This is because some instruments are delicate and expensive, so they need special care when traveling. When Jingjing was on the plane, a flight attendant told her the airplane was too small for her cello and she had to leave. This made her very upset and confused. Later, the airline realized there was a mistake and apologized to Jingjing, providing her with a hotel stay and a different flight the next day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Before when did Buckingham Palace look dull? Context: In 1901 the accession of Edward VII saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife Queen Alexandra had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as \\"the Marlborough House Set\\", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle époque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? to which it succeeds","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence \\"to which it succeeds,\\" we must analyze the context and the language used within the sentence. Sentiment analysis refers to the process of identifying and categorizing the emotion expressed in a piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral. The given sentence is quite minimal, without much context, making it a bit challenging to definitively assign a sentiment. However, let's examine the possible meanings and their corresponding sentiments: 1. Positive sentiment: In this scenario, we can interpret the sentence \\"to which it succeeds\\" as praising a movie or some aspect of a film. The word \\"succeeds\\" generally has a positive connotation, as it implies that something has accomplished its goal or met the desired standard. In this case, one can argue that the sentiment expressed is positive, as it acknowledges the success of the movie. 2. Neutral sentiment: Another interpretation is that the sentence might be part of a larger context where it is not explicitly offering praise or criticism but simply acknowledging that the movie has successfully met its objective. In this case, you can view the sentiment as neutral, as it neither expresses a strong positive nor negative emotion. Given the ambiguity of the sentence, it is crucial to consider the context in which it appears in a movie review to provide an accurate sentiment analysis. Understanding the surrounding sentences and the overall tone of the review would help narrow down whether the sentiment is positive or neutral."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death. The answer to this question is:","output":"Monteux"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Input: Review: I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I'd seen, \\"Burning Moon\\". But while that movie was rather grim and nasty, \\"Premutos\\" seems to mostly play it for laughs. While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this), I found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene. Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movies, especially \\"Braindead\\". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in \\"Bad Taste\\", it's clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it) Question: is it a positive review?

Do we have the right to be stupid?","output":"While the two questions may appear similar at first glance, they are not exactly the same. They both explore the concept of having the right to be stupid, but they approach the topic from slightly different angles. Let's examine these questions in more detail: 1. Should there be a right to be stupid? This question is more philosophical in nature and looks at whether or not society should accept and allow an individual to exercise stupidity. It involves a normative evaluation, requiring us to form an opinion on whether it is desirable or morally sound to grant such a right. In this scenario, one may argue that the right to be stupid is grounded in the principle of personal freedom. People should have autonomy over their thoughts, beliefs, and actions, even if they may occasionally lead to self-inflicted harm or less-than-ideal outcomes. This perspective is often based on the idea that personal growth and self-discovery can only be achieved through trial and error and by learning from one's mistakes. Additionally, one could argue that excessive regulation of individual behavior may stifle creativity and innovation, leading to a more controlled and less vibrant society. On the other hand, some may argue that granting a right to be stupid might lead to detrimental consequences for society as a whole. For instance, if people act without considering the consequences, it could result in dangerous situations or negatively affect the well-being of others. In this case, opponents of the right to be stupid may advocate for a more cautious and responsible approach to individual freedom, emphasizing the importance of balancing personal autonomy with collective interests. 2. Do we have the right to be stupid? This question shifts the focus from whether or not a right to be stupid should exist to whether it currently exists. It typically looks at the legal and social frameworks in place and assesses whether there are protections or allowances for individuals to act in ways that might be considered \\"stupid.\\" In democracies, legal systems often prioritize personal liberty, allowing individuals the freedom to think, believe, and act as they choose, within certain limitations. While there may not be a specific \\"right to be stupid\\" written into law, people might still be afforded the freedom to make misguided or irrational decisions so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others. This would mean that, in practice, there is a level of tolerance for individual folly, although that would be restricted by laws and regulations designed to maintain public order and safety. However, different societies might have different tolerances for perceived stupidity. In some cultures, conformity and adherence to societal norms may be highly valued, leaving little room for behaviors or actions that deviate from the expected. In this case, there might exist social pressures that discourage acting in ways that are perceived as \\"stupid,\\" even if there is no specific legal framework addressing such behaviors. In conclusion, while both questions deal with the concept of having the right to be stupid, they are not exactly the same. The first question focuses on whether or not society should accept and allow an individual the right to be stupid, which requires a normative evaluation. Conversely, the second question assesses whether an individual currently has the right to be stupid based on existing legal and social frameworks. Both questions prompt valuable discussions on the balance between personal freedom, responsibility, and the interests of society as a whole."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"what is the first place mentioned?\\" is in \\"A year before Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias death, three of Alfonso's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate, partitioning the kingdom among them.

Please answer this question: Who played the gunslinging cowboy robot 406 in the 1973 movie Westworld?","output":"In the 1973 science fiction western thriller movie, Westworld, the gunslinging cowboy robot 406 was portrayed by the talented actor Yul Brynner. Born as Yuliy Borisovich Brynner on July 11, 1920, the actor originally hailed from Russia but later became an American citizen. Apart from being an actor, Yul Brynner was also a singer, director, and accomplished photographer. Westworld was an intriguing venture in the world of cinema, as it was written and directed by Michael Crichton. The movie presents a dystopian future where wealthy people can visit a high-tech amusement park called Delos, which features state-of-the-art animatronics and artificially intelligent androids that simulate a variety of scenarios. One of these scenarios is Westworld, which is an immersive experience in the wild west universe. Yul Brynner's character was named Robot 406 and was modeled after the infamous gunslinger from the 1950s TV series \\"The King and I,\\" which Brynner also starred in. In his portrayal of the Gunslinger, Yul Brynner successfully embodied the iconic cowboy look, complete with a dark suit, hat, and a distinctive walk. As a guest at the park, visitors have the opportunity to engage in activities such as shootouts, saloon fights, and encounters with lawmen or outlaws. The Gunslinger's primary purpose in Westworld is to challenge guests to gunfights, allowing them to demonstrate their prowess in the simulated wild west setting. However, Westworld takes a dark and unexpected turn when a malfunction in the park's artificial intelligence system results in the androids becoming uncontrollable and dangerous. The Gunslinger gains the ability to kill and becomes a relentless hunter, pursuing two protagonists, Peter Martin and John Blane, who struggle to escape the park. Yul Brynner's portrayal of the Gunslinger has left a lasting impact on popular culture, with the character being a precursor to the concept of AI-driven machines turning against their human creators. The Gunslinger's chilling performance in Westworld can be seen as a significant influence on subsequent science fiction films and literature exploring the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The training camp The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main characters To build a movie plot, I will start by creating the main characters. In this case, our protagonist is Omar, a young and passionate individual who decides to join a secretive training camp in order to fight for what he believes in. Step 2: Create the setting The story takes place in a remote and covert training camp, hidden deep within a dense forest. The camp is run by seasoned veterans, who train new recruits in the art of guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and specialized weapons handling, such as rocket launchers. Step 3: Develop the conflict As Omar's training progresses, he struggles with mastering the rocket launcher. Despite his best efforts and the support of his fellow recruits, his performance continues to be subpar. One day, during a live-fire exercise, Omar misfires the rocket, causing a catastrophic accident that puts the entire camp and its members in danger. Step 4: Introduce a turning point The accident leads to Omar being ostracized by his fellow recruits and trainers, who doubt his commitment and ability to effectively contribute to their cause. However, instead of succumbing to despair and self-doubt, Omar becomes determined to redeem himself and prove his worth to the group. Step 5: Introduce external threats With Omar's accident and the subsequent explosion, the previously hidden training camp has drawn the attention of the government and rival factions. As external threats begin to close in on the camp, the group must decide whether they can trust a seemingly unreliable Omar with their lives and the success of their mission. Step 6: Bring the story to a climax As the enemies' forces approach, Omar takes it upon himself to devise a plan to defend and save the camp. With time running out, Omar must put his newly acquired skills to the test and confront his own fears and insecurities. In a dramatic showdown, Omar successfully fires the rocket launcher at a critical target, destroying the enemy's advance and proving his worth to the group. Step 7: Resolve the conflict With Omar's heroic actions, the group is able to repel the external threats and maintain the secrecy of their training camp. Omar earns the respect of his fellow recruits and trainers, and they continue on their mission, united and inspired by their shared experiences and newfound camaraderie. In summary, the answer to the question, \\"Build a movie plot around this: Where did Omar misfire the rocket? The training camp\\" involves following these steps: establishing characters and setting, creating conflict, introducing a turning point, developing external threats, climaxing with a heroic event, and resolving the conflict, resulting in a thrilling and emotional tale of personal redemption and camaraderie in the face of danger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The hydraulic crane was invented by Sir William Armstrong in 1846, primarily for use at the Tyneside docks for loading cargo. These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators: exploiting Pascal's law, they provided a much greater force. A water pump supplied a variable level of water pressure to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder, allowing the level of the platform (carrying a heavy load) to be raised and lowered. Counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus. Now answer this question: In what manner did hydraulic cranes employ Pascal's law?","output":"Hydraulic cranes employ Pascal's law through the efficient use of fluid pressure to magnify the force applied, resulting in a greater lifting capacity compared to the earlier steam driven elevators. Pascal's law states that when pressure is applied to an enclosed fluid, it is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and the enclosing walls. In the case of hydraulic cranes, this principle allows the crane to generate considerable force by using a relatively small amount of input force. In the hydraulic crane design invented by Sir William Armstrong in 1846, a water pump supplied a variable level of water pressure to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder. When force was applied to the plunger through the water pressure, the fluid inside the cylinder distributed that pressure throughout its volume evenly, according to Pascal's law. As a result, the level of the platform carrying the heavy load could be raised and lowered smoothly and with much greater force compared to steam driven elevators. Furthermore, the hydraulic system takes advantage of the incompressibility of fluids. When force is applied, the fluid does not compress significantly, maintaining a constant volume. This allows for a direct, linear response between the fluid pressure and the movement of the platform, which is an essential feature for smooth and reliable operation of the hydraulic crane. In addition to the application of Pascal's law, counterweights and balances were also employed to further increase the lifting power of the hydraulic crane. These elements provided mechanical advantage by offsetting some of the load's weight, allowing the hydraulic system to work more efficiently. In summary, hydraulic cranes utilized Pascal's law to transmit the pressure exerted by the pumped fluid throughout the system, enabling the crane to generate much greater force for lifting heavy loads. The combination of Pascal's law, the incompressibility of fluids, and the use of counterweights and balances made hydraulic cranes a superior alternative to steam driven elevators of the time, revolutionizing cargo handling processes at docks and in various other industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt. Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday.

Write a text based on this summary: wall street higher amid upbeat corporate news Text:","output":"Title: Wall Street Soars as Upbeat Corporate News Bolsters Market Sentiment The Wall Street stock market has experienced a significant uptick in recent days, bolstered by the influx of upbeat corporate news. Investors and market analysts alike are attributing this resurgence in Wall Street's performance to the positive financial results and outlook provided by several leading corporations. This surge in optimism has resulted in higher stock prices, further propelling the markets up and indicating a potentially robust period of economic growth. Among the companies that have contributed to the positive market sentiment is the technology giant, Apple Inc. The iPhone maker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, showing a resurgence in demand for its devices. Additionally, the recent success of its newly launched products, such as the Apple Watch and the iPhone 12, have reinvigorated investor confidence in the company's capacity for innovation and market domination. Similarly, Google's parent company Alphabet reported strong financial results, exceeding market expectations. The strong numbers are primarily attributed to increased advertising revenue, reflecting an essential recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As businesses have continued to adapt to the new normal, they have increased their spending on digital ads and online platforms, fueling Alphabet's remarkable growth. Moreover, the banking industry also benefitted from an array of positive news. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan Chase are among those who have reported higher-than-expected earnings for the previous quarter due to the recovery of investment banking activities, including equity underwriting and debt issuance. This resurgence highlights a renewed sense of confidence in the financial sector, further fueling the Wall Street rally. Efforts to stabilize the economic situation have been evident through the support provided by the Federal Reserve and other government bodies. The current low-interest-rate environment provides additional advantages for corporations and leads to stabilizing the stock market as a whole. This factor, coupled with the positive rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, has contributed to the improving market sentiment on Wall Street. It is evident that the upbeat corporate news has had a significant impact on investor confidence. This has led to an increase in trade volumes, with market participants more likely to invest in equities, taking advantage of the optimistic outlook and potential profit. Consequently, stock indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, have seen remarkable growth. In conclusion, the recent growth on Wall Street has been primarily driven by the positive financial performance and optimistic future outlooks from leading corporations, coupled with significant support from government bodies and increasing vaccination rates across the country. While the markets may face intermittent volatility as the global economy continues to grapple with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the general market sentiment remains buoyant. With key corporations posting strong results and innovations continuing to develop, there is ample reason for investors to maintain their confidence in the market's long-term potential for growth and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ruthless killer Steve Michel is known to the public as \\"The Claw\\" for his way of killing his victims with his prosthetic hook. After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook. When the police arrive at the crime scene in the shape of Detective Dick Tracy, he talks to Humphries, who is the owner of the store; Peter Premium, who is a representative for the insurance company; and a man named Cudd, who is the insurance investigator.

According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence. Thus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English. However, the above attitudes are nothing but the last influence of a long-gone period of British supermacy . The beginning of a clear lead of American English can be traced to the decades after World War II.

Why other answers are wrong: - The second option talks about system preferences, drivers, control panel, and display, which are unrelated to creating an ISO or installing Windows 7 from a pen drive. - The third option mentions using notepad and inputting a 32-bit patch amount, which is irrelevant to the process of installing Windows 7 from a pen drive. - The fourth option is incorrect because it talks about inserting the USB drive into the same drive you've just created. This does not make sense, as the USB drive needs to be inserted into a separate USB slot on the computer, not the DVD drive where the installation disc is inserted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Rory Cochane.  for the following movie plot:  Empire Records is an independent record shop managed by Joe (Anthony LaPaglia). The store is located in a fictional city in Delaware, and, like its employees, is eclectic and unique. The staff is very much a surrogate family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but loveable father figure. When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice. The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honour. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling 9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table. Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening manager A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) and fellow employee Mark (Ethan Embry). He confides in the pair about the previous night's events before riding away, seemingly for good. Joe arrives to help open the store and quickly receives phone calls from both the bank and the store owner, Mitchell Beck (Ben BodÃ©), regarding the previous night's missing deposit. Joe is distracted from immediately dealing with this crisis due to a scheduled store event: Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield), a former 80's pop idol, is due to arrive at the store for an autograph session to promote his new album. The staff is unenthused by \\"Rex Manning Day\\", and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men. The employees secretly tease Rex behind...

Adam, a veteran driving instructor and examiner, had recently taken over the responsibilities of overseeing the driving tests at the local testing center. He was keenly aware of the importance of both the written and practical aspects of the exam, as they were essential in ensuring that new drivers were proficient and safe on the roads. Taking the written exam from Steven with a warm smile and a nod, Adam walked back to his office, excited about the opportunity to help a new batch of aspiring drivers. He believed that by personally grading the exams, he would develop a better understanding of the students' grasp on traffic rules and defensive driving measures, which would enable him to give valuable feedback and guide them towards improvement. As Adam settled into his comfortable swivel chair, he began reviewing the first question, which focused on the right-of-way rules at a four-way stop. He appreciated the fact that the test covered a range of relevant topics, such as road signs, speed limits, alcohol and drug-impaired driving, and parking regulations. This comprehensive approach, he believed, was a crucial factor in creating well-rounded, responsible drivers who were confident behind the wheel. Adam mentally applauded Steven's commitment toward providing students with the necessary tools and resources to excel in their driving test. He knew that Steven had gone the extra mile in gathering the most up-to-date information on driving practices, incorporating it into the learning materials, and meticulously preparing the written exam. As he continued grading the exams, Adam was impressed by the students' overall knowledge and their ability to apply critical thinking when faced with challenging questions that required them to draw on their understanding of various driving scenarios. At the same time, Adam took note of the areas where improvement was needed, such as merging onto a highway, the use of turn signals, and the importance of maintaining a safe following distance. Adam also appreciated the variety of questions in the written exam, ranging from multiple-choice to short answer, and even a few diagram-based questions. This mix allowed him to gauge students' understanding from different angles, ensuring that they possessed a well-rounded grasp of the course material. Once he had finished grading all of the written exams, Adam carefully tallied the scores and recorded them in the database.

Write the answer: What spirit drink is the base of a screwdriver cocktail?","output":"The spirit drink that serves as the base of a screwdriver cocktail is vodka. Vodka, known for its subtle taste and versatility, is a widely popular choice in cocktail recipes as it pairs well with a variety of flavors without overwhelming them. Originating in Eastern Europe, vodka has evolved into one of the most commonly consumed spirits in the world, with variations in flavor and quality depending on the region and production methods. To better understand the significance of vodka in the screwdriver cocktail, let us delve into the origins of the drink and its history, the recipe and preparation, variations, and the role vodka plays in making this classic cocktail what it is today. The origins of the screwdriver cocktail date back to the mid-20th century, though its exact birthplace and creator remain subjects of debate. According to one legend, American oil workers based in the Persian Gulf during the 1940s would discreetly mix vodka and orange juice in their cups, stirring the concoction with their screwdrivers. This improvised mixing tool gave the cocktail its name. Alternatively, other sources suggest that the screwdriver might have originated in the United States as a simple and convenient way to enjoy vodka. The screwdriver cocktail is known for its simplicity, making it a popular drink among home bartenders and professional mixologists alike. The basic recipe consists of just two main ingredients: vodka and orange juice. To prepare a classic screwdriver, fill a highball glass with ice, pour in 1.5 to 2 ounces of vodka (depending on desired strength), and top with approximately 4 ounces of orange juice. Stir the contents gently, then garnish with an orange wedge or twist if so desired. Variations of the screwdriver cocktail have emerged over time, featuring additional ingredients or substitutions to suit different tastes and preferences. Some popular screwdriver adaptations include the 'Harvey Wallbanger,' which incorporates Galliano L'Autentico, an Italian herbal liqueur, and the 'Sloe Screw,' which swaps the vodka for sloe gin. In each case, vodka's unassuming flavor profile allows the spotlight to shine on the other ingredients, thus contributing to the versatility and appeal of the screwdriver cocktail. In conclusion, vodka is the essential spirit drink at the heart of a screwdriver cocktail. Its nearly neutral taste merges seamlessly with the refreshing sweetness of orange juice, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of occasions, from casual gatherings to more sophisticated events. The simplicity and adaptability of the screwdriver recipe have contributed to the cocktail's enduring popularity, with vodka remaining an indispensable component of this timeless classic."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

As he sifted through the items on his desk, he tried to retrace his steps to remember where he might have last seen the elusive key. He began to rummage through his drawers, organizing the items methodically as he searched. His eyes flicked from one object to the next, and he meticulously pushed aside paper clips, rubber bands, and a tangle of pens and pencils. A crumpled receipt caught his attention for a moment, but he quickly dismissed it, realizing that the date on it was too old to be relevant to his current predicament. Deciding to change tactics, the man turned to examine the stack of books and papers that cluttered his desk. He carefully arranged them into neat piles, hoping that the key would reveal itself in the mess of paperwork. Disappointed by the lack of results, he pushed back his chair, stood up, and surveyed the room for any other possible hiding places. His gaze wandered to a small cabinet near his desk. It had an assortment of things he didn't use often, but he figured it was worth a shot. Slowly, he opened the door and carefully shifted through the objects inside - an old watch with a worn leather band, a collection of coins from past travels, and a dusty, half-finished novel. Alas, the key was still nowhere to be found. Feeling frustrated, the man decided to retrace his steps throughout his home. He went back to the living room and began to search the cushions and crevices of his comfortable sofa, asking himself why he hadn't secured the key in a proper place. He knew keeping it on the key rack would have prevented this entire ordeal, but it was too late for regrets now. With a sigh, he moved on to the kitchen, examining every countertop and drawer, even checking behind the refrigerator and the trash can. Once again, he was met with disappointment. The search continued through the bathroom and bedroom, each room turning up no trace of the lost key. Feeling weary but still determined, he retraced his steps back to his office, falling onto the chair and staring at the items he had strewn across the desk in his search. He was starting to feel resigned to the notion that he would never find his lost key when something caught his eye - a hint of metal gleaming in the sunlight that filtered through the blinds. As if by some miracle, the man noticed an unclasped binder carelessly lying on the edge of his desk. The shiny piece of metal nestled between the pages appeared to be the lost key he'd been seeking. Excitedly, he pulled it from the confines of the binder, relief washing over him as he finally held the missing object in his hands. All the frustration and anxiety of his lengthy search fell away, replaced with an overwhelming sense of satisfaction. He meticulously returned the room to its original state and carefully placed the key on the key rack, vowing never to make the same mistake again. From that point forward, he would make a concerted effort to stay organized and prevent any future key mishaps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? A 61-year-old man was overcome with joy when he went to Grand Rapids, Michigan last month to encounter a man, 81, he believed to be the father he never met. However, paternity results obtained yesterday reveal the pair are not related after all. Samuel Childress, received the test results in the mail on Monday, February 2 and was shocked to see it was negative, said his wife Donna Childress on Tuesday morning. 'It's been rough on him,' she said of her husband finding out the results. 'He's been up and down all night.' The unfortunate maternity muddle began when Tony Trapani, 81, of Grand Rapids was cleaning out some filing cabinets following the death of his wife when he discovered a 56-year-old letter. That being said, Trapani still seems to resent her decision, no matter what her motivation may have been, saying; 'He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me,' said OPTIONS: - Childress after thinking Childress was his. - Donna Childress after thinking Childress was his. - Grand Rapids after thinking Childress was his. - Michigan after thinking Childress was his. - Samuel Childress after thinking Childress was his. - Tony Trapani after thinking Childress was his. - Trapani after thinking Childress was his.","output":"Tony Trapani after thinking Childress was his. The correct answer is Tony Trapani after thinking Childress was his because Tony Trapani is the 81-year-old man who found the letter about Samuel Childress. He thought Childress was his son, but the paternity test turned out to be negative. The other options are wrong because: - Childress, Donna Childress, and Samuel Childress are other people involved in the story, but Tony Trapani is the one who found the letter and thought Childress was his son. - Grand Rapids and Michigan refer to places, not people. - Trapani is just another way to refer to Tony Trapani, but his full name is more appropriate in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which Supreme Court case in the 1940s was related to the protest that the participants of the Civil Rights Movement at The Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama participated in? Answer:","output":"The Supreme Court case in the 1940s related to the protest that participants of the Civil Rights Movement at The Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama were involved in was Morgan v. Virginia (1946). This case centered around interstate bus transportation and racial segregation. In Morgan v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation on interstate buses was unconstitutional, as it violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. This decision was an essential precursor to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, ultimately leading to protests like the Freedom Rides, which specifically targeted segregation in bus terminals and transportation facilities. The Freedom Rides began in 1961 when civil rights activists boarded interstate buses and traveled throughout the South to challenge the discriminatory policies that persisted in spite of the Morgan v. Virginia ruling. Activists encountered violence and resistance, most notably at the Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama, where they were attacked by a mob of white supremacists. The Freedom Riders and their protests played a crucial role in amplifying the need for stronger enforcement of civil rights in the United States. Their actions eventually led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, both of which significantly diminished institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One possible question that could be asked from this paragraph is: \\"How did al Qaeda manage to fulfill the requirements needed to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation, such as funding, personnel recruitment, training, communication, and intelligence gathering, during the planning stages of the 9/11 attack?\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of m, which is -11.

Fact 1: Some animals' fur grows thicker for staying warm in the winter.  Fact 2: Mammals have hair and fur.  Given the two facts above, why do some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter? The answer is:","output":"To understand why some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter, let's break down the given facts and connect them logically. Step 1: Analyzing Fact 1 Fact 1 says that some animals' fur grows thicker for staying warm in the winter. This suggests that there is a relationship between the thickness of the fur and the ability to stay warm in cold weather. Step 2: Analyzing Fact 2 Fact 2 informs us that mammals have hair and fur. This implies that the animals referred to in Fact 1 are mammals since they have fur. Step 3: Connecting the facts Now, we can connect these two facts to understand why some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter. Since mammals have fur, and the purpose of this fur is to keep the animal warm, it would make sense for the fur to grow thicker in colder conditions, such as winter. Thicker fur provides better insulation, which helps to retain body heat and protect the animal against the cold. Step 4: Formulate the answer Given the logical connection between these two facts, the answer is: Some animals have hair that grows longer during the winter because the increased thickness of their fur provides better insulation, helping them stay warm in cold weather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant?

The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the elder and the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is the younger sister, a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Ironically, Gish was actually 15 years older than Davis. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with.

Over the past three months the portly ex-striker, now a member of Brazil's 2014 World Cup organizing committee, went through a series of grueling physical exercises and dietary re-education, all aired every Sunday on the Medida Certa (Ideal Measurements) show. Sunday night in front of a live television audience, Ronaldo tipped the scales at 222 pounds and his waistline was down from 42 inches to 37 inches. \\"I have problems with the weighing scales. It's a real trauma,\\" he said when the show began in September. \\"I have already tackled many challenges and this one will not be easy. Those who have already tried to lose weight know that.

Ronaldo retired last year and disclosed that he had long been suffering from thyroid problems, which caused him to gain a lot of weight. He said in September he wanted to be fit for a December 19 annual charity match in which he will take part along with his ex-Real Madrid teammate and French soccer legend Zinedine Zidane in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. Ronaldo retired prematurely after suffering many knee injuries. He played for Brazil in 98 international matches, scoring 62 goals and was part of the national squad that won the 1994 and 2002 World Cups.

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.  After reading the above, is \\"Kemp\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who called HUD to make sure she was allowed to kick out the tenants?\\"? Select from the following.

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest.

In light of this , anything that limits procreation , be it the use of contraception or even condoning the use of contraception , is against God . 5. Catholics consider the first commandment given to them by God to be to \` multiply ' . What claim can be made from these sentences?","output":"From these sentences, the claim can be made that the Catholic Church firmly believes in adhering to the principles laid out in the Bible, specifically concerning procreation, and is therefore justified in taking actions that align with these beliefs, even if they might be perceived as harmful to its followers. This claim is derived from the fact that the first commandment given by God in the Book of Genesis, as mentioned in sentence 5, emphasizes the importance of procreation by commanding the followers to \\"multiply.\\" This belief is deeply intertwined with the teachings and core values of the Catholic Church, as they prioritize their obligations to God over the needs of the people (sentence 3). Consequently, they may engage in actions that uphold these commandments, even if they are against widely accepted practices such as contraception (sentence 4). The Church's justification for such actions stems from the belief that going against the wishes of God would be more detrimental to its adherents than short-term harm caused by the given stance (sentence 2). Thus, the Catholic Church has a strong conviction in upholding beliefs and commandments that, as per their interpretation, adhere to divine instructions. In conclusion, the claim that can be made is that the Catholic Church believes in strictly following the divine commandments concerning procreation and justifies taking actions to preserve these beliefs, even when it involves opposing commonly accepted practices like contraception or causing potential harm to its followers. Their primary focus remains on fulfilling their duty towards God and maintaining the sanctity of the Church's core principles as outlined in the Bible."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here is a news article: The United Kingdom is a highly developed nation that exerts considerable international economic, political, scientific and cultural influence. Located off the northwest corner of Europe, the country includes the island of Great Britain – which contains England, Scotland and Wales – and the northern portion of the island of Ireland. The year 2017 ushered in anxiety about the country’s role on the global stage, due to the public voting in the summer of 2016 to leave the European Union. The vote raises questions about the European Union , as well as the policies supporting the eurozone . ||||| (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images)      The mood on the international conference call at the beginning of this month was somber as Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, prepared to list off top global dangers in the coming year. Bremmer began with a show-stopping line:      \\"If we had to pick one year for a big unexpected crisis — the geopolitical equivalent of the 2008 financial meltdown — it feels like 2018.\\" The reasons are many, Bremmer cited, but the most prominent causes for global insecurity stem from U.S. President Donald Trump's move away from global leadership, and China's eagerness to fill the perceived vacuum.      Bremmer isn't alone. Donald Trump pledged to \\"Make America Great Again.\\" The world thinks he is doing the opposite.      The United States slips in this year's U.S. News Best Countries ranking, dropping to the No. 8 spot after falling one position from its 2017 ranking. Switzerland, an island of stable prosperity in a world of turmoil, remains the Best Country, according to a global survey of more than 21,000 persons.      The reasons for America's drop – the second straight year its ranking dipped – are fueled by the world's perceptions of the country becoming less progressive and trustworthy, more politically unstable and a president who after just a year in office is far more unpopular than any other head of state or company CEO.      As in 2017, Canada remains the No. 2 in the survey. Germany, as it was in 2016, is perceived as the most powerful country in Europe – surpassing the U.K. to place at No. 3 overall, while the U.K. drops to No. 4. Japan rounds out the top five, the highest finish for a nation in Asia, a region which survey respondents increasingly believe holds many of the keys to the world's future. At No. 6 is Sweden and Australia moves up to the No. 7 position, surpassing the U.S.      The 2018 Best Countries rankings, formed in partnership with global marketing communications company Y&R's brand strategy firm, BAV Group, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, are based on a study that surveyed global citizens from four regions to assess perceptions of 80 countries on 75 different metrics.      Trump Shocks, Divides the World      The Best Countries rankings come just days after Trump celebrates his first year as U.S. president. The U.S. is still seen as the most powerful nation. In many ways, however, the results reflect 12 months of ongoing signs of the decline of America's standing in the world. In this sense, a noticeable \\"Trump Effect\\" is taking hold of the U.S.      Just days after taking office, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by pulling the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Weeks later a poll showed just 15 percent of Germans believed the new U.S. president to be competent. By last spring's NATO summit, European leaders had begun believing that the U.S. had abdicated its leadership role in the military alliance, as Trump shifted support for both NATO and the European Union.      As summer unfolded, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Days later, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center released a poll showing the unpopularity of Trump and his policies was sharply dragging down global opinion of the U.S.      Meanwhile, Trump's statements further rattled world opinion. The president engaged in a war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. By November, Trump had begun accumulating a sizeable trail of verbal gaffes to world leaders.      By early January, the Washington, D.C.-based Freedom House warned that democracy was \\"in crisis\\" around the world, in no small part because of Trump's repeated attacks on the judiciary system and news media in the U.S., lack of seeking \\"meaningful input\\" from relevant agencies and \\"violations of basic ethical standards.\\"      In the Best Countries survey, the greatest drop by the U.S. in the rankings came in the perceptions of survey respondents for countries having open travel policies. The backlash against Trump's travel ban order in February 2017 and subsequent media attention are having a lasting impact on America's image, and challenging long-held perceptions of the country's reputation for openness.      One piece of good news for the U.S.: The country is seen as the No. 2 country overall for education. Even so, U.S. higher education industry experts worry the country is becoming a less attractive destination for international students, partly because of U.S. immigration policies.      Opportunities for Many Countries      Among other key findings in the 2018 Best Countries survey:      America's perceived retreat from its traditional global leadership role is creating opportunities for other countries, particularly in the areas of \\"soft power,\\" arenas where economic and cultural influence drive opinions and policy-making.      Switzerland's position as the No. 1 overall country is driven by its reputation for citizenship and being open for business. For the third year in a row, Canada is seen as offering the best quality of life, driven by high ratings for education, health care and public safety.      In Asia, the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP hasn't slowed the advancing economic might of the region, particularly in China. Authorities in Beijing now see the U.S. foreign policy signals as mixed and an opportunity to work more closely with other countries, including American allies.      \\"Trump's neo-isolationist and unilateralist inclinations have given China a golden opportunity to enhance its prestige, status, and international leadership,\\" says Zhang Baohui, a professor of political science and director of the Centre for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.      The Best Countries survey findings on leadership and trust in governments and companies are particularly revealing. Approximately 82 percent of survey respondents believe there is a leadership crisis, and 61 percent say they trust private companies more than the government to take care of their needs.      Additionally, corporate CEOs are more supported than government leaders. Only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have approval ratings to rival the top ratings by CEOs such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.      And the people with the highest disapproval ratings? By far, Trump, followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.      For 10 interesting facts on the Best Countries survey, click here.

Imagine you're a big kid in a playground with lots of other kids. Some kids are making cool things with play dough, and others are deciding the rules of the playground.  Now, the United Kingdom (UK), where Big Ben and the Queen live, is a really big kid. The UK has many friends and is important in playground matters, telling others how things should be done. It's located away from the rest of the playground, like on a tree island. But a while ago, the UK decided to stop playing some games with a team called the European Union. This made other kids wonder about what will happen to the team without the UK. Each year, big kids from around the world compare how well they are doing in the playground. This year, the US, where Mr. Trump is the class monitor, went down in the list because some kids think it isn't playing nice anymore, and isn't a reliable friend.  Switzerland, imagine it as a kid who always eats his vegetables and never gets into fights, keeps doing very well. Canada, where moose and maple syrup come from, is doing great too.  Kids' opinions matter a lot in this playground. The way other kids see you can change how well you do in these annual comparisons. So right now, not all kids are happy with the US and its class monitor, Mr. Trump.  This is because Mr. Trump decided to stop playing a trading game with some kids named Trans-Pacific Partnership. He also said some not-so-nice things and did not want to play the climate change game.  Now the good news for America is it's really good in the 'education' game, like a bright kid who often gets A's. But some smart children from around the world might not want to learn from America because of some rules Mr. Trump has. All this is resulting in a big shuffle in the playground. Some new kids get a chance to be noticed and liked. Switzerland, the always well-behaved kid, is the coolest, and Canada has the best life, like always having the yummiest lunchbox.  Also, the kids at the playground believe that the folks who run toy companies could probably do a better job running the games on the playground than the class monitors. Only Canada's class monitor Mr. Trudeau and Germany's monitor Mrs. Merkel are as cool as the toy company bosses. And sadly, class monitors Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin are not so liked.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) MI6 agent James Bond meets a Swiss banker in Bilbao, Spain to retrieve money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of M. Bond tells the banker that King was buying a report stolen from an MI6 agent who was killed for it, and wants to know who killed him. The banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal the assassin's name. Bond escapes with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped, and Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters back in London. Bond gives chase to the assistant/assassin on a boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome, where she attempts to escape via hot air balloon. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses, then causes the balloon to explode, killing herself. Bond traces the recovered money to Viktor \\"Renard\\" Zokas, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter, Elektra; Renard previously abducted and held her for ransom, and MI6 believes that he is targeting her a second time. Bond flies to Azerbaijan, where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at a casino to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator... The answer is:","output":"Bond flies to Azerbaijan on his mission."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Household uses for soaps include washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping, where soaps act as surfactants, emulsifying oils to enable them to be carried away by water. In industry they are also used in textile spinning and are important components of some lubricants.  - A sulfonate is a salt or ester of a sulfonic acid. It contains the functional group R-SO.  - A carboxylate is a salt or ester of a carboxylic acid. \\"Carboxylate salts\\" have the general formula M(RCOO), where M is a metal and \\"n\\" is 1, 2...; \\"carboxylate esters\\" have the general formula RCOOR. R and R are organic groups; R  H.  - Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants.  - Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube).  - Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with \\"soft water\\"). Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone and chalk which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates.  - A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with \\"cleaning properties in dilute solutions.\\" These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water.  - Linear alkylbenzene is a family of organic compounds with the formula C6H5CnH2n +1 . Typically , n lies between 10 and 16 , although generally supplied as a tighter cut , such as C12 - C15 , C12 - C13 and C10 - C13 , for detergent use . The CnH2n +1 chain is unbranched . They are sometimes called LABs . They are mainly produced as intermediate in the production of surfactants , for use in detergent . Since the 1960s , LABs have emerged as the dominant precursor of biodegradable detergents .    What entity does 'linear alkylbenzene' has the relation 'has part' with? Answer:","output":"Linear alkylbenzene (LAB) has parts consisting of a benzene ring (C6H5) and an unbranched alkyl chain (CnH2n+1), where n typically lies between 10 and 16."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

However, I will attempt to provide an assessment by breaking down various factors that constitute a quality review and addressing the review's content. 1. Relevance: A helpful review should be directly related to the subject matter. In this case, the statement \\"I hacked coc\\" could be referring to the popular mobile game \\"Clash of Clans\\" (CoC). If the review is intended for an app, product, or service related to Clash of Clans, then it may have some relevance, albeit minimal. However, if there is no connection to Clash of Clans or hacking within the context of the review, it may not serve any relevant purpose. Rating: 1-2. 2. Depth: A comprehensive review should provide insightful analysis or personal experience, allowing prospective consumers to make an informed decision about the product. The review in question does not provide any background information about the nature of the alleged hacking, how it was carried out, or its impact. As a result, it does not add any meaningful insight for other users. Rating: 1. 3. Clarity: Clear communication is critical for a quality review, allowing readers to understand the reviewer's opinion and reasoning. This terse statement is vague, as it is uncertain whether the reviewer is expressing a positive experience (e.g., easily overcoming in-game challenges through hacking) or a negative one (e.g., frustration due to hacking affecting the gaming experience). Rating: 1. 4. Grammar and Spelling: Proper spelling and grammar make a review more readable and credible. Although this statement contains no grammatical errors, it uses internet slang (\\"coc\\" instead of \\"Clash of Clans\\") and lacks punctuation, which may not be accessible or understandable to all readers. Rating: 2. 5. Constructiveness: An ideal review should offer constructive feedback so that developers or manufacturers can improve their products or respond to concerns. The statement \\"I hacked coc\\" contains no actionable feedback, suggestions for improvement, or clear indication of the reviewer's expectations. Rating: 1. Taking these factors into consideration, my overall rating for this review would be between 1 and 2, closer to 1.

So, -8*x + 17*x = -112 + 13 Now let's do the math: 9*x = -99 Now, we want to find out what x is, so we need to divide both sides by 9: x = -99 / 9 And x is: x = -11 So, the answer is x = -11.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Five years ago, when I taught art at a school in Seattle, I used Tinkertoys as a test at the beginning of a term to find out something about my students. I put a small set of Tinkertoys in front of each student, and said:\\"Make something out of the Tinkertoys. You have 45 minutes today - and 45minutes each day for the rest of the week.\\" A few students hesitated to start. They waited to see the rest of the class would do. Several others checked the instructions and made something according to one of the model plans provided. Another group built something out of their own imaginations. Once I had a boy who worked experimentally with Tinkertoys in his free time. His constructions filled a shelf in the art classroom and a good part of his bedroom at home. I was delighted at the presence of such a student. Here was an exceptionally creative mind at work. His presence meant that I had an unexpected teaching assistant in class whose creativity would infect  other students. Encouraging this kind of thinking has a downside. I ran the risk of losing those students who had a different style of thinking. Without fail one would declare, \\"But I'm just not creative.\\" \\"Do you dream at night when you're asleep?\\" \\"Oh, sure.\\" \\"So tell me one of your most interesting dreams.\\" The student would tell something wildly imaginative. Flying in the sky or in a time machine or growing three heads. \\"That's pretty creative. Who does that for you?\\" \\"Nobody. I do it.\\" \\"Really-at night, when you're asleep?\\" \\"Sure.\\" \\"Try doing it in the daytime, in class, okay?\\" Question: The teacher used Tinkertoys in class in order to   _  ?
