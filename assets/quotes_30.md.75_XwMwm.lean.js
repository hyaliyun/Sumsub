True as a Turtle is a 1957 British comedy film directed by Wendy Toye and starring John Gregson, Cecil Parker, June Thorburn and Keith Michell. In the film, a young couple embark on a voyage on a ketch named \\"Turtle\\". John Coates wrote the screenplay, based on his novel of the same name. Can we infer the following? The voyage was made on a sailboat.","output":"Yes, we can infer that the voyage in the movie \\"True as a Turtle\\" (1957) was made on a sailboat, specifically aboard a ketch named \\"Turtle\\". A ketch is a type of sailboat that is characterized by its two-masted design. In a ketch, the aft (rear) mast, also called the mizzen mast, is shorter than the mainmast, which is the vertical spar that supports the main sails. This design allows for better maneuverability and simpler sail handling, as well as increased sail area, making it a popular choice for cruising sailboats. The film, directed by Wendy Toye, stars John Gregson, Cecil Parker, June Thorburn, and Keith Michell, and it narrates the story of a young couple who set off together on a voyage aboard the ketch \\"Turtle\\". The script for the movie was written by John Coates, based on his own novel of the same name, which likely provided additional details about the sailboat adventure and the challenges faced by the characters on their journey. Given this information, the central theme of the movie revolves around the couple's adventures and experiences on a sailboat and the water, which also serves as the primary setting for the unfolding narrative. This, combined with the description of the ketch as the mode of transportation, allows us to confirm that the voyage was indeed made on a sailboat. In conclusion, based on the provided information about the 1957 British comedy film \\"True as a Turtle,\\" we can infer that the voyage embarked upon by the young couple in the film occurs on a sailboat, specifically aboard the ketch named \\"Turtle\\". The movie's plot and setting, as well as the character interactions and development, help to further accentuate the role that the sailboat voyage plays in the overall story, providing a unique setting and mode of transportation for the characters' journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q with options: Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What movie would the OP NOT be a fan of ? OPTIONS: 1. Waiting 2. Terminator 3. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 4. Mr. Deed","output":"Based on the passage provided, the OP expresses some discomfort or uneasiness with the idea that we are becoming more like machines - efficient, effective, productive, but soulless. They mention that this prospect haunts them. Given this context, we can analyze each movie option to determine which one the OP would likely NOT be a fan of: 1. Waiting: A comedy film about restaurant employees who pass their time by playing pranks and goofing off at work. This movie doesn't strongly emphasize on people turning into machines or losing their souls. The theme is more focused on antics within a workplace setting.   2. Terminator: A science-fiction film where a cyborg assassin, the Terminator, is sent back in time to kill the mother of the eventual leader of the human resistance in a post-apocalyptic future. This movie heavily revolves around the conflict between human beings and advanced machines, with machines being soulless and emotionless, intent on exterminating humanity. Given the OP's concern about becoming more like machines, it's quite likely that they would not be a fan of this movie. 3. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A movie adaptation of the novel, which follows the adventures of a journalist and his attorney as they descend into chaos, drugs, and debauchery during a trip to Las Vegas. The film primarily deals with the theme of excess and hedonism, rather than the transformation of humans into machines or soulless beings. 4. Mr. Deeds: A comedy film in which a small-town man inherits a massive corporation and uses his newfound wealth to help others while also finding love. The film's plot is centered on the protagonist's morals and kindness, which again doesn't explicitly involve the theme of humans becoming machine-like or losing their souls. Comparing all these four movies, based on the concerns mentioned in the passage, the OP would likely NOT be a fan of \\"Terminator\\". The central theme of human vs. machine conflict in Terminator resonates with the OP's uneasiness and aligns with the notion that people are haunted by the idea of turning into machines. Consequently, the movie \\"Terminator\\" is the strongest candidate for what the OP may not be a fan of among the given options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose it becomes night happens, how will it affect water in the clouds becomes warmer.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. At night, the temperature generally decreases and the Earth's surface cools down. This cooling can cause water in the clouds to become colder instead of warmer, as stated in the question. Thus, the night's cooling effect will have less influence on the formation of ice crystals, in comparison with the daytime when the temperature is higher and the sun's energy is available to heat the water.

In the old days at the school, discipline was applied with a stick rather than the hand, as the  pick from the following.  A). stick tended to strike softer.;  B). hand tended to strike softer.;","output":"In the old days at the school, discipline was applied with a stick rather than the hand, as the stick tended to strike softer. This method of discipline is reflective of a time when the educational system implemented strict measures for the maintenance of order in classrooms. Back then, it was assumed that the presence of a strict regime would facilitate a well-disciplined learning environment. Using a stick as a disciplinary measure was seen as a more controlled way to reprimand students compared to utilizing one's hand. Even though the force applied with a stick might have been greater in some occasions, the primary notion behind using a stick was to maintain a level of consistency and distance between the teacher and the student. With the use of a stick, the inflicted pain was considered more bearable and less personal as there was no direct contact between the teacher's hand and the student's body. The thought process behind this method was twofold. Firstly, the consistency of the punishment allowed students to anticipate the consequences of their actions and potentially deter them from misbehaving. Secondly, the distance maintained between the teacher and the student through the use of a stick symbolized the authority that teachers held over their students. This authority was meant to assert the teacher's role as the guiding figure in the classroom, responsible for correcting and molding the student's behavior. Additionally, using a stick as a tool for discipline indicated a more systematic and impartial approach to punishment. The hand, in contrast, was seen as personal and subjective, as the force of physical punishment could significantly vary between incidents and teachers. The choice of the stick, in this sense, demonstrated a methodical and uniform method of regulation, allowing for the establishment of a hierarchy in the school environment. However, it is essential to note that contemporary research in education and child psychology has substantially discredited the use of physical punishment as an effective form of discipline. Studies have shown that physical punishment can lead to adverse effects on a child's mental health, hampering their ability to develop healthy relationships and emotional regulation. Given the current understanding of the impact of physical punishment on children, it is unlikely that the phrase \\"the stick tended to strike softer\\" would resonate with educators today. Instead, educational institutions now promote more compassionate and constructive approaches to maintaining discipline, such as developing resilience, fostering respect, and nurturing an intrinsic motivation to learn. These methods better align with the goals of modern education: to create lifelong learners who understand the importance of knowledge and possess the skills to navigate an ever-evolving world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion. To provide more context, I can elaborate on the process and the organizations involved: Step 1: Identify the type of organizations involved in generating loss estimates Both private companies and government organizations look into the data and information on security breaches. Private companies include computer security consulting firms, while government organizations have specific agencies responsible for cybersecurity and data protection. Step 2: Understanding the process for estimating losses These organizations collect data from various sources, including incident reports, client surveys, and research studies. They analyze trends and assess the impact of security breaches on businesses, industries, and countries. This allows them to estimate the financial consequences of such incidents. Step 3: Referencing popular organizations that produce loss estimates Some well-known computer security consulting firms that provide loss estimates include FireEye, CrowdStrike, and Kaspersky Lab. Government organizations may include US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

Plot title: Shutter Island Movie plot: In 1954, two U.S. Marshals â Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule â travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \\"The law of 4; who is 67?\\" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days. Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an... My question: Why is the doctor satisfied? A:","output":"The doctor, specifically Dr. John Cawley, is satisfied because he is conducting a ground-breaking, albeit controversial, psychological experiment on Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels. The entire situation on Shutter Island, including the investigation, the disappearance of Rachel Solando, and Chuck Aule's presence have all been orchestrated to try to help Daniels, who is actually Andrew Laeddis, confront his own guilt and severe mental trauma. Daniels is an unreliable narrator and plagued by delusions and hallucinations due to his past traumas. Dr. Cawley believes that this immersive and manipulative approach has the potential to break through Daniels' deeply ingrained denial, repression, and resistance to treatment. His satisfaction stems from the belief that his experimental method might ultimately free Daniels/Laeddis from the grips of his mental illness, through facing the truth about his own actions in killing his wife (Dolores Chanal) because she drowned their children. By witnessing Daniels' progress, unraveling the clues laid out for him, and gradually unlocking the repressed memories of his past, Dr. Cawley is content that the experiment is pushing Daniels towards a moment of self-realization and potential healing. The unfolding events on Shutter Island, along with Cawley's own determination and secretive demeanor, create an ongoing sense of tension and conflict. However, deep down, Dr. Cawley is satisfied with the experiment's direction, because it offers hope for a new treatment avenue for extreme cases of psychosis and delusion. Even though his methods are unorthodox and met with resistance by others, Dr. Cawley sees the potential outcome as a justification for his satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All my jeans could not fit in my new bag bag because the","output":"bag was too small for my entire collection. In an attempt to solve this problem, I went through the following steps: Step 1: Assess the situation First, I assessed the situation to determine the extent of the issue. I counted the number of jeans I had and compared that to the capacity of my new bag. Step 2: Categorize the jeans To better understand the bag's limitations, I categorized my jeans into three groups based on their size and importance: must-haves, nice-to-haves, and can-live-withouts. Step 3: Prioritize the jeans Next, I prioritized the jeans based on their importance to me, setting aside the 'must-haves' for packing first. This would ensure that I have all the necessary jeans with me. Step 4: Experiment with packing techniques Rather than just folding the jeans in the traditional way, I researched and experimented with different packing techniques. For example, I tried rolling the jeans tightly, which can save space and prevent wrinkles. I also considered using vacuum bags, as they compress clothes and create more room. Step 5: Maximize the use of space I reevaluated the layout of my new bag and looked for unused areas where I could slip in a pair of jeans. For instance, I placed jeans in smaller pockets or stuffed them between other items to make the best use of every available space. Step 6: Minimize the number of jeans After trying various packing techniques and maximizing the use of space, I still found that not all of my jeans would fit. At this point, I had to make some tough decisions about which jeans to leave behind. I decided to leave behind some of the 'can-live-withouts' and a few of the 'nice-to-haves' based on factors such as recent wear, versatility, and sentimental value. Step 7: Double-check the packing Lastly, I double-checked the packing to ensure I hadn't missed any crucial jeans or other items, zipping up my new bag with a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had packed smartly and efficiently. In conclusion, although not all my jeans could fit in my new bag, by prioritizing, experimenting with packing techniques, maximizing space, and minimizing the number of jeans, I managed to fit the most important ones and learned valuable lessons about efficient packing for the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

Class A studied a pond filled with protozoa, while class B studied a pond with almost no protozoa.  Which class observed less engulfing and digesting of other organisms?  Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations under control. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. Protozoa are also important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. A:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's break down the information given step by step: 1. Class A studied a pond filled with protozoa. 2. Class B studied a pond with almost no protozoa. 3. Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. Considering this information, we can infer which class observed less engulfing and digesting of other organisms. Since Class A studied a pond filled with protozoa, and protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms, it can be assumed that they observed more predatory behavior. On the other hand, Class B studied a pond with almost no protozoa. This means that there were fewer protozoa to observe engulfing and digesting other organisms.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The album was generally well received. Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\".

News article: Caterpillar's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Caterpillar Inc. is about as American as you can get, except that these days it’s not, having been partially shuffled off to Switzerland. But it still must deal with the IRS, and the IRS isn’t happy with the heavy equipment maker. In fact, the IRS is trying to add 1 billion in taxes and penalties to the company’s 2007-2009 year. Many of the proposed adjustments evidently relate to the Swiss entity as well as to foreign tax credits. Caterpillar has said it is fighting the IRS. But Caterpillar faces other legal process too, including a grand jury subpoena requesting information about the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. units. The company was in the Senate hot seat in 2014. A report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation said the company avoided 2.4 billion in U.S. taxes over 13 years by shifting profits to Switzerland. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) grilled Caterpillar execs and PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants over the company’s offshore move of 85% of its parts sales. Most of Caterpillar’s parts business remained in the U.S., including employees and execs. Only 65 of over 8,000 parts employees are in Switzerland, claimed Sen. Levin, noting that “nothing changed in the operations.” Sen. Levin called it a sweetheart “tax deal pure and simple to shift profits between related parties.” But Caterpillar V.P. Julie Lagacy defended the deal saying it was legit. This echoes others who have appeared before Levin, including Apple CEO Tim Cook. The biggest surprise of the hearing was the Republican pushback defending Caterpillar and noting that the tax code was to blame. In fact, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., went so far as to suggest that Caterpillar deserved an award, not an inquisition. Sen. Paul said Caterpillar and its accountants have an obligation to shareholders to minimize their taxes. The hearing was perhaps most uncomfortable for the accountants asked about emails that seemed to poke fun at the fact that they might be retired by the time of an audit. Nevertheless, there was nothing definitive in the hearing, other than that taxes are terribly complex, and that multinational companies can and do try to move things around to save. Apple’s Tim Cook testified to the same effect, though without the Republican support Caterpillar mustered. Individuals may scratch their heads at how U.S. multinational companies plop profits offshore. After all, the Swiss banking scandals since 2008 make it clear that for individuals, everything is income worldwide. Multinational companies are different, and even “stateless” income is possible. Yet Sen. Levin and others would like to see more harmony in the tax code and a tightening of this “stateless” income. Tax havens like Ireland are favored by global giants like Apple, Google, HP, Facebook and Twitter. In 2013, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said Apple avoided 9 billion in U.S. taxes in 2012 alone via offshore units with no tax home. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook testified it was nothing illegal. Calling it the “holy grail of tax avoidance,” Sen. Levin claimed that Apple saved billions by claiming companies registered in Ireland are not tax resident in any country. Even Facebook flipped more than 700 million to the Cayman Islands as part of a “Double Irish” tax reduction strategy. Google used the Double Irish and the Dutch Sandwich, saving billions in U.S. taxes. Global companies like Apple, Starbucks and Hewlett-Packard put income in foreign pockets in ways the IRS doesn’t like. And the IRS isn’t alone in its criticism. The G20 countries and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) call it tax manipulation. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about Caterpillar Inc., a big American company that makes heavy equipment, and how they are in trouble with the IRS (the people who collect taxes) for not paying enough taxes.

But now, the IRS wants Caterpillar to pay 1 billion more in taxes and penalties. Some important people like senators and accountants are talking and arguing about this situation.

Article: Today, almost everyone has heard of Harry Potter.The books detailing his experiences at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have aroused passion, creativity, and interest in reading throughout the world.     But have you ever considered why you are a fan of the Harry Potter series?     JK Rowling has created a list of characters and an environment for them to inhabit that appeals to both adults and children.     The fantasy aspect of the wizarding world expands the imagination, and takes the mind to new and exciting places.Anything could happen there.Her stories contain parts of the believable and unbelievable, changing the predictability that readers commonly come across and bear in fiction.     The main theme of the series, including good versus evil, prejudice, love, death, sacrifice, friendship and loyalty, in actuality contributes to the ever-lasting nature of the stories.At the same time, these themes remind us of classic literature, offering mature readers tales that wear like a comfortable pair of shoes, while introducing younger readers to concepts they will meet throughout their lives.     Much of the appeal also comes from the characters.In each book, JK Rowling introduces and describes the characters in such a way that we wonder not only about their futures, but also about their pasts.Even supporting characters are suddenly more than just extras in the background.And what of Harry Potter himself? We care about Harry, because we watch him grow from an innocent boy to a powerful wizard.We see him as both Hero and Victim.He experiences endless love and extreme pain, and as readers, we experience them with him.

Is Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. a good answer to this question?","output":"While it is true that the city of Santa Monica was called Kecheek by the indigenous Tongva people, it does not provide a direct answer to the question about the date the explorer reached Santa Monica. To provide a detailed and long answer, we will look into the history of the city and identify the associated explorers. The area of present-day Santa Monica was first inhabited by the Tongva people, who called the place Kecheek, meaning \\"the place of the Alkali fly larvae,\\" referring to the hatching ground of a particular species of fly along the creeks that fed from the nearby Santa Monica and San Pedro Mountains. It wasn't until the arrival of European explorers that the area began to experience significant changes. Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo is credited with discovering the Santa Monica area in 1542. Cabrillo, who initially sailed under the Spanish flag but later for Portugal, was the first European to navigate the coast of present-day California. The exact date that Cabrillo first set foot in Santa Monica, or what he called the \\"Bay of Smokes\\" (Bahía de los Fumos) due to the smoke from the Tongva peoples' fires, is not precisely known. Records suggest that Cabrillo's expedition passed by the Santa Monica area on October 10, 1542. However, it is not clear whether the expedition actually made landfall or merely viewed the coast from their ships. In 1769, another Spanish explorer, Gaspar de Portolá, led an overland expedition that reached the Santa Monica area. He, along with a group of Spanish soldiers and missionaries, essentially established the Spanish claim on the region. On August 3, 1769, the Portolá expedition reached present-day Santa Monica, and it is this date that is most commonly associated with the \\"explorer reaching Santa Monica.\\" In conclusion, while the indigenous name of Kecheek provides interesting background information on Santa Monica's history, it does not answer the question about the date when the explorer reached Santa Monica. The most accurate answer would be August 3, 1769, when Gaspar de Portolá's overland expedition arrived in the area, although Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo's expedition sailed by the coastline on October 10, 1542."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: For grown-ups,an afternoon snooze  is often easier said than done.But many of us have probably experienced just how simple it can be to catch some sleep in a gently rocking hammock .By examining brain waves in sleeping adults,researchers reported in the June 21issue of Current Biology,a Cell Press publication,that they now have evidence to explain why that is. \\"It is a common belief that rocking causes sleep:we fall asleep in a rocking chair soon and,since ancient times,we cradle our babies to sleep,\\"said Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva.\\"Yet,how this works had remained a mystery.The goal of our study was made up of two parts:to test whether rocking does indeed improve sleep,and to understand how this might work at the brain level.\\" Schwartz,Michel Muhlethaler,and their colleagues Laurence Bayer and Irina Constantinescu asked twelve adult volunteers to nap on a custom-made bed or\\"experimental hammock\\"that could either remain still or rock gently.All participants were good sleepers who didn't typically nap and did not suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day.Each participant took two 45-minute afternoon naps,one with the bed still and one with the bed in motion,while their brain activity was monitored. \\"We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swinging condition,\\"Muhlethaler said.\\"Surprisingly,we also observed a dramatic boosting of certain types of sleep-related brain waves.\\" More specifically,rocking increased the length of stage N2sleep,a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep that normally occupies about half of a good night's sleep.The rocking bed also had a lasting effect on brain activity,increasing slow brain waves and bursts of activity known as sleep spindles . Schwartz and Muhlethaler say the next step is to find out whether rocking can improve longer periods of sleep and to find out whether it may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders,such as insomnia .

When he was 12, his parents died. He was alone and didn't get on well with others. People always laughed at him. No one showed kindness to him. His only friend was a dog named Tige. He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not polite to it. He didn't know that an unkind work sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife. One day as he walked down the street, a young lady was walking in front of him. Suddenly one of her bags dropped from her arms. As she stopped to pick it up, she dropped other bags. He came to help her.\\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\\"she said kindly, smiling. A special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog happily and went directly to the river nearby. \\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\\"he repeatedthe woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog,\\"You are a nice little dog!\\"Tige raised its ears as if it understood. \\"Uhum! Even a dog likes it!\\"he said,\\"Well, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you anymore.\\"Tige waved its tail happily. The boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life. After telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said,\\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness. All of us should learn about kindness. What a great powerit has!\\" Options: A The dog. B The businessman. C The young lady. D The gentleman. Answer: A The dog.

A Facebook album uploaded to the ministry's official page featured a photograph of Minister of State Teo Ser Luck lying on a worker's dormitory bed. It was accompanied by the caption: \\"I learnt that some workers prefer to sleep without a mattress as they are used to it back in their home country\\". Mr Teo denied making that comment when contacted by the BBC. In a later statement the ministry said an administrator wrote the caption, not Mr Teo. The statement issued on behalf of the Ministry of Manpower said the caption would be removed and a clarification issued. \\"We regret the unintended implications, and any misunderstanding that the post has caused,\\" the statement said. It said Mr Teo had visited the dormitory to mark International Migrants Day, and that it was \\"unfortunate\\" that the visit \\"was over-shadowed by this turn of events\\". Singapore is home to hundreds of thousands of foreign workers brought in to work in the shipping and construction industries, jobs that not many Singaporeans are eager to take on. Employers provide accommodation for migrant workers, however, advocacy groups have raised concern over their living conditions which can be crowded and unsanitary. The post has drawn criticism among the country's vocal online community. While some Facebook users defended the caption, others criticised Mr Teo for being \\"insensitive and condescending\\". \\"Is your head so far up the ivory tower? Our politicians really need to reflect on how far out of touch they are with reality,\\" said Facebook user Johnny Tang. Jeff Chua suggested that most foreign workers made the choice to sleep without mattresses because of \\"bed bug infestations\\" in dormitories. A Facebook user criticised Mr Teo for his \\"million dollar salary\\" and using \\"migrant workers as a photo opportunity\\". The most popular comment on the post however, came from Ibrahim Khalil, a foreign construction worker in Singapore. \\"In our own homes, we sleep with mattresses. But in Singapore, it is due to the hot weather in our rooms, with (up to) 12 people. Sometimes dormitory management don't allow for more than two fans in the rooms,\\" he said, adding that migrant workers like himself would be happier if they received a \\"more comfortable dormitory life\\". Many of Singapore's politicians, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, maintain an active social media presence and are popular with internet users. However, Mr Teo is not the first to have been criticised by some over what seemed like an insensitive post. Minister Tan Chuan-Jin faced negative comments after he suggested in a Facebook post that some elderly people who collect cardboard as a way of making money, were doing it as a \\"form of exercise and activity\\". Another politician Baey Yam Keng drew outrage after he condemned the Paris terror attacks in November by uploading a photo of himself standing next to the Eiffel Tower which some users thought was doctored - although he denied this.

Article: James Proud, a British businessman who settled in San Francisco launched a Twitter campaign called \\"Stop DST\\". Daylight Saving Time (DST) refers to the time during the summer when clocks are one hour ahead of standard time. \\"Daylight saving was created to save energy, and it doesn't really do that.\\" Proud said, \\"but what's even worse are its negative health effects. It's both outdated and harmful.\\" daylight saving has been linked to a surprising number of health issues such as heart attacks, but Proud has a particular interest in the topic because of its disruptive  effects on sleep. Last year, German researchers suggested that our body cocks never really adjust t daylight saving, which causes a host of health problems. Till Roenneberg of Ludwig-Maximillians University said that because of DST, \\"the majority of the population has severely decreased productivity, decreased quality of life, increasing chance of getting illness, and is just plain tired.\\" The week after daylight saving also witnesses a sudden increase in fatal traffic accidents, according to the University of Colorado. It is believed that this is caused both by disrupted sleep schedules and the shift of daylight hours from the morning to the evening. \\"Daylight saving is an economic tradition. And all economic choices involve achieving a balance. \\" said behavioral economist David Gerard. \\"Even if we decide to abolish daylight saving, there would be a large number of unhappy people.\\" Some such people are shift works, students and parents of schoolchildren, all of whom get to enjoy an extra hour of daylight after work or class with DST. Plus, restaurants love the extra evening sales DST allows. Daylight saving has also been linked to lower crime rates, due to the \\"deterrent effect\\" of longer daylight. Basically, more light increase a criminal's chances of being seen by witnesses or police, which discourages criminal activity. Gerard also point out that an extra hour of daylight has vastly more influence in the American South, where the sun sets... Question: What causes Proud's greatest concern? Options: A: DST not keeping up with economic development B: DST resulting in disorder in people's sleep schedule C: DST stopping people from working productively. D: DST not helping to save energy any more","output":"Proud's greatest concern, as mentioned in the article, is the negative health effects of DST, particularly the disruptive effects on sleep.

Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\". From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \\"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \\"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \\"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\\", what would be the answer ?

Use the plastic measuring cup that came with the powder to measure it out. If your can of powder didn't come with a measuring tool, measure one heaping teaspoon, which is roughly equivalent to 5 grams. Pour the powder directly into the water and use a spoon to quickly stir it. If you're using a bottle with a cap, you can close the cap and shake it.  If you don't have a container that is exactly quart-sized, measure four cups of water into a large container and mix in the powder. You may find it convenient to buy a quart-sized water bottle with a lid, which you can carry with you for times when you want to take a dose of creatine outside the house. You can also mix creatine with juice or an electrolyte-containing energy drink. As mentioned above, creatine beings to degrade when it is mixed with water, so you must consume it right away to get the maximum benefit from the supplement.  Chase the creatine with more water. It's important to stay well hydrated while you take creatine, so follow it up with another cup or two. Eat and drink as normal. There are no dietary contraindications for creatine, so you may eat a normal meal before or after consuming it. When you're loading creatine, you need a total of 20 grams a day for the first five days. Space out the doses so you have one at breakfast, one at lunch, one at dinner and one before bed. After the initial 5-day load, taper off to a comfortable maintenance routine. You can safely take up to 4 doses a day, but taking 2 or 3 has the same effect once you're in maintenance mode.

Answer: symbiotic relationship Output:","output":"Part #1: Understand the scientific question Usage: The question given is \\"What is the term for the relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is harmed?\\" In this case, we need to understand the context of the question, which is about biological interactions. The answer, 'symbiotic relationship', meets the criteria because it correctly answers the question by identifying the type of relationship the question asked for. Part #2: Identify the correct answer to the question Usage: The answer given is 'symbiotic relationship'. This answer is correct because in the field of biology, symbiosis refers to any type of close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms. In particular, when one species benefits and the other is harmed, it's called a 'parasitic relationship', which is a type of symbiotic relationship. Part #3: Generate supporting facts for the answer Usage: Supporting facts for this answer could be \\"A symbiotic relationship includes various forms of close interactions between two different species, such as mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.

Usage: Translation should be accurate and not just rely on direct translation.

Chapter XXXIV  Violence   It had been arranged at Folking, before Hester had started, that Caldigate himself should drive the waggonette into Cambridge to take her back on the Wednesday, but that he would bring a servant with him who should drive the carriage up to the Grange, so that he, personally, should not have to appear at the door of the house. He would remain at Mr. Seely's, and then the waggonette should pick him up. This had been explained to Mrs. Bolton. 'John will remain in town, because he has so much to do with Mr. Seely,' Hester had said; 'and Richard will call here at about twelve.' All her plans had thus been made known, and Mrs. Bolton was aware at what hour the bolts must be drawn and the things removed.  But, as the time drew nearer, her dislike to a sudden commencement of absolute hostilities became stronger,--to hostilities which would seem to have no sanction from Mr. Bolton himself, because he would then be absent. And he too, though as he lay awake through the dreary hours of the long night he said no word about the plan, felt, and felt more strongly as the dawn was breaking, that it would be mean to leave his daughter with a farewell kiss, knowing as he would do that he was leaving her within prison-bars, leaving her to the charge of jailers. The farewell kiss would be given as though he and she were to meet no more in her old home till this terrible trial should be over, and some word appropriate to such a parting would then be spoken. But any such parting word would be false, and the falsehood would be against his own child! 'Does she expect it?' he said, in a low voice, when his wife came up to him as he was dressing.  1.

We did end up opening escrow on a house the week of the first class . The day before the first class was filled with house inspections and piles of paperwork , and I could hardly think straight . But the class turned out okay . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What would need to happen for this scenario to be possible ?","output":"Several steps and scenarios need to occur in order to make the above situation possible. 1. Financial Preparation: Before thinking about purchasing a house, there should be adequate financial readiness. This could involve saving for a down payment, ensuring a good credit score for mortgage approval, or having a steady income that can comfortably bear the mortgage payments and other house-related costs. 2. House Hunting: The person or family will have to undergo a process of house hunting to find the suitable house that fits their needs and financial capabilities. This could involve days, weeks, or even months of searching, visiting different listings, comparing prices, and locations. 3. Making an Offer and Opening Escrow: Once the perfect house is found, the interested buyer makes an offer. If the offer is accepted by the seller, escrow is opened. An escrow is a process where the funds and the title deeds are held by a neutral third party until all conditions of the contract are met. 4. House Inspections: Before the closing on a house, inspections need to occur. These inspections are conducted to evaluate the house condition and to ensure that the house is in the agreed-upon shape. In some cases, the result of the inspection may give room for further negotiation. 5. Paperwork: There will be a lot of paperwork required in this process. This could range from the initial purchasing contract, escrow instructions, title deeds, inspection reports, mortgage agreements, to insurances. All these documents must be reviewed and signed by the respective parties involved. 6. Class Attendance: Concurrently, the person mentioned in the passage is also attending a class. The person might be a student or professional attending some sorts of educational or training courses. The class could be part of their routine schedule or could be a new commitment that they started. Despite the busy schedule and distracting situation, they successfully attend the class as intended.    7. Emotional Stress and Multitasking: It's quite clear that the person is under some level of stress and is dealing with multiple things at the same time - buying a house, attending class, and more. The person has to manage their time and energy efficiently to navigate through all these simultaneously. In summary, various interconnected events and conditions would need to happen for the above scenario to be possible. The processes of purchasing a house and attending class both require significant time and focus, and managing both concurrently underscores the person’s ability to multitask and handle pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth.  Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? A:","output":"Neptune would travel a longer distance in its orbit around the Sun than Earth, given that it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. To understand this, we must look into the concept of orbits and their sizes, as well as the distances planets need to cover in order to complete their respective orbits. An orbit is the path taken by an object in space when it moves around another, due to the force of gravity. In our solar system, the planets travel around the Sun in elliptical orbits. The size of a planet's orbit is determined by its distance from the Sun, specifically in terms of semi-major axis, which is the average distance between the planet and the Sun. Earth is the third planet from the Sun with an average distance of approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the solar-massive body. This distance denotes Earth's semi-major axis and forms the basis for an astronomical unit (AU) – a measurement used to describe the scale of our solar system. Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25 days or one solar year. Neptune, being the eighth planet from the Sun, has an astronomically greater semi-major axis, averaging at around 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) or approximately 30 AU. Given this immensely larger distance from the Sun, Neptune's orbit is substantially more extended than Earth's. It takes Neptune approximately 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. So, in comparing the distances that Earth and Neptune travel in their individual orbits, it becomes evident that Neptune traverses a vastly larger path. This is due to Neptune’s substantial distance from the Sun compared to the Earth. Consequently, Neptune would travel a longer distance in its orbit around the Sun than Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While William, with a higher salary, had more disposable income to spend, Samuel had to budget his money more carefully due to his limited financial resources. As people generally allocate a portion of their earnings for entertainment and personal items, William's larger salary allowed him to spend more on various expenses. Step 1: Analyze the options given. - I. William had a much smaller salary. - II. Samuel had a much smaller salary.

The second is to place their hand anywhere on the body of a car, and keep it there. This is where things start getting difficult. Lots of other people are doing the same thing. And the winner of the \\"handathon\\" contest is the person who can carry on doing it for the longest time. That person gets to own the car. It still seems to be an easy thing to do. At the beginning it is. Anyone can stand still. But when the contest has been going for four or five days, standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world. And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention. After a few days, the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep. Competitors are allowed to take a five-minute break every hour to eat, drink or do whatever else is necessary. No one is allowed to lean on the car for support. Winners need to be able to show great powers of attention. They also need to be able to develop special skills. Maybe the popularity of the handathon is due to the fact that it is not necessary to be a trained athlete to enter. Entrants in the Longview handathon certainly don't seem to do much preparation. Most say they will prepare by \\"getting lots of sleep\\". Others say they will \\"eat healthy food\\" or \\"pray for success\\". The whole event gives ordinary people the chance to do something interesting and win something at the end. Handathons are competitions, but there is little rivalry   between the competitors. They help each other out and keep each other's spirits up. People who drop out early return with food, drink and encouragement for those still standing. Question: Why is handathon popular? Answer: Answer:","output":"Handathon is popular because it does not require one to be a trained athlete to participate, giving ordinary people the chance to do something interesting and win something at the end. It also fosters a sense of camaraderie and support amongst competitors, rather than intense rivalry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a premise: oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling Here is a hypothesis: I wanted to keep calling before I received mine in the mail. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis holds true given the premise, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their core components and examine the relationship between them. Premise: \\"oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling\\" From this premise, we can summarize the following points: 1. The speaker has recently received something in the mail. 2. This received item inspires the speaker to continue calling (though the exact context or purpose of the calling is unspecified). Hypothesis: \\"I wanted to keep calling before I received mine in the mail.\\" The hypothesis essentially states that, prior to receiving the item in the mail, the speaker already had a desire to keep calling. Now, let's attempt to deduce the validity of the hypothesis based on the premise. The premise focuses on the impact of the received item on the speaker's motivation to continue calling. The hypothesis, however, seeks to establish the speaker's motivation preceding the reception of the item.  Taking these elements into account, it is not necessarily possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true, solely based on the premise. While the premise does establish that the speaker is currently inspired to keep calling, it neither confirms nor denies any motivation that may have existed prior to receiving the item in the mail. To determine the validity of the hypothesis with certainty, more information regarding the speaker's motivations and feelings before receiving the item would be required. As it stands, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is not strong enough to definitively conclude that if the premise is true, so is the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring.

He sold the film to a news agency that year but it was later handed to the government for its inquiries. Ms Nix Jackson says she was told this year the government agency believed to be in possession did not have the film. The 8mm Nix film was shot from the opposite side of the presidential limousine from where the famous Zapruder film was taken on 22 November 1963. Why the legend of JFK endures The Nix film shows the bullet hitting the president, First Lady Jackie Kennedy climbing on to the boot of the limousine, and secret service agent Clint Hill jumping into the vehicle. The film is shot from Dealey Plaza, showing Zapruder across the street and the famous grassy knoll, from where some witnesses thought they heard a shot fired. It is not as complete as the Zapruder movie, as it shows only part of the assassination. However, the lawsuit cites the Warren Commission - which investigated the assassination - as saying the Nix film was \\"nearly as important as the Zapruder film\\".

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

This adoption took place after the birth of a daughter named Georgette. Step 2: Analyzing the second sentence: \\"Shortly after the birth of her daughter, Georgette, Tina and her sisters adopted Tina George Jones.\\" Meaning: This sentence is either incorrect or ambiguously written. If the intended meaning is that Tina and her sisters adopted someone named Tina George Jones, then the sentence is incorrect because 'Tina George Jones' should be replaced with 'George Jones' only. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that Tina and her sisters were adopted by George Jones, the sentence structure is ambiguous and should be rephrased. Step 3: Comparing the meanings of both sentences: The first sentence clearly states that George Jones adopted Tina and her sisters after the birth of their daughter Georgette. On the other hand, the second sentence is either incorrect or ambiguously constructed. As a result, I'd say that the sentences do not have the same meaning with the current wording of the second sentence.

Francis Tiafoe, Top-Ranked Junior, Grew Up at Tennis Center, and It Shows From 1999 to 2010, its tenants were three members of the Tiafoe family: Constant and his twin boys, Francis and Franklin. While Tiafoe, the center’s maintenance man, made his rounds, tending to the courts and emptying the trash bins, Francis would follow, occasionally drifting away to hit a few balls. The costs of elite tennis are prohibitive for many parents — the full-time junior program here is 27,500 a year — but Francis had ready and free access to the sport and some of the best coaches because of his father’s job. From that unusual arrangement, a young tennis star was born. Today, Francis Tiafoe, 14, is the nation’s top-ranked boys player in his age group. “It could be argued that Francis is the luckiest kid in the world,” Ray Benton, the tennis center’s chief executive, said. “It was pure serendipity. He didn’t pick tennis; tennis picked him.” When the French Open begins May 27, analysts and fans will lament the state of men’s tennis in the United States. John Isner is the top-ranked American at No. 10, and he is hardly considered a formidable threat to win a Grand Slam tournament. The last American man to win a major was Andy Roddick, at the 2003 United States Open. If Francis continues his ascent, he could be the country’s next best hope in the sport — a notion that would have been inconceivable to his parents when they immigrated from Sierra Leone in the early 1990s. Tiafoe and his wife, Alphina, had twin boys in 1998, and two years later he took a job on the construction crew that was building the tennis facility. “I worked harder than everybody else as I was the only black guy on the crew,” he said. When the club was completed, Tiafoe was hired to do maintenance. Responsible for opening and closing the center, and everything in between that did not directly involve tennis, he often slept only three hours a night. His starting salary was 21,000 a year. When the staff told him he could stay in the spare office, he made it a home for him and the boys, who stayed at least five days a week. The rest of the time the children stayed with Alphina, who lived with relatives in a one-bedroom apartment in nearby Hyattsville. “We didn’t have a certificate of occupancy, so I was really nervous about telling people he lived in a back room,” Benton said. Alphina said she liked the arrangement because the center was a safe haven from her blighted neighborhood. At first, no one at the center paid much attention to the boys. But the boys, especially Francis, paid attention to the action on the courts. Frank Salazar, one of the coaches, said that from the time Francis was 4, “he had a tennis racket in his hands.” For years, Francis would watch instructors give lessons to older boys. “When we would get done training the bigger boys, he would roll the basket out there and try to serve by himself or play some mini-tennis with whoever had a few minutes,” Salazar said. “Suddenly he started to get really good. He’s probably watched more tennis than all the kids here combined.” When Francis was 8, Mikhail Kouznetsov was hired to coach at the club’s Junior Tennis Champions Center. He became a second father of sorts to the Tiafoe children. Alphina called him “a godsend and a miracle.” “I would come in early, around 5, 6 a.m., and wake the boys up to play and feed them balls or whatever,” Kouznetsov said. “Me and my wife loved them, so we helped feed them, buy them shoes and when we needed to, we drove Francis to tournaments and paid his entrance fees out of our own pockets.” Constant Tiafoe left his maintenance job at the center in 2010 and is unemployed. The family now lives in the apartment in Hyattsville. But the boys remain immersed in tennis almost exclusively. Francis said he had no friends outside the center. His girlfriend, he said, is also a world-class player there. The Tiafoe boys’ development was not always smooth. Franklin also exhibits impressive skills on the court, along with some petulance. “You would know Franklin is playing because all you would hear is curse words ringing from somewhere in the courts,” said Ken Brody, who founded the Junior Tennis Champions Center in 1999. “Roger Federer was the quintessential hothead when he was a junior. They grow out of it.” Schoolwork can be a struggle for Francis, and the fitness regimen and practice drills sometimes flustered him. “Iʼd give him a C in gym glass,” said Frank Costello, the senior director of fitness. “There’s good days and bad days.” But Francis’ results on the court have been so promising that shortcomings may be easy to dismiss. In January he won the boys’ singles title at an international tournament in Bolton, England. A week later, he won Les Petits As, a prestigious tournament in Tarbes, France, which attracts many of the world’s best young players. He now has endorsement deals with Adidas and Wilson. “I knew I was going to play pro tennis when I was 12,” Francis said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about a young tennis player named Francis Tiafoe. He grew up at a tennis center where his dad worked as a maintenance man. This allowed Francis to learn and play tennis for free. Now, at 14 years old, he is the top-ranked boys' tennis player in his age group in the United States.

Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (Persian: syd rwHllh mwswy khmyny [ru:hol'la:he khomei'ni:] ( listen); 24 September 1902 - 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader and politician. He was the founder of Iran as an Islamic republic and the leader of its 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of 2500 years of Persian monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. In January 1963, the Shah announced the \\"White Revolution\\", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as \\"an attack on Islam\\"). Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.  Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.  On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \\"wretched, miserable man,\\" and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.  On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. This sparked three days of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August.","output":"This text is about Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, also known as Ayatollah Khomeini.

But they are said to be the same person – apparently taken just days apart. The young Vietnamese woman at the centre of the improbable medical case, Nguyen Thi Phuong, claims the transformation may have come about because of an extreme allergy to seafood. Nguyen, 26, says she developed this puffy face and sagging skin in 2008 but was too poor to seek treatment. Earlier this month, doctors said they would examine her free of charge. Nguyen’s husband, carpenter Thanh Tuyen, insists the story is true and his love has not faded for his once-beautiful wife. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Rapid ageing: A mystery condition has apparently caused Nguyen Thi Phuong's face to sag and wrinkle over a matter of day. She is pictured aged 21 on the left and 26 on the right. She has always worn wear a mask in. public to hide her appearance from prying eyes, but she has now sought help from doctors to see if they can reverse the 'ageing' effect. Displaying photos of a beautiful. 21-year-old woman on her wedding day in 2006, Mrs Nguyen said: 'Five years. ago, I was rather pretty and not so ugly like this, right?' Mrs Nguyen believes her condition was caused by a life-long allergy to seafood. She said she had suffered a particularly bad reaction in 2008. 'I was really itchy all over. my body. I had to scratch even while sleeping.' Phuong said she took. some medicine bought at a local pharmacy instead of going to the. hospital because her and her husband Tuyen, now 33, were too poor to. afford it. She said: 'After one month of taking the drugs, I became less itchy but hives remained on my skin. Then I switched to traditional medicine. and all the hives disappeared, together with my itching. However, my. skin began to sag and fold.' Mrs Nguyen then took another kind of. traditional medicine to treat her rapid-aging skin problem - but to no. avail. Doctors say it may have been the long-term use of traditional medicines that caused the condition as they are often spiked with corticoids. These steroids speed up the effects of the unregulated remedies but could also have triggered the rare skin disease mastocytosis, where the body produces too many mast cells. The couple do not remember what the medicine was or which pharmacy they got it from. Our love hasn't faded: Tuven (pictured) said he still loved his wife but they hadn't had children as their lives were too difficult. Mrs Nguyen said: 'We considered that it was. our destiny and I quit treatment in 2009. Now I always wear a face mask. whenever I go out. 'The skin on my face, chest and belly. have folds like an old woman who has given birth several times although I. have never had a child. 'But the rapid-aging syndrome hasn't affected. my menstrual cycle, hair, teeth, eyes and mind.' In 2010, the couple. migrated to the southern province of Binh Phuoc's Bu Dop District where. they rent a small wooden house. It could be.... Lipodystrophy. This is a rare syndrome which causes a layer of fatty tissue beneath the surface of the skin to disintegrate while the skin itself continues to grow at a startling pace. It has no cure and leaves victims with loose folds of skin on their bodies as well as wrinkled faces and features of people much hold. Only 2,000 people are thought to have the condition. Or it might be.... Cushing’s Syndrome. This can be triggered if a person has very high levels of a hormone called cortisol in their blood. Common symptoms include weight gain, rounding of the face due to deposits of fat developing there and thinning of the skin. It often occurs as a side effect of treatment with corticosteroids. Women are five times more likely to develop endogenous Cushing’s syndrome than men, with most cases affecting people who are 25 to 40 years old. Mr Nguyen continued to work as a carpenter. while Phuong got a job at a cashew-nut processing factory.  Both earn a. total of less than £92 a month - which means they cannot. afford an examination at a major hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Tuyen said his wife's disease has not affected his love for her or their relationship. He said: 'I married Phuong when she was a. beautiful woman. I have followed her through her disease and have never. been shocked at all. 'It's not easy to talk about one's own. marital affairs. Just simply understand that I still love her very. much.' Mrs Nguyen said her husband's love is the reason she is able to. persevere in the face of adversity. She said: 'He still loves me like before. despite the fact that I look old and ugly. With him, I feel more. confident to live and work.' On October 2, doctors from Nguyen Dinh. Chieu Hospital in Ben Tre Province said they would examine Phuong for. free and send her to the HCMC Dermatology Hospital if they failed to. diagnose her condition. There is already some disagreement among doctors over the cause of the rare condition. Doctor Vo Thi Bach Suong of the HCMC University of Medicine and Pharmacy, said: 'She might have taken corticoid for a. long time. Many traditional pharmacists use corticoid in their medicine,. leading to side effects like swelled face and abnormally-growing skin. sections.' Nguyen Hoai Nam, another lecturer at the university, agreed that Phuong may suffer from the wrongful use of corticoid. He said: 'A sudden stop in using. corticoid could easily lead to Cushing's Syndrome, which is clearly seen. through affected skin.' However, doctor Huynh Huy Hoang of. the HCMC Dermatology Hospital has doubts over this diagnosis. He said: 'It's really strange. This is. the first time I've heard of such a case of rapid-aging process on an. adult. It's not lipodystropy syndrome. 'However, aging is not a common sign of Cushing's Syndrome either.' Doctor Yen Lam Phuc of the Vietnam. Military Medical Academy agreed with Hoang, saying the rapid aging could. not be a side effect of a medical substance.  He said: 'It could be a. totally new syndrome.' Meanwhile Tuyen said that he and his wife do not dare to have a child, even though they have been married several years, because their lives are so difficult. He said: 'Our only wish is to have some philanthropists or doctors help my wife to make her normal face again.' Doctor Hoang Van Minh from the Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University Hospital claims Phuong, could regain some of her previous beauty with medical treatment. Dr Hoang visited Phuong this week at her house in the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre where he said it was likely she did have mastocytosis. He said Phuong's face still swells and she is itchy with frequent diarrhoea, which are common signs of the disease. There is currently no cure but there are many medicines to help treat its symptoms. 'She needs to be treated for her allergies first,' Dr Hoang said. He added that his treatment plan could restore between 50-70 percent of her skin to normal and laser therapy could reduce the folds. Dr Hoang said there should be more tests to verify his initial diagnosis and find any other diseases she might have.","output":"A Vietnamese woman named Nguyen Thi Phuong claims to have undergone a drastic transformation within just a few days due to an extreme allergy to seafood.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- Signs of oil and gas have been found by a Chinese rig that was drilling off a disputed island chain in the South China Seas, according to Chinese state media. The drilling area does have the basic conditions and potential for oil exploration, Wang Zhen, deputy director of CNPC Policy Research Office, told Xinhua. The drilling operation, known as the Zhongjiannan Project, was completed on July 15, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). The state-owned energy company will further analyze the collected geological data before announcing their next steps. When China dispatched the oil rig on May 2 to begin drilling near the Paracel Islands in the South China Seas, the move kicked off a series of confrontations between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in the area. Both nations claim ownership over the chain China refers to as the Xisha islands.

The ongoing dispute in the South China Seas regarding the Paracel Islands has been a point of contention between China and Vietnam for years. Despite the recent discovery of oil and gas in the area by a Chinese drilling rig, Vietnam firmly opposes China's claims to the islands and has labeled the drilling activities as \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. The Vietnamese government asserts that the Paracel Islands fall within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) based on historical records and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Vietnam has repeatedly urged China to respect international law and cease its provocative actions in the disputed waters, but these calls have been disregarded by the Chinese government. In response to China's aggressive actions and the subsequent confrontations between the two countries' vessels, the international community has raised concerns over the potential for escalation and has called for both nations to exercise restraint. Several countries, including the United States and Australia, have expressed support for a rules-based order in the South China Seas, emphasizing the need for all parties to respect international law and abide by the principles outlined in the UNCLOS. Moving forward, it is vital for both China and Vietnam to participate in diplomatic dialogues and negotiations to resolve the territorial dispute peacefully and to de-escalate tensions in the South China Seas. If left unaddressed, the situation could lead to further disputes and a potential risk of conflict between regional powers. In conclusion, despite the discovery of oil and gas by the Chinese drilling rig, Vietnam remains firm in its rejection of China's claims to the Paracel Islands. It is essential that international law be respected, and both nations engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute in a peaceful and constructive manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The conventional procedure at most gas stations is for customers to arrive at the pump, refuel their vehicle, and then pay for the gasoline either at the store or through an automated service at the pump. Apparently, the woman in this instance did not adhere to this routine and disrupted the ordinary system of operations. In more detail, the woman parked her car, went inside the store to pay for the gas in advance, and then returned to her vehicle to get in line for the pump. Her actions created a situation where the narrator was unable to refuel their vehicle in a timely manner, given that another car was using a pump that was already paid for but not yet in use.

Answer: The British dealt with range measurement first, when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPTIONS: [+] yes; [+] no;","output":"Answer: The fuse length could be set using height reported by specialized military personnel known as artillery observers or spotters. These individuals play a crucial role in the effective use of artillery in military operations. Their primary responsibility is to identify enemy targets and relay the information, including distance, elevation, and coordinates, to artillery units in real-time. Artillery observers work closely with several types of equipment and instruments to determine target distance and elevation accurately. Some of the gear and techniques they might use include: 1. Range finders: These devices use various methods such as laser, radar, or acoustic signals to measure the distance to the target. By emitting signals and measuring the time it takes for them to bounce back from the target, a highly accurate estimate of the range can be calculated. 2. Topographical maps: Observers use topographical maps, which illustrate the terrain and elevation of an area, to help determine the height and position of targets. This information is essential in calculating the necessary adjustments for artillery fire. 3. Binoculars and spotting scopes: These tools are used by observers to identify and track enemy movements visually. They can also assist in pinpointing specific targets and estimating their approximate distance and elevation. 4. GPS devices: Observers may employ GPS devices to determine their precise location and the coordinates of enemy targets. This information can be relayed to artillery units to help coordinate their fire. 5. Communication equipment: Secure radios and communication systems enable observers to relay the essential information, such as range, elevation, and coordinates, to artillery units to guarantee accurate targeting. In summary, the fuse length could be set using the height reported by artillery observers or spotters. These highly trained military personnel utilize a range of specialized equipment and techniques to provide critical data to artillery units to allow them to accurately target enemy forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cubans will celebrate the historic pact with the U.S. This was the best Christmas gift ever for me, for hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans and for the 11 million Cubans on the island. I’m talking about the history-making announcement by President Obama of a sea change in U.S.-Cuba relations after more than 50 years of irrationality and hostility — something I had come to believe would not happen in my lifetime. “Incredible news I’ve waited my entire life to hear,” said Ralph Ortega, editor-in-chief of On Wall Street and a former Daily News reporter. “I wish my dad, who was Cuban, was here for this.” Yes, unexpectedly, it did happen. Not only is Alan Gross, the American who spent five years in a Cuban jail, reunited with his family on the first day of Chanukah, but three Cubans who for 15 years were imprisoned in the U.S. for spying are back in their country just in time for Christmas. As Milena Recio, an editor of the online publication Progreso Weekly, said from Havana, “It is good that the road to a re-encounter among both nations had begun with a humanitarian gesture.” The actions Obama announced Wednesday have profound implications for Cuba and Latin America. Even if only Congress can put an end to the shameful embargo, Obama and Raul Castro are opening a dialogue on everything else. The thousands of people of good will in Cuba and in the U.S. who worked hard for many years to see this day are feeling joy and accomplishment. “We did it,” said an elated Arturo López Levy, a professor in Denver who was born in Cuba. “It is everybody’s victory for peace and good relations and nobody’s defeat.” On the island ruled by the Castro brothers since 1959, University of Havana students are celebrating and there is excitement coupled with a sense of new possibilities. “It is one of the most exciting moments we have lived,” Recio said. In Miami, opinions are sharply split and emotions are at a boiling point. The Marco Rubios of this world are pulling their hair in panic, but most Cuban-Americans are hailing Obama’s move as brave and moral and fair. “At last there is a President with common sense in Washington,” said Vicente Dopico, a Miami-based Cuban-American artist. Yes, the best Christmas gift ever to Cubans and all people of good will is really happening. And almost incredibly, I have lived long enough to see it . . .","output":"Cubans celebrate the historic agreement between the U.S. and Cuba after more than 50 years of difficult relations.

News article: Bernard Madoff 'hid 9bn from prosecutors' If true, it could prove to be a significant development for Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee charged with uncovering Madoff's secret assets, who is now likely to want to interview Madoff to find out where the money is. The fellow prisoner also claimed that Madoff told him that the only other person to know of the identities of the three is Frank DiPascali, his former right-hand man, though it is not clear whether he knew money had been passed to them. Mr DiPascali has pleaded guilty to 10 separate counts relating to the Madoff fraud and is currently working with federal prosecutors from jail to help them widen the case. Madoff allegedly told the inmate – who is not named by the paper – that he suspects Mr DiPascali may be using information relating to the secret 9bn as leverage to shorten his own sentence. He has yet to be sentenced. Mr DiPascali's lawyer declined to comment. The New York Post account also provides an insight into Madoff's alleged life behind bars, suggesting he sought the aid of a counsellor ahead of the release of Sheryl Weinstein's book last year, in which it was revealed he had had an affair with the former investor. \\"He was having problems with his wife [Ruth]\\" over the book's revelations, the inmate is reported to have said. Madoff is alleged to have been prescribed anti-depressants as a result. Madoff is said to have now taken a job in the prison shop at Butner, North Carolina, where he is serving his sentence, and has still yet to be visited by sons Andrew and Mark, who worked in Madoff's securities business. However, the inmate's account of Madoff's attitude to his victims does not tally with other recent accounts. According to the New York Post's description, Madoff \\"feels a lot of pain for what he did to\\" his thousands of victims, running contrary to a recent account in New York Magazine in which the fraudster is alleged to have said: \\"**** my victims. I carried them for 20 years, and now I'm doing 150 years.\\" In that piece, he reportedly told one fellow prisoner that the crime was not fully of his own making, and that he felt unfairly caught up in the situation. \\"People just kept throwing money at me,\\" Madoff told a prison consultant. \\"Some guy wanted to invest, and if I said no, the guy said, 'What, I'm not good enough?'\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are as follows: 1. Bernard Madoff, the mastermind behind the largest Ponzi scheme in history, allegedly hid 9 billion from prosecutors. If true, this could be a significant development for Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee responsible for uncovering Madoff's secret assets. 2. Madoff reportedly told a fellow prisoner that only three people knew about the hidden money: himself, an unidentified individual, and Frank DiPascali, his former right-hand man. DiPascali has pleaded guilty to 10 separate counts related to the Madoff fraud and is currently assisting federal prosecutors from jail to widen the case. 3. Madoff allegedly suspects that DiPascali may be using the information about the hidden 9 billion as leverage to shorten his own prison sentence.

Madoff was prescribed anti-depressants as a result. 5. There are conflicting accounts about Madoff's attitude towards his victims. While the New York Post's source claims that Madoff feels pain for those he defrauded, another account in New York Magazine quotes Madoff as saying, \\"**** my victims. I carried them for 20 years, and now I'm doing 150 years.\\" These key points highlight the potential uncovering of additional hidden assets, the ongoing investigation into Madoff's fraud, and Madoff's personal life and attitude towards his victims as he serves his 150-year prison sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

Write an article based on this summary: Dress professionally while still looking fit. Dress to show off that bod while you're out on the town. Maintain your image to complement your physique. A confident attitude may be the most subtle yet powerful way to show off your muscles.","output":"Title: Striking a Balance: Dressing Professionally and Accentuating Your Physique Introduction: In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is essential for both physical and mental well-being. Apart from the numerous health benefits, regular exercise does wonders for your body, and it only makes sense to show off your hard-earned physique. However, striking the perfect balance between dressing professionally and accentuating your body can be tricky. This article offers guidance on how to dress to impress while maintaining a professional image that complements your toned body. Step 1: Choose the Right Fit The first step in dressing professionally while showcasing your physique is selecting clothing that fits you well. Poorly fitting clothes can make even the most toned individual appear unkempt or unprofessional. Opt for tailored suits, fitted dress shirts, or sleek blouses that accentuate your body without being too tight or revealing. A well-fitted outfit will not only accentuate your toned figure, but it will also give you a confident aura while maintaining a professional appearance. Step 2: Incorporate Appropriate Colors and Patterns Colors and patterns can greatly enhance your attire and help show off your physical attributes. Dark shades, such as navy blue, black, or charcoal, provide a slimming effect and generally look more professional. These colors can be contrasted with lighter, more vibrant shades for a pop of visual interest. Vertical stripes can also create an elongating and slimming effect, drawing the eye to your toned physique. Step 3: Opt for High-Quality Fabrics Investing in high-quality fabrics will ensure that your clothing retains its form, feels comfortable on your body, and withstands washes and usage. High-quality fabrics can adapt to your body shape and look more polished, allowing your sculpted frame to stand out. Step 4: Choose the Right Accessories Accessories can enhance your overall look while adding a professional touch. Men can opt for leather belts, cufflinks, and ties, while women can choose tasteful jewelry and a flattering belt to subtly draw attention to their waistline. A high-quality timepiece, like a classic watch, can demonstrate your attention to detail and reflect a sense of sophistication and style without overtly drawing attention to your physique. Step 5: Confidence is Key Lastly, one should never overlook the importance of a confident attitude. A positive demeanor and self-assured body language can go a long way in enhancing your appearance and highlighting your fitness achievements. Stand tall, walk with purpose, and project a magnetic energy into every room you enter to showcase your muscles subtly yet powerfully. Conclusion: Dressing to accentuate your toned physique while maintaining a professional image is all about finding the perfect balance. By selecting clothing that fits well, incorporating appropriate colors and patterns, investing in high-quality fabrics, and accessorizing wisely, you can showcase your hard work without compromising your polished appearance. Most importantly, remember that a confident attitude completes the look, reflecting the strength and determination that went into crafting your impressive physique."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1947, Inspector Garvey of Scotland Yard suspects Michael Lanyard, the reformed jewel thief known as \\"The Lone Wolf\\" is behind the theft of the priceless diamonds called the \\"Eyes of the Nile\\". Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen.  Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily  (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom.  Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton, Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard.

As a result, your thermostat senses the lower temperature and sends a signal to the heating system to provide heat for your home. When the oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump. In this process, the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air. This fuel/air mixture is crucial for the efficient and optimal operation of the heating system. Now, suppose less fine mist is mixed with air. This situation will lead to a less efficient fuel/air mixture, which in turn affects the combustion process within the heating system. Consequently, the flame produced in the combustion chamber may not be as strong and consistent as it should be. With a weaker flame, the heating system may not be able to provide sufficient heat to warm the room to the desired temperature as efficiently as it would with a proper fuel/air mixture. This means that the heating system may need to work harder to try to maintain the desired room temperature, which can lead to increased energy consumption and longer heating times. Furthermore, having less fine mist mixed with air could also potentially cause incomplete combustion, leading to the production of higher levels of undesirable emissions, such as carbon monoxide, smoke, and soot. In conclusion, the reduced efficiency of the fuel/air mixture in the heating system will lead to less heat output and could ultimately affect the overall performance of the heating system, making it more challenging to maintain a comfortable temperature in the room."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With these factors in mind, the story unfolds in the following way: As the 2016 presidential campaign gains momentum, several strong Democratic contenders emerge, including Hillary Clinton, who eventually decides to run, believing she can bring a fresh perspective to the White House while building on the progress made during the Obama administration. Other Democratic candidates also join the race, highlighting their unique approaches to improving the country and connecting with diverse groups of Americans. The primary season is full of debates, rallies, and moments highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate. In the end, Hillary Clinton emerges as the Democratic nominee due to her wealth of experience and ability to appeal to various demographics. In the general election campaign, Clinton faces a challenging Republican opponent who capitalizes on the desire for change and critiques of the Obama administration. The battle between the two candidates is intense and divisive, with each side working tirelessly to promote their vision for the country and discredit their opponent. After months of campaigning and increasingly hostile rhetoric, the election reaches its climax. The results are in, and despite a tightly contested race, Hillary Clinton becomes the President-Elect of the United States, making history as the first woman to hold the highest office in the land. Many Americans celebrate this historic achievement, while others remain concerned about the direction the country will take under her leadership. Throughout her presidency, Clinton works to achieve a balance between continuing the successful policies of the previous administration and implementing new initiatives to address ongoing challenges. Her tenure is marked by both successes and setbacks. Across the aisle, the Republican Party learns from this election cycle, making adjustments to its platform and strategy to better connect with voters and adapt to changing demographics.

Beehives  -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today,  Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall   instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial   results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away. Question: As mentioned in the passage, Lucy Answer: Options are: [A]. works by herself in Africa.

Nina Courtepatte's mother calls for inquiry into murdered aboriginal women Families and communities across Canada are again renewing their calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women in Canada following the death of Sagkeeng First Nation teenager Tina Fontaine. The 15-year-old girl was found dead in Winnipeg last weekend and police are treating her death as a homicide. For Edmonton's Peacha Atkinson, mother of Nina Courtepatte, the news of Fontaine's death has reminded her of her own loss. She gathered with other family members and with friends Saturday at at Hawrelak Park for mutual support. “It brought back all the memories, flooding back,” Atkinson said. “When you found out, the phone calls, the sleepless nights, the wondering where she is.” Courtepatte, also young and aboriginal like Fontaine, was just 13 years old in 2005 when she went missing. Nina Courtepatte was 13 years old in 2005 when she was killed. Her body was dumped at a golf course outside Edmonton. (CBC News) Courtepatte had been lured from the West Edmonton Mall, sexually assaulted and killed. Her battered body was found on a golf course west of Edmonton. In 2012, Michael Briscoe was found guilty of first-degree murder in relation to Courtepatte's death. This week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper dismissed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women. “We should not view this as a sociological phenomenon, we should view it as a crime,” Harper said. Atkinson told CBC News that she wasn't surprised by the prime minister’s response. “The government, they don’t care about us,” she said. “To the government, we are expendable. Why put money and resources into finding out how come we’re so expendable?” Melanie Omeniho, elected president of the Women of the Métis Nation, has long been advocating for this type of inquiry. “The truth is there is a [social] process that has to be acknowledged as to why people think it’s acceptable that they’re aboriginal women and they’re just kids that have gone missing or young women that have gone missing and that they don’t matter to society,” Omeniho said. While any inquiry would be too late for Courtepatte, Fontaine and other victims of crime, Atkinson hopes there will be a national inquiry soon so other mothers of aboriginal girls across the country won’t have to grieve their daughters as she does.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  Paragraph: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates? The answer is:","output":"Barb, who practiced the no-tillage method, had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates. This is because, in places with rigorous winters, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, potentially leading to planting later than ideal dates."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer a question about this article: In 1820-1830’s the Ottoman Empire endured a number of strikes which challenged the existence of the country. The Greek Uprising (began in the spring of 1821) evidenced internal and military weakness of Ottoman Empire and caused severe atrocities by Ottoman military forces (see Chios massacre). The disbandment of the centuries-old Janissary corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 (Auspicious Incident) was a good deed for the country in the longer term, but it has deprived the country from its army forces for the nearest future.

It tells the story of Eric \`\` The Kid '' Stoner , a young Depression - era poker player , as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best . This quest leads him to challenge Lancey \`\` The Man '' Howard , an older player widely considered to be the best , culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two . The script , adapted from Richard Jessup 's novel , was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern ; it was Lardner 's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten . The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard . Jewison , who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began , describes The Cincinnati Kid as his \`\` ugly duckling '' film . He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects . The film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release ; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances .  - A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person.  - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or \\"community\\" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures.  - Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as \\"the stakes\\") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money and/or material goods. Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize. The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.    What is the relationship between 'the cincinnati kid' and 'gambling'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between \\"The Cincinnati Kid\\" and \\"gambling\\" lies in the fact that the film revolves around the world of poker, which is a family of gambling card games. The movie tells the story of a young poker player, Eric \\"The Kid\\" Stoner, who aims to prove himself as the best by challenging seasoned player Lancey \\"The Man\\" Howard. Throughout the film, the characters engage in poker games, which involve betting, an essential aspect of gambling.

Write an article based on this summary: – President Trump has a notable new critic of his plan to impose big tariffs on steel and aluminum: House Speaker Paul Ryan. “We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,” says a spokesperson for Ryan. “The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don’t want to jeopardize those gains.” In fact, congressional GOP leaders have not ruled out the idea of taking some kind of legislative action to block any such tariffs, assuming Trump makes them official as promised in the coming week or two, reports the Wall Street Journal. Members of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee also oppose the tariffs, as do various Senate Republicans, notes the Washington Post. Trump, for his part, sounded unfazed by the pushback. \\"No, we're not backing down,\\" Trump said in the Oval Office, while with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, per the AP. Earlier Monday, Trump said Mexico and Canada might be able to avoid the tariffs, but only if they agreed to better terms on NAFTA. Trump reaffirmed the point with reporters. \\"We've had a very bad deal with Mexico, we've had a very bad deal with Canada—it's called NAFTA,\\" Trump said.

He wanted to put big taxes, called tariffs, on steel and aluminum coming into the United States. He thought it would help American workers and industries. But some people, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, do not agree.  Paul Ryan is a very important man who speaks for a group of people called the House of Representatives. He is worried that the big taxes on steel and aluminum will make other countries unhappy. Those countries might put big taxes on American goods in return. This could lead to a thing called a trade war, which could be bad for everybody. A person who speaks for Paul Ryan said, \\"We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan.\\" Many other important people in the United States government also do not agree with President Trump's idea. They are trying to find ways to stop it from happening. One way they can do this is by making a new rule or law that says \\"no\\" to the big taxes. Many people in powerful government groups like the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate are also against Trump's tax idea. President Trump does not seem worried about all the people who disagree with him. He said, \\"No, we're not backing down,\\" when he was talking to a group of reporters in a special office called the Oval Office. Trump also said that countries like Mexico and Canada might not have to pay the big taxes, but only if they make some changes to a deal with the United States called NAFTA.

Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season.

As with the plastic bins, storage cabinets that feature clear drawers are the best option because you can easily see what LEGO pieces are inside. Look for drawer systems that provide different size drawers, so you can easily organize your collection based on the size of the pieces. In order to maximize your space, it may make sense to store multiple types of LEGO bricks and pieces in a single drawer. To prevent them from becoming mixed up, it helps to have a drawer organizer with different compartments, so you can separate the pieces based on your chosen sorting system. Drawer organizers are available at office and home supply stores. They come in a variety of sizes, and some are even customizable, so you can create the ideal storage for your LEGOs. Even if your storage cabinet has drawers made of clear plastic, it’s a good idea to label them with the contents, so you don’t have to go searching for a certain piece in the middle of a build. For the most organized collection, be as specific as possible when creating the labels. A label maker is obviously ideal for creating labels for your drawers, but you also easily create custom labels on your computer as well.

Currently, broadband home connection is legal only for diplomats and employees of foreign companies, a report said. The Caribbean nation is one of the world's least connected countries, and only between 5% to 25% of Cubans have any type of internet service. Cuba's state telecom agency Etecsa said the pilot project would allow residents in the historic district of Old Havana to order broadband through fibre-optic connections operated by the Chinese telecom firm Huawei. No timeline or prices have been announced. Some Cuban citizens have dial-up home services or restricted mobile phone connections that allow access only to state-run email, The Associated Press news agency said. The public can access the internet in public wi-fi spots in Cuba, which opened last year. But many have complained about the cost of the connection: 2 (Â£1.4) an hour, or about a 10th of the average monthly salary. There are 58 wireless internet points in Cuba, 17 of them in Havana. Around 150,000 Cubans used those spots daily in 2015, according to Etecsa data. Odalys Rodriguez del Toro, Etecsa director for Havana, has also announced that 30 more public wi-fi spots will be opened in the capital in 2016, doubling the number of access points. The United States has been pushing Cuba to show that it is improving conditions for its citizens as the two countries normalise their relations after more than 50 years of hostility. US President Barack Obama is expected to travel to Cuba later this year to celebrate the re-establishment of diplomatic relations. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Cuban government will begin allowing citizens in Old Havana to order broadband internet service from the state telecom agency Etecsa. The pilot project for this initiative will involve fiber-optic connections operated by Chinese firm Huawei.

As the United States continues to push Cuba to show that it is improving conditions for citizens, this development can be seen as a response to those demands in relation to internet connectivity. With diplomatic relations between the two countries being re-established, the expansion of broadband access demonstrates a change in policy toward increased digital access for the Cuban people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  Daniel visited two countries. Switzerland and India. There was almost no air pollution at all in Switzerland, while the air in India was almost impossible to breathe it was so polluted.  Which country had fewer people develop lung cancer? A:","output":"Based on the information provided about air pollution and its links to lung diseases such as lung cancer, it is likely that Switzerland, with almost no air pollution, had fewer people develop lung cancer as compared to India, where the air was extremely polluted. Air pollution exposes people to various harmful chemicals and particulate matter that can cause inflammation and harmful effects on the respiratory system. When people breathe in these polluted particles, they can damage the lungs and increase the risk of developing lung cancer. In India, with a high level of air pollution, the population is at an increased risk of developing such diseases due to continuous exposure to pollutants. Switzerland, on the other hand, has stringent regulations and practices to control air pollution, resulting in cleaner air for its residents. This clean air significantly reduces the chances of developing lung cancer as people are not inhaling harmful pollutants. Therefore, the rate of lung cancer in Switzerland is expected to be lower than that in India. It is essential to note that various other factors can contribute to lung cancer, such as genetics, lifestyle habits like smoking, and occupational exposures. Although air pollution is a significant contributor, it is vital to consider these other contributing factors when evaluating lung cancer rates in different countries. However, based on the air pollution levels in Switzerland and India, it is reasonable to conclude that Switzerland had fewer people develop lung cancer due to its comparatively cleaner air."},{"instruction":"Assagao -  Assagao (pronounced [aːsɡãːw]) is a village in Bardez Goa located about 4 kilometres west of Mapusa.

It's a game where people play in teams and try to kick a round ball into a goal.  There are two teams in England named West Brom and Bournemouth. In football, sometimes players move from one team to another. This is called a 'transfer'.  Recently, West Brom announced that they have signed a new player named Marc Wilson. Marc used to play for Bournemouth, but he decided to join West Brom for the rest of the season. He's not switching teams forever; it's just a short visit. This is called a 'loan'. When a player is on loan, they play for the new team for a little bit before going back to their original team. Marc Wilson is known as a 'defender' in football. A defender's job is to stop the other team from scoring a goal. He plays an important role in protecting his team's goal. Marc decided to leave Bournemouth and go to West Brom because of some personal reasons. Personal reasons can be anything that has to do with a person's life outside of football.

Really the worse movie I have ever seen(at the cinema). Nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster. I saw it when it came out in a cinema in Brighton. People were walking out and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium! At the end there were boos and scorn from the meagre crowd left, which was quite sad as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really sheepish. However the movie was that bad that I really could not feel like that sympathetic with them. Everybody has to start from somewhere and their son started off his acting career with this truly awful attempt at 'Tarantinism made in the UK'. 5 years have gone bye, but sometimes I still cringe at the memory of that sad night at the movies!

Furthermore, the reviewer mentions the audience's negative reactions, such as walking out, booing, and expressing scorn, indicating that the sentiment is not only their own but also shared by others. The mention of relatives of one of the main actors feeling sheepish drives home the point that even those with a personal connection to the film couldn't feel positive about it. The reviewer concludes by stating that the film has no redeeming features and assigns the lowest possible rating due to the lack of an option for zero.

Given the question: Process:  - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is using less energy happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person using less energy, leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration and vocalization. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced oxygen consumption: When a person is using less energy, their body's metabolic rate might decline, leading to reduced oxygen consumption. In this case, the amount of oxygen moving from the lungs into the bloodstream could be affected as there will be less demand for oxygen by various organs, tissues, and cells in the body. 2. Altered respiration rate: With less energy being used, the need for oxygen and the production of carbon dioxide will be decreased. This can lead to a decrease in the respiratory rate as the body tries to maintain the appropriate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, which in turn would lead to a smaller amount of air being pulled into the lungs and less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Indirect Effects: 1. Impact on vocalization: Since the act of speaking involves the coordination of various muscles and movements, a person using less energy might experience changes in their vocalization abilities. Reduced energy expenditure could lead to weaker or less forceful vocalizations, which might result in changes in the pitch, tone, or volume of their voice. 2. Reduced physical activity: With less overall energy, a person might experience a decline in their physical activity levels. This could potentially limit the degree to which their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are challenged, leading to a reduction in the efficiency of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream and ultimately affecting their ability to complete physical tasks or engage in long conversations without becoming fatigued. 3. Impact on cognitive function: It's important to recognize that oxygen plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy cognitive function. With less oxygen being delivered to the brain due to reduced energy expenditure, it could indirectly affect a person's cognitive abilities, including their capacity for effective communication and speech. In conclusion, a person using less energy, leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, can indeed have direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration and vocalization. The body's ability to maintain an appropriate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and the effect on vocalization, physical activity, and cognitive function are some of the factors that could be impacted by this perturbation. However, it is important to note that these effects may vary depending on the individual and the extent to which energy expenditure is reduced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this proper case","output":"The Natura 2000 network is a vast array of protected sites that span across Europe and its surrounding regions, representing the largest network of such areas in the world. Established through the European Union's Habitats Directive and Birds Directive, this extensive network aims to safeguard Europe's rich biodiversity and preserve the habitats and species most at risk. Comprised of approximately 26,000 protected sites, Natura 2000 covers almost 18% of Europe's total land area and significant portions of its marine territory. The network is home to a wide range of habitats and species, from pristine forests and wetlands to rugged coastlines and scenic landscapes, which collectively support more than 200 habitat types and 1,000 species listed under the EU directives. The primary purpose of Natura 2000 is to ensure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats, taking into account both socio-economic considerations and ecological needs. This is achieved through the establishment of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), designated under the Habitats and Birds Directives respectively. Together, these sites form a coherent ecological network that allows for the protection and conservation of both terrestrial and marine habitats. To maintain and enhance the network, EU Member States are responsible for establishing the necessary conservation measures within each Natura 2000 site. These measures may include the creation of management plans, implementation of restoration projects, or the promotion of sustainable land-use practices. Furthermore, Member States are required to report on the progress and effectiveness of these conservation measures regularly, ensuring that the network continues to achieve its objectives. Natura 2000 plays a crucial role in preserving Europe's unique natural heritage for future generations. Through its extensive network of protected areas, it not only contributes to the achievement of global biodiversity targets but also serves as a vital resource for local communities, businesses, and governments. Natura 2000 sites provide many socio-economic benefits, such as supporting tourism and recreation, offering a source of clean water and air, and providing natural flood protection. In conclusion, the Natura 2000 network is the world's largest collection of protected areas, comprising a wide range of habitats and species that contribute to Europe's rich biodiversity. Established through the European Union's Habitats and Birds Directives, the network aims to preserve and enhance the continent's most valuable and threatened habitats and species. By fostering cooperation between Member States and stakeholders, Natura 2000 not only safeguards Europe's natural heritage but also supports vital socio-economic functions for the benefit of both human populations and the environment."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Water plays a significant role in landscape transformation, and understanding the sequence of events as the water interacts with land features is essential to comprehend the overall process. 1. Water flow initiation: The process starts with the formation or existence of a water source in the area, which may be a stream or river flowing over the land surface or frequent rainfall in the area. The water flow carries various elements like sediments, minerals, and rocks that contribute to the erosion process. 2. Surface erosion: As the water flows over the land, it begins to remove and carry away loose particles of soil, rocks, and vegetation, known as surface erosion. The removal of these materials leads to a loss of support for underlying materials, making the land more vulnerable to further erosion. 3. Channel formation: Over time, water continues to flow along the same path, and this repeated movement gradually forms a channel. The channel's depth and width depend on factors such as the volume and velocity of the water, soil composition, and the presence of vegetation. 4. Downcutting: With an established channel, the water flow becomes more focused on specific points, where it has more energy to cut into the underlying soil, rocks, and bedrock. This downward erosion, called downcutting, allows the stream to create a deeper and narrower gash in the landscape. 5. Lateral erosion: While downcutting continues, the stream also erodes the sides of the channel, expanding its width. This process, known as lateral erosion, changes the shape of the landscape around the stream as it removes earth materials from the banks and deposits them downstream, forming more gently sloping valley sides. 6. Mature stage: Over many years, the stream will continue to erode the landscape, creating a deep, V-shaped valley that will ultimately evolve into a ravine. However, this process may take a very long time, depending on factors such as the water flow, bedrock composition, and climate conditions of the area. 7. River drying up: Eventually, the river or stream may experience reductions in water flow, possibly due to changes in climate, geological shifts, or human intervention. If the water source dries up completely, the erosion process ceases, leaving a dry ravine in its place. In summary, the first step in the process of forming a ravine through erosion is the initiation of water flow, which can be attributed to a river, stream or consistent rainfall in the area. This water flow brings about surface erosion, leading to a series of events including channel formation, downcutting, lateral erosion, the mature stage, and finally, if the water source dries up, a dry ravine remains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a cold, wet field two hours' drive west of London, there's no mistaking the huddle of ancient shapes that emerge suddenly on the horizon, back-dropped by a distant cluster of leafless trees. Until recently, any first encounter with Stonehenge, that legendary keeper of Neolithic secrets, could prove deeply underwhelming. Two traffic-snarled highways have encroached on the brooding rocks, robbing them of their scale. Now that's changing. The site's custodians have unveiled a 44 million visitor center and a radical remodeling of the landscape that will reconnect the circle with the atmospheric terrain it has occupied for more than 4,000 years. CNN was among the first visitors through its doors -- and to experience a redesigned approach to the UNESCO World Heritage Site that its guardians hope will restore some of its once-formidable presence. Visitors are no longer directed to a cramped parking lot slapped hastily on top of historically significant earthworks. The parking lot and a roadway, which for decades has severed the stone circle from an ancient avenue, are being torn up and grassed over. Instead they arrive at the new center, an elegant modern pavilion of glass and weathered sweet chestnut wood that now forms the gateway to the enigmatic millennium-old monument -- helping to create a sense of anticipation and drama. Contrast vital. \\"One key thing has been to make it as different from the stones as possible,\\" Stephen Quinlan, one of the center's architects, told CNN. The building's undulating roof and matchstick steel pillars blend in with the area's rolling hills and sparse woodland, he said. The center officially opens on December 18, three days before the winter solstice, when druids, pagans and revelers gather to watch the sun rise in perfect alignment with the stones -- a celestial event that both explains their purpose and deepens their mystery. These time-honored traditions show how cherished Stonehenge is, not only to the people who assign it spiritual importance, but also to the archaeologists who study its origins. Not to mention the 1 million tourists who traipse here each year. It's no wonder the government bodies guarding the site have been cautious about remodeling -- enduring 30 years of wrangling over budgets, designs and locations before creating the new center. Worthwhile wait. For some, however, the wait has been worth it. \\"I think it's fabulous,\\" Mark Horton, a professor of history at Bristol University, told CNN at the center's opening. \\"It's one of the most important archaeological monuments in western Europe and has been for so long woefully neglected.\\" In one way the delays had been an advantage, he said. \\"If it was here 10 years ago, it would look out of date because we now have completely new interpretations of how and why and when Stonehenge was built.\\" Stonehenge isn't visible from the center, lying over the crest of a hill -- so visitors spend time exploring its new exhibition space before walking or catching a road train to cover the mile and a half to the stone circle. The exhibition's centerpiece is a 360-degree virtual display that tries to simulate the experience of standing within the stone circle -- something most visitors have been banned from doing since the late 1970s in order to protect the rocks. It uses laser-scanned images to zap the viewer back through history amid dramatic solstice sunrises and sunsets. For anyone who has waited in vain for a dawn obscured by the miserable British weather, this could actually be an improvement. Neolithic head reconstructed. Among 250 other antiquities, the exhibition also includes the reconstructed head of a 5,500-year-old Neolithic man found nearby. Archaeologists have used advanced 3D scanning technology on his skull to reveal his face. While this undoubtedly offers a valuable glimpse into the human story behind Stonehenge, there's no escaping the fact that the result of all that hi-tech labor bears an uncanny resemblance to Jeff Bridges in \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" The Neolithic man's skeleton is also on display, a fact that has stirred some controversy. The leader of Britain's self-proclaimed largest order of druids says the use of the bones is disrespectful to their long-dead owner. \\"Those who've been laid to rest should stay at rest -- it's not a pagan issue, it's one of common decency,\\" King Arthur Pendragon, who describes himself as the Battle Chieftain of the Council of British Druid Orders, told CNN. While it brings visitors face to face with the monument's history, what the new center cannot do is shed definitive light on how and why Stonehenge was constructed using stones quarried 150 miles away in the Preseli mountains of Wales. There have been numerous theories about their construction and purpose, ranging from outlandish claims about UFOs or mythical stories of giants and wizards to explanations concerning druidic rituals or astronomical observatories. Solstice ceremonies. The 2009 announcement that another stone circle -- Bluestonehenge -- had been discovered adjacent by the nearby River Avon has lent support to another theory: that Stonehenge was a temple forming part of a larger funeral and burial complex that only later became a place for solstice ceremonies. Back in the 21st century, with much of the remodeling yet to be completed, it's still a work in progress. Although the road train's slower approach to the stones does help build the atmosphere, the old parking lot and the remaining busy highway still blot the landscape. There are times, however, walking the circuit around Stonehenge, when the traffic, the noise and the fellow visitors taking iPhone selfies suddenly melt away. In these fleeting moments there's a sense of the power these simple rocks have conveyed to so many. But while the site's guardians hope their innovations will help visitors to connect better to the surrounding ancient landscape, for some there will always be one crucial element missing. \\"The only thing that struck me is you can't go up and touch it,\\" said fourth-time visitor Keith Foskett, of West Sussex, England. \\"I think that's a real shame. English Heritage might own it, but it really belongs to the people. You should be allowed to go up and hug the stones.\\" Stonehenge, near Salisbury, England. +44 87 0333 1181.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, is a visual feast, transporting audiences back to the decadence and glamor of the Roaring Twenties. The film's stunning visual effects and elaborate set design create an immersive atmosphere that is exhilarating to the senses. The fast-paced and high-energy storytelling make for an exciting and engaging viewing experience. The cast, led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire, effectively captures the spirit of their respective characters and contributes to the overall luster of the film. Although some might argue that this adaptation lacks depth, it nonetheless delivers an entertaining spectacle that would appeal to a broad audience. In conclusion, The Great Gatsby stands out as a dazzling visual extravaganza and provides a thrilling glimpse into the world of 1920s excess. I highly recommend this film to fans of Baz Luhrmann's directorial style, and those looking for a visually stunning movie experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who said Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell as a GI would ruin his career? ?  On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army as a private at Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They would eventually marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell as a GI would ruin his career....

Fact 1: Lakes are generally bigger and deeper than ponds.  Fact 2: Lake trout season opens in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, excluding the refuges.  Given the two facts above, trout are found in places generally bigger and deeper than what? Answer:","output":"Given the two facts above, trout are found in places generally bigger and deeper than ponds. To provide a detailed explanation, we can analyze both facts and the habitats of lake trout. Fact 1 states that lakes are generally bigger and deeper than ponds. This is a significant distinction because the size and depth of a body of water can influence its temperature, oxygen levels, and overall ecosystem. Lakes, due to their size, often have varying temperature zones within them. They can have deep, cold waters that typically retain a consistent, low temperature, as opposed to shallow areas that can warm more easily. Ponds, on the other hand, have less water volume and are shallower, leading to more uniform temperatures and oxygen levels throughout the pond. Fact 2 specifically mentions that lake trout season opens in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, which are both part of the Great Lakes system in North America. This information indicates that lake trout inhabit these large lakes, which are significantly larger and deeper than ponds. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are a species of char, closely related to other cold-water fish such as brook trout and Arctic char. They are native to North America and are found primarily in large, deep, cold lakes. The preferred habitat for lake trout consists of deep waters with a temperature range of around 40°F to 52°F (4°C to 11°C). These cold, well-oxygenated conditions are ideal for lake trout, enabling them to thrive and grow to significant sizes. Given that lakes provide the necessary conditions of size, depth, and low temperatures, it is evident that lake trout are better adapted to thriving in lakes than in ponds, which tend to lack the extensive depth and size found in lakes. Furthermore, larger lakes, like Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, are part of complex ecosystems that can support more diverse and stable populations, providing ample food sources and suitable habitats for lake trout. On the other hand, ponds may not be able to offer the same optimal living conditions for lake trout due to their smaller size and limited depth. Therefore, based on the provided facts and additional information on lake trout habitats, these fish are predominantly found in places generally bigger and deeper than ponds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The creation of the system used by Jordan indicates that Taylor has a firm grasp of technology and a deep understanding of designing effective solutions, which points towards them being a technical person. The system’s ease of use reflects Taylor's thoughtfulness and insight into the needs of their users, which is a highly valued skill for a technical person in the development of user-friendly systems. At the same time, the fact that Taylor specifically created the system for Jordan to use at their workplace evokes a sense of personal connection and consideration between the two, indicative of a friendly relationship.

Jennifer really got on Victoria's nerves, because","output":"Jennifer had acquired a particularly condescending manner when dealing with Victoria. She always seemed to find ways to belittle Victoria's accomplishments and constantly reminded her where she fell short. With each passing day, it appeared as though Jennifer made it her personal mission to undermine Victoria's confidence. To make matters worse, Jennifer exhibited a knack for ingratiating herself with their mutual friends and colleagues, leaving Victoria feeling isolated and alienated from her own social circle. This had been going on for months, and Victoria was at her wit's end trying to salvage her self-esteem and make sense of why Jennifer was so hell-bent on eroding her spirit. One prominent issue was Jennifer's incessant need to engage in one-upmanship. If Victoria achieved something she was proud of, Jennifer would counter with an even greater accomplishment of her own, never failing to point out how insignificant Victoria's achievements were in comparison. For instance, when Victoria earned a promotion at work, Jennifer \\"congratulated\\" her through a text message, casually mentioning that she had received two promotions in the past year, making it painfully clear that Victoria's success paled in comparison to her own. Another trait that irked Victoria was Jennifer's habitual interruption of conversations. Whenever Victoria tried to share her thoughts or feelings, Jennifer would dive in without allowing her to finish a sentence, giving little validation to Victoria's input. This constant disregard for Victoria's perspective exacerbated the already strained relationship and fueled Victoria's frustration with Jennifer's egocentric persona. Jennifer was also notorious for her thinly veiled, passive-aggressive comments. She delivered these remarks, known as 'backhanded compliments,' with a condescending smile that made Victoria's blood boil. Despite this infuriating behavior, Victoria constantly found herself second-guessing her own interpretation of Jennifer's intentions, questioning whether Jennifer truly meant any harm or if perhaps Victoria was just overreacting. One unforgettable incident was when Victoria excitedly shared her designs for an upcoming project at their weekly work meeting. Jennifer smiled sweetly and said, \\"That's such an interesting concept, Victoria. I wouldn't have thought to do it that way—simple yet kinda quirky.\\" It was clear to everyone but Victoria that Jennifer was undermining her ideas in front of their colleagues, masking her subtle jab as a compliment. As time went on, Victoria found herself growing increasingly tired and disheartened by Jennifer's antics. While she attempted to confide in her friends about her feelings, Jennifer had already cemented herself as the group favorite, making it difficult for others to sympathize with Victoria's plight. Furthermore, Jennifer’s charm made it almost impossible for others to recognize her snide comments or dismissive behavior for what they truly were: manipulative power plays. In order to regain her peace of mind and self-confidence, Victoria made a conscious effort to build a support system outside of her shared social circle with Jennifer. She sought out new friendships, hobbies, and interests that were separate from Jennifer's life. By doing so, she began to rediscover her sense of self-worth, which empowered her to confront Jennifer and gradually limit her presence in her life. Ultimately, Victoria realized that she had the power to rise above Jennifer's pettiness and negativity, allowing her to cultivate relationships built on mutual respect and understanding. This newfound strength and perspective served as a reminder that she deserved more than to be surrounded by those who sought to belittle and undermine her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As their bond deepens, Gomathi teaches Sundharam some classical dance moves, and in return, he shows Gomathi his father's silk saree shop, where they develop a profound connection over the intricacies of the traditional fabric designs.  However, their growing love faces a series of challenges. Gomathi's parents strongly disapprove of the relationship, as they believe that Sundharam's modest background and lack of artistic talent make him an unsuitable match for their daughter.

Simultaneously, Gomathi decides to stand up to her parents and assert her love for Sundharam. She visits his family's silk saree shop and learns in-depth about the art of weaving sarees, gaining an appreciation for the skill and commitment it takes. Gomathi then applies her artistic talent by designing a beautiful and unique classical dance costume using Sundharam's family sarees. Together, Sundharam and Gomathi prove to their respective families that love knows no boundaries, and that art and tradition can thrive and blend when joining hearts that are truly meant for each other. Impressed by Sundharam's resolve and Gomathi's immense talent blossoming in the light of their love, both families come to appreciate and accept their relationship.

Here is one sentence: He encountered a general feeling of resistance from many citizens. Here is another sentence: These trees are widely planted because of their resistance to salt and smog. Does the term resistance mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"No, the term \\"resistance\\" does not carry the same meaning in both these sentences. In each sentence, the word \\"resistance\\" takes on different connotations relative to the context in which it is used. To better understand, let us break down the meaning of \\"resistance\\" in both cases. In the first sentence, \\"He encountered a general feeling of resistance from many citizens,\\" the term \\"resistance\\" refers to the opposition or reluctance of people to accept, agree with, or follow a particular idea, course of action, or change. The citizens in this context may object to a proposed policy, decision, or adjustment, demonstrating their disapproval or disagreement. This kind of resistance can manifest in various forms, including protests, strikes, or vocal dissatisfaction. In the second sentence, \\"These trees are widely planted because of their resistance to salt and smog,\\" the term \\"resistance\\" signifies resilience or the ability to withstand and not be negatively affected by specific environmental factors or conditions. In this case, the trees possess a natural capacity to tolerate high levels of salt and smog exposure, allowing them to thrive in such environments where other species may fail to do so. The concept of resistance in this context is primarily tied to the trees' biological and ecological characteristics. In conclusion, the word \\"resistance\\" carries distinct meanings in the sentences provided. In the first instance, it pertains to opposition against a particular idea, change, or course of action expressed by citizens. Conversely, it refers to the ability of trees to withstand harsh environmental factors such as salt and smog in the second sentence. These nuanced differences highlight the importance of understanding the context in which the term is being used to grasp its intended meaning accurately."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands 150,000 to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the \\"demon in the sky\\". Six years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival Scott Crossfield repeatedly break the other's speed records. They often visit the Happy Bottom Riding Club run by Pancho Barnes, who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either \\"prime\\" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer \\"pudknockers\\" who only dream about it.

Police, Ferentz probe incident at bar By MEGAN MANFULL and TOM WITOSKY Register Staff Writer 09/28/2001  Iowa City, Ia. - A criminal investigation is under way into an alleged assault that involves at least one member of the Iowa football team. Tom Widmer, an Iowa City police captain, said Wednesday that the investigation began early Sunday morning after police responded to a call from a bar named Etc. The tavern is located in the downtown Iowa City pedestrian mall. \\"It is an active investigation,\\" Widmer said. Widmer said police received the call about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. He declined to identify any suspects. Ryan Rooney, a manager at Etc., said at least one assailant was a member of the Iowa football team. He would not identify the player or say if more than one player was involved. Rooney said one of his bartenders sustained a concussion from the assault and required medical attention. \\"It was more of a jumping than a fight,\\" he said. Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said Thursday morning he was looking into the matter. He said he was told of the incident Wednesday evening. \\"I'm fuzzy on the details right now,\\" Ferentz said. \\"A player told a coach about something that took place, and then they told me.

(Rating: 21 by The Film Snob.) (See our blog What-To-See-Next for details on our rating system.) Here's a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the on-screen tedium.  You'll not be wringing your hands, nor rolling your eyes, nor sighing into your popcorn. No indeed. For a movie of *this* averagousity, only clawing at your own face will do.  When you begin to claw your own face -- as begin you must! -- start in at the lower portion. You'll need your upper portion, with its handy tear ducts, intact for the Truly Tear-jerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you haven't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then.  In a season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as A Thing that anyone could create. *Watching* it, however, is a much more dangerous undertaking.  Here's our story...  Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourth-tier celebrity/entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a phone call from New York City, in the USA. The publisher of Sharp's magazine, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says \\"Come work for me!\\" With his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartment/office in the background, saying \\"Yes\\" is a no-brainer. Soon Sidney is at work in New York City, doing allllllll the wrong things. His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are (1) Jewish, and (2) gay.  He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the industry's hottest movie star, when she leaves it in the magazine's offices during a business luncheon. This is a spot of bad luck for everyone, for, among other things, Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes, before he wakes up to the Dunst character. Worst of all, he totally alienates Alison Olsen (played by winsome scripting-confusion by Kristen Dunst), a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine *and* The Big Apple. (We have, of course, been to a movie before, and so we know how this relationship is going to end up. This is therefore why we'll need intact tear ducts for the movie's third act.) The problem with The Thing is, the script just never jells, excepting for the one tear-duct set piece in which True Love prevails. Publisher Harding is supposed to be a son-of-a-bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over. The script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy, however, and Bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze. Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young, but whenever he comes up to her (as he does constantly) she makes a point of engaging him in conversation, instead of attempting to discourage his existence. The \\"comedy\\" of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room, and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception. The hot starlet Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is \\"wounded.\\" The character never shows us *why* he is wounded, however. This is yet another resultant of the movie's mortally wounded script. At one hours and fifty minutes, This Thing feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. It is uninspiring, unfunny, unredeemable, and not even rentable. Run Away Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative.

When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating.

Scroll down to see the video. Remember me? Emily Ratajkowski, the model star of Robin Thicke's number 1 hit is back as the star of this month's GQ. While the 21-year-old model left her pants on for Robin Thicke's video, she has dared to bare all for the iconic men's magazine. In one of the shots that we can publish the London-born model can be seen carrying a bunch of balloons and concealing her modesty with just one arm. In another she poses in a giant. cocktail glass in a revealing pair of black underwear with a bottle of. champagne and sky-high stilettos.

She has starred in campaigns for the likes of Forever 21, Nordstrom, and various swimwear and lingerie clients. Her big break came when she was shot. by industry legend Tony Duran. After that, she began to be recognised as. a fashion model and shot more and more fashion editorials, including. gracing the cover of GQ Turkey. Sultry: The London-born model now resides in America and also works as an actress. But she really caught the world's attention as the star of Thicke's video, which was released in. March. The uncensored version was released a few days later and garnered more than 1 million views in days before being banned by YouTube. Thicke said in an interview that he had sought the approval of his wife, actress Paula Patton, to shoot with nude models. 'Obviously if she didn't like it, I wouldn't put it out,' he said. The 36-year-old singer said director Diane Martel came up with the idea of using nude models. 'As long as it's fun and the girls are comfortable, let's do something silly,' Thicke said. 'Let's take some chances.' And it looks like taking a chance certainly paid off for Emily. In bed with Robin: The clip features Emily topless in bed.

In late April, the artist posted a twitpic of the track listing for the new album. She also commented that at the time she was \\"open to suggestions\\" regarding the album's title. Two weeks later, a blog posting on her record label's official website revealed that the album would be entitled ///Y/, the punctuation marks spelling Maya, M.I.A.'s own forename. The title follows on from previous albums named after her father (2005's Arular) and mother (2007's Kala). Some reviewers used the stylised title while others did not. M.I.A.'s official Myspace page uses both titles. The album was released in conventional physical and digital formats and as an iTunes LP.The album's cover features the singer's face almost completely hidden by YouTube player bars. MTV's Kyle Anderson described the cover, which was previewed in June 2010, as \\"a typically busy, trippy, disorienting piece of art\\" and speculated that it might be \\"a statement about 21st century privacy\\". Additional art direction for the album was provided by Aaron Parsons. M.I.A. used her mother's Tamil phonebook to find a wedding photographer to provide images for the album. Photographers for the album were Ravi Thiagaraja, M.I.A. and Jamie Martinez. Elements of the artwork had previously been used in one of a series of billboard images, all designed by musicians, which were projected onto landmarks in London by a guerrilla project called BillBored during the 2010 British general election.

Write a summary based on this article: Major League Baseball's new collective bargaining agreement will include blood testing for human growth hormone, sources confirmed to ESPN The Magazine's Buster Olney.      A report in the New York Times, citing two league sources familiar with the deal, said testing would begin in February during spring training. According to the sources, the penalty for a positive HGH test will be the same as a positive steroid test -- a 50-game suspension.      MLB would become the first major professional sports league in North America to test for HGH. The NFL agreed upon on HGH testing in its latest CBA, but has yet to implement it.      MLB already conducts random testing for HGH in the minor leagues, a program it began last year.      Baseball's new labor contract also will include a rise in the minimum salary to 480,000 and luxury taxes on both amateur draft signings and international free agents coming to the major leagues.      There also will be a slight increase in the total of players eligible for salary arbitration after the 2012 season, when there also will be a new method to determine compensation for clubs losing top major league free agents. There also will be modifications to the luxury tax on high-payroll teams, but the threshold will remain at 178 million next year.      Sources told ESPN.com's Jayson Stark that MLB's labor negotiators have reached a \\"handshake agreement\\" on all major issues, and the sport's new five-year collective bargaining agreement is likely to be announced Tuesday.      The new labor deal will run through the 2016 season, meaning it will ensure two full decades of continuous labor peace for the first time since the formation of the Major League Baseball Players Association in the 1960s.      The changes would be the most numerous since the 1997 agreement that came nearly two years after a 7½-month strike that wiped out the 1994 World Series. The five-year deal, replacing one set to expire Dec. 11, ensures 21 consecutive years of labor peace for MLB at a time when the NBA season is being threatened by a lockout that already has wiped out a quarter of the regular season.      As part of the deal, baseball's minimum salary will go from 414,000 this year to 480,000 in 2012 and 500,000 later in the deal -- matching what the average salary was in 1989.      Owners gained one of their chief objectives: a restraint on the bonuses paid to amateur free agents, both those entering professional baseball from high schools and colleges and those coming to MLB organizations from abroad.      A tax of 75 percent to 100 percent will be imposed on the amount a team exceeds a threshold, and teams exceeding the threshold by higher amounts could lose first- and second-round draft picks.      For international free agents, such as players from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, there will be a separate threshold and tax with penalties, and there will be a study committee that could put a new system in place later during the agreement.      After the 2012 season, about five to six additional major leaguers will become eligible for salary arbitration each year. The group of players with at least two but less than three years of major league service lost the right to arbitration in the 1985 agreement, but players regained it for the top 17 percent of 2-3-year players by service time in the 1990 deal. That will rise to 22 percent following the 2012 season.      For this offseason, the number of Type A free agents, requiring the highest draft-pick compensation from the team signing a player, will be cut from 21 as part of a one-year deal bridging the way to a new system. There will be no change for the most-prized free agents, such as Albert Pujols and Prince Fielder.      Starting next year, teams will have to make a \\"qualifying offer\\" of a one-year guaranteed contract to their players eligible to become free agents in order to receive compensation if the player signs with another club. That amount will be at least 12.4 million and could rise by next year, depending on a formula. The new \\"qualifying offer\\" does away with the statistical formula for ranking free agents that has existed since the 1981 strike settlement.      In addition, there are modifications to baseball's revenue-sharing formula and to its benefit plan. Players and owners did not agree to a tax on low-payroll teams, although they did have some discussion during negotiations.      The sides have essentially been in agreement on most significant issues for several days. But following this week's owners meetings, they met outside Chicago on Thursday evening to settle on the specifics on a number of matters that had needed to be resolved before the agreement could be put in writing. That session concluded early Friday.      Commissioner Bud Selig already has announced the move of the Houston Astros to the American League. That will pave the way for realignment of the sport into two 15-team leagues, adding a second wild-card playoff team in each league and spreading interleague play throughout all six months of the regular season.      But this agreement also will lead to significant changes to the schedule, free agency, the draft, the signing of international players, revenue sharing and the so-called \\"competitive balance tax.\\"      And the addition of two more wild-card teams likely won't be the only significant change to baseball's postseason structure. A source told Olney that a past rule that teams in the same division can't play in the Division Series round likely will not be part of the new agreement.      Information from ESPN The Magazine's Buster Olney, ESPN.com's Jayson Stark and The Associated Press was used in this report. ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Major League Baseball’s owners and players are on the verge of completing a new labor deal that for the first time will include blood testing for human growth hormone, according to two people in baseball briefed on the matter. The testing will be a significant step for baseball, allowing it to move ahead of other professional sports leagues, including the N.F.L., in confronting the troublesome issue of a drug that has long evaded detection.                              The bargaining agreement, which is expected to be announced early this week, calls for blood testing to begin in February, when players report to spring training. Players who test positive will face a 50-game suspension, which will be the same as the first-time penalty for a positive steroid test, according to the two people.      Although minor elements of the overall agreement still need to be completed, the two people said that a full understanding on H.G.H. testing had been reached and that no further negotiations on that issue were needed.      As such, baseball will be the first of the major North American professional sports to do any type of blood testing for drugs at a league’s highest level. In 2010, baseball introduced H.G.H. blood testing for minor league players because the step could be taken without the consent of the major league players union.      Photo      Commissioner Bud Selig, who is sensitive about his legacy and the longstanding criticism that he was too slow to react to the use of performance-enhancing drugs in his sport, will now be able to cite the H.G.H. testing in stressing how seriously baseball treats the issue of drug use. And without mentioning the N.F.L. by name, he will be able to take satisfaction in accomplishing what football has been unable to do.      Last summer, the N.F.L. and its union reached an agreement on a new labor contract that included blood testing for human growth hormone, leaving the details of the testing to be worked out after the deal was ratified. But the players have since refused to sign off on the testing, citing various reservations.      Members of Congress have become involved in the stalemate, but the N.F.L. players union continues to raise questions about the testing, in particular expressing concerns that the natural level of H.G.H. in football players might be higher than that of the general population and that too many players would unfairly test positive as a result.      The two people with knowledge of baseball’s labor agreement said they were confident that this pattern of last-minute objections would not arise in their sport.      H.G.H. is believed to boost lean muscle mass, aid in recovery and improve stamina, but it is illegal to possess in the United States without a prescription. Although there is no urine test for H.G.H., Olympic athletes have been blood-tested for the substance for nearly a decade. Within baseball, however, there was skepticism about the test, with some critics pointing to the fact that it was not producing any positives. Meanwhile, evidence emerged that the substance was indeed being used in the sport.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In 2007, an investigation into a ring of pharmacies and doctors in Florida led to disclosures that tied numerous players to H.G.H. And at the end of 2007, George J. Mitchell, at the behest of Selig, produced a report on drug use in baseball that linked a number of players — including Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens — to the substance.      Sentiment in baseball began to change in 2010, when a professional rugby player in England was suspended for testing positive for H.G.H. It was proof that at least some were seeking.      Selig embraced the development and several months later started the blood tests at the minor league level. This year, first baseman Mike Jacobs, who had played in the major leagues for a number of seasons, became the first minor league player to test positive for the substance.      Although H.G.H. testing may be the most notable element of the new bargaining agreement, there were other issues the two sides had to wrestle with as they moved toward a deal that will last for five seasons and will guarantee two decades of peace in a sport that endured numerous work stoppages before that.      In particular, baseball wanted a tougher financial slotting system for draft picks to better control what teams now spend on players coming out of high school and college. In the end, the sides agreed on a luxury tax of sorts that would penalize teams that go over an overall threshold for money spent signing picks. In addition, the system of free-agent compensation, in which teams surrender first-round picks in exchange for signing a Type A player, is being eased and there will be changes to the system that governs the signing of players from outside the country.      But perhaps most significant for Selig and everyone else in the sport is that an overall agreement is within reach without public rancor in a year in which the N.F.L. went through a protracted lockout and the N.B.A. is in a labor standoff that could cost it the 2011-12 season. And that the agreement will have a drug-testing clause that will put baseball ahead of other sports. |||||","output":"Major League Baseball (MLB) is set to introduce blood testing for human growth hormone (HGH) as part of its new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Sources confirmed to ESPN The Magazine that testing will begin in February during spring training, making MLB the first major professional sports league in North America to test for HGH. The penalty for a positive HGH test will be the same as a positive steroid test – a 50-game suspension. MLB already conducts random testing for HGH in the minor leagues, and the new labor contract will also include a rise in the minimum salary to 480,000, luxury taxes on both amateur draft signings and international free agents coming to the major leagues, and other modifications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

LIBERTARIAN/ANARCHO-CAPITALISM: You have two cows.","output":"To rate these two sentences' similarity, we must first understand the meaning and context underlying each statement. PURE COMMUNISM refers to a hypothetical society where people collectively own and manage resources, property, and the means of production. In a purely communist society, wealth, goods, and services would be distributed based on individual need, and there would be no private ownership. In the context of the sentence: \\"PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows,\\" it could imply a scenario where you, as an individual, do not own the cows. The cows represent a common resource shared with others, and no one person would have exclusive claims to the cows or their products. LIBERTARIAN/ANARCHO-CAPITALISM refers to a political philosophy that advocates for minimal or no government intervention in the economy and civil affairs. Proponents of these ideologies argue for private property rights, free markets, and voluntary associations in lieu of a centralized government. In the context of the sentence: \\"LIBERTARIAN/ANARCHO-CAPITALISM: You have two cows,\\" it could imply that you, as an individual, own the two cows with exclusive rights over them. In this system, you can decide what to do with the cows, their products, and with the profits derived from them without government interference. To rate the similarity between these two sentences: - Both sentences involve the same object: two cows. - Each sentence refers to different ideologies in terms of how property and resources are managed. Given these factors, I would rate the similarity of the two sentences at a 2 out of 5. Although they refer to the same objects, the underlying ideologies suggest different interpretations of ownership and resource management.

Context: Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a recognizable facial phenotype in addition to moderate to severe cognitive disability with severe speech impairment and variable multiple congenital anomalies. The anomalies may include Hirschsprung disease, heart defects, structural eye anomalies including microphthalmia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and urogenital anomalies. Microcephaly, seizure disorder and constipation are common. All typical cases result from haploinsufficiency of the ZEB2 (also known as ZFHX1B or SIP-1) gene, with over 100 distinct mutations now described. Approximately 80% of patients have a nonsense or frameshift mutation detectable by sequencing, with the rest having gross deletions necessitating a dosage sensitive assay. Here we report on the results of comprehensive molecular testing for 27 patients testing positive for MWS. Twenty-one patients had a nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutation identified by sequencing; 14 of which localized to exon 8 and 17 of which are novel. Six patients had deletions in the ZEB2 gene, including two novel partial gene deletions. This report, the first such analysis in North American patients, adds to the growing list of both novel pathogenic mutations associated with MWS, as well as other variants in the ZEB2 gene. In addition, we suggest an economical testing strategy.   Question: Which gene is responsible for the development of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?

The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second.

The APEX system is indeed used to represent the different variables related to photographic exposure, like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. However, to answer the specific question, \\"What is the effective f-number proportional to?\\" we need to dive deeper into the concept of the f-number in photography. The effective f-number, commonly referred to as \\"f-stop\\" or \\"focal ratio,\\" is a dimensionless number that indicates the relative aperture size of a camera lens. The f-number is the ratio of the lens's focal length (the distance between the lens and the image sensor) to the diameter of the aperture. Mathematically, it is expressed as: N = f / D where N is the f-number, f is the lens's focal length, and D is the aperture diameter. The f-number is critical in photography as it helps determine the amount of light entering the camera and, consequently, the exposure of the photograph. A smaller f-number (indicating a larger aperture) allows more light to enter the camera, resulting in a brighter image; a larger f-number (indicating a smaller aperture) reduces the light entering the camera, resulting in a darker image. Now, let's address the proportionality aspect of the question. The effective f-number is proportional to the inverse square root of the lens's entrance pupil area. The entrance pupil area is the effective aperture area as seen through the front of the lens, which affects the exposure. This relationship can be written as: N ~ 1 / sqrt(A) where N is the f-number, A is the entrance pupil area, and ~ denotes \\"proportional to.\\" It is important to note that the f-number also affects the depth of field (DOF) in a photograph. A smaller f-number (wider aperture) results in a shallow DOF, making the subject in focus while the background is blurry. A larger f-number (smaller aperture) increases the DOF, allowing more objects in the scene to be in focus. In summary, the original statement does not directly provide the correct answer to the question, \\"What is the effective f-number proportional to?\\" The effective f-number is proportional to the inverse square root of the lens's entrance pupil area, which influences the exposure and depth of field in a photograph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again.

Article:","output":"Title: Anonymous Strikes Back: The Hacking Saga Continues Subtitle: In retaliation to the recent persecution of hackers, the activist group 'Anonymous' targets the US Government, breaching personal data of over 104,000 individuals. The activist hacker group, Anonymous, has taken a bold step in retaliation against the government's continuous persecution of computer hackers, such as Lauri Love and Aaron Swartz. Both individuals were famously targeted by the US government for their hacking initiatives, sparking an ongoing debate regarding computer privacy, civil liberties, and security. Anonymous has now turned its attention to the US government itself, hitting back by infiltrating and stealing the personal data of more than 104,000 employees, contractors, family members, and affiliates of various government sectors, including the Department of Energy, US Army, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The staggering number of affected individuals suggests that this cyber attack could have vast implications for the government and perhaps several other key agencies. Anonymous exploited a flaw in Adobe System Inc's software, allowing them access to classified information, potentially resulting in severe security breaches and irreparable damages. The incident has raised eyebrows in the government, as key officials express their concerns about the scale of the attack and the possible ramifications of the stolen information. Among the details obtained during the breach were banking information and financial records of the targeted individuals. This raises a major cause for concern, as there is potential for widespread attempts at theft and fraud, in addition to the severe breach of privacy. As retaliation measures continue and the scale of the infiltration grows larger, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the government's ongoing crackdown on hackers is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it displays a proactive approach to safeguarding national security and attempting to prevent further instances of cybercrime. However, it also provides an incentive for hacktivist groups, like Anonymous, to strike back and make even bolder moves in the digital warzone. This most recent attack is a glaring reminder that the cybersecurity landscape is continually evolving and that no individual or organization is truly impervious to such threats. Hackers, like Anonymous, are motivated by their ideologies, often focusing on targeting governments and exposing what they perceive as institutionalized corruption and injustice. The government's response to this most recent infiltration will be crucial in determining its future effectiveness in combatting the growing threat of cyberattacks. As Anonymous maintains its momentum, it is unclear what measures the government will take to protect itself against such breaches, as well as ensuring the continued security of its employees and citizens. The lines between activism and cyber-terrorism become increasingly blurred, leaving the government with a difficult decision to make: to what extent will they go to quell the ever-present threat of hacktivism? And will their efforts ultimately be sufficient in ensuring national security, while maintaining the delicate balance of civil liberties and privacy rights? Only time will tell, but as the digital landscape continues to evolve and the struggle between hackers and governments intensifies, it is certain that the outcome will shape the future of cybersecurity and the ongoing battle for privacy and freedom in the digital age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Fact 1: All chemical reactions require activation energy to get started.  Fact 2: Chemical changes are a result of chemical reactions.  Given the two facts above, what is required before a chemical change? A:","output":"A catalyst B: A barrier C: Activation energy D: A medium To answer the question, let's consider the provided facts step-by-step and link them to the answer options: Fact 1: All chemical reactions require activation energy to get started. This fact tells us that activation energy is necessary for chemical reactions to occur. Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy needed for a reaction to take place. Fact 2: Chemical changes are a result of chemical reactions. This fact connects chemical changes to chemical reactions. Since chemical reactions lead to chemical changes, the requirements for a chemical reaction must also be required for a chemical change. Now, we can look at the answer options and choose the one that meets the requirements for a chemical reaction and chemical change based on the given facts: A: A catalyst - Although a catalyst can speed up a chemical reaction, it is not a requirement for starting a chemical change. B: A barrier - A barrier has no direct relevance to initiating a chemical reaction or change. C: Activation energy - As mentioned in Fact 1, activation energy is required to initiate a chemical reaction. Since chemical changes are a result of chemical reactions, this choice aligns with the requirements given in the facts. D: A medium - A medium may provide an environment for a reaction to occur, but it is not a fundamental requirement for the reaction or change to happen. Based on the analysis of the facts and answer options, the correct answer is: C: Activation energy"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'll teach you how to bake a potato in the microwave. Just follow these easy steps: 1. Wash your potato: Ask an adult to help you wash the potato using water so it's nice and clean. 2. Poke holes: With your grown-up's help, use a fork to poke some holes in the potato. This helps steam escape, and the potato won't go \\"boom\\" in the microwave! 3. Put the potato on a microwave-safe plate: Ask your grown-up to place the clean potato onto a plate that's safe for the microwave. 4. Cook the potato: Have the adult put the plate with the potato in the middle of the microwave. Then close the door, set the microwave to cook for about 5 minutes, and press start. 5. Flip the potato: After the five minutes, tell your grown-up to wear oven mitts to carefully turn over the potato. Then cook it for another 3-5 minutes, depending on how big the potato is. 6. Check if it's done: When the microwave timer goes \\"beep,\\" ask the adult to use the fork to poke the potato again. If it's soft and easy to poke, your potato is ready! If not, cook it for 1-2 more minutes. 7. Cool down and enjoy: Once the potato is cooked, have your grown-up put the plate on the counter and let it cool down for a few minutes.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

Q:You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Trying to keep up with the times... Product review: Compairing this album to other bands that are coming out today this is a good record. But by Metallica standards this album is horrible. The band has lost there golden touch. The druming has an over-bearing feel and it seems to be mis-directed. The bass lines, are hard to make out. I don't however think that James Headfield's voice is still going fine, I saw them live in July and he sounded better than ever. I also can understand why there aren't any guitar solo's - because they want to be more current with the music today. While listening to this record you can tell that Metallica is trying to fit in with the new-style bands that don't usually do flashy guitar stuff.I think we all want our old Metallica back... this band needs to realize that they can't just stop and try to become more modern in there outlook they have to keep the formula that made them great... this album is sad. A:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product for several reasons.  Firstly, the reviewer compares the album to other current bands and mentions that, although the record may be good by today's standards, it is disappointing compared to Metallica's past works. This indicates that the album may not have met the reviewer's expectations, and long-time fans of the band could be similarly disappointed. Secondly, the reviewer points out specific technical aspects that they find to be problematic, such as the overpowering drums, indiscernible bass lines, and the absence of guitar solos. These criticisms suggest that the sound of the album may be lacking or not up to par with Metallica's previous works. If these elements of the album matter significantly to potential buyers, the review may discourage them from purchasing the product. On a positive note, the reviewer does mention that James Hetfield's voice is still good, which is a favorable aspect. However, they attribute the absence of guitar solos to the band’s desire to conform to the contemporary music scene, which might be perceived as a negative by those who appreciate Metallica's traditional sound. The reviewer's longing for the \\"old Metallica\\" back, along with their belief that the album is a sad attempt by the band to modernize, suggests the album has not maintained the essence that made the band great in the past. In conclusion, the review is more negative than positive, which will likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product. While there might be a few appealing aspects of the album, such as James Hetfield's vocal performance, the overall sentiment expressed by the reviewer is of disappointment and the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones. Potential buyers who value Metallica's classic sound and style may be discouraged from buying the album based on this review, as the band appears to deviate from what made them popular in the first place."},{"instruction":"Combine facts and answer this: Kārte Seh is a neighbouhood of an Afghan city with approximately how many people?","output":"I cannot combine the facts and answer the question without knowing the population of Kārte Seh neighborhood.

Answer:","output":"The prestigious Palme d'Or award at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival was won by Chinese filmmaker Chen Kaige. Born on August 12, 1952, Chen Kaige is one of the key figures in China's fifth generation of filmmakers and has earned international acclaim for his works. The film that brought home the Palme d'Or was his masterpiece \\"Farewell My Concubine\\" (Chinese: 霸王别姬). This epic Chinese drama was adapted from the novel of the same name by Lilian Lee (Li Pik-Wah). The powerful narrative of the film covers a period of 53 years and explores the turbulent lives of two male Peking Opera performers. The story uniquely presents the changes and political upheavals in China from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the events of the Cultural Revolution. \\"Farewell My Concubine\\" was the first Chinese film to ever receive this prestigious award, an honor it shared with Jane Campion's \\"The Piano,\\" as both films were declared joint winners at the 46th Cannes Film Festival. Chen Kaige's film not only received critical acclaim but also achieved commercial success worldwide. Since then, it has become a cultural phenomenon and one of the most significant Chinese films of all time. Tonya Suzanne Holly, on the other hand, is an American film producer, writer, and director who gained prominence in the early 2000s. Although she was not involved in the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, she has contributed to the independent film industry by producing and contributing to socially relevant films such as \\"When I Find the Ocean,\\" \\"The Mirror,\\" and \\"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde.\\" In conclusion, the Palme d'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival was awarded to Chen Kaige for his groundbreaking film \\"Farewell My Concubine,\\" which marked an important milestone in the history of Chinese cinema and brought international recognition to its creator."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: 1st Marathon Product review: I'm 58 yrs old and training for my first Marathon.

He had been suffering from dementia and died peacefully at his home on Saturday aged 87, his family said. The peer had been accused of 22 counts of historical sex offences against boys - allegations his family denied. A \\"trial of the facts\\" set for April will no longer take place. A lawyer representing alleged victims said they had been denied justice. Liz Dux, who represents six alleged victims, said: \\"This is devastating news for my clients. They have waited so long to see this case come before the courts, to be denied justice at the final hurdle is deeply frustrating.\\" The Goddard inquiry, which is examining child sexual abuse claims, may now examine the allegations, the BBC's Tom Symonds said. It had set aside the case while it was being dealt with in the courts. Lord Janner's  family said he would be \\"deeply missed\\" and requested their mourning be respected. They had previously said he was a man of \\"great integrity\\" and \\"entirely innocent of any wrongdoing\\". Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who led calls for Lord Janner to face justice, said: \\"Obviously it is very sad for Lord Janner's family that he has passed away, though it is also extremely sad for his alleged victims.\\" He added: \\"It is disappointing that all the evidence is not now to be brought before a court. \\"It is a very sad day for justice.\\" By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Should a man with what was described as \\"advanced and disabling dementia\\" face a trial over allegations of child sexual abuse spanning four decades? It is that question - and the conflicting answers offered to it - that places Lord Janner's death so prominently in the news. A High Court judge, just weeks ago, said his answer was no: there was little point in hauling a man who could barely recognise his own family in front of a jury, to answer for his alleged behaviour a generation ago. That was galling enough for his alleged victims. But they sought solace in the so-called \\"trial of the facts\\" due to begin in the spring. That will now not happen - leaving them devastated, and so many questions about Lord Janner's alleged behaviour permanently unaddressed. The peer had been on a leave of absence from the House of Lords since October 2014. He was accused of 15 counts of indecent assault and seven counts of a separate sexual offence against a total of nine alleged victims. The Old Bailey heard the allegations spanned the years 1963 to 1988. The judge who ruled that he was unfit to stand trial earlier this month said he made his decision based on four experts. \\"The defendant has advanced and disabling dementia that has deteriorated and is irreversible,\\" Justice Openshaw said at the time. Born in Cardiff, he was the grandson of eastern European Jews who fled to Britain. After being evacuated to Canada during the Second World War, he returned to Britain to complete his education before joining the Army. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1970, winning the seat of Leicester North West after his father's retirement from representing the seat. As a backbencher, he campaigned for Israeli and Jewish causes, as well as on consumer safety, women's equality and workers' rights. And in the 1980s, he helped to launch the Parliamentary War Crimes Commission, set up to report on ex-Nazis living in Britain. Sir Mick Davis, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, said: \\"The passing of Greville Janner marks the end of an era for the Jewish community. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Janner family at this most difficult time.\\" The Holocaust Educational Trust also paid tribute. Its chief executive, Karen Pollock, said: \\"In 1988 Greville Janner had the foresight to know we as a nation needed to know about and remember the Holocaust and so established the Holocaust Educational Trust. \\"Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"Lord Janner, a former British Labour MP who had been charged with historical child sex abuse offenses, passed away at the age of 87.

They just did not understand the power of a dream. He told her that if she truly wanted a scholarship and that nothing could stop her except one thing -- her own attitude. The next year, as she and her team went to the Northern California Championship game, she was offered a scholarship and on the college team.

The text defines the relationship between John Redcorn and Nancy Gribble, mentioning that they had been lovers for 14 years before their split, which indicates that John would understand the timeline of his affair with Nancy coinciding with Joseph's birth and conception. 3. The text describes Joseph and John's close resemblance as being \\"obvious to everyone else in the neighborhood,\\" which suggests that John Redcorn would notice this resemblance himself.

Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher that his wife was not under the influence of drugs that night.      Deputies had responded to the home earlier Wednesday night, at about 11:30 p.m., when Jacob Henderson called 911 asking for help with his wife. He called back and canceled the request, but deputies had already arrived and were told the couple was fine, the recordings indicate.      The second call reporting the children had been shot came at 2:24 a.m.      The children were taken to Dallas for autopsies.      The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County district attorney’s office are assisting in the investigation.      “The family has had previous contact with CPS in 2010 but not recently,” CPS spokeswoman Marissa Gonzales said Thursday in an email. “Details of those interactions are confidential.” ||||| Sarah Henderson has been charged with capital murder in the death of her two daughters. (Henderson County Sheriff’s Office)      The first EMS call came in at 11:29 p.m. Wednesday.      “I want to get somebody out here to check my wife out,” Jacob Henderson said, his voice calm and even. He didn’t think his wife was trying to commit suicide, he told the dispatcher, but she was “freaking out like somebody is out to get her.”      Seven minutes later, Henderson called again. His wife was “fine now,” and he wanted to cancel his earlier request for help.      Still, deputies from the Henderson County Sheriff’s Office came to Henderson’s home in Mabank, Tex., roughly 55 miles southeast of Dallas. It was the home he shared with his wife, Sarah Nicole Henderson, 29, and her daughters, ages 7 and 5.      “A male and female told the Deputies they were fine and no one was in danger or jeopardy,” read a news release from the Sheriff’s Office.      Henderson’s next call came in at 2:24 a.m. Thursday. Choking back tears, panting for breath, and at times wailing, Henderson told the 911 dispatcher that his wife had shot her children.      Jacob Henderson called 9-1-1 after his wife, Sarah Henderson, shot her 5-year-old and her 7-year-old in Mabank, Tex. on Nov. 2.

She kept trying to pry back the gun Jacob Henderson took away from her.      In the background of that distraught 911 call, Sarah Henderson can be heard asking: “Why did I do that, Jake?”      [Student charged after bragging about putting roommate’s toothbrush ‘where the sun doesn’t shine’]      He had fallen asleep and awakened to hear his wife say, “Jake, I shot the kids,” Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher. In his 911 call, Jacob Henderson alerted police to what they would find: The girls, reported to be 7-year-old Kaylee and 5-year-old Kenlie, had been shot in the head.      Recordings of Jacob Henderson’s EMS and 911 calls were released by the Sheriff’s Office on Friday.      County Sheriff Botie Hillhouse told The Washington Post that officials had yet to determine a motive in the killings. Hillhouse said officers had been dispatched to the house in 2015 for a “verbal disturbance,” but all they found was Sarah Henderson standing in her yard, arguing with someone over the phone.      “We hadn’t had much to do with her until Wednesday night and then again Thursday,” Hillhouse said.      CBS News reported that Texas Child Protective Services confirmed it had been in contact with the family six years ago, but other details were confidential.      Sarah Henderson has been charged with one count of capital murder, with another capital murder charge pending, officials said. She was arraigned Friday morning with bail set at 2 million and remains in jail under suicide watch. Hillhouse said the punishment for capital murder in Texas is life in prison or the death penalty.      The gruesome case took another dark turn Friday when investigators announced Sarah Henderson had planned for at least two weeks to kill her children, though authorities did not provide further details to support this claim. She had also intended to kill her husband, “but the entire crime did not go as planned,” a news release said. ABC News quoted Hillhouse as saying that the gun malfunctioned when Sarah Henderson tried to kill Jacob.      [Disney knew its property had alligators.

He added that Sarah Henderson has another son who lives with his father outside the county.      The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County District Attorney’s Office are assisting with the investigation. It was not clear if Sarah Henderson had obtained an attorney.      A neighbor, Jaylyne Palmer, told NBCDFW that she had never had a conversation with Sarah Henderson, but that the girls would ride their bikes through her driveway.      “They would draw pictures and put them in the mailbox for us,” Palmer said.

Summarize this article: Chisako Kakehi stands accused of killing three partners and attempting to murder a fourth. Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide. Her lawyers pleaded not guilty on her behalf, only for Ms Kakehi to seemingly admit killing her last partner. Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married. On Monday, she appeared to confirm she had killed him, saying she committed crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she had obtained the cyanide from a business associate. But on Wednesday she told the court: \\"I don't remember (what I said)\\", according to the Mainichi daily newspaper. Lawyers for Ms Kakehi had previously said her testimony could not be trusted, because she has mild dementia and \\"barely remembers things that happened recently\\". Investigations into the wealthy widow began after a post-mortem examination was carried out on her fourth husband, revealing traces of cyanide in his body. Ms Kakehi is on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, all aged between 70 and 80, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend - who later died of cancer - between 2007 and 2013. Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths. Some media have dubbed Ms Kakehi a \\"black widow\\" - a term derived from the female spider that eats its partner after mating. In April another Japanese woman, Kanae Kajima, who was convicted of killing three lovers, lost a final appeal against her death sentence at the Supreme Court.

Story highlights The early voting in the runoff left neither party feeling comfortable      The 36,000 early voters who didn't participate in the primary are among the major question marks      (CNN) More than 140,000 voters had cast their ballots by the time early voting in Georgia closed Friday -- another indication of sky-high turnout in the closely watched runoff for a House seat between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.      And that's leaving neither side confident of victory in what is likely to be a tight race for Georgia's 6th Congressional District seat.      The pool of early voters includes more than 36,000 who did not participate in the April primary contest for the seat, which was vacated when former Rep. Tom Price became President Donald Trump's health and human services secretary, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.      The early vote total soared past the 57,000 who voted early in the primary, where Ossoff reached 48%, just shy of the majority that would have avoided the runoff entirely. Ultimately, more than 192,000 people voted in the primary -- close to the 210,000 who participated in the 2014 midterm election in the district.      The early voting in the runoff left neither party feeling comfortable and has aides on both sides forecasting a close contest Tuesday -- even as Republicans celebrated turnout that is approaching presidential election levels in the conservative-leaning district.      Read More ||||| As the most expensive House race in history rushes toward the finish line Tuesday, the latest public polls are unanimous: The Georgia special election between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel is too close to call.      The race for the suburban Atlanta seat, closely watched for clues about the shape of the 2018 midterm elections, appears to be within a few percentage points — with perhaps the slightest edge to Ossoff, the 30-year-old Democrat seeking to wrest away a traditionally Republican seat in the first major election of Donald Trump’s presidency.      Story Continued Below      “It’s all well within the margin of error,” said Matthew Towery, whose firm, Opinion Savvy, released a poll last Friday conducted for Atlanta’s Fox affiliate showing Ossoff leading by a single point. “I’d say the preponderance of evidence suggests that Ossoff has a very, very slight lead. But it really is a coin flip right now.”      The tight polling has both parties — which have each made eight-figure investments in the race — expecting a nail-biter Tuesday night. The current state of play: Of the six public polls conducted in June, Ossoff leads in five of them — and hits the 50-percent mark in each of the five — with the fifth showing a tie.      But Ossoff’s lead is far from safe. Outside of an early June Atlanta Journal Constitution poll showing Ossoff ahead by 7 points, the Democrat’s lead is within the margin of error in each of the polls showing him ahead.      Here are five questions about the latest polls — and what they tell us about the eventual outcome in Tuesday's vote:      Are the polls correctly picking up early voting?      In-person early voting concluded last week, and about 140,000 votes have already been cast — that’s more than 70 percent of the 193,000 total votes tallied in the 18-candidate April vote that led to the upcoming runoff.      During early voting for the April race, Ossoff was the only serious Democratic candidate, which allowed him to bank a large share of the early vote. GOP voters, on the other hand, mostly waited through election night as Handel and three other competitive Republican candidates slugged it out.      But now it’s down to just two candidates — Ossoff and Handel. And while polls and the profile of the early-voting electorate both suggest Ossoff is banking more votes, Handel is more competitive than in the first round of voting, when she was one of many Republicans running.

Ossoff has a 15-point lead among self-described early voters in the Opinion Savvy poll, a 13-point lead in a poll from The Trafalgar Group, a 14-point lead in a SurveyUSA poll conducted for WXIA-TV in Atlanta and a 9-point lead in a WSB-TV/Landmark Communications poll . Then there is the Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, the only live-caller poll, where Ossoff led by 31 points among early voters.      The huge early vote raises another issue: Are the candidates drawing out new voters, or are they merely cannibalizing voters who would have cast their ballots on Election Day?      “I do see a higher participation from Handel voters in the early voting and see that gap getting a little tighter,” said Robert Cahaly, a senior strategist at The Trafalgar Group, the Atlanta-based firm that found Ossoff with a 3-point lead in a poll last week. “The question is: Does it come at the cost of votes on Election Day?”      Can Ossoff’s ground game change the electorate — and can the polls pick up those changes?      Ossoff may be a first-time candidate running in what has been a reliable GOP district, but he’s managed to raise more campaign cash for a single race than any other congressional hopeful in history: 23.6 million as of May 31, a figure that will likely swell by millions before next Tuesday’s election.      While television advertising still dominated most candidates’ campaign budgets, Ossoff is pouring millions into an unprecedented ground game to turn out new voters and those who haven’t voted in nonpresidential elections previously.      That scrambles the calculus for pollsters, who usually rely on past performance to determine whom they call and who comprises their surveys. In a typical special election, pollsters can rely on data from past midterm and off-year races to establish a likely electorate.      “I like to joke that Ossoff has spent enough money that he could pay Uber to give every single voter a ride to the polls,” Cahaly said. “You can’t duplicate that effort on a national level.”      Will younger voters show up?      This is the most practical — and perhaps most important — question about Ossoff’s ground game: Can he turn support among younger residents of the district into votes?      Turnout among young voters always slumps outside presidential races, but it’s critical for Ossoff. In the Opinion Savvy poll, Ossoff has an astounding, 62-point lead over Handel among voters younger than 30 years of age, 81 percent to 19 percent. But Handel leads by 25 points among seniors — who are typically more reliable voters in off-year races — 62 percent to 37 percent.      While the Opinion Savvy poll shows a more dramatic break among voters by age, it’s still consistent with the general pattern of the race, where younger voters prefer Ossoff. But young voters’ levels of support and turnout weren’t enough to help Ossoff win a majority of the vote in April and avoid the runoff altogether; he finished with 48.1 percent of the vote.      “All the [demographics] will look almost exactly the same as the first round,” Opinion Savvy’s Towery predicted. “He’s performing well with younger voters; she’s performing well with older voters.”      Will GOP voters skeptical of Trump stick with Handel?      When Trump plucked four House members to join his administration, he did so carefully: Each of the four won reelection last year by at least 16 percentage points. Tom Price, the Republican congressman who resigned the Georgia seat to become secretary of Health and Human Services, won by more than 23 points.      But even as Price cruised to reelection, there were signs of trouble for the GOP in the traditionally affluent, Republican suburbs that make up much of the district. Trump carried the seat only narrowly over Hillary Clinton, 48 percent to 47 percent. (Compare that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won the district by a 23-point margin, similar to Price last year.)      Any path to victory for Ossoff has always centered around winning those Clinton-Price voters: traditional Republicans repelled by Trump’s contentious persona and policies. The Opinion Savvy poll shows Ossoff winning 97 percent of voters who “strongly disapprove” of Trump’s job performance — a group that makes up 44 percent of the sample. But he’s only winning 49 percent of those who “somewhat disapprove” of Trump, compared to 39 percent for Handel.      Handel needs to win only a small percentage of the voters aligned against the president. Overall, voters in the district are divided on Trump: Half approve, and half disapprove. Handel is winning roughly 92 percent of voters who approve of Trump’s job performance, the Opinion Savvy poll shows.      What about late-breaking voters?      Voters in Georgia’s 6th District have been inundated with door knocks, telephone calls and television advertisements — the last of which can been seen throughout Metro Atlanta.      The polls reflect this: There are few undecided voters left.      But just because few voters tell pollsters they haven’t made up their minds doesn’t mean they can’t change their minds. And Cahaly, the Trafalgar Group pollster, says he thinks Handel has been gaining in recent weeks.      “What I saw is momentum on her part. I saw her growing strength,” Cahaly said. “I believe this race was 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 points a few weeks ago.”      That runs counter to a POLITICO report last week that Republicans are increasingly worried that Handel is “trending downward” in internal surveys.      But Cahaly cited one other factor that the newest polls might not be picking up: last week’s shootings at congressional Republicans’ baseball practice in Northern Virginia that wounded five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana.      Cahaly said Trump’s handling of the shooting might bring home enough traditional Republican voters uneasy with the president to carry Handel across the finish line.      “I think it’s an interesting dynamic, and I’d like to see how that affects it,” he said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The closely-watched runoff for Georgia's 6th Congressional District seat between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel is looking to be a tight race.

The sat-cannon, or satellite-cannon, was an innovative piece of technology designed by a joint team of scientists and engineers from Earth and Titan, working together to further their knowledge of Titan's unique atmosphere and weather patterns. Dalrin, a seasoned scientist himself, had been a part of this ambitious project since its inception. Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest moon in the solar system, boasted of an atmosphere much denser and thicker than the Earth's. This made it an ideal subject for studying and understanding the behavior of various weather phenomena happening within its atmosphere. Packed with nitrogen and methane, Titan's atmosphere is home to exotic clouds, polar winds, and massive cryovolcanoes that spew out water and other compounds instead of molten rock. These peculiar conditions puzzled scientists and sparked a strong sense of curiosity amongst them. As a result, they teamed up to design an experimental tool that would enable them to study Titan's weather patterns more closely—a satellite-cannon capable of launching test-satellites into Titan's orbit. This marvelous machine, standing tall as a symbol of cross-planetary cooperation, had a uniquely sleek and futuristic appearance. It was adorned with various instruments, sensors, and satellite-launching mechanisms. Its mainframe extended towards the sky, equipped with a powerful and precise firing mechanism that enabled the team to propel satellites into space with incredible accuracy and minimal energy consumption.  The sat-cannon's core function lay in its ability to send small test satellites, laden with various scientific instruments, into orbit around Titan. Here, these satellites could measure atmospheric conditions such as temperature, pressure, and wind patterns. They could also capture images and spectral data, shedding light on the unique meteorological phenomena that occur on this enigmatic moon. Ultimately, the data collected from these test satellites would help scientists and researchers to develop a better understanding of Titan's climate, weather patterns, and its overall compatibility with human life. Thanks to this groundbreaking project, the sat-cannon quickly became a point of interest and pride for both the Earthlings and the Titanians. As Stowik continued to gaze at the sat-cannon in awe, Dalrin went on to share more details about its development, the scientific progress it had made possible, and the collaboration that had brought together the brightest minds from two distant worlds.

With endless strategies and methods available, it can be overwhelming to figure out the right path. To achieve success, entrepreneurs need to prioritize and dedicate their energy to the most important aspects in the early stages of their business venture. Before diving into sales or marketing strategies, it's crucial that every new business owner focuses on these three key areas: identifying the target market, building a solid foundation, and maintaining an innovative mindset. Step 1: Identifying the Target Market Understanding your target audience is the first step towards a successful business venture. By knowing who your products or services are designed for, you can tailor your marketing plan and strategies to those customers more effectively.  Research: To begin, start researching by gathering data on your potential customers. Identifying demographic factors such as age, gender, location, and purchasing habits can provide a more in-depth understanding of your target audience. Define: Once you have gathered essential information, create a specific customer persona to represent your typical customer. This will help you visualize the target market, which aids in developing marketing strategies that cater to their needs and desires. Step 2: Building a Solid Foundation Creating a strong foundation during the initial stages of your business will provide a platform for future growth and success. To build a sturdy foundation, focus on the following elements: Business Plan: Develop a comprehensive business plan that outlines your objectives, goals, strategies, and tactics. The plan should also detail essential areas such as financial planning, marketing, operations, and human resources. Legal and Regulatory Requirements: Ensure that your business complies with all legal and regulatory requirements relevant to your industry. This includes permits, licenses, taxes, and necessary insurances. Navigating these requirements from the start allows you to operate your business worry-free and avoid potential legal issues down the road. Strong Network: Cultivate a strong network of professional connections to provide support and foster future opportunities. By forming relationships with experienced professionals, you can gain valuable insights, mentorship, and potential collaborations that can serve to enhance your burgeoning business. Step 3: Maintaining an Innovative Mindset Business owners must constantly evolve to stay ahead of the competition. Adopting an innovative mindset ensures that you're continuously advancing and adapting to the ever-changing business landscape. Invest in New Technology: Embrace new technology to improve your products, services, and overall operations. This can increase efficiency and provide a competitive edge against other businesses in your industry. Regular Market Research: Continuously monitor market trends, industry standards, and advancements.

FILE - In this May 13, 2017 file photo, Japanese soldiers use rubber rafts as part of an amphibious drill during joint military exercises between the U.S., Japan, France and the United Kingdom, on Naval... (Associated Press)      HAGATNA, Guam (AP) — Residents of the tiny Pacific island of Guam say they're afraid of being caught in the middle of escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea after Pyongyang announced it was examining plans for attacking the strategically important U.S. territory.      Though local officials downplayed any threat, people who live and work on the island, which serves as a launching pad for the U.S. military, said Wednesday they could no longer shrug off the idea of being a potential target.      \\"I'm a little worried, a little panicked. Is this really going to happen?\\" said Cecil Chugrad, a 37-year-old bus driver for a tour bus company in Guam. \\"If it's just me, I don't mind, but I have to worry about my son. I feel like moving (out of Guam) now.\\"      Guam is used to the threats from North Korea but advances in the country's nuclear program paired with fiery rhetoric from President Donald Trump has raised the already high animosity and heightened worries that a miscalculation might spark conflict between the nuclear-armed nations.      Reports suggested North Korea mastered a technological hurdle needed to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile. The advances were detailed in an official Japanese assessment and later a Washington Post story that cited U.S. intelligence officials and a confidential Defense Intelligence Agency report.      In response, Trump on Tuesday threatened the communist country \\"with fire and fury.\\" On Wednesday, the North Korean army said in a statement that it was studying a plan to create an \\"enveloping fire\\" in areas around Guam with medium- to long-range ballistic missiles.      While it is extremely unlikely that Pyongyang would risk the assured annihilation of its revered leadership with a pre-emptive attack on U.S. citizens, some residents are concerned.      \\"If anything happens, we all got to be ready, be prepared, and pray to God that it doesn't happen,\\" Daisy Mendiola, 56, said after finishing lunch with her family at a restaurant near Hagatna. \\"Everyone's afraid, because we're dealing with powers that's beyond us.\\"      Other residents are worried about the political atmosphere and the government's ability to find a peaceful solution.      Todd Thompson, a lawyer who lives on Guam, said he laughed off past threats because he \\"figured cooler heads in Washington would prevail, and it was just an idle threat.\\"      \\"But I have to say, I'm not laughing now,\\" Thompson said. \\"My concern is that things have changed in Washington, and who knows what's going to happen?\\"      His brother Mitch Thompson, who also lives on Guam, added he believes \\"a lot of people have no confidence that the White House will do the right thing under the circumstances.\\"      However, the brothers say they haven't seen anyone panicking or stocking up on supplies.      \\"I think people are just stunned and really don't know what to think,\\" Todd Thompson said.      Guam is about 2,100 miles (3,380 kilometers) southeast of Pyongyang and 3,800 miles (6,115 kilometers) west of Honolulu in the Pacific Ocean. For years, North Korea has claimed Guam is within its missiles' striking distance, making furious statements each time when the U.S. flew powerful bombers from the island's air base to the Korean Peninsula.      In August last year, the North's Foreign Ministry warned that all U.S. military bases in the Pacific including Guam would \\"face ruin in the face of all-out and substantial attack\\" by the North's military. In the spring of 2013, state media cited leader Kim Jong Un as having ordered his military to prepare plans on launching strikes on U.S. military bases in Guam, Hawaii and South Korea as well as the American mainland.      Guam is armed with the U.S. Army's defense system known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, which can intercept missiles.      Similar threats in 2013 led Guam's U.S. Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo to advocate for the THAAD system, she said in a statement Wednesday.      \\"North Korea's most recent threat to target Guam is dangerous and it further heightens tensions in our region,\\" Bordallo said. \\"While we have heard threats like this in the past, I take them very seriously.\\"      Guam's Homeland Security Adviser George Charfauros urged calm and said defenses are in place for such threats.      \\"An attack or threat to Guam is a threat or attack on the United States,\\" said Guam Gov. Eddie Calvo, who said he spoke with White House officials Monday morning. \\"They have said that America will be defended.\\"      A travel agent on Guam said they haven't had a surge of customers seeking to book flights off the island.      \\"It's not bad at all, no chaos,\\" said Mariah Sablan, who works for Golden Dragon Travel Inc. \\"It's just like a regular business day.\\"      ___      Bussewitz reported from Honolulu. Associated Press writer Mark Thiessen in Anchorage contributed to this report.      ___      This story has been corrected to show that the North Korean announcement came Wednesday in Guam due to the international date line. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base      North Korea has said it is considering carrying out missile strikes on the US Pacific territory of Guam.      The North's official news agency said on Tuesday the plan involved firing medium-to-long-range rockets at Guam, where US strategic bombers are based.      US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, flying into Guam, said there was no imminent threat from North Korea.      He also defended President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday threatened Pyongyang with \\"fire and fury\\".      Mr Tillerson said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he would understand.      \\"I think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime that the US... will defend itself and its allies,\\" he said.      On Wednesday, Mr Trump tweeted that the US nuclear arsenal was \\"more powerful than ever before\\", but added he was hopeful \\"we will never have to use this power\\".      The recent exchanges mark a sharp rise in rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang, but China has urged calm.      A foreign ministry statement quoted by Reuters called on all sides to avoid words or actions which might escalate the situation and to make greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks.      The UN recently approved further economic sanctions on North Korea, which Pyongyang said were a \\"violent violation of our sovereignty\\", warning the US would \\"pay a price\\".      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen'      On Wednesday, the official KCNA news agency said North Korea was \\"carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam\\" using its domestically made medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles.      The news agency reported a military statement issued on Tuesday, which probably came in response to US military drills in Guam.      However, there has been no indication that any attack on Guam by North Korea is imminent.      In a message to the public, the governor of Guam Eddie Baza Calvo said there was currently \\"no threat\\" to the island and the Marianas archipelago, but that Guam was \\"prepared for any eventuality\\".      North Korea's statement is the latest stage in a heating up of rhetoric and tension.      Pyongyang, which has tested nuclear devices five times, launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit mainland US.      On Tuesday, media reports in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was \\"seen from Japan\\"      While not confirmed, this was seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state.      A report in the Washington Post, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected.      A Japanese government defence white paper also said the weapons programme had \\"advanced considerably\\" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons.      North Korea's missile programme explained      In response, President Trump warned North Korea to stop threatening the US, saying they would be \\"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\\".      However, veteran US Senator John McCain was sceptical about Mr Trump's statement, saying he was \\"not sure that President Trump is ready to act\\".      'Scary' situation - BBC's Yogita Limaye in Seoul, South Korea      On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme.      But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. \\"I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,\\" she said.      Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual.      North Korea had reacted angrily after the fresh sanctions were announced on Saturday by the UN, in an attempt to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions.      The sanctions aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third.      KCNA said North Korea would retaliate and make \\"the US pay a price\\" for drafting the new measures.      It called the sanctions a \\"violent violation of our sovereignty\\", the news agency said.      Meanwhile on Wednesday the UK Foreign Office said it would \\"continue to work with the US and our international partners to maintain pressure on North Korea\\".      \\"We have been consistently clear and forthright in our condemnation of North Korea's destabilising and illegal behaviour, including through support for UN Security Council resolutions to bring in sanctions that will limit North Korea's ability to pursue its nuclear weapons programme,\\" a spokesman said.      A spokesman for Germany's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said it was watching the situation \\"with the greatest concern\\" and called on all sides to use restraint.      The tiny but important island of Guam      The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii.      It is a \\"non-incorporated\\" US territory, with a population of about 163,000.      That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections.      US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more.      It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like the South China Sea, the Koreas and the Taiwan Straits.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. (Oliver Douliery/Pool/European Pressphoto Agency)      Texas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress, one of President Trump’s evangelical advisers who preached the morning of his inauguration, has released a statement saying the president has the moral authority to “take out” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.      “When it comes to how we should deal with evildoers, the Bible, in the book of Romans, is very clear: God has endowed rulers full power to use whatever means necessary — including war — to stop evil,” Jeffress said. “In the case of North Korea, God has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong Un.”      Jeffress said in a phone interview that he was prompted to make the statement after Trump said that if North Korea’s threats to the United States continue, Pyongyang will be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.”      [Trump threatened ‘fire and fury.’ Here’s why to some that’s perfectly God-like.]      The biblical passage Romans 13 gives the government authority to deal with evildoers, Jeffress said. “That gives the government … the authority to do whatever, whether it’s assassination, capital punishment or evil punishment to quell the actions of evildoers like Kim Jong Un,” he said.      He said that many pacifist Christians will cite Romans 12, which says, “Do not repay evil for evil,” but Jeffress says that the passage is referring to Christians, not to the government.      “A Christian writer asked me, ‘Don’t you want the president to embody the Sermon on the Mount?’ ” he said, referring to Jesus’s sermon. “I said absolutely not.”      In his sermon on the morning of Trump’s inauguration in January, Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Dallas, compared Trump to the story of the biblical leader Nehemiah, who helped rebuild the city of Jerusalem.      The first step of rebuilding the nation, Jeffress said, was the building of a wall around Jerusalem to protect its citizens. “You see, God is not against building walls,” Jeffress said in his sermon at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington.      [‘God is not against building walls!’ The sermon Trump heard from Robert Jeffress before his inauguration.]      Jeffress is no stranger to controversy. He has said in the past that former president Barack Obama paved the way for the Antichrist and drew wide attention for calling Mormonism a cult during the 2012 Republican primaries. Jeffress knows his comments on North Korea could be considered controversial, even among fellow evangelicals. His megachurch in Dallas is a prominent Southern Baptist church, one where evangelist Billy Graham had membership for many years. In 2016, the church reported an average weekly attendance of about 3,700.      “Some Christians, perhaps younger Christians, have to think this through,” Jeffress said. “It’s antithetical to some of the mushy rhetoric you hear from some circles today. Frankly, it’s because they are not well taught in the scriptures.”      Over the past two years, Jeffress said, Trump has been “very measured, very thoughtful in every response.”      “People instinctively know that this president is not going to draw an imaginary red line and walk around it like President Obama did,” he said.      Attitudes about North Korea among evangelicals are unclear, he said.      An overwhelming number of white, evangelicals voted for Donald Trump, 81-16 percent, according to exit poll results. Politics anchor Libby Casey talks to religion reporter Sarah Pulliam Bailey about how Trump appealed to this group and what they expect from him in office. (The Washington Post)      “I think many evangelicals, like most Americans, really don’t pay attention to global affairs,” Jeffress said. “I believe we’re all going to be forced to soon if North Korea isn’t dealt with decisively.”      Jeffress is unusual for an evangelical pastor because most pastors do not speak about specific foreign policy issues from the pulpit, except sometimes about Israel, said Amy Black, a political-science professor at Wheaton College, an evangelical institution in Illinois.      Theologians and church leaders have debated the interpretation of Romans 13 for millennia, Black said. Most mainstream interpretations of the passage, she said, would suggest that God works through governmental leaders, but ultimate authority comes from God. Debate broke out among Christians in Germany during World War II over how to interpret this passage; some Christians believed they should follow the government while others set up a resistance movement.      “If anything, Romans 13 creates a conundrum, because it could be interpreted that Kim Jong Un has authority to govern,” she said.      Jeffress last met with Trump in July when a group of pastors laid hands on the president in the Oval Office. He said now that health care is off the table, evangelicals are hoping for tax reform, though he didn’t have any specifics in mind.      The access Jeffress has to the White House, Black said, may explain why many evangelicals have been so attracted to Trump.      “Some of the approval of Trump is less about the specific person and even specific policy, but it’s about someone who is listening to us,” she said. “Jeffress is a piece of that story of having access.”      Black says that Jeffress represents an “old guard” of evangelicals, closely aligned to leaders like popular radio personality and psychologist James Dobson and Pat Robertson, who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network. Many evangelicals now look to leadership from pastors like Rick Warren in California or Tim Keller in New York City, though Warren and Keller do not speak about politics very often.      “We’re in a weird vacuum; we’re past the Jim Dobson and Pat Robertson era, but it’s not 100 percent clear who will fill their place,” Black said.      Jeffress, who was an early supporter of Trump, has said that after sharing Wendy’s cheeseburgers in Iowa, he believed Trump would be the next president and that it would be because God placed him there. In July, his church choir and orchestra performed a song called “Make America Great Again” at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in D.C., where Trump was in attendance.      This story has been updated to provide further comments from Amy Black, a political-science professor at Wheaton College. ||||| Story highlights Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain said he took exception to Trump's comments      Democrats slammed Trump for a reaction they charged was \\"bombastic\\" and \\"unhinged.\\"      (CNN) President Donald Trump faced criticism from lawmakers in both parties on Tuesday after warning that North Korea would \\"face fire and fury like the world has never seen\\" if Pyongyang keeps threatening the United States.      Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain said he took exception to Trump's comments, warning that the President might not be able to follow through with the threats he is making.      \\"I take exception to the President's comments because you've got to be sure that you can do what you say you're going to do,\\" the Arizona Republican said in an interview with Phoenix radio station KTAR. \\"The great leaders I've seen don't threaten unless they're ready to act and I'm not sure President Trump is ready to act.\\"      Trump issued his warning to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday during a photo op at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.      \\"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.

In a release just hours after US President Donald Trump threatened that any North Korean attack would be met with \\"fire and fury\\", Pyongyang's state media said its military was \\"carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam\\".      The North's threat is to use medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles and is the latest and most specific threat directed against the US. ||||| US airbase in Guam threatened by North Korea as Trump promises 'fire and fury'      North Korea has said it is considering a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after Donald Trump warned the regime that any threat to the United States would be met with “fire and fury”.      The threat, carried by the state-run KCNA news agency, marked a dramatic rise in tensions and prompted warnings to Washington not to become embroiled in a bellicose slanging match with North Korea.      Pyongyang said it was “carefully examining” a plan to strike Guam, located 3,400km (2,100 miles) away, and threatened to create an “enveloping fire” around the territory.      Guam is home to a US military base that includes a submarine squadron, an airbase and a coastguard group.      Guam’s governor, Eddie Calvo, on Wednesday attempted to reassure residents that there was “no threat” of a North Korean strike, but added that the island was prepared for “any eventuality”.      Calvo added: “Guam is American soil … We are not just a military installation.”      In an online video message he said he had been told by the US defence and homeland security departments that there was no change in the threat level.      A Korean people’s army (KPA) spokesman said in a statement Wednesday that a plan would be put into practice as soon as the order to attack Guam was issued by the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.            “The KPA strategic force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium- to long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the US major military bases on Guam, including the Anderson airforce base,” the spokesman said.      KCNA quoted a second army spokesman accusing Washington of devising a “preventive war”, adding that any attempt to attack the North would provoke “all-out war, wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the US mainland”.      The US should cease its “reckless military provocation” against North Korea to avoid such a reaction, the spokesman added.      In response, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, called for an overhaul of the country’s armed services, citing an “urgent” need to improve its ability to defend against North Korean missile attacks.      “I believe we might need a complete defence reform at the level of a rebirth, instead of making some improvements or modifications,” Moon told senior military officials, according to Yonhap news agency.      “Another urgent task now facing us is securing defence capabilities to counter North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations.”      The unification ministry, which handles cross-border relations, said the threat against Guam would damage attempts to improve inter-Korean ties. A ministry spokesman said the South was committed to dialogue and sanctions, and urged Pyongyang to end its provocations.            Q&A What are North Korea's nuclear capabilities? Show Hide North Korea has carried out five nuclear tests since 2006, so it unquestionably has the capacity to create some form of nuclear bomb.      To function effectively, however, the bomb needs to be small enough to fit on to a missile. Some experts believe the North has already \\"miniaturised\\" its nuclear capability, while others believe the regime is still several years away from being able to do so. Japan's defence ministry warned on 8 August that it was possible that Pyongyang had mastered miniaturisation.      North Korea would also need a reliable delivery system for any bomb. Its proven short- and medium-range missiles could reach South Korea and Japan. In July it test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles, placing US cities in range of potential attack, according to US experts.      Beijing issued a brief foreign ministry statement on Wednesday calling on “all parties to avoid any words or actions that might escalate the situation”            France and Germany also called on all sides to use restraint. “We are watching the increasing rhetorical escalation regarding the Korean Peninsula with the greatest concern,” German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer told reporters.      Tensions in the region have risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month. The UN security council responded last weekend by unanimously agreeing sanctions designed to deprive the regime of around a billion US dollars in hard currency.      Q&A Why is North Korea threatening Guam? Show Hide Guam, a 210 sq mile sovereign US territory in the western Pacific Ocean, is used by America as a strategic military base. Almost a third of its land is controlled by the US military and about 6,000 American troops are based there.      The island's location, within range of North Korean medium- and long-range missiles, and military significance to the US make it a logical target for Pyongyang.      As recently as Monday, two US air force B-1B bombers flew from Guam to join their counterparts from South Korea and Japan for a mission over the Korean peninsula, about 2,100 miles away. Read more            North Korea’s bellicose language is causing anxiety in Japan. Its defence ministry warned on Tuesday that it was possible that Pyongyang had miniaturised its nuclear weaponry. A leaked US intelligence assessment also claimed the regime had successfully produced a miniaturised nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles.      Japanese fighters conducted joint air drills with US supersonic bombers near the Korean peninsula on Tuesday, Japan’s air self-defence forces said. A day earlier, two US B-1 bombers flew from Guam over the Korean peninsula as part of its “continuous bomber presence”, a US official said.      US security and defence officials in Guam, which is within range of North Korean medium- and long-range missiles, said there was no imminent threat to people there or elsewhere in the Northern Mariana Islands.      Guam’s department of homeland security and office of civil defence said they were monitoring North Korea with US military and government officials.      Guam’s homeland security adviser, George Charfauros, said officials were confident that the US defence department was “monitoring this situation very closely and is maintaining a condition of readiness”.      But the speaker of the Guam legislature, Benjamin J Cruz, said people on the island were “just praying that the United States and the … defence system we have here is sufficient enough to protect us”. Cruz told the Associated Press that the threat was “very disconcerting”.      He added: “It forces us to pause and to say a prayer for the safety of our people.”      In his strongest warning yet to North Korea, Trump told reporters in New Jersey on Tuesday: “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.”      The New Zealand prime minister condemnded Trump’s comments, in an unusually strong statement.      North Korea v the US: how likely is war? Read more      “I think the comments are not helpful in an environment that is very tense,” Bill English told local media. He said his government had yet to express concerns to the US administration directly, but “certainly if that type of commentary continued we would”.      English added: “I think we are seeing reaction from North Korea that indicates that kind of comment is more likely to escalate rather than settle things.”      But North Korea experts played down the potential for a military strike on Guam. “There’s rhetoric on both sides – it’s like two bullies in the playground yelling at each other,” said Robert Kelly, associate professor at Pusan National University.      “I think the North Koreans just pulled the Guam threat out of the air. Sure, there’s some sort of rough plan on a shelf somewhere, because Guam is an important American reinforcement point, but I don’t think there is anything immediately in the offing.      “They just needed to say something in response – you poke the North Koreans in the eye and they poke you back.”            Additional reporting by Eleanor Ainge Roy and agencies ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Residents of Guam have voiced their concerns after North Korea said it was \\"carefully examining\\" a plan for missile strikes on the US Pacific territory.

There will be more people in the world and most of them will live longer than people do now. Computers will be much smaller and more useful, and there will be at least one in every home. And computer studies will be one of the important subjects in schools then. People will work fewer hours than they do now and they will have more free time for sports, watching TV and traveling. Traveling will be much easier and cheaper. More people will go to other countries on holiday. There will be changes in our food, too. Maybe no one will eat meat every day. Instead, they eat more fruit and vegetables. Maybe people will be healthier. Work in the future will be different, too. Dangerous and hard work canl be done by robots, because of this, many people will not have work to do. This will be a problem.

Prince Andrew this week said foreign firms should invest in Britain, not other European nations, because 'unlike them it is open for business' Prince Andrew has risked causing another political controversy by poking fun at EU nations plunged into chaos by the collapse of the euro. The Duke of York told entrepreneurs at the Davos summit in Switzerland that foreign firms should invest in Britain, not other European nations, because ‘unlike them it is open for business’. And he boasted it had another huge advantage – its own currency, not the ailing euro. Fresh questions were being raised about the Prince's attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he is staying in a luxury ski chalet - at the expense of the taxpayer, it has emerged. His controversial remarks were made at a private. cocktail party at the conference, attended by international. political and business leaders. They. came on the eve of tomorrow’s EU summit in Brussels, where Prime. Minister David Cameron faces another bruising confrontation over his. refusal to accept EU curbs on the City of London. Chancellor. George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson were also at the Davos. reception, hosted by the Prince to promote British business, even though. he is no longer a special envoy for UK Trade & Investment, the. Government-backed body. Prince. Andrew was forced to quit the role last year following disclosures in. The Mail on Sunday about his friendship with US billionaire Jeffrey. Epstein, a convicted sex offender. But. he was allowed to maintain a lower-profile role and was guest of honour. at its reception for British business leaders in Davos on Thursday. According. to witnesses, he said in his welcoming speech: ‘The message to get. across here tonight is that Britain is open for business – unlike one or. two other countries I could mention.’ To warm applause, he added: ‘And what is more, we have our own currency!’ A man sleeps before a panel session at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, where Prince Andrew this week gave his speech. Controversial: Prince Andrew (left) has held a one-to-one meeting with President Ilham Aliyev (right), the billionaire dictator of Azerbaijan. One. businessman said: ‘He knew he was chancing his arm a bit but most of us. thought his comments were great. That is what he is there for, to bang. the drum for Britain. ‘If any European takes umbrage at what he said, they lack a sense of humour.’ The. Duke of York has made hundreds of trips to promote Britain. But his. role was dogged by claims of lavish spending. A spokeswoman declined to. comment. Questions have been raised over. Prince Andrew's role at the World Economic Forum, six months after he. was forced to stand down at UK trade envoy over his friendship wit a. convicted sex offender.

So. far he has given a dinner for Indonesian businessmen, hosted a reception. for UK trade delegates - including George Osborne - and held a. one-to-one meeting with President Ilham Aliyev, the billionaire dictator. of Azerbaijan. This is despite him being forced to. stand down as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade. last July, amid controversy over his friendship with sex-offender. Jeffrey Epstein and his close links with despots. The 51-year-old Duke has been accompanied to the event by two publicly-funded aides and royal protection officers. Yesterday, he was spotted going in. skiing in nearby Klosters, where he is staying in a luxury,. eight-bedroom chalet - accommodation which could up to £39,000. The bill for the chalet - which. features its own chef, chauffeur, sauna and steam room - could cost. anything between £21,000 and £39,000, and it is expected to be paid for. out of taxpayers' pockets. The latest revelation about Prince Andrew has sparked outrage amongst his critics. Shadow. Justice Minister Chris Bryant told the Sunday Mirror: 'I thought we had. dispensed with his services. There were plenty of UK representatives -. David Cameron, George Osborne, Andrew Mitchell - who could have all met. with Aliyev if it was in our national interests. 'At a time when everybody is feeling. the pinch, it's shocking Prince Andrew still thinks he should be. entitled to an eight-bedroom mansion.' The Duke's meeting with President. Aliyev only emerged through Azerbaihan state news agency, which released. a picture of the pair together. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace. said Andrew had been invited to the World Economic Forum and was. attending in his capacity as a senior member of the Royal family. He. also added that his meeting with President Aliyev was one of many. official engagements planned during his visit. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'His role. is to continue to support UK business and travel overseas as a senior. member of the family, and visits which were already in the diary will be. kept. He will relinquishing it gradually.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"Prince Andrew, who is part of the British Royal Family, spoke at an important event called the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He encouraged international businesses to invest in the United Kingdom instead of other European countries because the UK is more open for business and has its own money called the British Pound, instead of using the Euro like many other European nations.

Question: If the temperature in the environment increases, what will happen to the rate of cellular respiration?   Answer: increases Output:","output":"An explanation of the given question and answer: The question asks about the impact of increased temperature on the rate of cellular respiration. The given answer is 'increases,' which indicates that the rate of cellular respiration increases with increasing temperature. When the temperature in the environment increases, it generally leads to increased cellular kinetic energy, causing molecules to move more rapidly. This increased molecular movement results in a higher frequency of collisions between substrates and enzymes involved in cellular respiration. Consequently, it speeds up the various chemical reactions within the process, leading to an increase in the overall rate of cellular respiration. However, it is essential to note that this increase is only beneficial to a certain extent. If the temperature becomes too high, it can cause enzymes to denature, losing their function and reducing the efficiency of cellular respiration altogether. In summary, an increase in temperature in the environment can lead to an increase in the rate of cellular respiration due to increased molecular movement and reaction rates. Still, there is an upper limit to the temperature increase, beyond which enzyme function may be compromised."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

His loveable character first made an appearance in 1963 and went on to star in more than 40 stories, selling 120 million copies worldwide. Clifford's image has gone on to appear on merchandise and in US buildings, including the White House. Bridwell had completed two more books which are due for release next year. Dick Robinson, president of the author's long-time publisher Scholastic said: \\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our loyal and talented friend whose drawings and stories have inspired all of us and generations of children and their parents.\\" His wife of 56 years, Norma, said: \\"A lot of people were Clifford fans and that makes them Norman fans too.\\" She was responsible for naming the character Clifford after her imaginary childhood friend. Over the decades, the bright red dog featured in a host of stories, including Clifford Goes To Hollywood and Clifford and The Grouchy Neighbours, which became popular bedtime reading for children across the US and beyond. The dog regularly got into trouble before redeeming himself with a daring rescue or doing a good deed. Bridwell's wife said there were parallels between the author and his creation. \\"He's never been able to recognise that. Clifford tries to do the right thing, Norman tries to do right the thing, and he makes a mess of it. But he's the most lovable grown-up man. He's just a nice guy.\\" Before he found fame with Clifford, Bridwell worked as a commercial artist during the 1950s. He made numerous attempts to break into children's publishing, until a New York book editor suggested he created a story around an illustration he had submitted of a child and her oversized dog. Further rejections followed, until publishers Scholastic saw his creation's potential - a move which led to lasting success for the company. \\"I said to my wife, 'Now don't count on there being any more. This one is just a fluke. I don't know if there will ever be another one,'\\" Bridwell said. In more recent years, the character was animated in a series of cartoons for US television, while a feature film - Clifford's Big Red Movie - was made in 2004. Bridwell is survived by his wife, a son and three grandchildren. A small private funeral service will be held along with a more public celebration of the author's life and work, his family said.

Go for something between casual and original. But remember you are making first impressions so what you wear kind of dictates a part of your personality, so don't go far outside your comfort zone. Expectations are overrated. You just got out of elementary school, no need to wear makeup or do anything fancy with your hair. If you're not comfortable with it, don't do it! All these middle school girls you see in magazines have makeup on solely for the advertisements. Going your first day with no makeup is quite the bold move itself, as it shows you have confidence in yourself and that you don't need makeup to attract attention! This will wake you up and make you smell fresh and feel great. (Remember some nice deodorant to top it off.) You do not need to haul your whole home with you. All you really need for your first day really is a few snacks, a pencil or two and the basic supplies. Bringing extra pencils and snacks may be helpful, but not necessary. The higher grades don't bite! If you're feeling daring enough, go and try to make some friends who are older than you, as they have gone through your grade and may be able to give you some pointers. Mingle with some other stranger that may be hanging around too.

Aim for a balance between casual and original, bearing in mind that your choice of clothes offers an insight into your personality. However, ensure you remain within your comfort zone. Contrary to popular expectations, there's no requirement for you to wear makeup or style your hair elaborately. If this isn't comfortable for you, it's entirely fine to avoid it. Many middle school girls who advertise makeup in the media only do this for promotional purposes. On your first day, confidently showing up without makeup can showcase your self-confidence and indicate that you do not require makeup to command attention. Don't forget to freshen up in the morning to feel active and use a deodorant to remain fresh. When it comes to packing, there's no need to bring your entire house with you! For your first day, the essentials - a few snacks, a couple of pencils, and basic supplies, are more than enough. While extra snacks and pencils can be beneficial, they aren't essential. Also remember, the senior students are not intimidating. Should you feel bold enough, consider making friends with older students as they can provide you with valuable advice based on their experiences. Mix and mingle with others who might be hanging around, and if you're unable to find a new friend, use the time to familiarize yourself with the school layout.

The Cleveland Browns headed south to the Louisiana Superdome for their Week 7 battle against the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints. Cleveland struck first, on a 23-yard field goal by kicker Phil Dawson and a 4-yard run by running back Peyton Hillis to take a 10-0 lead after one quarter. In the second quarter, New Orleans closed the gap on a Garrett Hartley-yard field goal, but the Browns answered with another Dawson field goal and a 30-yard interception return by linebacker David Bowens to push the lead to 20-3 at the half. Special teams played a large role for the Browns in the half, with a 62-yard punt return by Eric Wright thanks to a Josh Cribbs lateral, and a 68-yard rush on a fake punt by punter Reggie Hodges both leading to field goals. In the fourth quarter, quarterback Drew Brees connected with tight end David Thomas to pull within 10, but another Dawson field goal and a second Bowens interception return sealed the win for the Browns. With the win, the Browns entered their bye week at 2-5.  This win also marked the third consecutive season in which the Browns defeated the defending Super Bowl champion.

Write a summary based on this article: View Images As Philae closes in for a landing, the shadow-pocked surface of the comet 67P is revealed.      Photograph by ESA/Rosetta/Philae      A misfire of harpoons, an ancient technology, may have spelled the end of one of the most advanced: Philae, the first spacecraft to send images from the surface of a comet. Unanchored to its comet, the spacecraft drifted into darkness, sending back scientific data even as its solar-powered batteries faded.      The lander successfully delivered data on the composition of the comet, before losing contact early Friday with the European Space Agency at the Rosetta Mission Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany.      \\"With its batteries depleted and not enough sunlight available to recharge, Philae has fallen into 'idle mode' for a potentially long silence,\\" an ESA statement announced.      \\"It was a very successful mission; it has returned a lot of great data already,\\" said space scientist Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, a member of the Rosetta science team.      When Rosetta was originally designed more than a decade ago, the comet lander Philae was conceived of as a 24-hour mission, he says. \\"People are focusing on the wrong thing to ignore the success of carrying a lander to a comet and getting it on the surface.\\"      The lander detached from the Rosetta spacecraft orbiting 13.7 miles (22 kilometers) above comet 67P Churyumov–Gerasimenko on Wednesday, landing on the 3.1-mile-long (5-kilometer-long) comet that same day.      During the landing at its intended site, called Agilkia, the lander's stabilizing rocket and two anchoring harpoons failed to fire.      On Earth, Philae weighs 187 pounds (85 kilograms), but gravity is so weak on Comet 67P—hundreds of thousands of times weaker than Earth—that it weighs about an ounce there. The harpoons were intended to keep the probe from drifting off the surface of the comet.      Instead, the unsecured lander bounced off the comet's surface, touching down again nearly two hours later, and then bouncing once more before finally settling, apparently in a shadowed crater beside a cliff. (See \\"Space Probe Philae Bounces on a Comet.\\")      Japan's Hayabusa spacecraft, which landed on an asteroid in 2005, encountered similar travails. Its MINERVA mini-lander was designed to hop on the space rock but instead drifted into space.      In the shadows, the solar panels of Philae failed to recharge, leaving it helpless after its 2.5-day batteries died. \\"From now on, no contact would be possible unless sufficient sunlight falls on the solar panels to generate enough power to wake it up,\\" said mission controllers.      There is some hope of rousing Philae from its sleep. Before the lander shut down, mission controllers rotated Philae's main body about 125 degrees (some 35 percent of the way around its axis), which should have shifted its main solar panel. \\"This may have exposed more panel area to sunlight,\\" said the ESA, perhaps allowing the lander's batteries to recharge.      Even if Philae is never revived, the mission will continue to deliver more new science. Scientists are analyzing data from Philae's final communication, and will receive much more information from the Rosetta orbiter, expected to keep orbiting the comet until December 2015.      The orbiter, currently about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) away from 67P, will slowly spiral in until it's only a mile or two from the comet's surface, at which point its cameras will be able to pick out details just a few inches across.      Light reflected from the surface and into spectrographs will tell scientists the contents of 67P's outer crust.      Rosetta will also add to Philae's data on the composition of gases released from the interior. Already, the orbiter has detected hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, formaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide along with water and carbon dioxide.      As the comet makes its closest approach to the sun next summer, the orbiter will study the comet as it heats up.      Michael D. Lemonick contributed to this article. ||||| A probe named Philae is seen after it landed safely on a comet, known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in this CIVA handout image released November 13, 2014.      A pioneering robotic spacecraft shut down on Saturday after radioing results of its first and probably last batch of scientific experiments from the surface of a comet, scientists said.      Batteries aboard the European Space Agency’s Philae comet lander drained, shutting down the washing machine-sized probe after an adventurous and largely unscripted 57-hour mission.      Carried aboard the orbiting Rosetta mothership, Philae floated to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Thursday, but failed to deploy anchoring harpoons.      Upon contacting the comet’s unexpectedly hard surface, it bounced back up into space twice then came to rest at a still-unknown location about 1 km (0.6 mile) from its original target.      Photos and other data relayed by Philae show it finally landed against a cliff or crater wall where there was little sunlight to recharge its batteries. Racing against the clock, scientists activated a series of automated experiments, the first to be conducted from the surface of a comet.      Before dying, Philae defied the odds and radioed its science results back to Earth for analysis.      Its last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars toward the sun, Philae’s batteries may recharge enough for a follow-on mission. “Perhaps when we are nearer to the sun we might have enough solar illumination to wake up the lander and re-establish communication,” spacecraft operations manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement.      Scientists are particularly interested in learning about the chemical composition of any organic molecules in samples drilled out from the comet’s body.      Comets are believed to be pristine remnants from the formation of our solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. They contain rock and ice that have preserved ancient organic molecules like a time capsule and may provide insight into how the planets and life evolved.      Philae's drill descended more than 25 cm (10 inches) on Friday, penetrating the comet’s surface.      Rosetta in August became the first spacecraft to put itself into orbit around a comet. It will accompany the comet as it travels toward the sun for at least another 13 months.

Since the moon is the primary force driving tides, a reduction in the moon's gravitational pull could lead to smaller waves and lower tides. This change could result in less force exerted on the coastline, reducing the overall erosion by the ocean. In the erosion process described: - Ocean waves hitting land might be smaller and less powerful. - Ocean water pulling sand off of beaches might occur at a slower rate. - Ocean water breaking rocks off of cliffs might be less frequent or less intense. - Ocean water carrying sand and rocks into the ocean might be less effective.

Who's film \\"Le Monde du silence\\" won the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, Louis Malle or  Arne Sucksdorff? A:","output":"Louis Malle did not win the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957 for the film \\"Le Monde du silence.\\" Instead, it was Jacques-Yves Cousteau who co-directed the film with Louis Malle and whose film won these prestigious honors. \\"Le Monde du silence\\" (The Silent World) is a French documentary film co-directed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle. The film was released in 1956 and is based on Cousteau's book of the same name. It showcased the beauty of the underwater world and highlighted the importance of protecting the marine environment for future generations.  Jacques-Yves Cousteau, a renowned French naval officer, explorer, and conservationist, had a deep passion for the oceans and their mysterious underwater inhabitants. In fact, Cousteau was one of the primary inventors of the \\"aqua-lung,\\" the predecessor to modern scuba diving equipment, which allowed divers to explore the oceans with unprecedented freedom.  Louis Malle, on the other hand, was a prominent French film director, screenwriter, and producer. Malle is known for his groundbreaking, thought-provoking, and often controversial works such as \\"The Lovers\\" (1958), \\"Murmur of the Heart\\" (1971), and \\"Au revoir les enfants\\" (1987). While initially working on the \\"Le Monde du silence\\" project as an underwater cinematographer, Malle's artistic and storytelling vision gave the film a unique and captivating direction that contributed to its success. Together, Cousteau and Malle's collaborative effort resulted in the creation of \\"Le Monde du silence,\\" which captured the magic and wonder of the underwater world using innovative underwater filming techniques. The film fascinated global audiences and garnered critical acclaim, winning the Palme d'Or at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1957. The success of the film marked a pivotal moment in both French cinema and marine conservation awareness, paving the way for future generations of oceanographers and filmmakers to follow in Cousteau and Malle's footsteps. In summary, while both Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle played significant roles in the making of \\"Le Monde du silence,\\" it was Cousteau, not Arne Sucksdorff, who is often credited as the primary driving force behind the film. With Malle's cinematic expertise and Cousteau's unmatched passion for ocean exploration, the two artists forged an unforgettable film that won the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He and his mentor Ken are sent to Bruges, where they are to await further instructions, by their employer Harry. Ken finds the city charming and quaint, while Ray has nothing but contempt for it. One night, Ken indulges Ray's desire to get out of their hotel room, and they explore the city. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray approaches ChloÃ«, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a fancy restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a couple and ends up knocking them unconscious. ChloÃ« takes Ray to her apartment, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik suddenly appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray disarms him, and fires the gun (which is loaded with blanks) in his face, blinding one of his eyes. ChloÃ« shamefully admits that she and Eirik occasionally rob tourists after she seduces them, insisting she'd told Eirik that Ray was not a target. Ray also becomes acquainted with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who turns out to be a drug-abusing racist. Harry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that the killing of a childâeven accidentallyâis unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. However, Ray, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order, and tells him to leave Bruges to make a new start elsewhere. Ken reports back to Harry, who immediately sets out for Bruges, enraged at the disobedience. He picks up a gun at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention. On the train, Ray is identified by the couple he assaulted in the restaurant, and is escorted back to Bruges.

The paragraph's contents include: - Outside of a restaurant with a snow-like graphic on the bottom - Men inside the bar - One man speaking into a microphone Now, let's evaluate each ending option: 1). see the men break dancing for the crowd This option could be logical since it continues describing the scene inside the bar, where there are already people, and adds an activity going on that involves the crowd. 2). see a man outside talking This option shifts the focus from inside the bar to the outside, which doesn't appear to be a natural continuation of the current paragraph's focus. 3). then see ladies playing beer pong against a team of men This option could also be a logical continuation as it maintains the focus on activities inside the bar. 4). see the ending screen This option seems unrelated to the paragraph's content and would be a disconnect from the flow in context.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sorry, I Left My Memory in the Other Room Ever forget the reason why you walked into a room seconds after you enter, even though you know you are there for a reason? You stand in the doorway wondering, “I know I came in here for something!” If you answered yes, you may go as far as to rationalize that this is why it happens: ‘Well, our lives are so overburdened, and that’s why so many of us buzz around like caffeinated cheetahs crossing things our mental checklists. So many things to remember: gym clothes, umbrella, kids’ soccer practice and piano lessons…’ And then it happens — just as you walk into another room to perform one of those super important tasks, you can’t, for the love of God, remember what it was! It’s annoying … and as it turns out, pretty common. A recent study out in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology validates this kind of forgetfulness and says the trigger may be as benign as passing through a doorway. Who knew? The study authors refer to the phenomena as the “location-updating effect,” which suggests there may be a decline in memory when you move from one location to another. The location change doesn’t have to be dramatic; walking into the next room is all it takes. The study questions whether this memory lapse has to do with a shift in context or whether there is something more to be learned about how we experience certain environments. The working theory is that when you enter a new room or environment, your brain works to update your understanding of what’s going on around you. As it turns out, this is a lot of work (it’s “effortful”, the authors say) for your buzzing brain. The study consisted of three experiments in which college students performed memory tasks either while changing their location in a room or while exiting a doorway into another room. The lead author, University of Notre Dame psychology professor Gabriel Radvansky, found that students forgot more when walking through a doorway than when they just moved across the room. Radvansky suggests that doorways create a sort of “event boundary” and prevent us from being able to retrieve thoughts and decisions we, ironically, likely left in the previous room. This isn’t the first study in this area. Previous research has shown that environment can affect memory and that we are better at accessing information we have learned if we try to retrieve it in the same social context. Guess that means it’s a good thing that most of us work in the same office every day. Otherwise, our jobs might be a lot more taxing on our memories. The series of experiments within the study, conducted at University of Notre Dame, had participants move through both virtual environments and real ones, suggesting that there may be some validity to this idea. But even personal experience may point to this forgetting phenomenon. When this study was sent around the Medical Unit here at ABC News, there was a roar of approval for the theory. Senior producer Ann Reynolds said, “I get an invitation and I think, ‘Are we busy that night? I’ll check the calendar.’ I know the calendar is in the kitchen, so I think ‘kitchen’ — and when I get there, I think, ‘What could I possibly have wanted in the kitchen at 10 o’clock at night?’ So I head back to the bedroom, where I see the invitation I was wondering about. … Arrrgh.” Arrrgh is right. But at least now, we have the beginnings of understanding why. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Research in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology has identified the \\"location-updating effect,\\" which suggests that memory may decline when moving from one location to another, often due to walking through doorways.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this \\"Use the instruction manual. Buy replacement parts. Fix a drop in water pressure. Fix a leaking reservoir.\\"","output":"Title: How to Fix a Leaking Reservoir and Drop in Water Pressure Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn some simple and easy ways to fix a leaking reservoir and solve the problem of drop in water pressure in a way that even a five year old can understand. So let's get started! First of all, you might wonder, what is a reservoir? A reservoir is a big container or tank that holds water. You might have seen one in your house, maybe in your kitchen, the bathroom or somewhere else. Now, let's learn some steps to fix the problems. Step 1: Read the Instruction Manual Before we do anything, it is very important to read the instruction manual. This is a booklet with lots of pictures and words that tell us how to use or fix something. Ask your mommy or daddy to read it to you or help you understand what it says. The manual will give you lots of helpful information on how to fix the leaking reservoir and the drop in water pressure. Step 2: Buy Replacement Parts Sometimes, when a reservoir is leaking or the water pressure is low, it means you might need to buy new parts to replace the old ones that are not working properly. You can go to a shop where they sell these parts with your mom or dad, and ask the shopkeeper to show you the parts that you need. Make sure to take the instruction manual with you, so you can tell the shopkeeper exactly which parts you need. Step 3: Fix the Drop in Water Pressure Now, let's learn how to fix the drop in water pressure. This means the water is not coming out as fast as it should be, and we will need your help to fix it! First, find the water valve. A water valve is like a little door that lets more or less water through when you open or close it. It might be a round wheel or a handle you need to turn. The instruction manual will help you find it. With the help of your parents, carefully turn the valve to open it up a little bit more so that more water can flow through and your water pressure will go back to normal! Step 4: Fix the Leaking Reservoir It's now time to fix that leak! A \\"leak\\" means that water is coming out of something when it should not be. The leaking might be happening because a part is broken or not in the right place. Remember those replacement parts you bought earlier? This is when they will come in handy! Ask your parent to help you find the part that is causing the leak and show you how to replace it using the instruction manual. Make sure to be patient and follow each step slowly and carefully. And that's it! By following these simple steps, you have learned how to fix a leaking reservoir and a drop in water pressure. Congratulations, little helper! You have done a great job, and now you can enjoy fresh water without any problems!"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The post is written in Bengali and discusses the contributions of different religious groups (Hindu and Muslim) in the fight for India's independence from the British. 2. The post also raises the question of why Muslims in Bangladesh are being persecuted for alleged Hindu-related violence in India. Based on the content, the post appears to focus on the roles and conflicts between different religious groups in the context of political and historical events. Therefore, this post can be classified as follows: - Religious: The primary topic of the post is centered on the Hindu and Muslim religious groups and their situations in India and Bangladesh. - Political: The post refers to India's independence and the role of religious groups, which involve political aspects such as relations between India and Bangladesh. - Geopolitical: As the post discusses sensitive religious issues in the context of international politics and the historical background, it can also be considered as having a geopolitical component. - Personal: The post does not seem to directly target any specific individual for attack or defamation; thus, it does not fit into the Personal category. In conclusion, the given Bengali post can be classified under the Religious, Political, and Geopolitical categories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  But I can use this background: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  What is an answer for this question: Which ocean is probably connected to less oceans with higher salinities? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and the background details about the Arctic Ocean, the Madrigal Ocean is most likely connected to fewer oceans with higher salinities. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the Madrigal Ocean has a lower salinity compared to the Listy Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean also has the lowest average salinity among Earth's major oceans due to limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. In a similar manner, the lower salinity of the Madrigal Ocean suggests limited connections and outflow to other oceans with higher salinity levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Information:  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.  - Theodorus \`\` Theo '' van Gogh ( Dutch pronunciation : ( teodors teo vn x ) ; 1 May 1857 -- 25 January 1891 ) was a Dutch art dealer . He was the younger brother of Vincent van Gogh , and Theo 's unfailing financial and emotional support allowed his brother to devote himself entirely to painting .

Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something.  \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost.  This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off.  No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound.  Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus.  Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did.  But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by.  I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one.  Then I gave up.  I decided to walk on to the next stop.

The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people.

Cancer deaths were up 8 percent from 7.6 million in a previous survey in 2008 and breast cancer killed 522,000 women last year, up 14 percent in the same period, according to the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). \\"Breast cancer is also a leading cause of cancer death in the less developed countries of the world,\\" said David Forman, head of IARC's Section of Cancer Information, the group that compiles the global cancer data. RELATED: ALL AIR POLLUTION CAUSES CANCER: WHO He said this was \\"partly because a shift in lifestyles is causing an increase in incidence, and partly because clinical advances to combat the disease are not reaching women living in these regions.\\" An estimated 14.1 million people developed cancer in 2012, up from 12.7 million in 2008. And 1.7 million women were newly diagnosed with breast cancer last year, up by more than 20 percent from 2008. IARC's report, called GLOBOCAN 2012, gives the most up-to-date estimates for 28 different types of cancer in 184 countries and offers an overview of the global cancer burden. RELATED: GENE THERAPY SHOWS ‘EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH’ PROMISE IN CURING BLOOD CANCERS It found that the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide in men and women combined were lung, breast and colorectal cancers. The most common causes of cancer death were lung, liver and stomach cancers. Projecting forward, IARC experts said they expected \\"a substantive increase\\" in cancer cases worldwide, with annual new cases predicted to rise to 19.3 million by 2025 as the global population both grows and ages. RELATED: VIDEO: WOMAN THROWS FLASH MOB DANCE PARTY BEFORE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY Worldwide trends show that in developing countries going through rapid societal and economic change, the shift towards lifestyles more typical of richer industrialised countries leads to a rising burden of cancers linked to reproduction, diet and hormones. The IARC report said cancer incidence — the number of new cases each year — has been increasing in most regions of the world, but noted what it said were \\"huge inequalities\\" between rich and poor countries. While rates of new cancer cases are still highest in more developed regions, death rates are relatively much higher in less developed countries because people's tumours are often not detected and diagnosed early enough due to a lack of screening and access to treatment. RELATED: NYPD COPS’ CANCER RATE SOARS POST-9/11 \\"An urgent need in cancer control today is to develop effective and affordable approaches to the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer among women living in less developed countries,\\" said Christopher Wild, IARC's director. He said it was critical to bring rates of disease and death in poorer countries in line with progress made in recent years in treating and curing some cancers on wealthier countries. One stark example of the inequality is in cervical cancer - which kills hundreds of thousands of women in Africa each year but can be largely avoided with a vaccine or successfully treated if it is picked up early enough with screening. In sub-Saharan Africa, 34.8 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed per 100,000 women each year, and 22.5 per 100,000 women die from the disease. That compares with 6.6 and 2.5 per 100,000 women respectively in North America. \\"These findings bring into sharp focus the need to implement the tools already available for cervical cancer, notably HPV vaccination combined with well organised national programmes for screening and treatment,\\" Wild said.

Given the following passage  \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos.

The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential.

Question: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  John wanted to invent a machine. To that end, he devised an experiment in which he used three components, comp A, comp B, and comp C. Comp A was a machine that applied force over a shorter distance. Comp B was also a machine, but it applied force over a longer distance. Comp C was not a machine.  Would comp A increase or not increase the force applied compared to comp B? Answer:","output":"Given the principles of machines, Comp A, which applies force over a shorter distance, would typically increase the force applied compared to Comp B, which applies force over a longer distance. This is based on the concept of mechanical advantage in physics. If a machine applies force over a shorter distance, it tends to increase the force that it applies. Similarly, if a machine applies the force over a longer distance, it tends to apply less force. This is in order to maintain the balance of work done because work is the product of force and distance (Work = Force x Distance). So if a machine increases the distance (like Comp B), it decreases the force. And if a machine decreases the distance (like Comp A), it increases the force.  In other words, Comp A, due to its function of applying force over a shorter distance in your description, it should increase the force applied when compared to Comp B. This would hold true as long as the total work done remains the same, which is the underlying principle of how machines work. They make the work easier by changing the way it's done, not by changing the total amount of work.  However, the specific increase in force would depend on the actual design and efficiency of the machine, among other factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Austin will likely make some money from selling their shoes. Selling unused or unwanted items is a common practice in many cultures, whether through traditional methods like garage sales or flea markets, or via online platforms like eBay, Depop, or Facebook Marketplace. It's often seen as a practical and environmentally friendly way to get rid of things you no longer need. Firstly, by selling their shoes, Austin is also likely to make a bit of a profit which can then be invested in new items or even saved up for future use. This could be especially beneficial if the shoes being sold are of good quality or from a renowned brand, as this could potentially increase their market value. Moreover, selling items that are still in good condition instead of throwing them away helps to reduce waste. It's a great example of the concept of a circular economy, where items are reused or repurposed instead of being discarded, thus minimizing the amount of waste that goes to landfill. This can also contribute to resource efficiency, as it reduces the need to produce new items. Additionally, by selling the shoes, Austin is providing an opportunity for someone else to use and enjoy them. Many people appreciate the possibility of buying second-hand items for a variety of reasons - it's often more affordable than buying new, it's a method of sustainable consumption, and sometimes, it even implies finding unique or vintage items that aren't available in conventional stores.  Lastly, selling their unwanted items could be a learning experience for Austin. They're likely to develop skills such as negotiation and pricing methods, online advertising, customer service, and possibly even business management.  These are some of the outcomes that could result from Austin deciding to sell their shoes in the market. While it might not be a significant change in their life, it's definitely a step towards a more sustainable lifestyle, and it could also contribute to their personal development or financial situation. Ultimately, the result of these actions depends on multiple variables such as the demand for the shoes in the market, their condition and brand, and Austin's selling skills. But, in essence, Austin will mostly be making some money from this transaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. (CNN) -- A flurry of last-minute legal maneuvers Tuesday spared, for now, the life of John Ferguson, a Florida death row inmate who suffers from mental illness and at one point called himself the 'prince of God.'  Ferguson, a diagnosed schizophrenic convicted of killing eight people, was scheduled to get the lethal injection Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET at a Florida State Prison.  But an appeals court in Atlanta granted an emergency stay of execution Tuesday night.  Florida officials then asked the Supreme Court to allow the lethal injection to proceed. Just before midnight the high court denied Florida's request, keeping in place the stay of execution, according to court documents.  Some had questioned why authorities would kill a man who suffered from mental illness.  Laurel Bellows, the president of the American Bar Association, released a statement earlier Tuesday saying she was concerned about how thoroughly Ferguson's competency was evaluated.  \\"The American Bar Association is alarmed that Florida is poised to execute John Ferguson, a man diagnosed as severely mentally ill for more than 40 years, before the constitutionality of his execution is fully evaluated.\\"  Chris Handman, one of Ferguson's attorneys, told CNN. \\"We think the court should intervene to stop that execution from going forward.\\"  Handman said a court had earlier found that Ferguson was mentally ill and had delusions that caused him to think he is the \\"Prince of God.\\"  Ferguson is on death row for the murders of eight people in Hialeah and Carol City, Florida, in the late 1970s.

Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home!

Following on the heels of the band's global #1, \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, selling over 500,000 copies in the UK. In the United States, the song matched the #2 peak of its predecessor on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100, kept from #1 by \\"Flashdance... What a Feeling\\" by Irene Cara for 2 weeks.  - George Alan O'Dowd (born 14 June 1961), known professionally as Boy George, is an English singer, songwriter, DJ, fashion designer and photographer. He is the lead singer of the Grammy and Brit Award-winning pop band Culture Club. At the height of the band's fame, during the 1980s, they recorded global hit songs such as \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\" and \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and George is known for his soulful voice and androgynous appearance. He was part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the late 1970s to the early 1980s.  - Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'.   - \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\" is a song written and recorded by the British new wave band Culture Club. Released as a single in September 1982 from the group's platinum-selling debut album \\"Kissing to Be Clever\\", it was the band's first UK #1 hit. In the United States, the single was released in November 1982 and also became a huge hit, reaching #2 for three weeks.  - Mark Snow (born August 26, 1946) is an American composer for film and television, perhaps best known for his work with \\"The X-Files\\".  - Giovanni Giorgio Moroder (born 26 April 1940) is an Italian singer, songwriter, DJ and record producer. Moroder is frequently credited with pioneering Italo disco and electronic dance music.  - Italo disco (sometimes hyphenated, such as Italo-disco, subjected to varying capitalization, or abbreviated as Italo) is a genre of progressive music which originated in Italy and was mainly produced at the end of the 1970s to late-1980s. The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982. Italo disco faded in the early 1990s.  - The X-Files is an American science fiction horror drama television series created by Chris Carter, which originally aired from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002 on Fox. The program spanned nine seasons, included 202 episodes, and a feature film of the same name. Later in 2008, a was made and preceded a tenth season revival, which consisted of six episodes, in 2016. The series revolves around FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who investigate X-Files: marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to make scientific analyses of Mulder's discoveries to debunk his work and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a very few select people. They develop a close relationship which begins as a platonic friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series-spanning story arc, \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" episodes form roughly two-thirds of all episodes.  - DJ Dado ( born Flavio Daddato , 6 January 1967 ) is an Italian disc jockey and record producer who is mostly known for his remix of Mark Snow 's theme for X-Files , and for covering Giorgio Moroder 's \`\` The Legend Of Babel '' .

In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would case A have faster or slower air flow above it than case B?  Hint: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided, it can be concluded that case A, which represents the air flow as it would be in an airplane wing, would have faster air flow above it than case B, which represents the air flow as it would be in a race car spoiler. The reason for this difference can be explained using Bernoulli's law, which states that the pressure of a fluid decreases as its velocity increases. In an airplane wing, the shape causes the air to flow more quickly above the wing, and as a result, the air pressure is lower above the wing than below it. This difference in pressure generates lift, allowing the airplane to rise above the ground and maintain flight. On the other hand, a race car spoiler operates in the opposite manner. The shape of the spoiler causes the air to flow more slowly above it, resulting in greater air pressure above the spoiler than below it. This increased air pressure pushes the car downward, providing better traction between the wheels and the track surface, allowing the car to maintain stability and achieve higher speeds without losing contact with the track. Therefore, case A would have faster air flow above it, while case B would have slower air flow above it, as their respective designs serve different purposes in terms of manipulating air pressure and flow to achieve either lift for an airplane or increased traction for a race car."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States. There are over 500 federally recognized tribes within the U.S., about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaska Natives. The ancestors of modern Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia. After the Indian wars in the late 19th century, the government established Native American boarding schools, initially run primarily by or affiliated with Christian missionaries. At this time, American society thought that Native American children needed to be acculturated to the general society. The boarding school experience was a total immersion in modern American society, but it could prove traumatic to children, who were forbidden to speak their native languages. They were taught Christianity and not allowed to practice their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Native American identities.  Before the 1930s, schools on the reservations provided no schooling beyond the sixth grade. To obtain more, boarding school was usually necessary. Small reservations with a few hundred people usually sent their children to nearby public schools. The \\"Indian New Deal\\" of the 1930s closed many of the boarding schools, and downplayed the assimilationist goals. The Indian Division of the Civilian Conservation Corps operated large-scale construction projects on the reservations, building thousands of new schools and community buildings. Under the leadership of John Collier the BIA brought in progressive educators to reshape Indian education. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) by 1938 taught 30,000 students in 377 boarding and day schools, or 40% of all Indian children in school. The Navajo largely opposed schooling of any sort, but the other tribes accepted the system. There were now high schools on larger reservations, educating not only teenagers but also an adult audience. There were no Indian facilities for higher education. They deemphasized textbooks, emphasized self-esteem, and started teaching Indian history. They promoted traditional arts and crafts of the sort that could be conducted on the reservations, such as making jewelry. The New Deal reformers met significant resistance from parents and teachers, and had mixed results. World War II brought younger Indians in contact with the broader society through military service and work in the munitions industries. The role of schooling was changed to focus on vocational education for jobs in urban America.  Since the rise of self-determination for Native Americans, they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live. In addition, many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures. Beginning in the 1970s, tribes have also founded colleges at their reservations, controlled, and operated by Native Americans, to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures.

Please answer the following question: -  You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the aluminum recycling process might involve converting the rolled aluminum sheets into new aluminum products. After the ingots have been transported to another facility and rolled out to make them more manageable, the next step is to transform the aluminum sheets into new products, which involves cutting, shaping, and forming them into a variety of goods and applications. These aluminum products may include aluminum cans, foils, automotive parts, aircraft components, construction materials, and other everyday items that use aluminum. This conversion process can be carried out using various machinery and techniques, such as extrusion, casting, or stamping, depending on the specific requirements of the end product. Once the new aluminum products are manufactured, they are inspected for quality assurance and then packaged for distribution to retail stores, businesses, or other production facilities, where they can be used by consumers or integrated into further manufacturing processes. Thus, the last step of the aluminum recycling process is primarily concerned with transforming rolled aluminum sheets into a diverse range of new products, thereby completing the closed-loop recycling process and contributing to the conservation of resources and reduction of environmental impact associated with raw aluminum production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Unique Method of Protest: The Free Keene movement, which primarily consists of two dozen activists led by Ian Freeman, has made a splash in the city by targeting parking regulations. Members of the group approach parking enforcement officers, feed meters before 5 tickets can be written, and engage in discussions about their faith and military service while recording these interactions with video cameras. In addition, the group distributes leaflets condemning parking regulations and pretends to drink alcohol during City Hall meetings. Mixed Reactions from Residents: Some Keene residents have expressed gratitude and even made donations to the Free Keene movement. However, there have also been reports of harassment allegations and litigation against the group, causing discomfort amongst locals. A nurse and beekeeper living in Keene described the current atmosphere as being on edge. Leader’s Background and Controversies: Ian Freeman, originally from Florida, arrived in New Hampshire to promote libertarianism in a state whose license plates boldly declare \\"Live Free or Die.\\" Freeman’s activism has led to several arrests, one of which was for allegedly obtaining multiple identification cards from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Freeman also supports the use of video cameras to capture interactions with parking enforcement officers, arguing that if their job is too stressful, it may not be the right one for them. In addition to leading the Free Keene movement, Freeman also broadcasts a Free Talk Live radio show. Opposition to Free Keene Movement: The aggressive activism of the Free Keene movement has inspired the creation of the “Stop Free Keene!!!” Facebook page, where users have organized and distributed their own leaflets critiquing the movement. One opposing organizer questioned the group's intentions, asking, \\"Who asked you to come free us?\\" Conclusion: While the Free Keene movement's unique tactics have garnered attention and support, they have also created controversy and tensions within the city. In a town divided, it remains to be seen how the ongoing conflict between the libertarians and their opponents will play out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

La première période du concile a commencé le 11 octobre 1962 et s'est terminée le 8 décembre de la même année. Durant cette première session, les évêques et autres participants ont engagé des discussions sur les divers documents préparés à l'avance par la commission théologique. Ces débats portaient sur des sujets tels que la réforme liturgique, la nature de l'Église et la liberté religieuse. Cependant, la clôture de la première période n'a marqué que la fin des premières réflexions et débats sur ces questions importantes. Les trois sessions suivantes, qui se sont déroulées au cours des années suivantes, ont permis d'approfondir ces discussions et d'établir un ensemble de documents conciliaires qui traduisent les réformes et les engagements du Concile Vatican II.

Answer with text (not indexes). Context: Afghan (Pashto also Persian: ; see \\"etymology\\") refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country. Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, \\"Afghan\\" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan  Pashtuns, Tajiks, and also a large number of Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \\"Encyclopædia Iranica\\", the word Afghan (afn) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aymaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qezelbash, Gujjars, Brahui, and members of other tribes., Urbanization refers to the population shift from rural to urban areas, \\"the gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas\\", and the ways in which each society adapts to the change. It is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in central areas. The United Nations projected that half of the world's population would live in urban areas at the end of 2008. It is predicted that by 2050 about 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized. That is equivalent to approximately 3 billion urbanites by 2050, much of which will occur in Africa and Asia. Notably, the United Nations has also recently projected that nearly all global population growth from 2016 to 2030 will be absorbed by cities, about 1.1 billion new urbanites over the next 14 years., Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , \\"Afnistn\\"), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world., Pashto (; \\"Paxt\\" ), also known in older literature as Afghn or Pahn, is the South-Central Asian language of the Pashtuns. Its speakers are called Pashtuns or Pukhtuns and sometimes Afghans or Pathans. It is an Eastern Iranian language, belonging to the Indo-European family. Pashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, and it is the second-largest regional language of Pakistan, mainly spoken in the west and northwest of the country. Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are almost 100% Pashto-speaking, while it is the majority language of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern districts of Balochistan. Pashto is the main language among the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is estimated to be 4560 million people worldwide., Kabul (Pashto/) is the capital of Afghanistan as well as its largest city, located in the eastern section of the country. According to a 2015 estimate, the population of the city was around 3,678,033 which includes all the major ethnic groups.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The perturbation of leaving bread out in the air and its effect on global warming causing winters to be warmer can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process relating to animal hibernation. To fully understand the connection between these factors, let us break down the sequence of events. 1. Bread left out in the air: This act on its own doesn't have a significant impact on global warming. However, the production of bread and its ingredients (wheat, transportation, etc.) contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Global warming causes winters to be warmer: As greenhouse gas emissions increase due to various human activities, Earth's average temperature rises, leading to warmer winters in many regions. Now, let's examine the indirect impact of warmer winters on the animal hibernation process: A. Animals eat a lot during good (warm, clear) weather: Warmer winters can lead to an extension of the feeding season for certain animals, potentially resulting in increased food consumption and weight gain before hibernation. B. The season changes to one with bad (cold, snowy) weather: With warmer winters, the severity and duration of harsh winter conditions might be reduced. This could affect the timing and length of hibernation periods for some animals. C. Animals find a place to hibernate and enter hibernation: The alterations in weather patterns and temperatures might affect an animal's ability to find suitable hibernation sites or trigger hibernation at the appropriate time. D. Body processes slow down, heart rate and breathing rate slow, animal loses weight more slowly: Warmer ambient temperatures during winter may cause an animal's metabolic rate to remain more elevated than in colder conditions, possibly resulting in lower energy conservation during hibernation. E. The animal survives without eating or drinking: Since the overall hibernation process may be affected by warmer winters, an animal's ability to survive without food and water might be indirectly impacted. In conclusion, the act of leaving bread out in the air does not have a direct impact on the animal hibernation process. However, the indirect effects of global warming on winter temperatures can influence various steps in the hibernation process, altering the feeding patterns, hibernation timing, and energy conservation mechanisms for some animals."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: WACK AS H@# Review: This CD is totally wack, I cant belive I bought this crap.

Kim In Ryong claimed that North Korea had hoped for a nuclear-free world, however, due to the \\"extreme\\" threat from the US, the country has been forced to become a \\"full-fledged\\" nuclear power. The tensions between North Korea and the United States have escalated significantly, as North Korea continues to develop its nuclear capabilities. The country now claims that the \\"entire US mainland is within our firing range.\\" North Korea's nuclear program has been a significant cause of concern for the international community, with numerous countries, including the United States, South Korea, Japan, and China, urging Pyongyang to halt its aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons. In response to the substantial threat, the United Nations has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on North Korea, aiming to cut off sources of funding and support for the country's nuclear and ballistic missile development. Despite these sanctions, North Korea continues to test-launch ballistic missiles and carry out nuclear tests in direct defiance of the international community. While UN sanctions have had some impact on the North Korean economy, they have not deterred the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons. In fact, the situation has only grown more precarious, as evidenced by the increasing number and range of missile tests conducted by Pyongyang throughout the past year. As part of the international response to North Korea's nuclear ambitions, Russia has also committed to cutting ties with the country to comply with new UN sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced this decision recently, which may signify a substantial shift in global efforts to curb the North Korean nuclear threat. While Moscow has been seen as a long-time benefactor of North Korea, this latest move puts increased pressure on China – North Korea's primary ally – to become more proactive in handling the crisis. Another significant factor in the situation is the anticipated visit of US President Donald Trump to Asia next month, where he may visit the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea. This visit could heighten tensions between Washington and Pyongyang even further, potentially pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a tipping point. In conclusion, the complex web of geopolitics, diplomacy, and military threats surrounding the Korean Peninsula has escalated to new heights, with the potential for a catastrophic conflict becoming increasingly palpable. North Korea's efforts to perfect a long-range intercontinental missile capable of reaching the US mainland have intensified global anxieties and may only serve to push the two adversaries closer to the precipice of nuclear war. While diplomatic efforts are still ongoing, it remains uncertain what the future may hold and whether the prospects for peace on the Korean Peninsula can be secured."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sources disagree, though, on whether the comment came before or after Orlando's alleged attempt at a punch, which sadly missed Bieber. (Hilarious detail: The crowd reportedly cheered after the punch was thrown and Bieber left the scene.) TMZ explains why there's no love lost between Bloom and Bieber: First there were rumors of a possible flirtation between Kerr and Bieber after a 2012 Victoria's Secret fashion show, and then earlier this year, a photo was taken of Bloom hanging out with Bieber's ex (or, depending on the day, not-ex), Selena Gomez.

The reason they might not like each other is because there were rumors about Justin Bieber and Miranda Kerr being flirty at a fashion show in 2012, and Orlando Bloom hanging out with Selena Gomez, Justin's ex-girlfriend. The fight started because Orlando didn't want to shake Justin's hand, and then Justin said something rude. But a friend of Justin's says he didn't say anything and Orlando was just being mean.

A. call the police  B. doing drugs  C. new contacts  D. making new friends  E. plan  The best answer is A:","output":"In order to objectively select the best answer, let's analyze each option one by one: A. Call the police - This choice implies that the party is either illegal or dangerous in nature. While it's possible, it is not a guaranteed outcome for every alley party. B. Doing drugs - Again, there is an assumption that alley parties are only associated with drug use. While this might be the case sometimes, it should not be generalized to all situations. C. New contacts - It is possible to meet new people at any social gathering, including alley parties. This choice seems reasonable, but let's check the other options before making a decision. D. Making new friends - Similar to 'new contacts,' making new friends is a probable outcome of attending a party. However, this also depends on the type of party and the individual's ability to socialize. E. Plan - This option is unclear about what it is referring to, and it does not directly answer the question about what is likely to happen during an alley party. Based on the options and an objective analysis, it seems that making new friends (D) or establishing new contacts (C) would be the most likely outcomes. However, since social events can vary, and some alley parties could involve negative activities that might discourage friendship building (such as drugs or violence), I would select 'C.

Given the below context:  In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Question: \\"Who were the jihadists that met in Germany and determined that fluency in English would better their odds in a successful attack on the US?\\" Response: \\"Atef, KSM, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Since german shepherds large, active dogs and are known to have hips that give out, it's important to make sure they have good nutrition throughout their lives. Make sure to buy healthy food that is not full of filler ingredients.","output":"Taking care of a German Shepherd involves a combination of proper nutrition, regular exercise, grooming, socialization, and preventive healthcare, among other essentials. Below are some detailed steps to ensure your German Shepherd leads a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 1. Feed your German Shepherd high-quality food: As you've already mentioned, nutrition plays a crucial role in your dog's overall health. Choose a food specifically designed for German Shepherds, consisting of high-quality ingredients like real meat, vegetables, and whole grains rather than by-products and fillers. The food should contain the appropriate balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals for your dog's age, size, and activity level. Consult your veterinarian for specific recommendations based on your dog's unique needs. 2. Establish a regular feeding schedule: Feed your adult German Shepherd twice daily, dividing the recommended daily amount of food between the two meals. Be consistent with feeding times to establish a routine. Make sure to measure the food portions accurately to avoid overfeeding and obesity. Keep fresh water available for your dog at all times. 3. Exercise your German Shepherd daily: These dogs are known for their high energy levels and are bred to work. They need daily physical exercise to stay mentally and physically healthy. Schedule at least two 30-minute sessions of exercise every day, such as brisk walks, running, hiking, or playing fetch. Alongside physical exercise, engage in mental stimulation with activities like training exercises, puzzle toys, and indoor games. 4. Socialize your German Shepherd: Expose your dog to various people, other dogs, and environments from a young age to help them become well-adjusted and adaptable. Regular socialization helps prevent behavioral issues, such as fear-based aggression or anxiety. 5. Train your German Shepherd: Begin training at an early age and use positive reinforcement techniques to teach essential commands. This breed is intelligent and eager to learn, so don't limit your dog to just basic training—introduce agility courses, scent work, or other advanced options to keep their minds occupied. 6. Groom your dog regularly: German Shepherds have a thick double coat that requires brushing two to three times a week to remove dead hair, promote healthy skin, and minimize shedding. Regular brushing also strengthens the bond between you and your pet. Bathe your dog every two months or so to keep their coat clean, and check their nails, ears, and teeth regularly for potential issues. 7. Schedule regular veterinary appointments: Take your German Shepherd to a veterinarian for routine checkups, vaccinations, and parasite control measures. Regular exams help detect any health issues early on and ensure that your dog remains in the best possible condition. Discuss your dog's dietary needs and potential breed-specific health concerns with your vet. 8. Provide a comfortable living environment: Offer a comfortable, warm, and dry bed or sleeping area for your dog, and keep the temperature in your home at a comfortable level. Ensure that your German Shepherd has a safe, fenced outdoor space to move around and eliminate. 9. Spay or neuter your dog: If you don't intend to breed your German Shepherd, consider spaying or neutering them to avoid unwanted litters and some health issues, such as uterine infections or prostate problems.

Analyze the structure and content of each question. Question 1: \\"Who do you vote for president?\\" - This question asks about the person someone votes for as president, without specifying any time period or specific election. Question 2: \\"Which candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election do you support?\\" - This question specifically asks about a person's preferred candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 2. Compare the focus of each question. - Question 1 focuses on one's vote for president without any context. - Question 2 narrows down the context to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 3. Evaluate the similarities and differences. Similarities: - Both questions are about one's preferences in an election. - Both questions ask for the preferred candidate for a presidential position. Differences: - Question 1 does not have a specific time frame or election. - Question 2 is explicitly about the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? emotionally stirring","output":"The given review, \\"emotionally stirring,\\" suggests a positive opinion of the movie. Although the phrase is brief, it carries significant weight in terms of describing the movie-going experience. To begin with, the term \\"emotionally\\" implies that the movie was successful in evoking strong feelings and resonating with the audience on a deeper level. The usage of this word typically refers to a positive experience, as the emotions elicited by the movie must have been impactful enough for the reviewer to mention it. It is often considered a mark of quality for a movie or a work of art to provoke emotions, as it indicates the film's ability to engage viewers effectively. Additionally, the word \\"stirring\\" further supports the positive nature of the review. This suggests that the movie had a moving or even awakening effect on the reviewer, stirring their emotions or thoughts in some way. Much like the term \\"emotionally,\\" using \\"stirring\\" to describe a movie implies that the experience was likely thought-provoking and left a lasting impression on the viewer. This capacity to have a lasting impact can be interpreted as a compliment to the movie and contribute to its overall positive reception. In essence, the review appears to praise the movie for its success in eliciting a profound emotional response. The viewer found the film to be engaging and impactful, hence this review points towards a positive opinion of the movie. However, it is crucial to note that while the review is primarily positive, the emotional nature of the experience could vary among viewers, and different individuals may perceive the movie differently depending on their own personal interpretations or emotional connections. Nonetheless, based on the wording used in this review, it is safe to conclude that the reviewer has a positive opinion of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His senior year, Bomer received a scholarship for some of his monologue performances, which led to his acceptance at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Where he graduated in 2001, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, along with his friend and also actor Joe Manganiello. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did any of these lead to a big break in his career?","output":"Yes, Matthew Bomer's early acting experiences and education led to significant breaks in his career. His professional stage debut at age 17 in a production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire at the Alley Theatre in Houston marked the beginning of his acting career. Later on, his acceptance at Carnegie Mellon University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2001, provided him with the foundation and connections that ultimately helped him break into the entertainment industry.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Forcing yourself to feel happy without first validating your feelings of sorrow will lead to greater problems down the road. However, don’t use this as an excuse to get stuck in a rut; feel your sadness, acknowledge it, and use the wisdom you’ve gained from the experience to move on. It's possible you don't even know why you're feeling like this. Sometimes our minds get on a track all their own that we can't decipher. If this sounds like you, then take it as a cue that your logical brain has taken a little vacation and simply needs to be put back to work. Telling yourself to “think positive” can be pretty underwhelming advice, especially when the mortgage payment is due, the car breaks down, and life seems out of control. Instead of trying to convince yourself that your situation is just rosy, focus your energy on approaching the unpleasantness in a positive way. This starts with monitoring and reshaping your internal monologue.  If you catch yourself thinking, “I can’t believe I’m in this mess again,” correct the thought by adding, “but I’ll pull through just like I always do.” Keep correcting these negative statements until it becomes second-nature; after that, make it your goal to eliminate the negativity altogether. You can even write it down on paper to help you get it out and view it more objectively as you correct your thoughts. Doing this has been shown to have a number of health benefits -- including increased lifespan, a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and greater resistance to the common cold. Sometimes you may feel unsure of who you are. In these times, it can help to write down a values list to help you determine what drives you and motivates you in your life. This can also help you address problems that are causing negative feelings. To write a values list: Identify a time that you were the happiest, a time when you were the proudest, and a time when you were the most fulfilled or satisfied. Use these times to help you determine your top values. Then prioritize them in your daily life. Don't forget to reaffirm your values when you're feeling low. \\" This means not only your possessions (hot running water, a computer, a full refrigerator), but also the things that add value to your life (your friends, your hobbies, your convictions). Call it a \\"Gratitude List\\" because it's a list of what you're grateful for. Sometimes it's a little hard to be grateful when you're not in the right mood. To get the juices flowing, look at someone else' life. What should they be thankful for? Alright, now how many of those things do you have too? Probably quite a few. Take one minute to think about this question, \\"What is shame and how often is it useful?\\" Hopefully you came up with something like, \\"An emotion determined by society and rarely.\\" Because that'd be true! When you feel shame, you're worried about what others think of you. And where's the value in that?!  The second you start feeling a twinge of that feeling, grab it by its horns and analyze it. If you were 7 years old, would this bother you? If you were 70, would it bother you? How about if you lived in a different culture? Chances are you'd be able to answer \\"no\\" to all those questions. Your reasons for shame have been taught to you for no good reason. Get 'em out of your brain to make room for useful feelings! If you find that shame is a constant in your life, consider seeking professional help from a therapist. Spend a whole day in your PJs relaxing, get into a good book, and don't let anyone disturb you. If you don’t have time for this type of mini-escape, listen to an audiobook while driving to work or riding the bus. Keep your mind focused on something besides your negativity. It's easy to forget that we can control our minds. They are us, we are not them (in a manner of speaking). If you give your mind a new world to take it, you'll get a new world out. Relaxing and distracting yourself is the first step to finding a new outlook.","output":"This article is about learning to acknowledge and cope with negative feelings, improving our thoughts, and finding ways to be grateful and happy in life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With so many lists out there, who has time to read all of them?            Turns out: We do. But because you probably don't, we rounded up all the Top 10 lists we could find, smashed 'em together in a big spreadsheet, and spit out overall Top 10 lists for the year's best albums, songs, books and movies. You're welcome.      Methodology            The Top 10 Songs Of 2018      10. Drake — 'Nice For What'      \\"Prepare to play this song at every single one of your pre-games. It's a certified head-banger, and makes our list of top music videos of the year for its star-studded cameos, including Yara Shahidi, Rashida Jones, Issa Rae, Tiffany Haddish, Olivia Wilde, Emma Roberts, Misty Copeland, and more.\\" [Marie Claire]      9. Ariana Grande — 'no tears left to cry'      \\"It begins as a quailing power ballad before shaking that mood off in favour of a sassy pop strut, showing that the only way out from rock bottom is up. By making statements such as this and 'Thank U, Next' part of her public grapple with trauma, Grande is crafting her own bracingly resilient narrative.\\" [The Guardian]      8. Robyn — 'Honey'      \\"Drizzled in synth, pulsing like a heartbeat, 'Honey' is where pop's lovelorn dancefloor queen delivers ecstasy merely by promising it. The song overwhelms with glittery intimacy but keeps its own secrets.\\" [Pitchfork]      7. Travis Scott — 'Sicko Mode'      \\"[I]t's one of the most exciting rap songs of the decade, and it telegraphs its attempts to be one of the most exciting songs of the decade by tapping en vogue producers like Cardo and Tay Keith, 'A Fever You Can't Sweat Out'–type beat switches, Drake, and Swae Lee in the margins.\\" [The Ringer]      6. Janelle Monáe — 'Make Me Feel'      \\"With the click of her tongue, Janelle Monáe reminded everybody in 2018 why she so naturally takes up the mantle of Prince... The singer co-wrote this infectious lead single with Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson, and Justin Tranter, resulting in a soulful, retro-funky groove that sizzles and vibrates, with a sensuous music video to match: So good and so f—ing real.\\" [EW]      5. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper — 'Shallow'      \\"Really, the magic of 'Shallow' is that it is several things all at once. There's the song itself, which serves as a reminder that Gaga is one of the great vocalists of our time. There's the song as a plot point, which launches us into one of the most cuckoo bananas movies of the year. And there is the song, but mostly the wail, as a cultural moment. There were few better moments of catharsis this year than playing this song with a group of friends and listening to them belt their hearts out.\\" [The Fader]      4. Childish Gambino — 'This Is America'      \\"Childish Gambino wrote the new national anthem in blood this year and it left a permanent stain. But thank God we can dance to it. Let's thank America, too.\\" [NPR]      3. Cardi B — 'I Like It'      \\"With her storied fairytale come-up, Cardi would be the one to inject new thrill into flexing wealth, a hip-hop tradition as time-honored as the genre itself.\\" [Billboard]      2. The 1975 — 'Love It If We Made It'      \\"'Love It If We Made It' is the sound of this moment in time because of its zeitgeisty lyrics of course, but it's also because of how they are communicated: an endless scroll of tweets and headlines with no space for thought or emotion before the next one rolls into view. Levelled, loud, persistent. The song itself is a monolith, maximalist to the extreme. Each electronic trill and whoosh is like digital overspill from the overpacked whole. Collapse is a constant threat.\\" [Line of Best Fit]            1. Ariana Grande — 'Thank U, Next'      \\"[It's] the anthem 2018 deserves: Rather than zap the pain from memory, Grande assesses the damage — specifically, her history with love — and rebuilds from the ground up, rekindling her most crucial relationship: Ariana and Ariana. Though she gives her exes their flowers, do not mistake this for a song about men; it's dedicated to the woman at the eye of their storm who survived.\\" [Vulture]      Honorable Mention      Kacey Musgraves and Mitski were their own worst enemies, placing a variety of songs on top 10 lists, with no single song racking enough votes to crack the top 10. But they clock in at 12 and 13:      11. Ella Mai — 'Boo'd Up'      12. Kacey Musgraves — 'Slow Burn'      13. Mitski — 'Nobody'      14.

Click here to see selections for every subject and more. Photo: Photo-illustration: Maya Robinson/Vulture and Photos by Getty Images      There is no denying that we currently have more music immediately available to us than at any other point in the history of recorded music. This is a gift and a curse: There’s so much good stuff out there, but there’s also just so much stuff. As such, top-ten lists like this serve a dual purpose. On one hand, these are ten songs that altered the course of popular music as we understand it, and the hope here is to emphasize that fact. On the other hand, these are also just very good songs, even devoid of the context of where they sit in the 2018 musical canon. These are either the very best songs of the year, or ten of many very best songs of the year, but they’re here because they are undeniable jams, or they said something about who we are or the world we live in. In a couple cases, they just held up really well.      10. The Carters, “Apeshit”      In Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s world, black opulence isn’t a luxury but the standard. “Apeshit,” a “Niggas in Paris” for 2018 where Bey out-raps both members of the original Throne, outlines its master plan for dismantling the racial class divide brazenly: trade debt for equity, calculate your worth then triple it, and flex accordingly. Who knew you could have the run of the Louvre until Bey and Hov unlocked the doors? “Apeshit” functions as a petri dish of aspirational candy for a generation to devour, a gold mine of Migos-brand gaudiness and one-percenter reverie that remains in awe of its own excess (“I can’t believe we made it,” the Carters repeat). That Bey can reduce her own rap legend of a husband into background hype man for her own dizzying bars (“She went crazy!” he ad-libs) only further serves their point: The time for abiding by limitations is over. —Dee Lockett      9. Travis Scott ft. Drake, “Sicko Mode”      No one was surprised that “Sicko Mode” was good. It’s Drake and Travis Scott in top form: Drake manages to make reminiscing about how he used to take the bus to dances in high school, but now takes Xanax to go to sleep on the plane, sound like the biggest come-up in the world, instead of just, like, some adult shit that happens because everyone — including Drake — is anxious and tired all the time. But “Sicko Mode” ultimately shines as the centerpiece of Astroworld, an album that is credited to Travis Scott alone, but is actually more of an ensemble piece that welds blown-out bass to blurry organ runs and sucks the entire history of hip-hop into a psychedelic universe grounded by absolutely nothing at all. “Sicko Mode” changes up so much that it sounds like it’s a million minutes long, and that isn’t a bad thing. —Sam Hockley-Smith      8. The 1975, “Love It If We Made It”      If every generation needs its clarion call to address the times, Matty Healy won’t give it to this one the way history’s used to. The 1975’s “Love It If We Made It” takes stock of all that is wrong with the world in the language that speaks loudest to this Zeitgeist: by shouting, sans context, references to the headlines of the last two years. From Lil Peep’s death, to the Syrian refugee crisis, to quoting Donald Trump praising Kanye West, and also the time Trump said “moved on her like a bitch,” our societal grievances are all presented in one giant clusterfuck of a scrawl. But what to do about it? This is not a diagnosis with an antidote. Healy proposes no action, just sentiment: hope that we’ll make it out of this alive. It’s all there’s really left to say. —D.L.      7. Pusha T, “If You Know You Know”      A great bane of social media is that too many people using it know too little about the history of what they’re speaking on. Case in point: Pusha T, whom the uninitiated thought to be acting out of pocket when he dropped the bomb about Drake’s secret son in his juicy diss track over the summer. How did this guy, a supposed relic of the Clipse days to anyone under the age of, say, 25, acquire that kind of intel? “If You Know You Know” won’t answer that (though he did eventually reveal his sources) because Push is the rap type whose old-school ethos trades in quiet, calculated movements, the code of the streets he used to run. If you know Push’s story, then you’ll know how he’s always finessed the game to put himself in the position of those in the know. If you don’t, you’ll just have to take his word for it. —D.L.      6. Kacey Musgraves, “Slow Burn”      There’s a specific quality to a Kacey Musgraves turn of phrase that she’s perfected over the years: featherweight verses heavy with emotion. “Slow Burn” comes at you like a long exhale after a lifetime of breathing in hot air. “Good in a glass, good on green / good when you’re putting your hands all over me” are maybe all things you’re not supposed to say when you’re a woman in country music, but Musgraves has never cared much for tradition and gatekeeping. If she wants to take the edge off life a bit — and shed some of the self-seriousness of this genre while she’s at it — by sparking up a blunt paired with a stiff glass of whiskey, she will. Her life, her career, on her terms. Musgraves knows exactly who she is and what kind of artist she wants to be and, amazingly, even so, will keep pace with everyone else while they’re still catching up to where she’s at: “Taking my time, let the world turn.” —D.L.      5. Robyn, “Human Being”      You know those videos of those Boston Dynamics robots that all for some reason look like large dogs and move so fluidly that for a brief second you can envision a very near future (maybe tomorrow?) where they take over and suddenly America is run by a robot with four legs and no discernible face? “Human Being,” a song about a probably not-so-distant-future (also maybe tomorrow?) where AI is the majority, and run-of-the-mill humans with hearts and blood, etc. are the minorities, is not about those robots, but if it were then it would probably lose some of its emotional resonance, of which there is quite a bit. To wit: If you listen to this song without knowing that Robyn wrote it after reading Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and began to compare that book’s description of humans’ relationship to animals to a hypothetical relationship we might have with AI, you’ll hear it as an affecting piece about emotional disconnect and what happens when we forget about the interior histories of those around us. In other words, it’s about the future, but it’s also about right now. —S.H-S.      4. Mitski, “Nobody”      Written while Mitski was on a very long tour and was stranded in Malaysia over the holidays due to the evils of capitalism (very expensive plane tickets), and a misguided idea that because she’d spent a lot of time there as a kid she’d feel at home as an adult, “Nobody” is about being completely alone. It is also about time-zone-based alienation and the primal desire to just have someone around when you’re at your loneliest. The disco backbeat prevents it from veering into mopey territory, and also helps make a case for the song as an instant classic. You know the kind: It’s new, but may as well have been a radio staple for the last 40 years. —S.H-S.      3. Juice WRLD, “Lucid Dreams”      If Juice WRLD never makes another great song, he will always have “Lucid Dreams,” which crashes the best (and a couple of the worst) parts of the Ghosts of Emo’s Past with a fluid, singsong flow that sounds like a run-on sentence. Yes, this song is built on a sample of Sting’s “Shape of my Heart,” but the appeal of the song is all Juice WRLD. It’s not what he’s saying — which is at times rote (“You were my everything / Thoughts of a wedding ring.” Come on, man!) and at other times heartbreaking (“I take prescriptions to make me feel okay.” That vocal lilt!) Basically, it’s not perfect, but it is still great. —S.H-S.      2. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, “Shallow”      We don’t need to wonder about when Bradley Cooper first knew he had a hit on his hands, because in interviews he talks about A Star Is Born like it was the movie he was destined to make, and we were all destined to love with the same furor the entire population of the year 1997 had for Titanic. Still, it’s surprising that the songs were, well, so good. “Shallow” is the song that everyone you know loves: your old college roommate, that snobby dude who cloaks his love of big hits in karaoke performances he pretends are ironic, your mom, her sister, your dad, and probably your small child, pet, fish, or other living thing whose thoughts are not easily communicable, too. “Shallow” is undeniably the hit of the movie, and a major song in general, and it’s due to the interplay between Lady Gaga and Cooper. Gaga in particular soars (is there a more triumphant moment than around 2:33 into the track?), but it’s a testament to the power of this song that even the fake crowd noise sounds legit. Cooper may have manufactured the triumphant moment as a plot point in his movie, but it has officially crossed over into reality. —S.H-S.      1. Ariana Grande, “Thank U, Next”      Following a year that culturally conditioned people to feed off of spite and vengeance, Ariana Grande decided for the public good to end it with an alternative: maturity. The past year and a half for Grande has been defined by more tragedy than most will encounter in a lifetime, from the Manchester massacre to the sudden death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller to the fast rise and faster fall of her relationship with former fiancé Pete Davidson. She’d already released one album this year, Sweetener, trying to rebound from the bombing, but then every other shoe that could drop did so with a seismic thud. Musicians create to pull through, so Ari returned to the studio to make a whole other forthcoming album, Thank U, Next. Its title track is the anthem 2018 deserves: Rather than zap the pain from memory, Grande assesses the damage — specifically, her history with love — and rebuilds from the ground up, rekindling her most crucial relationship: Ariana and Ariana. Though she gives her exes their flowers, do not mistake this for a song about men; it’s dedicated to the woman at the eye of their storm who survived. So 2018 will go down as the year that Ariana Grande entered pop immortality. What can she possibly do next? —D.L. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The article presents a list of the top 10 songs of 2018, compiled from various sources. The list is as follows: 1.

As seems to be the general gist of these comments, the film has some stunning animation (I watched it on blu-ray) but it really falls short of any real depth. Firstly the characters are all pretty dull. I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (Laputa being my favourite animé, original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who seems oblivious of this). However she promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more \\"happy\\".  There is also a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the druids really? Are they people? and who are the weird women/girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest? There is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers. The plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this. It is almost like a weird version of The Day of the Triffids. And who does call Toola? why bother with this if it wont be explained? I really wanted to like this film but I found the plot no where near as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having any real character like those of Miyazaki. I do not resent watching it but I do sort of wish I hadn't bought it. My advice? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow it, or buy it cheap! Perhaps if your new to animé films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it. It certainly is visually pleasing.

While the reviewer acknowledges the stunning animation and visual aspects of the film, they express disappointment with the dull characters, lack of depth, and unanswered questions in the plot.

Information:  - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins.  - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\"  - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.  - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist.  - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.  - Island in the Sea is a 1987 album by country singer Willie Nelson . Its title track was a minor hit .

Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Question: Who plays Emily Hacker? Movie title: Manhattan Baby Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On holiday in Egypt with George and Emily Hacker (Christopher Connelly and Martha Taylor), her archaeologist father and journalist mother, ten-year-old Susie Hacker (Brigitta Boccoli) is approached by a mysterious blind woman who gives her an amulet. Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find. The next day, the woman drops the Polaroid down to Mrs. Hacker from a window overlooking the pavement. Marcato's name and phone number are written...

Hypothesis: Man  is DJing. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, based on the given premise, we can conclude the hypothesis. To explain this conclusion in a detailed manner, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their core components. Premise: 1. Man wearing a blue shirt: This part of the premise specifies the subject's appearance, i.e., a man who has a blue shirt on. 2. DJing: In this context, DJing refers to the activity in which the man is involved. The man is performing as a DJ, controlling music and creating a curated aural experience for listeners or a crowd of people. Hypothesis: 1. Man: The hypothesis states the general subject, that is, the man, regardless of his shirt color or what he is doing. 2. DJing: Again, this refers to the action the man is performing within the hypothesis. Now, when a hypothesis is being deduced from a premise, it is crucial to determine whether the given information in the premise supports or logically leads to the hypothesis. In this case, the premise states that a man is wearing a blue shirt and is DJing. The hypothesis states that a man is DJing. The action of DJing present in both the premise and hypothesis remains consistent. The only notable difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the description of the subject's appearance (the blue shirt). However, the color of the shirt is irrelevant to whether the man is DJing or not. The action of DJing is not dependent on the color of the shirt worn by the subject. As a result, given that the hypothesis 'Man is DJing' matches the action of DJing provided in the premise 'Man wearing a blue shirt is DJing,' we can confidently conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But I had a crippling fear of going where? - outside - vacation - idle - apartment - neighborhood  The best answer is","output":"The best answer given your description of a crippling fear would be \\"outside,\\" which is, in general, a fear of leaving the safety and familiarity of one's home and engaging with the world beyond. It is important to examine why this fear may be crippling and how it can be understood and addressed. A crippling fear of going outside can be attributed to agoraphobia, which is an anxiety disorder characterized by an irrational fear of being in open or public spaces. Individuals with agoraphobia often experience extreme anxiety when confronted with situations where they feel exposed, unsafe, or unable to escape. This anxiety can manifest in physical symptoms, such as panic attacks, and can become so debilitating that affected individuals may become housebound. This fear can be caused by a variety of factors, such as past traumatic experiences, heightened anxiety, or an entrenched pattern of avoidance and negative thinking. When faced with the prospect of going outside, individuals may experience a range of concerns, from specific fears like encountering a particular situation or person to more general apprehensions about losing control while away from their home. If you find yourself crippled by the fear of going outside, it is important to seek professional help from a mental health professional. A psychologist or therapist with experience in anxiety disorders can work with you to develop a tailored plan for addressing your fears and guiding you towards an increased level of independence in your daily life. Some common strategies for addressing the fear of going outside include: 1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This form of therapy helps individuals identify the root causes of their fears, challenge irrational thoughts, and develop strategies for managing their anxiety in a healthy and constructive manner. 2. Exposure therapy: Gradually exposing individuals to situations that trigger their fears can help to desensitize them to these anxieties and build confidence in their ability to cope with such circumstances. 3. Breathing and relaxation techniques: Mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation can help individuals manage their anxiety symptoms and develop techniques for calming themselves when faced with stressors. 4. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help manage the symptoms of anxiety and facilitate therapeutic progress. 5. Support system: Developing a strong support system of friends, family members, and professionals who understand and validate the individual's experiences can be invaluable in the process of overcoming agoraphobia. While it might be tempting to avoid the situations that trigger your fear of going outside, it is essential to confront these anxieties in order to regain control of your life. By working with a mental health professional, you can develop an understanding of your specific fears and establish a plan for moving forward with greater confidence and self-assurance."},{"instruction":"Title: VHS is a dead media format Review: Mighty Max is an awesome show and needs to make the transition to DVD soon.

To do this, we need to move the constants to the other side of the equation. To shift the constant -75638 to the left side of the equation, we can add 75638 to both sides. This gives: 37955 + 75638 = -3917*j Step 2: Simplify the equation. Combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation: 113593 = -3917*j Step 3: Solve for j. To find the value of j, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of -3917: 113593 / (-3917) = (-3917*j) / (-3917) Step 4: Calculate the value of j.

Options: - sporting goods store - sears - pool - sporting event - school  Explain why a human would choose \\"sporting goods store\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"A human would choose \\"sporting goods store\\" to answer the question above because a sporting goods store primarily focuses on selling a wide range of sports equipment, gear, and accessories. These stores are designed to cater specifically to the needs of individuals who are looking to buy equipment for various sports and fitness activities. Here are the reasons why each of the other options may not be suitable: 1. Sears: While Sears is a department store that sells a variety of items, including some sports equipment, it does not specialize in this area. As a result, the selection of sports equipment at Sears might be limited compared to a sporting goods store. 2. Pool: A pool is a place where people go to swim and is not a store or a location where someone can buy sports equipment. While there might be some pool-related equipment available at a pool, it does not offer a comprehensive range of sports equipment. 3. Sporting event: A sporting event is a competition or game involving teams or individuals participating in a specific sport. Although some sporting events have booths or stands that sell team merchandise and basic sports equipment, the primary focus of the event is the competition, and the selection of sports equipment available would be limited compared to a dedicated sporting goods store. 4. School: A school is an educational institution where students learn various subjects, and while schools might have sports facilities and equipment for their students, they do not typically sell sports equipment to the general public. In summary, a human would choose a sporting goods store to get sports equipment because it is a specialized store that offers a broad selection of equipment for various sports, making it the ideal place to find and purchase any sports gear they may need."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers.

Question: Given the following context:  It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

Together, they must locate a stolen artifact that is essential to the stability of the criminal underworld. Unknown to them, they are being manipulated by forces within their own organization with motives that could bring their entire world crashing down around them. Act 1: A mysterious and powerful artifact, known as the Alloy of Trust, is stolen from the safehouse of a notorious crime lord, Carlo Ricci. The artifact is said to possess the power to unite the criminal underworld, and whoever controls it, holds the loyalty of organizations from across all major cities. The loss of the artifact leaves a power vacuum in the criminal world, with different factions vying for control. Carlo Ricci is desperate to reclaim the missing artifact to restore his power and control. He instructs his most trusted henchmen to join forces with Vinnie, an outsider whose cunning and street smarts could help locate the missing item faster. Act 2: Carlo Ricci's henchmen, along with Vinnie, start their search for the Alloy of Trust. They proceed to visit bars and underground gambling dens, trying to gather information through bribes, threats, and coercion. In a seedy bar on the outskirts of town, they learn that a rival gang, the Black Hand, is rumored to be behind the Artifact's theft. They decide to infiltrate the Black Hand to find out more. During this time, we see glimpses of an inner tension between Vinnie and the henchmen. Carlo Ricci's crew initially did not want Vinnie to be part of their mission, believing him to be untrustworthy. But as Vinnie proves his worth, he gradually starts gaining their loyalty and respect. However, Vinnie always seems to be one step ahead, as if he knows more than he is letting on. As they infiltrate the Black Hand, it becomes apparent that the rival gang does indeed have possession of the Alloy of Trust. But Vinnie and the henchmen discover that the theft of the artifact was actually orchestrated by someone within Carlo Ricci's own organization, who has been secretly working with the Black Hand to usurp and take down Ricci. Act 3: Vinnie and the henchmen make a choice – they decide to bring this traitor to justice to restore Carlo Ricci's power and regain control of the criminal underworld. They devise a plan to ambush the traitor and the rival gang during an exchange of the Alloy of Trust. In the climax of the movie, a thrilling gunfight ensues between Vinnie, the henchmen, the vengeful traitor, and the rival gang members. Our protagonists emerge victorious against all odds, retrieving the Alloy of Trust, and presenting it back to Carlo Ricci. In a surprise twist, it is revealed that Vinnie was an undercover agent assigned to infiltrate the criminal underworld and dismantle it from the inside. He presents vital evidence to law enforcement, leading to the arrest of the traitor, Carlo Ricci, and several members of the criminal organizations. However, in order to preserve the loyalty he built with Carlo Ricci's henchmen, Vinnie helps them escape from imprisonment, preserving their respect for him, and completing his mission to rid the city of organized crime. The movie ends with Vinnie disappearing into the night, leaving his criminal past behind, and the henchmen, now free and loyal to him, given a second chance to reform their lives. The true power of the Alloy of Trust is revealed in the end as it brought out the loyalty among men where none thought was possible."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Media playback is not supported on this device Go to a restaurant in this pretty Belgian town, and all the diners know her. They come over to congratulate her on winning two medals at the 2016 Rio Paralympics; she raises a glass to a family celebrating a birthday. For a few hours, she's the life and soul of the party. But, at 37, the Belgian wheelchair racer suffers such pain she wakes her neighbours by screaming in the night. As she watches her precious, fiercely defended independence dwindling, she has planned her own death. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, and eight years ago Vervoort signed the papers which will, eventually, allow a doctor to end her life. It's not that she wants to die. She wants to live. But she wants to live on her terms. It is three months since she won silver and bronze at her second Paralympics and Vervoort is still the toast of Diest, where a large billboard bearing an image of her face declares the town is \\"so proud\\" of her. We're greeted at the door of her specially adapted flat by Zenn, Vervoort's assistance labrador. Nurses come in four times a day to tend to Vervoort's medical needs, but Zenn gives her mistress an extra degree of independence, fetching items and helping her dress. She is, most of all, a mood-enhancer. \\"When I'm happy, she's happy,\\" says Vervoort. \\"When I'm mad, she's scared, and she goes to sit in another part of the house so she's not bothering me. When I'm crying, she'll come to lie down with me, lick my face, hug me. \\"When I'm going to have an epileptic attack, she pushes her head between my knees. She is saying to me, 'Marieke, you have to lay down. Go to a safe spot because something is going to happen to you.'\\" The walls of her flat are crammed with framed photos and paintings of her winning moments, while medals, trophies, and bottles of champagne jostle for space on cupboards and counter tops. Her achievements have been hard won. A progressive, incurable spinal condition, diagnosed when she was 21, ravages her body and no two days are the same. \\"I know how I feel now, but I don't know how I'll feel after half an hour,\\" she says. \\"It can be that I feel very, very bad, I get an epileptic attack, I cry, I scream because of pain. I need a lot of painkillers, valium, morphine. \\"A lot of people ask me how is it possible that you can have such good results and still be smiling with all the pain and medication that eats your muscles. For me, sports, and racing with a wheelchair - it's a kind of medication.\\" Just getting to the start line in Rio was an achievement. In 2013, a racing accident left her shoulder so badly damaged a doctor told her she would never reach the top again. To that, as to so many setbacks in life, her response was a defiant hand gesture. \\"I turned my bed into a gym - physio, elastic belts,\\" she says. \\"I was doing my own physio, my own exercises. After the rehabilitation, I broke three world records.\\" She went back to her doctor and thanked her for telling her she would not reach the top again. \\"You gave me the power to fight back like an animal,\\" she told her doctor. \\"You make my mind only stronger.\\" The silver medal in the T52 400m in Rio came after 30 hours of violent sickness and a day on a rehydrating drip in the Paralympic village. The bronze in the 100m came after a bladder infection sent her temperature soaring. She said they were medals with two sides - happy and sad. \\"I can't imagine a better way to end your career, but also there's a side of sadness, to say goodbye to the sports that I love,\\" she explains. \\"Other people stop with their sports because they say they don't want to do it any more. I have to stop because my mind says yes, go further, you still can do it. But my body cries, says help, stop training, you break me.\\" To get a fuller picture of the athlete known as 'The Beast from Diest', we travel to see her close friend Lieve Bullens, the woman Vervoort calls her 'Godmother'. Ask Vervoort's friends and family to describe her and they will use a variety of adjectives. Determined, independent, joyful, stubborn. I would add funny, thoughtful and a terrible back-seat driver. The constant threat of an epileptic episode and her deteriorating sight mean she is no longer allowed to drive her car, emblazoned with her picture, fist punching the air after another race win. I take the wheel. It's clear my caution is damaging her image as Belgium's fastest woman on three wheels. \\"You are driving like an old woman! Ha ha ha!\\" Bullens welcomes us into a house which is part home, part Buddhist retreat. Large windows overlook the winter garden, drums and dreamcatchers are suspended from the ceiling. The open cooking range has been converted into a candle-laden altar. It's the perfect place to recuperate from the stress of the car journey. Vervoort met Bullens, a mental coach and therapist, when competing at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman triathlon for para-athletes. Triathlon had become her passion when the onset of her disease made her reliant on a wheelchair. She was para-triathlon world champion twice, but in 2008 her condition deteriorated to such an extent she had to give up the sport. It was the lowest point in her life. The pain was agonising, the loss of independence insupportable. She told her friend she wanted to kill herself. \\"She said 'there's no point in living, no point in going on because it's too hard, it's too bad',\\" Bullens says. But Vervoort's psychologist recommended she speak to Dr Wim Distelmans, a leading palliative care expert. He suggested an alternative option: euthanasia. Euthanasia - in which a doctor intervenes to end a life - has been legal in Belgium since 2002. It is available only if a patient has an incurable condition, is in unbearable pain, and is able to make a rational decision to request it, and even then two doctors have to agree it is the correct course of action. In 2015, MPs in the UK rejected the Assisted Dying Bill, which would have allowed some terminally ill adults to end their lives with medical supervision. Bullens was the first person Vervoort told about her decision. She is also the person she wants with her when she dies. \\"I immediately supported her,\\" Bullens says. \\"She is stubborn. She knows what she wants. But she also knows what she doesn't want. A living hell is not the life that she wants. \\"I immediately had the feeling it was something that she could control, and if she had control of her life, she would live longer. The pain is always there. She doesn't have to wait for the pain to have an end for her life. She says to the pain - I decide when to go. Not you.\\" In the hall of Bullens' house is a wall upon which friends and guests have written inspirational messages. But, until now, not Vervoort. She puts that right. It's a painful process, as her hands are beginning to fail her. Bullens knows it's a precious moment. \\"The woman who's writing it is forever in my heart,\\" she says. \\"She's not forever physically. It's a peaceful thought that she will go in a beautiful way, and not a hard way. In a strong way.\\" Jos and Odette Vervoort are no different to many proud sporting parents, travelling extensively to support their daughter. They get out a photo album of memorable moments on Copacabana Beach, Sugarloaf Mountain, and - the highlight - Vervoort being presented with her silver medal and getting a hug from Princess Astrid of Belgium. They've watched their sporty child grow into a world-beating adult. Like all parents, they know they need to let their child go. But for them, letting go means having to support her decision to end her life with euthanasia. \\"She's always been independent,\\" Jos says. \\"When she came in a wheelchair, she was frightened she would live all her life as a disabled person with mum and dad under the same roof. \\"You can see her situation, you are realistic, and you say yes, if she feels better with [the decision to choose euthanasia], I can live with it. \\"In the beginning we knew it was a decision for the future. Now we know the future is coming near. \\"It may be a question of months, a question of years. But we see as she becomes more dependent, it becomes more difficult.\\" Her parents don't know, and she doesn't know, when the moment will come. What is clear is she is not ready for it yet. She has given up wheelchair racing and taken up indoor sky diving - the vertical wind tunnel allows her battered body a sense of precious freedom - with the aim of doing an unassisted dive from a plane. She wants to fly in a stunt plane, and bungee jump from a bridge. She loathes not being able to drive her car, but her friends, family and Zenn give her much to live for. \\"I'm the richest girl in the world,\\" she says. \\"I'm a real rich girl, a really lucky person, even with this miserable, ugly disease which I hate.\\" Is she afraid of dying? \\"No, if you asked me 10 years ago, do you want to do a bungee jump - are you crazy? I'm not afraid any more. I risk everything, and I love it, to do all these things, because I'm not afraid to die any more,\\" she says. \\"To me, death is peaceful, something that gives me a good feeling.\\" Vervoort's fridge is well stocked. Not with food on the day we're there, but with sparkling wine. She opens a bottle before dinner. It's part of her pain relief. We go to eat with her at a restaurant in Diest, where she is the guest of honour. She recommends the sizzling beef and the shrimp tagliatelle, both delicious. It's a great night. The next day we arrive to do one last interview but find Vervoort curled up on the couch, exhausted and barely conscious after a pain-racked night. She called the nurses in the early hours to administer morphine. Zenn keeps close to her mistress' side. It's hard to believe this is the irrepressible woman we spent the previous day with, and a stark reminder of how unpredictable her illness is. But 40 minutes later, she wants to talk again. We talk about the reason she chose euthanasia over suicide. \\"If I didn't have those papers, I wouldn't have been able to go into the Paralympics. I was a very depressed person - I was thinking about how I was going to kill myself,\\" she explains. \\"In England, I hope, and every country, they will look at euthanasia in another way - it's not murder. I'm the best example. It's thanks to those papers that I'm still living. \\"All those people who get those papers here in Belgium - they have a good feeling. They don't have to die in pain. They can choose a moment, and be with the people they want to be with. With euthanasia you're sure that you will have a soft, beautiful death.\\" The conversation finishes in gales of laughter when Zenn, sensing the mood, decides to lighten it by passing wind. Seconds later, Vervoort's eyes roll backwards. She's having an epileptic fit. We hit the red button and medical staff are there within a minute. It's become part of her life. A couple of hours later she is in Brussels, giving a motivational speech and saying yes to selfies and autographs for anyone who wants them. She is determined not to waste a second of the life she has remaining. She has planned her funeral, and it involves a lot of sparkling wine. She also knows what she wants her eulogy to say. \\"I prepared everything. I wrote to every person who's in my heart. I wrote to every person a letter when I could still do it with my hands,\\" she says. \\"I wrote texts that they have to read. I want that everybody takes a glass of Cava, [and toasts me] because she had a really good life. She had a really bad disease, but thanks to that disease, she was able to do things that people can only dream about, because I was mentally so strong. \\"I want people to remember that Marieke was somebody living day by day and enjoying every little moment.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"Belgian wheelchair racer Marieke Vervoort, who won two medals at the 2016 Rio Paralympics, suffers from a progressive, incurable spinal condition.

What is the answer to this question? what is the meaning of holy spirit in hebrew?","output":"To find the answer to what the meaning of the Holy Spirit is in Hebrew, I will perform the following steps: 1. Understand the term \\"Holy Spirit\\": The Holy Spirit is a term used in Christianity, describing a divine being that is part of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). The Holy Spirit is a presence and a guide for Christians, often associated with inspiration, comfort, wisdom, and the teaching of divine truth. 2. Identify the equivalent Hebrew terms: The Hebrew language has two primary terms associated with the concept of the Holy Spirit. - Ruach HaKodesh (רוּחַ הַקֹּדֶשׁ): Ruach means \\"Spirit\\" or \\"Wind,\\" and HaKodesh means \\"The Holy.\\" So, Ruach HaKodesh directly translates to \\"The Holy Spirit.\\" This term is prevalent in Jewish texts and, by extension, used in Hebrew translations of Christian texts as well. - Shekhinah (שכינה): Although not an exact equivalent of the Holy Spirit, Shekhinah refers to the divine presence or the \\"indwelling\\" of God in the world. This concept aligns with some aspects of the Holy Spirit in Christianity, particularly the idea of God's presence among people and providing guidance. So, the meaning of the Holy Spirit in Hebrew can be summarized as \\"Ruach HaKodesh,\\" which means \\"The Holy Spirit,\\" with some similarities to the concept of Shekhinah, denoting God's presence in the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Gustaf V was born in Drottningholm Palace in Ekero, Stockholm County, the son of Prince Oscar and Princess Sofia of Nassau. At birth Gustaf was created Duke of Varmland. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1872, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway. On 8 December 1907, he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian throne two years earlier. According to Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson during the Midsummer crisis, the King in a private conversation had threatened to abdicate if the Government did not approve a German request to transfer a fighting infantry division - the so-called Engelbrecht Division - through Swedish territory from southern Norway to northern Finland in June 1941, around Midsummer. The accuracy of this claim is debated, and the King's intention (if he did in fact make this threat) is sometimes alleged to be his desire to avoid conflict with Germany. This event has later received considerable attention from Swedish historians and is known as midsommarkrisen, the Midsummer Crisis.  Confirmation of the King's action is contained in German Foreign Policy documents captured at the end of the war. On 25 June 1941, the German Minister in Stockholm sent a \\"Most Urgent-Top Secret\\" message to Berlin in which he stated that the King had just informed him that the transit of German troops would be allowed. He added:  The King's words conveyed the joyful emotion he felt. He had lived through anxious days and had gone far in giving his personal support to the matter. He added confidentially that he had found it necessary to go so far as to mention his abdication.  According to Ernst Wigforss, both Gustaf V and Prince Gustav Adolf attempted to persuade the Swedish Government to allow the Allies to transport troops through Sweden, though this was rejected by the Government because it was felt it would cause retributions from Germany.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who are the communists demanding for the US to withdraw?  The War Game depicts the prelude to, and the immediate weeks of the aftermath of, a Soviet nuclear attack against Britain. The narrator says that Britain's current nuclear deterrent policy threatens a would-be aggressor with devastation from Vulcan and Victor nuclear bombers of the British V bomber force. The film begins on Friday, 16 September (presumably 1966; this date wouldn't appear again until 1977). A news report tells of a Chinese invasion of South Vietnam; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the US does not withdraw, the US does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two US Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin to counter this, but the Russian and East German forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. In order to turn the tide, President Johnson authorises the NATO commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. An escalating nuclear war results, during which larger Soviet strategic IRBMs are launched at Britain. The film remarks that many Soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fuelled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings. It hypothesises that in any nuclear crisis, the Soviet Union would be obliged to fire all of them as early as possible in order to avoid their destruction by counterattack, hence the rapid progression from tactical to strategic nuclear exchange.

Brad Drewett is reluctant to divulge exact numbers, but the ATP World Tour Finals is a big deal for men's tennis. The season-ending event, worth 5 million in prize money this year, is the tour's marquee event -- an elite eight-man showpiece that attracts top sponsors and acts as a massive advert for the game. \\"It's one the of the ATP's biggest assets,\\" longtime tournament director Brad Drewett told CNN during this week's round-robin matches. \\"For it to be a commercial success is extremely important for us.\\" Drewett, a 58-year-old former tennis prodigy, has been running the finals for more than a decade now. It came to London's glitzy O2 Arena -- best known as a concert venue -- in 2009 after Drewett took it back to Shanghai for three years. Rihanna to Rafa: Tennis gets popstar makeover. \\"The actual financial structure is a bit different. We have a partnership here with AEG, the owners of the O2, whereas in Shanghai we had a partnership with the municipal government who were very keen to have the event for the purpose of promoting China and Shanghai and also promoting the sport of tennis in China,\\" he said. \\"Here it was us wanting to bring the event back to the traditional market of Europe, and in particular London.\\" The UK capital has a contract until 2013, but doubts have been raised about the event's future on the banks of the River Thames due to complaints about British laws which require players to be taxed on all endorsements during the time they are in the country. The Lawn Tennis Association, which runs Wimbledon and is also an event partner of the ATP finals, is lobbying the government for an exemption. \\"If we lose events like this it will have a big impact not just on the economy but also on sponsors and television and in other areas,\\" LTA chief executive Roger Draper told the UK Press Association. Can Federer make finals history in London? Drewett said the ATP is happy for the event to stay in London, which is one of the ruling body's global headquarters alongside Florida, Sydney and Monte Carlo. \\"That decision won't be made until the second or third quarter of next year. That's a decision for our board. We're very happy here,\\" he said. \\"We have every reason to believe that next year and the following year will be just as popular.\\" More than 250,000 people attended the 17,500-capacity arena over eight days in the first two years, and sponsorship has \\"sold out\\" with title partner Barclays bank joined by luxury-goods brands such as Rolex, Lacoste and Moet & Chandon along with the likes of FedEx, South African Airways, Nissan, Ricoh and Italian power giant Enel. It is broadcast in the UK by public and subscription channels, and in more than 150 countries around the world. \\"It's our marquee event and it generates a significant amount of money for us,\\" Drewett said. \\"And from a promotional point of view this week is the event that everyone is talking about.\\" The 2009 rebranding from the Masters Cup has also given the tournament a distinct identity from the four grand slam events of the tennis calendar. \\"A grand slam has two or three major courts, men and women, plus the outside courts over 14 days. To have quarter of a million in that time frame on one court is testament to the strength of the event and the players we have right now and their popularity,\\" Drewett said. \\"I personally like the rebranding. It tells a good story, it's pretty clear what it is. The message is very clear to the consumer. \\"We're not looking to compete in any way with the grand slams. This event is what it is -- the format being eight players, only men, indoors, round-robin -- it speaks for itself as being totally different from a grand slam. The public understand that.\\" Drewett was one of the most promising young players of the 1970s, winning the Australian Open junior title twice, but was not quite so successful on the senior circuit as he reached a career-high ranking of 34. However, he did appear at the season-ending event once, in the doubles at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1988 when it was a separate tournament -- now both formats are run during the same week. At that time, Madison Square Gardens was nearing the end of a 13-year run of hosting the singles -- and Drewett believes that the O2 is taking on a similar status to the iconic New York venue. \\"In its time it was one of the special ones, like here. The finals was a very special event. People still talk about playing at Madison Square Gardens, and this is going to be the same,\\" he said. \\"When you go out there, the court, the crowd -- there's a certain atmosphere you don't get very often at sporting events.\\" After ending his career, Drewett became involved in businesses before being asked to run for a place on the ATP board to represent the players. He did so for five years before taking on the role of chief executive of the ATP's International Group. \\"I was always interested in the politics and business. I was interested in what made the tour tick even as a player,\\" Drewett said. \\"Tennis has been, in relative terms, pretty big business for a long time. In terms of professional sport it's one of the most mature. \\"Tennis was one of the first where pro athletes could make a serious living from it, back in the 1950s. The business has got bigger and more mature, and it's as strong as it's ever been 60 years later.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What people sometimes hold funerals for whales?, using the article: Whales have evolved from land-living mammals. As such whales must breathe air regularly, although they can remain submerged under water for long periods of time. Some species such as the sperm whale are able to stay submerged for as much as 90 minutes. They have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled. They are warm-blooded, and have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin. With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at up to 20 knots, though they are not as flexible or agile as seals. Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale. Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years. Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the North Pacific grey whale population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Small whales, such as belugas, are..., what would be the answer ?

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\"  At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.  In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed.  While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.  In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry. Entity:","output":"The text is about John D.

What is the title of this article: Most animals indirectly use the energy of sunlight by eating plants or plant-eating animals. Most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars (e.g., glucose), with the release of molecular oxygen. These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion.","output":"\\"Sunlight's Energy: How Plants and Animals Use It for Growth and Motion\\""},{"instruction":"As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind.

Please answer the following question: Article: Researchers in over 80 nations are taking part in a project to conduct a decade-long census  of sea life. Scientists presented some of their findings at a recent conference as the project neared its completion. In deep icy waters under Antarctica, scientists found bulbous tunicates, an underground animal, and many newly-discovered creatures believed to be related to starfish   and other marine creatures. Elsewhere in the world's oceans, they have recently discovered many kinds of underwater life forms new to science. It is all part of a research effort called the Census of Marine Life. \\"There are about 2,000 scientists worldwide involved,\\" said Bob Gagosian, President, CEO of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. Gagosian helps manage the project. \\"Everywhere they've gone they've found new things,\\" he says. \\"The ocean basically is unexplored from the point of view of marine living things.\\" Researchers have placed small markers on hundreds of fish and marine animals to track by satellite their migration routes and to discover places where sea life gathers. According to Ron O'Dor, a senior scientist with the Census of Marine Life, knowledge of life on the ocean floor is especially limited. \\"90% of all the information we have is from the top hundred meters of the ocean,\\" O'Dor states. And he says the sea floor is, on average, at a depth of 4, 000 meters. And so, as some machines dive far below what people have previously seen, scientists are discovering new species of plants, animals and living things. Since the census project began, more than 5,300 new marine animals have been found. Ocean researchers say they hope to catalogue 230,000 species during the census --which some say is only a small part of all the creatures living in the sea. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The census of sea life will last for ten years.\\"?

The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Footage that shows the moment when scientists discovered the extent of the injuries suffered by the Plantagenet king - who was the last English king to die in battle - has been released. In the video, Professor Guy Rutty, a forensic pathologist at University of Leicester, is shown discovering two wounds at the base of the skull. Scroll down for video. The blow that killed Richard III was so powerful it left damage inside the skull on the opposite side (above) Looking inside the cranium, however, he finds a large indentation that lines up directly with one of the wounds at the base of the skull. The genetic analysis showed that Richard III almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age. Richard III was depicted by William Shakespeare as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the Tower of London. But scans of the king's skeleton show he wasn't a hunchback, but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle. The notorious description by Shakespeare of a ‘hunchback toad’, a Machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body, a limp and withered arm, was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation, experts claim. Instead, a 3D reconstruction of the king’s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of ‘scoliosis’, or sideways bending of his spine to the right. The condition, which would have developed in his early teens, means he was very far from being a hunchback. Despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs, there is no evidence he walked with a limp. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. It comes two months after genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Dr Jo Appleby, who led the exhumation of the skeleton from the Greyfriars car park, said: 'Following the identification of a major sharp force trauma to the base of the skull, which was probably inflicted by a sword or the top spike of a bill or halberd, we were interested to determine the angle of the blow. “Professor Rutty noted a small traumatic lesion on the interior surface of the cranium, directly opposite the sharp force trauma. 'Careful examination showed that the two injuries lined up with one another, and also with an injury to Richard’s first cervical vertebra. 'The combination of all three injuries provided evidence for the direction of the injury and also the depth to which the weapon had penetrated the skull.' Scientists found injuries in the skull of Richard III lined up (above) to reveal  the blow that killed him in battle. Richard III's skeleton found under a car park in Leicester was found to have 11 injuries sustained in battle. According to findings published earlier by the scientists in the Lancet medical journal, the lethal blows came from one of two devastating swipes to the back of the head. One was delivered by a halberd - a vicious axe-like weapon used in the late Medieval period - and the other by a sword. The researchers found that the skeleton had two additional injuries, which they think may have been inflicted after his enemies tore his armour from his lifeless body. One injury - to the buttocks - probably came as his bloodied body was paraded around the battle ground, the researchers suggest. The medical evidence establishes the most detailed account of Richard’s death ever attempted. The scientists used modern forensic methods to examine the injuries inflicted on Richard III's skeleton. Professor Rutty, who led the examination of the remains and has worked as a Home Office pathologist for 19 years, described seeing the injuries in the skull lined up as a 'eureka moment'. He said: 'I was able to look at the large injury in the base of the skull and, through experience, I was able to identify the key injury.' Professor Sarah Hainsworth, a materials engineer at Leicester University also involved in the study, added: 'Using modern forensic examination, we have discovered that Richard's skeleton sustained 11 wounds at or near the time of his death - nine of them to the skull, which were clearly inflicted in battle. 'The injuries to the head suggest he had either removed or lost his helmet. The other two injuries that we found were to a rib and his pelvis.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. The blow that killed King Richard III during battle left a severe indentation on the inside of his skull and went through the base of his brain, scientists examining his remains have discovered. 2. This discovery was made by Professor Guy Rutty, a forensic pathologist at the University of Leicester, who found two wounds at the base of the King's skull that aligned with the indentation in the brain. 3. Richard III, infamous from Shakespeare's depiction as a hunchbacked tyrant, actually had a slight spinal deformity or scoliosis and did not present as a hunchback. There is no evidence suggesting he had any limp. 4. The researchers confirmed through genetic analysis that Richard III likely had blue eyes and probably blonde hair, which may have darkened with age. 5. Modern medical scans established that the English monarch sustained 11 fatal injuries during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, suggesting that his death was the result of an upward thrusting weapon like a sword or spike piercing through his neck and brain. 6. A 3D reconstruction of the king's spine revealed a sideways bending of 65 to 85 degrees, indicating he developed the condition, known as scoliosis, in his early teens, far from the hunchback appearance historically attributed to him. 7. These findings are based on the remains found in a council car park in Leicester. The research involved studying these battle-scarred remains, the injuries of which align with an attack where Richard III would have been without his helmet, surrounded and overwhelmed by enemy soldiers. 8. Another notable injury found in his remains was a wound in the buttocks, which researchers believe could have been inflicted posthumously as his body was displayed on the battleground. 9. The highlights of this research offer a valuable insightful into the fatal experience of King Richard III on the battlefield, applying modern forensic methods to create the most detailed account of his death to date."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A young mild-mannered American couple, Cliff (Zahn) and Cydney (Jovovich), are celebrating their marriage by hiking to a remote beach in Hawaii while on their honeymoon. On their way, they see two hitchhikers, Cleo (Shelton) and Kale (Chris Hemsworth). They offer the pair a ride but change their minds when the two seem possibly dangerous.After they begin the hike, the couple comes in contact with Nick (Olyphant), a solo hiker who claims to be an Iraq War veteran. Nick saves Cydney's life when she slips while attempting to cross a narrow ledge. The trio approaches a group of frightened female hikers discussing a double murder in Honolulu. The victims had their teeth pulled out and fingertips removed. Cliff suspects the hitchhiking couple are the murderers, and Cydney and Cliff discuss whether or not they should turn back, but decide to continue hiking with Nick. They subsequently meet up with Nick's sexy girlfriend, Gina (Sanchez) at the Secret Falls Waterfall.Cliff suspects Kale and Cleo are following them. When he notices their permits are missing, Cliff sees Kale and Cleo's bags by the trail and goes through them, but he does not find the permits. After making camp, Nick and Cliff split up to search for Kale and Cleo. Cliff runs into a guide who is bringing Cliff the permits they left behind. Cliff and Nick return to the campsite. Nick brings a goat he has killed, and Gina proceeds to butcher the animal, explaining she had learned how while working in the meat department of a grocery store.The following day, Kale and Cleo are arrested for the murders. A container full of pulled teeth is found in one of their bags. The two couples are relieved by the arrests, and they continue their hike to the beach. Cliff rents two kayaks so he and Nick can explore a marine cave.As Gina idly looks through the photos on Cydney and Cliff's video camera, she is terrified when she realizes the couple are not who they claim to be. Gina sets off after Nick and Cliff, while Cydney chases after Gina.Flashbacks reveal that Cliff and Cydney are drug-addicted sociopaths who murdered the newlyweds. They kill people and steal their identities in order to, as Cliff explains, \\"live a hundred different lives and achieve a kind of immortality\\". It is also revealed that \\"Cliff\\" had planted the bag of teeth in Kale and Cleo's bag to frame them for the murders.In the Sea cave, Cliff suddenly reveals his true murderer identity and shoots Nick in the head. Gina witnesses this from the cliffs above. Then Cliff shoots at her, but misses. Cydney sneaks up on Gina and attacks her. Gina is stabbed in the leg but manages to push Cydney off the cliff into the water.Even though they haven't had a signal during the entire trip, Gina fortuitously receives a call on her cell phone from a phone company representative. She begs him to call the police. She spots Cydney below in the kayak just as Cliff pops up over the cliff ledge to grab her feet. Gina stabs him in the hand with Cydney's knife and flees.While Cliff chases Gina and Cydney kayaks ashore to intercept the police, Nick, saved by the titanium plate in his head from his war wound, wakes up. Gina runs into a group of men searching for their stolen kayaks, who tell her she is safe now. Cliff tries to convince the men that Gina is irrational due to meth use. But one of the group happens to be an EMT and notices Cliff's enlarged pupils, which undermines his story. So Cliff shoots and kills the entire group of men. Gina uses Cliff's distraction as an opportunity to run toward the beach. Nick arrives and fights Cliff, getting the upper hand. At that point, the police arrive by helicopter with a rifle aimed at Nick. Cydney is also in the helicopter, and the police want her to confirm that Nick is the killer, but she pauses. Cydney identifies Cliff as the murderer and says he ruined her life. The police sharpshooter kills Cliff as he reaches for his gun to kill Nick. Later Nick finally proposes to Gina in the helicopter but due to their traumatic encounters, they both agree to not having a honeymoon., Question: Who does Gina push off the cliff ?","output":"Gina pushes Cydney off the cliff."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Avengers: Age of Ultron is the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and was released on April 13, 2015, in Los Angeles, premiering in Hollywood. Directed by Joss Whedon, the film featured an ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner, among others. It follows the storyline of the Avengers coming together to fight off the sentient robot Ultron, who becomes self-aware and believes that the only way to save Earth is to eliminate humanity. On the other hand, Captain America: Civil War is the 13th film in the MCU and was released on April 12, 2016, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, the film boasts an extensive cast list as well, with almost all the main characters from previous MCU films reprising their roles, alongside newcomers like Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. The story revolves around the enactment of the Sokovia Accords, legal documents regulating the actions of superpowered beings, and the subsequent ideological and physical conflict between Captain America, who opposes the Accords, and Iron Man, who supports them. Consequently, the Avengers get divided over the issue, leading to an intense clash between the two factions. In chronological order, Avengers: Age of Ultron precedes Captain America: Civil War, with the latter being released almost a year after the former. The events in Age of Ultron have a direct impact on the storyline of Civil War, as the destruction caused by the fight against Ultron becomes one of the reasons for the implementation of the Sokovia Accords."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Simply add a quarter teaspoon of either dried thyme or oregano for each bay leaf in your recipe. For example, if you need a bay leaf for your stew but have run out, you can always use a quarter teaspoon of either thyme or oregano to replace it. Caraway and cumin are related, since they are both in the parsley family. They also have a similar taste, although cumin has a nutty and smoky flavor whereas caraway has sweet and earthy tones.  Start with a little less caraway than the recipe lists for cumin and then build it up to get the flavor profile you desire. You can also replace the cumin with ground coriander but you should be aware that it won’t be as smoky and nutty in flavor. The coriander will give it more of a lemony flavor. If you need a substitute for fresh cilantro, you can use an equivalent amount of fresh parsley, tarragon, or dill. Alternately, combine a bit of all three to replace an equal amount of cilantro. The substitute works best for garnishes. If you need to replace coriander seed or ground coriander, you can use an equivalent amount of cumin, fennel or caraway seeds. You can also use a combination of all three. If you run out of both fresh and dried sage, you can always replace it with an equivalent amount of a similar Mediterranean herb. For example, you could use any of the following substitutions:  Substitute marjoram for sage. It is savory like sage but has more citrus tones. Substitute rosemary for sage. Rosemary has more pine and citrus tones than sage but can work fine. Substitute thyme for sage. It has more mint notes than sage but will work nicely. Substitute savory for sage. It has a similar peppery flavor to sage so use it if you want to really bring out the peppery side of a dish. Savory is used in a lot of Mediterranean cooking and especially with meats and bean dishes, as well as vegetable dishes with mushrooms. Winter savory has a bit of a stronger taste so keep that in mind when adding the summer savory. You can also use any of the following substitutions:  Replace summer savory with thyme and a little bit of mint. Replace summer savory with a mix of half parsley and half celery leaves.","output":"If you don't have certain spices or herbs in your recipe, you can use others as substitutes. To replace bay leaves, use a tiny amount of thyme or oregano. If you need to replace cumin, use a little less caraway, or try ground coriander for a different flavor. For fresh cilantro, use parsley, tarragon, or dill, or a mix of all three. To replace coriander seed or ground coriander, you can use cumin, fennel, or caraway seeds, or a mix of them.

To properly understand this, let's examine the meanings of the two sentences. Sentence 1: \\"We have gone on trips; we've bathed in streams.\\" This sentence suggests that the speaker, along with others, has gone on trips involving various activities, such as bathing in streams. It asserts that the speaker has experience with going on trips and participating in associated experiences. Sentence 2: \\"We have never gone on a trip before.\\" This sentence contradicts the information from Sentence 1, as it states that the speaker and others have no prior experience with going on trips. It negates the claim that they have ever undertaken any trips or experienced any related activities. Entailment refers to a relationship between two statements in which the truth of one statement logically implies the truth of the other. That is, if the first statement is true, then the second must also be true. In this case, Sentence 2 does not follow logically from Sentence 1. Instead, the information provided in Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 is conflicting in nature. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. It's essential to note that Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 can't both be true simultaneously due to their contrasting nature.

In just a few years, Cruz has gone from working as the state Solicitor General and as a corporate attorney to become one of the most talked-about politicians on the Web. Cruz began traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire in 2013—and his many conservative fans are eager to see him run for president. That approach, however, has left Cruz with a list of enemies in","output":"Washington, D.C., that seems to grow longer by the day. His brash tactics, unapologetic conservatism, and refusal to play by the traditional rules of politics have made him a polarizing figure in the nation's capital. But what many of his critics fail to recognize is that the digital strategy forged by Josh Perry has played an instrumental role in elevating Cruz's political profile and connecting him with a dedicated base of supporters.  The increasingly crowded Republican field in the run-up to the 2016 election presented unique challenges for any potential candidate, but by honing a distinctive voice and cultivating an online community, Cruz was able to stand out amongst his peers. The internet strategy crafted by Perry and implemented by Cruz effectively harnessed the power of social media platforms to engage directly with voters, bypassing traditional gatekeepers such as the mainstream media and political party hierarchies. Perry's digital strategy extended beyond basic social media engagement, as he was responsible for the creation and management of a comprehensive online presence. This included producing engaging content, disseminating key messages, and staying ahead of online trends. Under Perry's guidance, Cruz's digital team ran an integrated, data-driven operation that maximized email marketing, online advertising, and microtargeted outreach efforts. They created shareable graphics, articles, and videos that resonated with their target audience and capitalized on real-time events to amplify the senator's message. Cruz's willingness to take on the GOP establishment—most notably during the 2013 government shutdown—further set him apart from other presidential hopefuls and endeared him to grassroots supporters. This outsider status endeared him to conservative activists and Tea Party supporters who were tired of what they perceived as the Republican Party's capitulation to the Democratic agenda. In many ways, Cruz's ascent as a political force was a testament to the transformative power of digital media and social networking. The internet allowed for a relatively unknown politician from Texas to become a nationally recognized figure, capable of challenging the status quo in Washington. But Cruz's lightning rod status also attracted a significant number of detractors, who dismissed him as everything from a demagogue to an obstructionist. While Cruz ultimately failed to win the Republican nomination, his unexpected rise to prominence during the 2016 presidential campaign demonstrated the importance of an effective digital strategy in modern American politics. Cruz's ability to harness the strength of his online presence undoubtedly changed the landscape of political communication, and the efforts of Josh Perry as his digital strategist should not be underestimated. So, as Ted Cruz's influence continues to reverberate through America's political discourse, Josh Perry—the 26-year-old Texan with a penchant for Taylor Swift songs—remains an unsung hero in understanding the role of digital media in shaping not only Cruz's story but also the broader nature of contemporary political campaigns. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the contributions of strategists like Perry to a candidate's success, or lack thereof, will only become more apparent in the years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, write down the given equation:    200 = -10*y + 200 2. The goal is to isolate the variable y. Start by simplifying the equation and eliminating constants present on both sides of the equation. Since there is a constant 200 on both sides, subtract 200 from each side to cancel it out.     200 - 200 = -10*y + 200 - 200 3. This simplifies the equation to:    0 = -10*y 4. Now, to solve for y, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which in this case is -10.    0 / -10 = (-10*y) / -10 5.

Passage: Vann stirred up controversy and 10,000 new readers by hiring George Schuyler in 1925, whose editorials and opinions made him famous as the \\"black H.L. Mencken\\" (who was a Courier subscriber). Under Vann, the Courier also worked as a tool for social progress. Most significantly, the paper extensively covered the injustices on African Americans perpetrated by the Pullman Company and supported the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Vann wrote to gain support for causes such as improved housing conditions in the Hill District, better education for black students, and equal employment and union opportunities. However, Vann often used his Courier editorials to publicly fight with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and W. E. B. Du Bois over issues such as President Calvin Coolidge's grants of clemency to black soldiers involved in the Houston Riot and Vann's allegations that James Weldon Johnson embezzled money for personal use from the NAACP and the Garland Fund. This disharmony was resolved in 1929 by published apologies by Vann, Du Bois, and Johnson, and within the decade, Du Bois became a regular Courier contributor. But in 1938, Vann's Courier ended up at odds with the NAACP once again. Vann, through national campaigns and contact with President Franklin D. Roosevelt pursued inclusion of African-American units in the United States Armed Forces. Vann saw this as an achievable step on the path to integration of the military, but the NAACP leadership, primarily Walter White, publicly disagreed with this half-measure, despite the protests of Thurgood Marshall. As a result of the Courier′s influence and Vann's political clout, New York Congressman Fish successfully added an amendment prohibiting racial discrimination in selection and training of men drafted to the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.

Once you've defeated Team Galactic and your party is ready, you can head to Lake Verity and cause Mesprit to appear. Flying to Twinleaf Town is the quickest way to get to the lake. You'll find the Verity Cavern entrance in the middle of the lake. You'll see Mesprit in the center of the room. It will look like the battle is about to start, and then Mesprit will run away before it begins. Professor Rowan will inform you that Mesprit is now roaming throughout Sinnoh, and that you can track it on the map. Roaming Pokémon like Mesprit will change locations every time you move between locations. This can make tracking them down difficult, but there's a trick you can use to speed it up. Walking between these two locations is the most effective way to encounter a roaming Pokémon due to the close proximity of tall grass on each side and the low level wild Pokemon. Each time you walk from one location to the other, Mesprit will move to a new location in Sinnoh. You can see its current location flashing on your Marking Map in the lower screen. Mesprit's movements are random, so you may have to go back and forth many times until you're both in the same spot. Once you've changed locations and Mesprit is in the same location you are, use a Repel so that you don't encounter any other Pokemon. If you encounter another Pokémon or start a battle with a trainer, Mesprit will move and you'll have to start over. Save before attempting to encounter Mesprit so you can quickly try again if you accidentally mess up. Since you're using a Repel, you won't encounter any Pokémon lower than your first Pokemon's level. This will prevent you from encountering any of the wild Pokémon in these two areas. If your first Pokémon is over level 50, the Repel will prevent you from encountering Mesprit.","output":"After defeating Team Galactic, players can find and track the roaming Pokémon Mesprit in Sinnoh by frequently moving between locations and using the Marking Map while employing Repel to avoid unwanted encounters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Claire Bates. PUBLISHED:. 10:18 EST, 3 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 10:18 EST, 3 October 2012. Natasha Keeling was told to give her daughter Georgia Tamiflu. A two-year-old girl who died after she was wrongly diagnosed with swine flu was failed by emergency services, a coroner has said. Georgia Keeling, from Norwich, died from a meningitis-like infection following the incorrect diagnosis at the height of the 2009 national pandemic. The inquest in Norwich heard that paramedic Patricia Perfect had examined her at home but sent an ambulance away because it was 'another case of swine flu'. Four hours later, following a second 999 call, the toddler was rushed to hospital where she died. Returning a narrative verdict today, Norfolk coroner William Armstrong ruled Georgia died following an 'erroneous diagnosis' and the fact she was not immediately admitted to hospital reduced her chances of survival and contributed to her death. He said: 'She died from a condition that was previously undiagnosed and the examination by Miss Perfect was inadequate and deficient and there was a failure to recognise the severity of her condition. 'Is is possible Miss Perfect was over-influenced by the fact there was at the time a prevalence of swine flu? 'There is no doubt at all that Georgia should have been sent to hospital immediately and she would have had a better chance of survival.' A fantastic girl: Georgia was misdiagnosed with swine flu when she was suffering from meningitis. Georgia's parents (pictured left) Paul Sewell and Natasha Keeling have spoken out to highlight a catalogue of failings that led to the death of their daughter Georgia (pictured right) He added that the East of England Ambulance Trust had already taken action to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies. Earlier in the hearing it was suggested Georgia’s death on August 4, 2009 was the result of meningitis. Today, pathologist Xenia Tyler said a. post-mortem showed she died from a group A streptococcal infection, a. rare form of blood poisoning which can develop into meningitis. Georgia was first seen by Miss Perfect at about midday on August 4, 2009 following a 999 call. Her mother, Natasha Keeling, said she. had initially felt relieved that she had been diagnosed and given the. swine flu medication Tamiflu. Georgia’s father, Paul Sewell, said he had been reassured it was not life-threatening. But her condition continued to. deteriorate and Ms Keeling again dialled 999 shortly before 4pm. Georgia. was pronounced dead at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital at. 4.24pm. Georgia was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, but she was pronounced dead on arrival. Meningitis symptoms to look out for. Professor John Kroll told the inquest. that, on the balance of probabilities, it was likely Georgia would have. survived if she had been taken to hospital sooner. He added: 'The diagnosis of swine flu was clearly inappropriate. The circumstances here go far outside. what any clinician would diagnose as swine flu. If it was swine flu, it. was swine flu with complications.' Dr Jeffrey Perrin, a paediatric and. intensive care consultant who examined the circumstances around her. death, said “red flag” warning signs were missed. Paramedic Patricia Perfect said she visited the family's home and made the swine flu diagnosis after a 45-minute examination. He added: 'I would not necessarily. have expected an emergency care practitioner to have diagnosed the. illness but it is more important to recognise the severity of the. condition. 'The failure of an emergency care. practitioner to recognise the severity of Georgia’s illness resulted in. her having a reduced chance of surviving the illness.' Miss Perfect yesterday told the. hearing she regretted the incorrect diagnosis but said “most clinicians” would have made the same mistake given the unprecedented circumstances. She described how medics had been 'distracted' by the pandemic. 'Swine flu was at the forefront of. everybody’s mind. Had that not been a factor I would have been looking. at other reasons,' she said. Speaking outside the inquest, Mr Sewell said the last three years had been like \\"going through hell\\". But he said the family accepted that the ambulance service had learnt from the mistake. He added: 'We were failed by one person and we can't blame the whole NHS for that.' He and Ms Keeling issued a statement saying: 'Nobody knows a child like their parents and we are saddened that despite our best instincts the ambulance service failed to provide adequate care to Georgia. 'We are pleased the ambulance service has apologised for the failings of its emergency care practitioner - we are only sorry that it has taken three years.' Speaking after the inquest, Dr Pamela Chrispin, medical director and deputy chief executive at the East of England Ambulance Service, offered her \\"deepest condolences\\" to Georgia's family. She added many children with fever and a rash are safely seen, treated and left at home. Dr Chrispin said the ambulance service had apologised for the shortcomings and was pleased the coroner had acknowledged the progress that had been made. 'In Georgia's case we accept that, although the paramedic carried out an assessment and followed national guidance, she could have identified the potential for Georgia to become more seriously ill and arranged urgent admission to hospital,' Dr Chrispin said. 'She has since undergone a period of retraining and evaluation and has returned to frontline duties. 'This is a difficult area for all healthcare professionals involved in the assessment of children in the community and, as in this case, sadly there is occasionally a tragic outcome. 'Since Georgia's death the East of England Ambulance Service have taken additional steps to help our staff recognise and manage seriously ill children. 'We are the leading ambulance service in the UK to work with the international Surviving Sepsis campaign, which promotes the early identification and treatment of sepsis.'

Answer:","output":"The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black turtle, or Pacific green turtle, is a large sea turtle species distributed across a wide range of habitats in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. As a highly migratory species, the green sea turtle's habitat varies during the different stages of its life cycle, with hatchlings, juveniles, and adults inhabiting distinct environments. Here's a comprehensive description of the habitat preferences of the green sea turtle: 1. Nesting beaches: Female green sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs on tropical and subtropical sandy beaches. They have a strong preference for nesting sites with adequate vegetation cover, as this provides shade and helps prevent the eggs from overheating. These beaches are typically located near coral reefs, seagrass beds, or other shallow marine habitats that provide food resources for the hatchlings and adults. Notable nesting sites for green sea turtles can be found in Costa Rica (Tortuguero beach), the United States (Florida), Mexico, and Australia (Great Barrier Reef), among others. 2. Hatchling and post-hatchling habitats: Once they hatch from the eggs, green sea turtle hatchlings are faced with the challenge of reaching the ocean. Their first habitat is the open ocean, where they spend their early years drifting with ocean currents in the pelagic zone. These \\"[lost years]\\" for the green sea turtles are associated with the surface layer of the water column, where they find cover among seaweed, floating debris, or sargassum mats. During this stage, they feed on a wider range of food items, including small crustaceans, fish eggs, and jellyfish. 3. Juvenile developmental habitats: After a few years in the open ocean, juvenile green sea turtles leave the pelagic zone and settle in shallow, coastal habitats, where they spend most of their adolescent years. These habitats are characterized by an abundance of vegetation, such as seagrass beds, algal patches, and saltmarshes, which provide food and shelter for the juveniles. They may also inhabit mangrove swamps, estuaries, and lagoons, where they can find safe refuge from predators. Their diet starts shifting towards herbivory at this stage, as they mainly feed on seagrass and algae. 4. Adult foraging habitats: Adult green sea turtles inhabit a wide range of coastal and nearshore marine environments, including coral reefs, rocky shores, and seagrass meadows. They are primarily herbivores, feeding on seagrass, algae, and other types of marine vegetation. However, they have also been known to occasionally consume small invertebrates, like sponges and jellyfish. The selection of specific foraging habitats may vary based on factors like nutrient availability, food quality, diversity, and abundance of resources. 5. Migratory routes and corridors: Green sea turtles undertake extensive migrations between their nesting beaches and foraging habitats. Though they have a relatively lower dispersal range than other sea turtle species, they can still travel thousands of kilometers during their migrations. These journeys occur in the open ocean and serve as an essential link between all the various habitats green sea turtles depend on throughout their lives. In conclusion, the habitat of the green sea turtle includes a diverse range of environments, from nesting beaches and the open ocean to foraging grounds in coastal and nearshore ecosystems. As a highly migratory species, the green sea turtle is strongly influenced by local and global oceanographic processes, which shape its distribution patterns across the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How to infuse cucumber flavor in water? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To infuse cucumber flavor in water, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Gather ingredients and supplies I will need fresh cucumbers, cold filtered water, a pitcher or a large glass bottle, a sharp knife, and a cutting board. Step 2: Wash the cucumber Before slicing the cucumber, it's crucial to wash it thoroughly to remove any dirt, pesticides, or bacteria that may be present on the surface. Washing the cucumber ensures a clean and fresh flavor infusion. Step 3: Slice the cucumber Using the sharp knife, I would slice the cucumber into thin and even slices. Thin slices would be best as they maximize the exposed surface area, allowing more flavors to be imparted to the water. I will ensure that the slices are consistent in size for an even flavor dispersion. Step 4: Add cucumber slices to the pitcher or glass bottle Place the cucumber slices inside the pitcher or glass bottle. By adding cucumber to the pitcher first, I ensure that the slices are distributed uniformly and provide an equal spread of flavor. Step 5: Fill the pitcher or glass bottle with water Pour cold filtered water over the cucumber slices, filling the pitcher or bottle to the desired level. I choose cold water as it helps to release the flavors from the cucumber more effectively and results in a more refreshing beverage. Step 6: Stir gently Gently stir the water and cucumber slices to ensure that they are evenly distributed and submerged in the water. This step is essential for an even flavor infusion. Step 7: Refrigerate Place the pitcher or glass bottle in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or preferably overnight to allow the cucumber flavor to infuse the water completely. The longer the cucumber slices are left to infuse, the stronger the flavor will become. Step 8: Serve Once the cucumber-infused water is chilled and the flavors have melded, strain the water using a fine-mesh sieve to separate the cucumber slices, and serve the water in glasses. Alternatively, keep the slices and serve the infused water with them intact for a visually appealing drink. By following these steps, I can effectively infuse cucumber flavor into water, creating a refreshing and healthy beverage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes.  and a hint : If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Abul-Fal Jafar ibn Ahmad al-Mutaid (895  31 October 932 CE), better known by his regnal name al-Muqtadir bi-llh (\\"Mighty in God\\"), was the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad from 908 to 932 CE (295320 AH), with the exception of a brief deposition in favour of al-Qahir in 928.  - Shapur I (New Persian: ), also known as Shapur I the Great, was the second \\"shahanshah\\" (king of kings) of the Sasanian Empire. The dates of his reign are commonly given as 240/42  270/72, but it is likely that he also reigned as co-regent (together with his father) prior to his father's death in 242 (more probably than 240).  - Tughril (full name: Rukn al-Dunya wa al-Din Abu Talib Muhammad Toghrul-Beg ibn Mikail) also spelled Toghrul I, Tugril, Toghril, Tugrul or Toghrïl Beg; (990  September 4, 1063) was the Turkic founder of the Seljuk Empire, ruling from 1037 to 1063. Tughril united the Turkic warriors of the Great Eurasian Steppes into a confederacy of tribes, who traced their ancestry to a single ancestor named Seljuq, and led them in conquest of eastern Iran. He would later establish the Seljuq Sultanate after conquering Persia and retaking the Abbasid capital of Baghdad from the Buyid dynasty in 1055. Tughril relegated the Abbasid Caliphs to state figureheads and took command of the caliphate's armies in military offensives against the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate in an effort to expand his empire's borders and unite the Islamic world.  - Middle Persian is the Middle Iranian language or ethnolect of southwestern Iran that during the Sasanian Empire (224654) became a prestige dialect and so came to be spoken in other regions of the empire as well. Middle Persian is classified as a Western Iranian language. It descends from Old Persian and is the linguistic ancestor of Modern Persian.  - Yamn-ud-Dawla Abul-Qim Mamd ibn Sebüktegn, more commonly known as Mahmud of Ghazni (November 971  30 April 1030), also known as Mahmd-i Zbul, was the most prominent ruler of the Ghaznavid Empire. He conquered the eastern Iranian lands and the northwestern Indian subcontinent (modern Afghanistan and Pakistan) from 997 to his death in 1030. Mahmud turned the former provincial city of Ghazna into the wealthy capital of an extensive empire which covered most of today's Afghanistan, eastern Iran, and Pakistan, by looting the riches and wealth from the then Indian subcontinent.  - Baghdad is the capital of the Republic of Iraq. The population of Baghdad, , is approximately 7.216.040 making it the largest city in Iraq, the second largest city in the Arab world (after Cairo, Egypt), and the second largest city in Western Asia (after Tehran, Iran).  - Al-Qadir (947  29 November 1031) was the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad from 991 to 1031. Grandson of al-Muqtadir, he was chosen in place of the deposed Caliph, at-Ta'i, his cousin. Banished from the capital, Baghdad, earlier, he was now recalled and appointed to the office he had long desired. He held the Caliphate for 40 years. It was during his Caliphate that Mahmud of Ghazni arose, threatening the empire; and but for the conflicts that broke out in Mahmud's family upon his death, the Buwayhid kingdom, paralysed by damaging war, would have been swallowed. The global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 per cent as against the Christian population of 10 per cent by 1000.  - Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrated phosphate of copper and aluminium, with the chemical formula CuAl()(OH)·4. It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gem and ornamental stone for thousands of years owing to its unique hue. In recent times, turquoise has been devalued, like most other opaque gems, by the introduction onto the market of treatments, imitations, and synthetics.  - The Arab world ('; formally: '), also known as the Arab nation (\\"\\"), consists of the 22 Arabic-speaking countries of the Arab League. These Arab states occupy an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. The contemporary Arab world has a combined population of around 422 million people, over half of whom are under 25 years of age.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Nishapur County is a county in Razavi Khorasan Province in Iran. The capital of the county is Nishapur. At the 2011 census, its population was 433,104, in 118,214 families; excluding those portions.   - Cairo (; ', ') is the capital and largest city of Egypt. The city's metropolitan area is the largest in the Middle East and the Arab world, and 15th-largest in the world, and is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, modern Cairo was founded in 969 CE by Jawhar al-Siqilli (\\"the Sicilian\\") of the Fatimid dynasty, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. Cairo has long been a center of the region's political and cultural life, and is nicknamed \\"the city of a thousand minarets\\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture.  - Al-Ta'i (932  3 August 1003) was the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad from 974 to 991. Very little is known about his personal and official life. During his Caliphate, Syria was torn by contending factions  Fatimid, Turkish, and Carmathian; while the Buwayhid dynasty was split up into parties that were fighting among themselves. To top this all off, the Byzantine Emperor John Tzimisces stormed the east in a victorious campaign in 975. After holding the office for seventeen years, al-Ta'i was deposed in 991 by the Buwayhid emir Baha' al-Dawla.  - The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \\"Ethnologue\\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family.  - Herat is the third-largest city of Afghanistan. It has a population of about 436,300, and serves as the capital of Herat Province, situated in the fertile valley of the Hari River. It is linked with Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif via highway 1 or the ring road. It is further linked to the city of Mashhad in neighboring Iran through the border town of Islam Qala.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - The Tahirid dynasty was a dynasty, of Persian dihqan origin, that governed the Abbasid province of Khorasan from 821 to 873, and the city of Baghdad from 820 until 891. The dynasty was founded by Tahir ibn Husayn, a leading general in the service of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun. Their capital in Khorasan was initially located at Merv, but later moved to Nishapur. The Tahirids enjoyed a high degree of autonomy in their governance of Khorasan, although they remained subject to the Abbasid caliphate and were not independent rulers.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - Abu al - Hasan Ali Ibn Muhammad Ibn Habib al - Mawardi (          ) , known in Latin as Alboacen ( 972 - 1058 CE ) , was a Kurdish Islamic jurist of the Shafi'i school most remembered for his works on religion , government , the caliphate , and public and constitutional law during a time of political turmoil . Appointed as the chief judge over several Khorasani districts near Nishapur , and Baghdad itself , al - Mawardi also served as a diplomat for the Abbasid caliphs al - Qa'im and al - Qadir in negotiations with the Buyid emirs . A symbol of his contributions here , he is well remembered for his treatise on \`\` The Ordinances of Government . '' The Ordinances , Al - Ahkam al - Sultaniyya w'al - Wilayat al - Diniyya , provide a detailed a definition of the functions of caliphate government which , under the Buyids appeared to be rather indefinite and ambiguous .  - Nishapur or Nishabur (also Romanized as Nshpr, Nshbr, and Neyshbr from Middle Persian: \\"New-Shabuhr\\", meaning \\"New City of Shapur\\", \\"Fair Shapur\\", or \\"Perfect built of Shapur\\") is a city in the Khorasan Province, capital of the Nishapur County and former capital of Province Khorasan, in northeastern Iran, situated in a fertile plain at the foot of the Binalud Mountains. It had an estimated population of 239,185 as of 2011 and its county 433,105. Nearby are the turquoise mines that have supplied the world with turquoise for at least two millennia. The city was founded in the 3rd century by Shapur I as a Sasanian satrapy capital. Nishapur later became the capital of Tahirid dynasty and was reformed by Abdullah Tahir in 830, and was later selected as the capital of Seljuq dynasty by Tughril in 1037. From the Abbasid era to the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran, the city evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center within the Islamic world. Nishapur, along with Merv, Herat and Balkh were one of the four great cities of Greater Khorasan and one of the greatest cities in the middle ages, a seat of governmental power in eastern of caliphate, a dwelling place for diverse ethnic and religious groups, a trading stop on commercial routes from Transoxiana and China, Iraq and Egypt.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Balkh (Persian/Pashto:  \\"Balkh\\"; Bactrian: , \\"axl\\") was an ancient city and centre of Buddhism, Islam, and Zoroastrianism in what is now northern Afghanistan. Today it is a small town in the province of Balkh, about 20 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital, Mazar-e Sharif, and some south of the Amu Darya. It was one of the major cities of Khorasan, since the latter's earliest history. Marco Polo described Balkh as a \\"noble and great city\\".

Tracy gave Remy a pained expression.  Given the context: What will happen to Remy? The answer is:","output":"To determine the answer, I will analyze the situation step-by-step and consider various possible outcomes: 1. Identify the situation: Remy is examining Tracy's injury for signs of fractures, and Tracy gives Remy a pained expression. 2. Consider Remy's role: Remy is assessing Tracy's condition, which implies that Remy might be a friend, family member, or possibly a healthcare professional. 3. Analyze Tracy's reaction: Tracy's pained expression indicates that the examination might be causing discomfort and possibly signals the presence of a fracture or another injury. 4. Evaluate possible outcomes for Remy:    a. If Remy is a healthcare professional, they might take further steps to diagnose and treat Tracy's injury, possibly ordering additional tests (e.g., an X-ray) to confirm the presence of a fracture. In this scenario, Remy would continue to provide medical care to Tracy.    b. If Remy is a friend or family member, they might recommend that Tracy seek medical attention to obtain a proper diagnosis and treatment. In this case, Remy would continue to provide emotional support to Tracy. 5. Choose the most likely outcome based on the available information.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.\\"? Answer:","output":"Sure, here are some detailed questions that can be used to test the students' understandings of the passage: 1. What significant event occurred during the 2nd century AD regarding the Roman Empire? Answer: The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD. 2. Which factors contributed to the political instability of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century AD? Answer: Economic issues, including inflation, external pressures on the frontiers, and an unstable system of power with emperors being rapidly replaced by new usurpers contributed to the political instability. 3. What were some of the effects of the war with Sassanid Persia on the Roman Empire in the 3rd century? Answer: There was a steady increase in military expenses, the army's size doubled, the cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. 4. How did the changes in the Roman army impact the Empire's economic structure? Answer: The need for more revenue to support the military changes led to higher taxes. As a result, the number of the curial, or landowning, class, declined, and fewer of them were willing to undertake the responsibilities of holding office in their native towns. 5. What challenges did the central administration face during this period? Answer: The central administration needed more bureaucrats to deal with the needs of the vastly grown army. This surge in tax collectors led to complaints from civilians, who believed there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers. 6. How did the increased military expenses and the need for revenue affect the social structure and civilian life in the Roman Empire? Answer: The increased military expenses led to tax hikes, which in turn led to a reduction in the number of the curial class, many of whom were unwilling to undertake the increasing burdens of office. The increase in bureaucrats, particularly tax collectors, led to grievances among the civilians.  By providing these multi-layered questions, students are encouraged to understand not just the facts presented in the passage, but the causative relations, the transformations, and overall societal implications during this historical period of the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse. I had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Wood's character Matt into the hooligan scene. But the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before. Let's clear up a few things: Hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run-of-the-mill league game; they don't set out to kill each other; they don't ONLY wear Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They most certainly don't, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. And I'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist). Don't get me wrong,I'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with The Firm for cluelessness. I found it ironical that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke. I could go on, but I think I've made my point. As for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and I'm sure if I hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then I would have guessed what was going on sooner than I did. And believe me, I was well in front. I get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised. If I'm right, then the makers have failed completely. It's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies. Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway. There are some funny, if unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school did raise a smile for me. But a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross. If you're British avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know. If you're American, you may enjoy it, as it's clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny the plot is flimsy, predictable and ultimately over the top.","output":"The sentiment of this review is very negative.

The boy's twin brother Jacob, a boy with a huge birthmark (also played by Donovan), decides to seek revenge against the bullies. Leonard (Jesse Camacho) who's overweight, survives the tree house fire but loses his sense of taste and smell. Thanks to the fire, this prompts Leonard to go on a diet, which isn't welcomed by his obese family. The boys' female friend Malee (Zoe Weizenbaum) tries to befriend an adult named Gus (Jeremy Renner), a grief-stricken patient of her therapist mother, Carla (Annabella Sciorra). Jacob's family falls apart after the death of his brother. But shortly after, his parents adopt a boy named Keith Gardner. Meanwhile, Malee begins to have a crush on Gus and changes the song for her recital to one Gus liked, just for him. As time goes by, she sees Gus as her \\"soul mate\\". She sneaks into his house one night to find him grieving. Afraid to confront him, Malee steals his gun and leaves. She gives it to Jacob the following day. Jacob frequently visits Jeff and Kenny, who are serving time in a juvenile hall. Jacob initially threatens them, until eventually Jeff commits suicide. Jacob befriends Kenny, soon learning he has an early release and is illegally moving to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Leonard's father decides to take his sisters to Florida instead of Leonard (who would usually go). Leonard decides to force his mother to lose weight by trapping her in the cellar. They both end up in the hospital after a gas leak in their home. Next, Jacob and Kenny agree that Jacob can go with him to New Mexico. Malee visits Gus and removes her clothes in an attempt to seduce him. Instead, Gus calls Malee's mother to come and pick her up. The next day, Gus explains to therapist Carla about the last fire he ever fought (which involved killing an injured little girl, upon the girl's request), claiming that Malee wanted him to take her pain away, as he was aware of her growing crush on him. Meanwhile, Jacob's mother tells him that Keith Gardner wasn't adopted to replace Rudy, and that she wants Kenny dead, which reminds Jacob of his planned revenge. The night of escape for Jacob finally comes and he meets up with Kenny. Jacob insists on going through a construction site which he says is a secret route. Once there, Jacob points Gus's gun at Kenny, and tells him \\"you killed him\\" before shooting him dead. Jacob buries the body and leaves. He returns in the daytime, and sees Gus spreading cement above Kenny's grave. Malee begins visiting her estranged father and Leonard's family finally starts eating healthily.

Options：  A. lakes  B. shore line  C. shallow waters  D. tidepools  E. atlantic ocean A:","output":"B. Shoreline In order for a crab to reach the ocean, it must cross the shoreline. The shoreline, also referred to as the coast or beach, is the area where land meets the sea or ocean. Shorelines are significant for many reasons, including being a vital habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms, as well as playing a crucial role in the transportation of sand and sediment along the coastline. Crabs are commonly found in marine and estuarine environments along shorelines worldwide. There are over 4,000 species of crabs, ranging in size from the tiny pea crab (measuring just millimeters in length) to the giant Japanese spider crab (with a leg span of up to 3.8 meters).  Crabs must navigate the shoreline for various reasons, such as searching for food, mating, and finding suitable habitats. When a crab crosses the shoreline, it is likely to encounter various conditions, including: 1. Tidal range: The area between the high tide and low tide lines, known as the intertidal zone, is where most crabs spend a significant portion of their lives. They must be able to maneuver through this area, which often includes rocks, shells, and seaweed, in order to make their way to deeper waters. 2. Wave action: Crabs must withstand the forces of waves as they break along the shoreline. Some species, such as the Atlantic ghost crab, are known for their ability to quickly scuttle across the sand, making them well-suited to traversing the shoreline. 3. Salinity: Shorelines are often characterized by varying degrees of salinity, or the concentration of salt in the water. Crabs must be able to tolerate these fluctuations in order to successfully cross the shoreline, as salinity can affect a crab's osmoregulation (the process of maintaining the balance of water and salt within their body). 4. Predators and competitors: The shoreline is home to a diverse array of organisms that may pose threats to crabs, including predators like seagulls and other crustaceans, as well as competitors for food and space. Crabs must be able to navigate these interactions in order to survive and reach the ocean. In conclusion, for a crab to reach the ocean, it must successfully cross the shoreline. This involves navigating a dynamic environment with varying physical characteristics and interacting with other organisms while avoiding potential dangers. The shoreline offers a unique habitat that demands a range of adaptations from crabs, making them well-suited to life at the boundary between land and sea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Mediterraneo Movie plot: n 1941, one year after Italy joined Germany against the Allies in World War II, a small group of misfit Italian soldiers is sent to a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea for four months of lookout duty. The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a farmer accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men.The soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. They see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men. They have decided to accommodate the Italians. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island.The local priest asks the lieutenant, a Sunday painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess, who believes that three is the perfect number for an affair of pure sexual fun. The sergeant takes up folk dancing and the shyest of the soldiers falls profoundly in love with the island's single, very overworked, prostitute. My question: What happens to the ship that is supposed to pick up the soldiers? A:","output":"In the movie plot, the ship that is supposed to pick up the soldiers is destroyed. As the Italian soldiers on the island see bombing on the horizon, they realize that their means of transportation and escape has been eliminated due to the ongoing conflict.

It took me a lot of hours on Yelp to decide where to have a top notch steak while in Vegas. I mean, it's not like there are 431 steakhouses in Vegas or anything. I am going to do my best to cover all the bases here, but I gotta be honest. Charlie Palmer Steak delivered one of the greatest and most synchronized dining experiences I have ever had and this is how the story goes.   The location:  Located inside the four seasons hotel, the restaurant itself is a bit darker than I enjoy, but it's a huge location that is very inviting. There is a very nice bar located near the front that seemed to be a bit dead. More than likely that has more to do with the fact that if your reservation is for 7PM you get seated at 7PM. That is how it went on Wednesday night, so I am not sure how it works out on the weekends when there are more folks in town.  The menu:   Very extensive menu that hits on a number of different price points. They give you an opportunity to go small, medium or big and big is B-I-G!!! They have what's called the \\"cut of the week\\" which is a pri fix menu option that includes 3 courses and two sides for 48. That's a great deal for the amount of food they serve.   The Food:  I knew before I sat down that I was going to pay a premium for dinner and that wasn't an issue for me. I was just hoping that the food would be off the charts good and I would get what I paid for and that's exactly how it went down.   We ordered oysters which were from the pacific northwest (I forget the name but I'm not hypercritical about the specific types of oysters when I dine at a high end restaurant) and they were amazing. Perfectly chilled, perfectly shucked and almost as fresh as the oysters I get here in San Francisco. My date doesn't even dig oysters and she loved them.  My date for the evening, Lizzy, ordered their \\"cut of the week\\" option and it was as follows:  First course Bib lettuce salad  The lettuce was too large to eat and probably could have been chopped to fit on the fork. The blue cheese was really strong for my taste but the bacon lardons were perfectly crisp and delicious. Overall the salad was good, but nothing special.  Second course 16 oz. NY Steak  The cut was a very large portion and it was cooked almost perfectly. It had a bit too much gristle for my taste but it Lizzy killed it so she clearly didn't have a problem with it. Seasoned well, tender and the sauce that accompanied it was flavorful and a great addition.   Dessert Meyer Lemon Creme Brulee   Custard is not my thing but I tried it. It was a bit too tart for my taste buds and I wouldn't order it.   2 sides Baby Broccoli and Garlic Mashed Potatoes  Baby broccoli was cooked just they way I like it. Crisp, bright green and still crunchy but cooked all the way through. Garlic mashed were good. It tasted like there was a bit of truffle oil goin on but I was focused on the red meat more than the starch. I mean, I didn't come to Vegas for the mashed potatoes. Feel me??  My Entree  Surf and Turf  Wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked filet mignon. Melt in your mouth good and absolutely amazing quality on this cut. Each bite tasted better than the previous bite. half tail of Maine lobster, cooked perfectly, with drawn butter and it was stuffed with a truly delicious mix of lobster, lobster stalk, fresh bread crumbs and a few special ingredients the waiter left out. Lobster meat was pulled away from the shell, which is a nice touch b/c who really wants to sit there with a bib on shucking lobster from the shell? I sure don't.   Dessert  The waiter comes out with these tiny, fabulous house made ice cream sandwiches, compliments of the chef. They were too kill for! The cookies were soft, delicious and the ice cream was a creamy dream of wonderful. We could have eaten about 8 more of those bad boys without an issue.   The service  10 out of 10. The waiter was friendly, he knew the menu up and down, answered all of our questions (and we had plenty) and was on top of his game. A step further. Our waiter had a party of 8 and a party of 6 seated as we were eating dinner. Instead of ditching us all together, another waiter came over to make sure we were doing ok and was also on top of his game. The communication between waiters, servers and the rest of the staff was absolutely perfect and I had never seen anything like it. Something as simple as pouring water in a glass was handled with such care. The waiter would hold a napkin over the glass each time she/he poured making sure we didn't get splashed. At times, they were a bit too fast for their own good. They took away my fork, knife and small plate after they cleared the oysters, but I'm not complaining because I was flat out impressed by the attention to detail. Each and every person working the room had a smile on their face, they were chatty but not too chatty, they took pics of people who wanted them to and it was truly a top notch dining experience and I can't wait to head back for more.

Question: Information:  - A parody (also called a spoof, send-up, take-off, or lampoon) is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original workits subject, author, style, or some other targetby means of satiric or ironic imitation. As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, \\"parody  is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.\\" Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as \\"any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.\\" Parody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music (although \\"parody\\" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation, gaming, and film.  - Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era.  - Igor , or sometimes Ygor , is a stock character assistant to many types of Gothic villains , such as Count Dracula or Dr. Victor Frankenstein , familiar from many horror movies and horror movie parodies . Although Dr. Frankenstein had a hunchback assistant in the 1931 film Frankenstein , his name was Fritz ; in the original Mary Shelley novel , Dr. Frankenstein has no lab assistant nor does a character named Igor appear .  - Wallachia or Walachia (; archaic: ', Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical and geographical region of Romania. It is situated north of the Lower Danube and south of the Southern Carpathians. Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections, Muntenia (Greater Wallachia) and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia). Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections.  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, famous for introducing the character of the vampire Count Dracula.  - Victor Frankenstein is the title character of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". He is a scientist who, after studying chemical processes and the decay of living beings, gains an insight into the creation of life and gives life to his own creature, often referred to as Frankenstein's monster, or often colloquially referred to as simply \\"Frankenstein\\".  - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.   - Popular culture or pop culture is the entirety of ideas, perspectives, attitudes, images, and other phenomena that are within the mainstream of a given culture, especially Western culture of the early to mid 20th century and the emerging global mainstream of the late 20th and early 21st century. Heavily influenced by mass media, this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of the society. The most common pop culture categories are: entertainment (movies, music, television, games), sports, news (as in people/places in news), politics, fashion/clothes, technology, and slang. Popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's attitudes towards certain topics.  - Frankenstein's monster, sometimes known as Frankenstein, is a fictional character whose fictional creator was Victor Frankenstein. The monster first appeared, without any name, in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". Shelley's title thus compares Victor Frankenstein to the mythological character Prometheus who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire. Although nameless in Shelley's novel, the creature took on the name \\"Frankenstein\\" in later years.   - A cliché or cliche (or ) is an expression, idea, or element of an artistic work which has become overused to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, even to the point of being trite or irritating, especially when at some earlier time it was considered meaningful or novel.  - A werewolf (from , \\"man\\"), man-wolf, or lycanthrope (\\"lykánthropos\\": , \\"lykos\\", \\"wolf\\", and , \\"anthrpos\\", \\"human\\") is a mythological or folkloric human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (e.g. via a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Early sources for belief in lycanthropy are Petronius (2766) and Gervase of Tilbury (11501228).  - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.  - A stock character is a stereotypical person whom audiences readily recognize from frequent recurrences in a particular literary tradition. Stock characters are archetypal characters distinguished by their flatness. As a result, they tend to be easy targets for parody and to be criticized as clichés. The presence of a particular array of stock characters is a key component of many genres. The point of the stock character is to move the story along.   - Abraham \\"Bram\\" Stoker (8 November 1847  20 April 1912) was an Irish author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel \\"Dracula\\". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned.  - Count Dracula is the title character and main antagonist of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel \\"Dracula\\". He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted in the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad III the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula. Other character aspects have been added or altered in subsequent popular fictional works. The character has subsequently appeared frequently in popular culture, from films to animated media to breakfast cereals.

His profession as a funeral director, in which the Sultenfuss' residence is also a funeral parlor, has led Vada to develop an obsession with death as well as disease. Vada also thinks that she killed her own mother, since her mother died giving birth to her. She regularly tends to her invalid grandmother (Ann Nelson), who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Harry's brother Phil (Richard Masur), who lives nearby, also stops by frequently to help out the family.Vada is teased by other girls because her best friend, Thomas J. Sennett (Macaulay Culkin), is unpopular and a boy. Their summer adventures from first kiss to last farewell introduce Vada to the world of adolescence.Vada's summer begins well. She befriends Shelley Devoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), the new make-up artist at her father's funeral parlor, who provides her with some much needed guidance. She is also infatuated with her teacher, Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne), and steals some money from Shelley's trailer to attend a summer writing class that he is teaching.But before long, things start to fall apart. Her father and Shelley start dating and get engaged, she cannot bring herself to tell her father that she has experienced her first menstrual cycle, Thomas J. dies from an allergic reaction to bee stings while looking for Vada's mood ring in the woods, and she finds out that Mr. Bixler is engaged to someone else.Vada's grief, however, manages to mend the rift between her and her father, she learns that she didn't kill her mom during childbirth (since her father tells her that things like mothers dying in childbirth just happen), and by the end of the movie, Vada has not only managed to deal with her pain and grief, but has also overcome some of her previous issues as well.","output":"Thomas J. Sennett was looking for Vada's mood ring in the woods when he unfortunately died from an allergic reaction to bee stings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Contrary to common belief, social media websites such as Facebook do not weaken personal ties, they strengthen them in unique ways for different age groups, according to a new study. The rapid spread of Facebook, which has more than 500 million users worldwide, has prompted concerns about its negative effects, but researchers at the University of Texas have reached a different conclusion. \\"Our findings suggest that Facebook is not replacing face-to-face interactions between friends, family and colleagues,\\" said S.Craig Watkins, an associate professor of radio, TV and film who headed the research team. \\"In fact, we believe there is sufficient evidence that social media afford opportunities for new expressions of friendship, intimacy and community.\\" The researchers questioned 900 college students and recent graduates about how and with whom they interact on Facebook. More than 60 percent of Facebook users said posting status updates was among the most popular activities, followed by 60 percent who wrote comments on their profile and 49 percent who posted messages and comments to friends. The researchers also found that although about the same number of men and women use Facebook, they do so in different ways. \\"There is a noteworthy difference in aims in how to use a tool like Facebook.We found that for women the content tends to be more affectionate, and (they) are especially interested in using it for connection,\\" said Watkins. \\"For men, it's more functional,\\" he added. Watkins pointed out that, for example, women are more likely to post pictures of social gatherings with friends, while men are more likely to post pictures of hobbies, or post a political or pop-culture related link.

What is the sentiment of the following review? Wow. Just, wow. Oh, and om.  I know I only wrote a review of this place recently, but that was after my first class. It was enough to convince me to go back, and a month later I am well and truly an Ashtanga yoga devotee.  I didn't know much about the different styles of yoga before I started, but quickly came to realise that Ashtanga yoga is a more active-movement style yoga that is perhaps more intense, and more of a workout, than others.  Going to a few of the Beginners II drop-in classes, they were pitched just right. I was a total noob, but with the patience of the teachers picked it up quickly. They never push you too far, and quietly go around the class as you follow the moves, adjusting a hand to put more pressure on the fingers, gently pushing your back a bit straighter, slightly twisting you a bit further round. In a month I feel I have improved quite a lot, and it's all down to the expertise of the teachers.  With the suggestion that I begin the Morning Mysore class, I have now attended one of the evening classes, introduction to Mysore. This is the system of self-practice and teaching. Every Monday - Thursday morning this school holds a 7 - 9am Morning Mysore where all practioners come in and leave in their own time, to practice their full primary (or secondary) series. I've yet to attend one of these, but the introductory class was basically the same style - come in and practice - but with less advanced people attending so it was less nerve-wracking. Kat, the teacher, was very patient and great at helping me improve further.  Karen, who set up the Bristo Yoga School, has done an amazing job of founding a little haven of at once tranquility and high energy on the corner of Bristo Square. Whilst the regular practioners here are perhaps more practiced than I, there is no air of superiority or intimidation that can happen in any \\"sport\\". It's a supportive, open, friendly environment and I'm not the only newbie or beginner.  I couldn't recommend this school highly enough, either for those looking for a casual once-a-week yoga session; a full beginners / intermediate course; pilates; or to practice their Morning Mysore each day. pick from the following.

Helen Folasade Adu was born on 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Her middle name, Folasade, means \\"honour confers a crown\\". Her parents, Adebisi Adu, a Nigerian lecturer in economics of Yoruba background, and Anne Hayes, an English district nurse, met in London, married in 1955 and moved to Nigeria. Her parents separated, however, and Anne Hayes returned to England, taking four-year-old Sade and older brother Banji with her to live with their grandparents near Colchester, Essex. After completing a three-year course work in fashion design, and later modeling briefly, Sade began backup singing with British band Pride. During this time, she formed a songwriting partnership with Pride's guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman; together, backed by Pride's rhythm section, they began doing their own sets at Pride gigs. Her solo performances of the song \\"Smooth Operator\\" attracted the attention of record companies, and in 1983 Sade and Matthewman split from Pride, along with keyboardist Andrew Hale, bassist Paul Denman and drummer Paul Cook, to form the band Sade. By the time she performed her first show at London's Heaven nightclub, she had become so popular that 1,000 people were turned away at the door. In May 1983, Sade performed their first US show at the Danceteria nightclub in New York City. On 18 October 1983, Sade Adu signed with Epic Records, while the rest of the band signed in 1984.  Following the record deal, the group began recording their debut album, Diamond Life, which took six weeks to record and was recorded entirely at The Power Plant in London. Diamond Life was released on 16 July 1984, reached number two in the UK Album Chart, sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK, and won the Brit Award for Best British Album in 1985. The album was also a hit internationally, reaching number one in several countries and the top ten in the US, where it has sold in excess of four million copies. Diamond Life had international sales of over six million copies, becoming one of the top-selling debut recordings of the '80s, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist.  \\"Your Love Is King\\" was released as the album's lead single on 25 February 1984 and was a success in European territories, charting at number seven in Ireland and number six on the UK Singles Chart. The song was less successful in the US, where it peaked at number 54 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The third single, \\"Smooth Operator\\", was released on 15 September 1984 and became the most successful song in the US from the album Diamond Life. The track peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the US Billboard Hot Black Singles, as well as peaking at number one on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. In Europe the song fared well, peaking at number 19 in the UK, and reaching the top 20 in Austria, Switzerland, France and Germany.","output":"This text is about Helen Folasade Adu, also known as Sade Adu or simply Sade, a Nigerian-British singer, songwriter, and former fashion designer and model.

When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee.          . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college. Question: Which of the following statements is WRONG?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The temptation when you rescue an emaciated, or very thin, horse is to feed her a lot to help him regain weight. However, this is not as simple as it sounds because suddenly providing an abundance of food causes digestive problems and is likely to trigger potentially serious health issues such as colic or laminitis. Weight gain has to be mapped out over several months. It must be done carefully and methodically. The ideal food for helping the horse regain weight is forage (good quality hay) and the amount you feed the horse should be the amount recommended for her current body weight, plus 10 or 15%.  Use a measuring tape to assess the horse’s current weight, and cross reference this with a body weight-based feeding chart. If you are concerned that you are not feeding the horse the right amount, talk to a vet. After a period of starvation, the horse’s stomach will need to repopulate the good bacteria that aids digestion. Feeding the horse a large meal will put a lot of pressure on the horse’s stomach that could lead to digestion problems. Rather than giving the horse her allotted amount of feed all at once, space the amount of feed you give her out over the course of the day. This will keep the horse from gorging herself. Forage, or good quality hay, is the ideal food for a horse in the initial stages of rehabilitation because it is high in fiber, takes time to chew, and it difficult to bolt down. Bolting a lot of feed quickly can lead to choke, or a blockage of partially chewed, dry food in the esophagus.  Alfalfa hay is high in protein and low in carbohydrates, which can help to keep the horse energized. If the horse is eating hay well, increase her daily ration by about one flake a day, and after a week of eating well, consider allowing her free access to hay. Some horses won't eat hay; if this is the case with your horse, try hay cubes or roughage chunks. These can trick the horse into thinking she is eating a concentrate, which will make her more likely to eat. If the horse if having trouble eating because of dental problems (for example, dropping food or drooling) try soaking the hay cubes to soften them. If the horse is not gaining weight on hay, then add beet pulp or rice bran to her diet. Both foods are higher in calories than forage but are also high in fiber. Avoid beet pulp that contains molasses as it will cause a \\"sugar rush\\" or a wash of sugar into the bloodstream that could overexcite your horse. Vegetable oils are an easy way to add calories to your horse’s feed. Most horses will eat 1 to 2 cups (250 ml each) of oil mixed into the food, though some horses may be picky. Try different types of oil, including: Canola, cocosoya, and standard vegetable oil. Although concentrates are high in calories, they are also high in the starches and sugars that trigger metabolic problems such as insulin resistance, colic, and laminitis. Summary:","output":"When rehabilitating an emaciated horse, it is crucial to gradually reintroduce food, focusing on forage-based diets, to avoid health issues and ensure proper weight gain over several months."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution? Solve -330*a - 260*a + 530*a + 364 = -56 for a.","output":"Okay, let's break this down into smaller parts: First, we have these terms -330*a, -260*a, and 530*a. These are all being multiplied by 'a'. We can think of these as toys 'a' has. If 'a' loses 330 toys and 260 toys, but then gets 530 toys, we need to add and subtract these to see how many toys 'a' ends up with.  So, -330 - 260 + 530 equals -60. This means 'a' has -60 toys. In math, we write this as -60*a. Then, we have this equation: -60*a + 364 = -56. Think of this like a seesaw. On one side we have -60*a + 364 and on the other side we have -56. In order for the seesaw to be balanced (or for the equation to be true), both sides need to be the same. Let's isolate 'a', which means to get 'a' by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we could first subtract 364 from both sides. That gives us: -60*a = -56 - 364, which simplifies to -60*a = -420. We still have 'a' being multiplied by -60, so to get 'a' by itself, we need to divide both sides by -60, like this: a = -420 / -60.

Select the topic that this about: Bayern Munich manager Felix Magath admits he is unconcerned who his side face in the last sixteen of the Champions League, claiming the 18-time German champions are capable of beating anyone.","output":"The topic of discussion involves Bayern Munich, specifically their manager Felix Magath. He confidently expresses his lack of concern about the potential opponents in the last sixteen of the Champions League, as he believes the 18-time German champions possess the capability of defeating any adversary. Felix Magath, a highly successful and respected coach in European football, has managed several top clubs throughout his career, including German giants Bayern Munich. Magath's success in Germany is due in part to his tactical acumen, ability to motivate and develop players, and an overall understanding of the game. The Champions League is an annual continental club football competition, organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs. The tournament serves as the premier club tournament in European football, and the victors are often considered the best club team on the continent for that year. The knockout stage of the Champions League, which involves the last sixteen teams, often features a blend of the top clubs from various European leagues. Bayern Munich is widely considered one of the most successful clubs in European football history. Having won 18 German championships (Bundesliga titles) and numerous other domestic and international trophies, the Bavarian giants have consistently displayed their dominance in German and European club football. The club's deep talent pool, financial resources, and top-notch facilities have all contributed to its sustained competitiveness on the highest stage. Therefore, it is understandable that Magath has confidence in his team's ability to perform against any opposition in the knockout stage of the Champions League. Bayern's track record speaks for itself, and their experience in high-pressure situations gives them the mental edge required to overcome adversity. However, it is important to note that the teams that make it to the round of 16 in the Champions League are typically strong contenders, meaning that Magath's confidence should not be misconstrued as arrogance or complacency. In order to ensure success against any opponent, Magath must prepare his team by thoroughly analyzing their potential adversaries, identifying key threats, and implementing the appropriate tactics to neutralize them. Furthermore, maintaining high levels of focus and determination among his players is crucial in ensuring they perform to their maximum potential and display the traditional winning mentality associated with Bayern Munich. In conclusion, the topic of discussion focuses on Bayern Munich manager Felix Magath discussing his lack of concern for who his team will face in the last sixteen of the Champions League, due to their proven track record in the competition and their ability to defeat any opponent. As a top-tier European football club, Bayern Munich's combination of talent, resources, and historical success make it a hazardous adversary in the competition. However, it is important for Magath and his players to not underestimate any potential opponent and maintain their dedication to preparation, hard work, and competitive spirit."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Before the Rains Movie plot: Before the Rains is set in 1930s Malabar District of the Madras Presidency of British India, against the backdrop of a growing nationalist movement. An idealistic young Indian man, T.K. Neelan (Rahul Bose) finds himself torn between his ambitions for the future and his loyalty to tradition when people in his village learn of an affair between his British boss and close friend Henry Moores (Linus Roache) and a married village woman Sajani (Nandita Das). Henry and T.K. are working on constructing a road in rural Kerala. The start of the film focuses on the affair between Henry and his house-maid Sajani. They make love near a waterfall, witnessed by two children who flee. Both Henry and Sajani are married to different partners and both know of each other's marriages. Henry's wife Laura and son Peter return from their vacation in England. Sajani is distraught but Henry assures Sajani that she is the one he loves. Sajani's violent husband finds out about her infidelity and brutally beats her. Sajani flees to Henry's house; Henry instructs T.K. to take her away into hiding. T.K tells Sajani never to come back as she is now disgraced and her presence in the village will endanger Henry's life. Sajani does not believe T.K but leaves nonetheless. During this time, resentment towards the British grows stronger; news about an adulterous act between an Indian woman and a British man would be inflammatory. Sajani's love for Henry drives her back to Henry's house. Henry tells her to leave and admits that he does not love her. A distraught Sajani finds T.K's handgun (a gift from Henry), shoots herself in the chest and dies. T.K. and Henry throw her body in the river to conceal her death. Sajani's disappearance garners interest in the village. Sajani's brother Manas and husband gather the men of the village to search the jungle for her. The same two children who discovered Sajani and Henry near the waterfall in compromising position then discover her dead body. It is established that a bullet from an English pistol killed...

Some potential feelings Carson may experience include sadness, disappointment, loneliness, and possibly some relief in being able to process his emotions on his own. It's possible that Carson is sad and upset about the end of his relationship, which is why he decided to tell Kai he couldn't hang out. He may be feeling down and not in the mood to socialize or engage in activities that require him to put on a happy face. Disappointment could also arise from the end of his relationship, depending on the circumstances surrounding the breakup. Additionally, loneliness can be a common reaction after a breakup, as a person might be accustomed to the presence and support of their former partner. Depending on his relationship with Kai, Carson might feel isolated and miss the companionship that his previous relationship provided. On the other hand, Carson may also experience relief in taking time to process his emotions and thoughts after the breakup. Having some alone time can provide a safe space to grieve the end of a relationship and start the healing process.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: These factors will be based on the type of fish that you want to catch. Short rods provide power for fish that give more fight while longer rods cast further. The power of a rod is how much weight in can lift, from light to extra heavy.  Rods can also be chosen based on the weight of the lure or the pound-test line that they are designed to be paired with.  Choose a graphite rod if you want a stiff yet sensitive experience and a fiberglass rod for a tough and powerful one.  Reels are classified as high or low speed  where the latter is used when needing more power to fight large fish. Some reels allow you to push a button to switch between high and low speed. Spinning rod and reels work well with top-water poppers and high-speed plugs. Use your dominant hand to hold the rod as you use your other hand to crank the handle.  Make sure you change the handle of your rod depending on which is your dominant hand. Spool the line by laying the rod on the floor and ensure that the line is going onto the reel at the same direction that the line is leaving the spool. Pinch the line and crank the reel handle a dozen times. With a slack line, drop the tip of the rod to check if the line starts to twist and spin. If it does, you have spooled the line in the wrong direction. Flip the spool over and continue in the right direction as you fill the reel. These rods work best when bottom fishing, jigging, long casting, or when using big baits. Use an open-face reel for casing or jigging to let out and retrieve the line quickly. Use a closed face reel when using lighter lures and baits. Make sure to use your thumb to control the speed of the spool and keep it slow. Baitcasting rods easily get tangled because the spool turns faster than the line as it leaves the rod. If the tangle isn’t too bad you may be able to untangle it by pulling more line off the reel. However, most baitcasting reel have either a centrifugal, magnetic, or electronic cast control to keep your line from getting tangled. Saltwater trolling rods carry a lot of line and their large bodies allow them to take extreme pressure for fighting large fish. These rods are shorter and stronger than casting rods. They may also come with a notched butt for a fighting belt or chair. Rods that are longer with a short butt are meant for use with a fighting belt or chair. Pair the rod with an appropriate line-test where a 20 pound rod and line combo works for sailfish, dolphin and marlin. Use 130 pound rod and line combo for billfish and bluefin tuna. These rods work best for either hovering over a target or to retrieve your line at high speeds. Use specialized tackle to work your lure at the correct speed, either very quickly or slowly depending on the fish. Use vertical jigging  with high-speed rods and metal lures for fast retrieval. In contrast, use rubber jigs to hover over the target or for slow, deliberate retrieval.","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on choosing the right fishing gear - rods, reels, and line - based on factors such as the type of fish, the fishing technique, the rod material, power, the reel speed, and the appropriate line-test, as well as offering tips for specific situations such as spooling, avoiding tangles, and using specialized tackle for effective lure retrieval."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the question: I have a new situation: Scientists are finding more and more evidences of water in the outer space. Earth has mostly liquid water. But that's not the case with other celestial objects. Venus has some water, but it is in gaseous state. On the other hand, water in Jupiter's moon Europa is in frozen state.  But I can use this background: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.  What is an answer for this question: In Europa would the state of water in higher or lower denstiy than in Earth? The answer is:","output":"In Europa, the state of water would be in a lower density than on Earth. This is because water on Europa is mostly in a frozen state due to its low temperature, which results from its distance from the Sun and the lower atmospheric pressure. The hydrogen bonds in water cause it to expand when it freezes, resulting in a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water, as explained in the given background information. Since most water on Earth is in liquid state due to the higher temperature and pressure, the water density on Europa would be lower than on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we infer the following? Hinckley Jr. liked to shoot guns. OPTIONS: 1. Yes; 2. It's impossible to say; 3. No; The answer is:","output":"2. It's impossible to say. While it is true that John Hinckley Jr. used a gun during his attempt to assassinate President Reagan on March 30, 1981, it is not possible to definitively infer that he \\"liked\\" to shoot guns based solely on this event. Shooting a gun to carry out an assassination does not always imply that the person enjoys or likes shooting guns; rather, it could indicate their willingness to resort to violent means to achieve their motives or objectives. In the case of John Hinckley Jr., his assassination attempt on President Reagan was motivated by an obsession with actress Jodie Foster. Hinckley believed that the assassination attempt would catch Foster's attention and impress her. To conclude that Hinckley Jr. liked to shoot guns, one would need more information about his interests, hobbies, or other instances where he used firearms. It could be possible that he had an interest in or affinity for firearms, but the assassination attempt in itself does not provide enough evidence to conclusively establish what Hinckley Jr. truly liked or enjoyed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wednesday morning, with the blessing of House GOP leaders, the Minnesota Republican convened the inaugural meeting of her Tea Party Caucus, where two dozen GOP members of Congress sat down with a similar number of Tea Party activists behind closed doors in an Armed Services Committee room. Then it was Bachmann's job to lead the group across the street to the Capitol for an appearance before TV cameras. \\"Okay, we can just go down the stairs,\\" she called out. \\"You're doing great, everybody. Okay, guys, this way!\\" She accepted a tube of lipstick from a male aide and applied it as she strode through the hallways of the Rayburn Building. \\"The press has been following us,\\" she explained. She continued her march down the Rayburn driveway (\\"Sorry about this long trip; I know it's warm\\") and across Independence Avenue (\\"Okay, let's cross when we can!\\") and finally mustered them a few steps from the TV cameras. \\"Ready to roll?\\" she asked. There and then -- on the Capitol grounds 104 days before the midterm elections -- Tea Party activists and Republican officeholders set aside any pretense about the two groups being separate. They essentially consummated a merger: The activists allowed themselves to be co-opted by a political party, and the Republican leaders allowed themselves to become the faces of the movement. Naturally, both protested that nothing of the sort was occurring. \\"I am not the head of the Tea Party,\\" Bachmann announced as she stood in front of a phalanx of Tea Party leaders. \\"We are also not here to vouch for the Tea Party.\\" With a dozen House Republicans surrounding her, Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, announced that her group \\"wanted to make sure the people in Congress don't become a mouthpiece for the movement.\\" Sorry, ladies. When Tea Party leaders join Republican lawmakers for a private strategy session followed by a campaign rally in the shadow of the Capitol, each has essentially endorsed the other. \\"We have to turn the tide around now in 2010 by electing conservative candidates such as Mrs. Bachmann here,\\" activist Ana Puig proclaimed during her turn at the microphones. \\"Let's lean into the fight, and let's take this country back in November,\\" agreed Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.). Rep. John Culberson (R-Tex.) forecast a Tea Party \\"tsunami that will sweep out these extremists who are governing the Congress in November.\\" A questioner asked Bachmann whether she was \\"putting your Republican colleagues in a spot\\" where they had to embrace the Tea Party. Bachmann said that three House Republican leaders have joined (the head of the House Republicans' 2010 campaign and the chairman of the House Republican Conference are members) and that \\"another member who is in the leadership told me he's very supportive of what we're doing and this is complementary\\" to other Republican efforts to seize the House in November. Bachmann added, incongruously, that she is still \\"hoping to be bipartisan\\" in her Tea Party Caucus. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Tea Party Caucus, led by a Republican politician, and Tea Party activists had a meeting, and then they went together to a place with TV cameras.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Banqueting House , Whitehall , is the grandest and best known survivor of the architectural genre of banqueting house and the only remaining component of the Palace of Whitehall in London . The building is important in the history of English architecture as the first structure to be completed in the neo-classical style , which was to transform English architecture . Begun in 1619 and designed by Inigo Jones in a style influenced by Andrea Palladio , the Banqueting House was completed in 1622 at a cost of £ 15,618 , 27 years before King Charles I of England was executed on a scaffold in front of it in January 1649 . The building was controversially re-faced in Portland stone in the 19th century , though the details of the original façade were faithfully preserved . Today , the Banqueting House is a national monument , open to the public and preserved as a Grade I listed building . It is cared for by an independent charity -- Historic Royal Palaces -- which receives no funding from the British government or the Crown .  - Wrest Park is a country estate located in Silsoe, Bedfordshire, England. It comprises Wrest Park, a Grade I listed country house, and Wrest Park Gardens, also Grade I listed, formal gardens surrounding the mansion.  - Inigo Jones (15 July 1573  21 June 1652) was the first significant English architect (of Welsh ancestry) in the early modern period, and the first to employ Vitruvian rules of proportion and symmetry in his buildings. As the most notable architect in England, Jones was the first person who introduced the classical architecture of Rome and the Italian Renaissance to Britain. He left his mark on London by single buildings, such as the Queen's House which is the first building in England designed in a pure classical style, and the Banqueting House, Whitehall, as well as the layout for Covent Garden square which became a model for future developments in the West End. He made major contributions to stage design by his work as theatrical designer for several dozen masques, most by royal command and many in collaboration with Ben Jonson.  - Whitehall is a road in the City of Westminster, Central London, which forms the first part of the A3212 road from Trafalgar Square to Chelsea. It is the main thoroughfare running south from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. The street is recognised as the centre of Her Majesty's Government and is lined with numerous departments and ministries including the Ministry of Defence, Horse Guards and the Cabinet Office. Consequently, the name \\"Whitehall\\" is used as a metonym for British central governmental administration, and the geographic name for the surrounding area.  - The Tudor period is the period between 1485 and 1603 in England and Wales and includes the Elizabethan period which ends with the completion of the reign of Elizabeth I in 1603. The Tudor period coincides with the rule of the Tudor dynasty in England whose first monarch was Henry VII (14571509). In terms of the entire century, Guy (1988) argues that \\"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors\\" than at any time in a thousand years.  - Paxton's Tower is a Neo-Gothic folly erected in honour of Lord Nelson. It is situated on a hilltop near Llanarthney in the Towy Valley, Carmarthenshire, Wales. It is a visitor attraction that can be combined with a visit to the nearby National Botanic Garden of Wales. Its hilltop location provides views over the Botanic Gardens and the Towy valley. The tower is under care of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty and is a grade II* listed building. History. The tower was built by Sir William Paxton (1745-1824), a Scottish-born but London-raised merchant and banker, whose forefathers were from Auchencrow by Paxton, Berwickshire. Paxton made his first fortune while with the HEIC in Calcutta with Charles Cockerell, brother of the architect. He purchased the Middleton Hall estate about 1790 and built the tower circa 1806-1809. Designed by the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell (1754-1827), Middleton Hall was destroyed by fire in 1931.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - In English architecture, mainly from the Tudor period onwards, a banqueting house is a separate pavilion-like building reached through the gardens from the main residence, whose use is purely for entertaining, especially eating. Or it may be on the roof, as in many 16th-century prodigy houses. It may be raised for additional air or a vista, with a simple kitchen below, as at Hampton Court Palace and Wrest Park, and it may be richly decorated, but it normally contains no bedrooms, and typically a single room apart from any service spaces. The design is often ornamental, if not downright fanciful, and some are also follies, as in Paxton's Tower. There are usually plenty of windows, as appreciating the view was a large part of their purpose. Often they are built on a slope, so that from the front, only the door to the main room can be seen; the door to the servants' spaces underneath was hidden at the back (Wrest Park). The Banqueting House, Gibside is an example.  - Hampton Court Palace is a royal palace in the town of East Molesey, Richmond upon Thames, Greater London, England, south west and upstream of central London on the River Thames. Redevelopment began to be carried out in 1515 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the King seized the palace for himself and later enlarged it. Along with St James's Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by King Henry VIII.  - In architecture a pavilion (from French \\"pavillon\\", from Latin \\"papilio\\") has several meanings. In architectural terminology it refers to a subsidiary building that is either positioned separately or as an attachment to a main building. Often its function makes it an object of pleasure.   - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The Palace of Whitehall (or Palace of White Hall) was the main residence of the English monarchs in London from 1530 until 1698 when most of its structures, except for Inigo Jones's 1622 Banqueting House, were destroyed by fire. Before then, it had grown to be the largest palace in Europe with more than 1,500 rooms, overtaking the Vatican and Versailles. The palace gives its name, Whitehall, to the road on which many of the current administrative buildings of the UK government are situated, and hence metonymically to the central government itself.

In 1983, he said in the New Statesman Adolf Hitler \\"didn't just pick on them [Jewish people] for no reason\\". Aberystwyth author Jasmine Donahaye said: \\"We need to address it, acknowledge it, discuss it.\\" In the same New Statesman publication, Dahl said: \\"There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity.\\" Dr Donahaye tweeted that Dahl's anti-Semitism was \\"well known and ugly\\". Organisers have been asked to comment. Celebrations to mark 100 years since the author was born in Cardiff began on Saturday in the capital and continue on Sunday. Dr Donahaye told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement this ugly side of Dahl should not be glossed over. \\"I don't think we should not celebrate him... it's an opportunity, and particularly because he's a children's writer, to use it as a jumping off point for a discussion.\\" But Plaid Cymru's Dwyfor Meirionnydd AM Dafydd Elis-Thomas said: \\"I would definitely say there's a world of difference between the views of an author and the literary production that we are celebrating - for me this was a huge carnival about a literary production.\\" On Saturday, a giant peach was carried through Cardiff and taken to the castle as part of the celebrations and Sunday sees a great pyjama picnic in Bute Park. But Dr Donahaye said this darker side should not be neglected amid the festivities. \\"Roald Dahl is an excellent opportunity to raise the issue with children and start to discuss it with children and bring to their awareness how that discourse manifests - obviously in an age-appropriate way. \\"If there's public funding going into a centenary celebration I think there's an onus on us to look at the complexity of that figure that we're celebrating - maybe that makes the celebration a bit more nuanced, a little bit darker, but that's appropriate. \\"I don't think they [the organisers] have been dishonest, I think it's a missed opportunity.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"There was a big celebration for a famous author named Roald Dahl, who would have been 100 years old.
