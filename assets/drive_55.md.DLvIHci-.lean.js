Untuk mengabaikan susunan kata dan memunculkan hasil yang mengandung semua kata kunci meskipun tidak dalam urutan yang sama, kita menggunakan \`SEARCH\` untuk mencari kata kunci di setiap entri. Jika Anda menggunakan Excel dalam versi yang mendukung dynamic arrays dan fungsi \`FILTER\` dan \`SEARCH\`, rumus Anda harusnya bekerja. Saya telah memperbarui rumus tersebut dengan pengecekan tambahan untuk kasus di mana semua kolom dari A3 hingga E3 kosong, dan juga untuk mengkonversi teks ke huruf uppercase sebelum pencocokan, yang akan membantu memastikan perbandingan tidak memperhatikan kecil atau besar huruf. Namun, pada bagian \`UPPER\` di dalam fungsi \`SEARCH\` tidak diperlukan karena \`SEARCH\` sudah tidak sensitif terhadap huruf besar atau kecil. Berikut rumus yang diubah, yang harus Anda letakkan di sel G283: \`\`\`excel =IF(AND(A3=\\"\\", B3=\\"\\", C3=\\"\\", D3=\\"\\", E3=\\"\\"), \\"Silahkan tulis detail jaringan\\", IF(AND(A3=0, B3=0, C3=\\"\\", D3=\\"\\", E3=\\"\\"), \\"Silahkan tulis detail jaringan\\", IFERROR( FILTER(F3:F282, (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(A3), UPPER(A3:A282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(B3), UPPER(B3:B282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(C3), UPPER(C3:C282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(D3), UPPER(D3:D282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(E3), UPPER(E3:E282))) ), \\"Master tidak ditemukan\\" ) ) ) \`\`\` Pastikan bahwa fungsi \`FILTER\` dan \`SEARCH\` tersedia dalam versi Excel Anda karena fitur tersebut diperkenalkan di Microsoft 365 dan Excel Online.

Perlu diingat bahwa rumus di atas menggunakan fungsi yang mungkin tidak tersedia di semua versi Excel dan bisa bersifat array yang perlu dienter dengan \`Ctrl\` + \`Shift\` + \`Enter\` tergantung pada versi Excel yang Anda gunakan. Catatan: Ada batasan pada jumlah argumen yang dapat diolah oleh fungsi PRODUCT, SEARCH, atau fungsi-fungsi lainnya, tergantung pada versi Excel yang Anda gunakan. Jika rumus ini melebihi batasan tersebut, mungkin perlu pendekatan lain."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a ninja bumping into a what he dubs, a modern-day ninja.

Suddenly, something rustles in the bushes. A figure steps out, lit by the bluish hue of the night vision goggles he wears. This is JACK, clad in a skin-tight wetsuit, combat boots, and tactical gear - a stark contrast to the surrounding tranquillity of the garden. The GREEN BERET cocks his MK 23 SOCOM pistol, ready to engage any threat. HAYATE (whispering to himself): \\"A shinobi in the garb of a fish? Surely this night plays tricks on me.\\" Hayate melts into the shadows again, intrigued and cautious. Jack's goggles flare green as he peers into the darkness, sensing motion but unable to locate the source. JACK: \\"Who's there?

We move in silence, strike with precision. We have more in common than you think.\\" Suddenly, a SHOUT is heard from within the dojo, and both men snap their heads towards the source.

В письменной речи нередко используется именно такая транскрипция — \\"мг\\". Есть и несколько других способов записать этот звук, зависящих от контекста и характера звука: 1. \\"М-м-м\\" или \\"ммм\\" могут быть использованы для выражения размышления или сомнения. 2. \\"Мгм\\" иногда записывают, чтобы показать полуутвердительный или неуверенный звук. 3. \\"Мг-г\\" или \\"мг-гм\\" могут использоваться для выражения возмущения или несогласия. Помимо этого, в русском языке \\"мг\\" может выражать звук, который человек издает, столкнувшись с неожиданностью или также нежеланием что-либо говорить. Но обычно в письменности или диалогах используется точная транскрипция - \\"мг\\", которая наиболее прямо отражает невербальную реакцию человека."},{"instruction":"А как согласие \\"Мгм\\" будет произнесено и записано на английском и китайском?","output":"В английском языке выражение согласия невербальным звуком зачастую записывается как \\"Mhm\\" или \\"Mm-hmm\\".

На китайском такое выражение согласия невербальным звуком может быть представлено звуками \\"嗯\\" (ēn), \\"恩\\" (ēn), или \\"嗯嗯\\" (ēn ēn), которые произносятся с различными тональностями, в зависимости от контекста.

A) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) B) Helicobacter pylori infection C) Chronic bile reflux D) Excessive alcohol consumption"},{"instruction":"C","output":"Correct! Chronic bile reflux is more commonly associated with chronic gastritis rather than acute gastritis. Acute gastritis is typically caused by factors that suddenly inflame or damage the stomach lining, such as NSAIDs, Helicobacter pylori infection, and excessive alcohol consumption. Chronic bile reflux may irritate the stomach over a longer period, contributing to chronic gastritis. Ready for the next question?

A) Granulomas B) Lymphoid follicles C) Neutrophilic infiltration D) Eosinophilic infiltration"},{"instruction":"B","output":"Correct! Lymphoid follicles are a histological finding often associated with chronic gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection.

A) Regular use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) B) Consumption of a high-salt diet C) Smoking D) Heavy alcohol use"},{"instruction":"A","output":"Correct! Regular use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been associated with a decreased risk of chronic gastritis, particularly in those cases related to Helicobacter pylori infection, because it reduces the gastric acidity that can exacerbate inflammation and allows for better healing of the gastric mucosa.

Karar vermek her zaman karmaşık bir iş olduğu için bu kargaşanın içerisinden çıkmak oldukça zordur. Rasyonel kararlar vermeyi engelleyen ön yargılar nedeniyle karar vermek oldukça zor olabilir. Bilişsel ön yargılar, rasyonel kararların, yani hesaplanmış kararların önünde koca bir engel olarak durur.","output":"Rasyonellik, en iyi sonucu getirecek seçeneğin bilinçli bir şekilde seçilmesini gerektirir. Bununla birlikte, insan zihninin karmaşıklığı ve çeşitli bilişsel yanılgılar ve duygusal önyargılar, bu idealize karar verme sürecini sık sık zorlaştırır. Önyargılar, çeşitli kaynaklardan türemiş olabilir. Bazı önyargılar evrimsel bir miras olarak görülebilir; örneğin, risklerden kaçınma eğilimimiz veya aşina olunan şeylere karşı bir tercihtir. Bu tür önyargılar, atalarımızın hayatta kalma stratejileri olarak gelişmiş olabilir ve DNA'mızın bir parçası olarak aktarılmış olabilir. Diğer önyargılar ise kişisel deneyimlerimiz ve öğrenmemiz sonucu gelişir. Kültürel normlar, eğitim, medya ve kişisel tecrübeler, düşünce ve karar verme süreçlerimizi şekillendiren etkenler arasındadır. Bilişsel yanılgılar, objektif gerçeklere göre ziyade zihinsel kısayollar ya da “heuristics” kullanarak karar verme eğilimimiz sonucunda ortaya çıkar. Bu kısayollar genellikle verimli ve yararlıdır, çünkü sınırlı zaman ve kaynaklarla karar vermemize yardımcı olurlar. Ancak, bilişsel yanılgılar aynı zamanda yanıltıcı sonuçlara da yol açabilir ve bu da rasyonel karar verme yeteneğimizi engelleyebilir. Rasyonel karar vermek için, insanların önyargılarının ve bilişsel yanlışlarının farkında olmaları ve bunları eleştirel bir şekilde değerlendirmeleri önemlidir. Bunu başarmak zor olsa da, aşağıdaki yaklaşımlar yardımcı olabilir: - **Bilgi edinme:** Karar vermeden önce kapsamlı ve farklı kaynaklardan bilgi toplamak. - **Eleştirel düşünme:** Bilgiyi ve varsayımları sürekli sorgulamak, kararlarımızın ardındaki mantığı değerlendirmek. - **Çeşitlilik:** Farklı bakış açılarını ve fikirleri göz önünde bulundurmak, grup düşüncesini önlemek. - **Duygusal farkındalık:** Karar verme sürecinde duyguların rolünün farkında olmak ve duygusal dürtülerle değil, nesnel değerlendirmelerle hareket etmek. - **Uzun vadeli düşünme:** Anlık tatmin yerine uzun vadeli sonuçlara odaklanmak. - **Sistemli yaklaşımlar:** Karar matrisleri kullanmak, pro ve contra listeleri yapmak gibi sistematik süreçlerden yararlanmak. Karar verme sürecini iyileştirmek için kullanılabilecek stratejiler ve araçlar olsa da, bilişsel ve duygusal önyargıların tamamen ortadan kaldırılması zordur. Rasyonel karar verme yeteneğimizi geliştirmeye yönelik sürekli bir öğrenme ve uygulama süreci gereklidir."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Fungsi \`ISNUMBER\` digunakan untuk memastikan hasil dari \`SEARCH\` adalah nomor, yang menandakan bahwa kata kunci ditemukan. 3. Operator \`*\` berfungsi sebagai AND dalam konteks array boolean (TRUE/FALSE) di Excel. Sehingga, hanya baris yang memenuhi semua kondisi (semua terdapat TRUE) lah yang akan di-filter. 4. Fungsi \`FILTER\` mengambil range A2:A100 dan array kondisi yang telah dibentuk untuk menghasilkan output data yang memenuhi kondisi pencarian. Perlu diperhatikan bahwa contoh di atas mengasumsikan bahwa data yang anda cari berada di dalam satu kolom (A2:A100). Jika data yang ingin Anda filter tersebar di berbagai kolom, anda mungkin ingin menyesuaikan range pencarian (\`A2:A100\` bagian pada \`SEARCH\`) untuk setiap kata kunci agar mencerminkan kolom yang sesuai. Sebagai contoh, jika setiap kolom dari A hingga E memiliki jenis data yang berbeda dan Anda ingin filter data berdasarkan kesesuaian di masing-masing kolom secara horizontal: \`\`\`excel =FILTER(A2:E100, (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(A3), UPPER(A2:A100))) * ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(B3), UPPER(B2:B100))) * ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(C3), UPPER(C2:C100))) * ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(D3), UPPER(D2:D100))) * ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(E3), UPPER(E2:E100))))) \`\`\` Dengan rumus di atas, setiap kondisi \`SEARCH\` akan mencari dalam kolom yang sesuai (misalnya A3 dalam A2:A100, B3 dalam B2:B100, dst.).

The \`FILTER\` function is used to search through the range F3:F282 and return the cells where the criteria are met for each corresponding cell in columns A through E from rows 3 to 282. The criteria are checked using the \`SEARCH\` function, which is case-insensitive, and wrapped by \`ISNUMBER\` to ensure that the \`SEARCH\` function has found the substring from cells A3, B3, C3, D3, or E3 within the corresponding cell ranges A3:A282, B3:B282, C3:C282, D3:D282, or E3:E282. 4. Each \`SEARCH\` function is put inside an \`ISNUMBER\` function to convert the search results to TRUE (if a number is returned, indicating the substring is found) or FALSE (if not found). 5. \`UPPER\` is used to make the search case-insensitive. The \`UPPER\` function converts text to uppercase, and it should be applied to both the search substring and the text being searched. However, in your formula, the \`UPPER\` function needs to be applied to both sides of the \`SEARCH\` function, meaning it should be like this \`SEARCH(UPPER(A3), UPPER(A3:A282))\` to ensure a case-insensitive search. 6. The search criteria are combined with the multiplication symbol (\`*\`), which acts as an AND operator in array contexts. This means that for a row to be included in the filter results, each search must return true (i.e., find the substring). If the formula does not work, you should ensure the intended behavior of the \`UPPER\` function. It should wrap around both the fixed criteria (e.g., A3) and the cell ranges (e.g., A3:A282). The correct usage should look like this: \`\`\`excel (IF(AND(A3=\\"\\", B3=\\"\\", C3=\\"\\", D3=\\"\\", E3=\\"\\"), \\"Silahkan tulis detail jaringan\\", IFERROR( FILTER(F3:F282, (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(A3), UPPER(A3:A282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(B3), UPPER(B3:B282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(C3), UPPER(C3:C282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(D3), UPPER(D3:D282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(E3), UPPER(E3:E282)))) ), \\"Master tidak ditemukan\\" ) ) \`\`\` Remember that \`FILTER\` is an array function and will only work if you are using a version of Excel that supports dynamic arrays (Office 365, Excel 2019 or later). If your version of Excel does not support dynamic arrays, you'll need an alternative approach to achieve the filtering functionality."},{"instruction":"bantu aku memperbaiki rumus excel di bawah","output":"Tentu, saya siap membantu!

Jika teks tersebut ditemukan, baris tersebut akan difilter dan ditampilkan. Namun, ada beberapa hal yang perlu diperhatikan terkait rumus ini: 1. Pemanggilan fungsi \`UPPER\` seharusnya dilakukan untuk kriteria pencarian (misalnya \`A3\`) dan bukan untuk seluruh rentang yang sedang disaring, kecuali jika Anda ingin mencari berdasarkan representasi teks yang diubah menjadi huruf besar (uppercase) di seluruh rentang. 2. Penggunaan \`SEARCH\` akan menemukan teks di mana saja dalam string yang ada dalam sel, bahkan jika itu bukan kata utuh. Jika ini bukan yang diinginkan, pertimbangkan menggunakan \`FIND\` yang akan mempersyaratkan pencarian case-sensitive. 3. Penggunaan \`ISNUMBER\` dengan \`SEARCH\` akan memberikan TRUE jika teks ditemukan di dalam sel dan FALSE jika tidak. Memperbaiki rumus berdasarkan poin-poin di atas: \`\`\`excel FILTER(F3:F282, (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(A3), UPPER(A3:A282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(B3), UPPER(B3:B282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(C3), UPPER(C3:C282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(D3), UPPER(D3:D282)))) * (ISNUMBER(SEARCH(UPPER(E3), UPPER(E3:E282)))) ) \`\`\` Metode \`UPPER\` sekarang diterapkan ke sel pencarian sehingga pencarian tidak sensitif terhadap huruf besar-kecil.

Explore IBM® watsonx.ai Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are designed to generate specific outputs based on the quality of provided prompts. Prompt engineering helps generative AI models better comprehend and respond to a wide range of queries, from the simple to the highly technical. The basic rule is that good prompts equal good results. Generative AI relies on the iterative refinement of different prompt engineering techniques to effectively learn from diverse input data and adapt to minimize biases, confusion and produce more accurate responses. Prompt engineers play a pivotal role in crafting queries that help generative AI models understand not just the language but also the nuance and intent behind the query. A high-quality, thorough and knowledgeable prompt, in turn, influences the quality of AI-generated content, whether it’s images, code, data summaries or text. A thoughtful approach to creating prompts is necessary to bridge the gap between raw queries and meaningful AI-generated responses. By fine-tuning effective prompts, engineers can significantly optimize the quality and relevance of outputs to solve for both the specific and the general. This process reduces the need for manual review and post-generation editing, ultimately saving time and effort in achieving the desired outcomes.

Related content Tech-led disruptions are accelerating, driven by generative AI Book a live demo of IBM® watsonx.ai Explore foundation models in watsonx.ai How does prompt engineering work? Generative AI models are built on transformer architectures, which enable them to grasp the intricacies of language and process vast amounts of data through neural networks. AI prompt engineering helps mold the model’s output, ensuring the artificial intelligence responds meaningfully and coherently. Several prompting techniques ensure AI models generate helpful responses, including tokenization, model parameter tuning and top-k sampling. Prompt engineering is proving vital for unleashing the full potential of the foundation models that power generative AI. Foundation models are large language models (LLMs) built on transformer architecture and packed with all the information the generative AI system needs. Generative AI models operate based on natural language processing (NLP) and use natural language inputs to produce complex results. The underlying data science preparations, transformer architectures and machine learning algorithms enable these models to understand language and then use massive datasets to create text or image outputs. Text-to-image generative AI like DALL-E and Midjourney uses an LLM in concert with stable diffusion, a model that excels at generating images from text descriptions. Effective prompt engineering combines technical knowledge with a deep understanding of natural language, vocabulary and context to produce optimal outputs with few revisions. Tutorial Develop system and instruction prompts with Llama 2 Best practices for prompt engineering using Llama 2. What are the benefits of prompt engineering? The primary benefit of prompt engineering is the ability to achieve optimized outputs with minimal post-generation effort. Generative AI outputs can be mixed in quality, often requiring skilled practitioners to review and revise. By crafting precise prompts, prompt engineers ensure that AI-generated output aligns with the desired goals and criteria, reducing the need for extensive post-processing. It is also the purview of the prompt engineer to understand how to get the best results out of the variety of generative AI models on the market. For example, writing prompts for Open AI’s GPT-3 or GPT-4 differs from writing prompts for Google Bard. Bard can access information through Google Search, so it can be instructed to integrate more up-to-date information into its results. However, ChatGPT is the better tool for ingesting and summarizing text, as that was its primary design function. Well-crafted prompts guide AI models to create more relevant, accurate and personalized responses. Because AI systems evolve with use, highly engineered prompts make long-term interactions with AI more efficient and satisfying. Clever prompt engineers working in open-source environments are pushing generative AI to do incredible things not necessarily a part of their initial design scope and are producing some surprising real-world results. For example, researchers developed a new AI system that can translate language without being trained on a parallel text; engineers are embedding generative AI in games to engage human players in truly responsive storytelling and even to gain accurate new insights into the astronomical phenomena of black holes. Prompt engineering will become even more critical as generative AI systems grow in scope and complexity. What skills does a prompt engineer need? Large technology organizations are hiring prompt engineers to develop new creative content, answer complex questions and improve machine translation and NLP tasks. Skills prompt engineers should have include familiarity with large language models, strong communication skills, the ability to explain technical concepts, programming expertise (particularly in Python) and a firm grasp of data structures and algorithms. Creativity and a realistic assessment of the benefits and risks of new technologies are also valuable in this role. While models are trained in multiple languages, English is often the primary language used to train generative AI. Prompt engineers will need a deep understanding of vocabulary, nuance, phrasing, context and linguistics because every word in a prompt can influence the outcome. Prompt engineers should also know how to effectively convey the necessary context, instructions, content or data to the AI model. If the goal is to generate code, a prompt engineer must understand coding principles and programming languages. Those working with image generators should know art history, photography, and film terms. Those generating language context may need to know various narrative styles or literary theories. In addition to a breadth of communication skills, prompt engineers need to understand generative AI tools and the deep learning frameworks that guide their decision-making. Prompt engineers can employ the following advanced techniques to improve the model’s understanding and output quality. Zero-shot prompting provides the machine learning model with a task it hasn’t explicitly been trained on. Zero-shot prompting tests the model’s ability to produce relevant outputs without relying on prior examples. Few-shot prompting or in-context learning gives the model a few sample outputs (shots) to help it learn what the requestor wants it to do. The learning model can better understand the desired output if it has context to draw on. Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) is an advanced technique that provides step-by-step reasoning for the model to follow. Breaking down a complex task into intermediate steps, or “chains of reasoning,” helps the model achieve better language understanding and create more accurate outputs. Prompt engineering use cases As generative AI becomes more accessible, organizations are discovering new and innovative ways to use prompt engineering to solve real-world problems. Chatbots Prompt engineering is a powerful tool to help AI chatbots generate contextually relevant and coherent responses in real-time conversations. Chatbot developers can ensure the AI understands user queries and provides meaningful answers by crafting effective prompts. Healthcare In healthcare, prompt engineers instruct AI systems to summarize medical data and develop treatment recommendations. Effective prompts help AI models process patient data and provide accurate insights and recommendations. Software development Prompt engineering plays a role in software development by using AI models to generate code snippets or provide solutions to programming challenges. Using prompt engineering in software development can save time and assist developers in coding tasks. Software engineering Because generative AI systems are trained in various programming languages, prompt engineers can streamline the generation of code snippets and simplify complex tasks. By crafting specific prompts, developers can automate coding, debug errors, design API integrations to reduce manual labor and create API-based workflows to manage data pipelines and optimize resource allocation. Cybersecurity and computer science Prompt engineering is used to develop and test security mechanisms. Researchers and practitioners leverage generative AI to simulate cyberattacks and design better defense strategies. Additionally, crafting prompts for AI models can aid in discovering vulnerabilities in software.

XIX a. antrosios pusės – XX a. pradžios istorijos kontekste, populiarioji kultūra yra dinamiškas laikotarpis, kuris atspindi ne tik kultūrines, bet ir technologines, socialines bei ekonomines transformacijas. Nuo pramonės revoliucijos iki pirmojo pasaulinio karo, populiarioji kultūra tapo masinės pramogų dalimi, skleidžiančia žinutes ir vertybes vis platesniems visuomenės sluoksniams. Šio darbo tikslas yra išanalizuoti populiariosios kultūros radimąsi ir raidą XIX a. antroje pusėje ir XX a. pradžioje, atsižvelgiant į įvairias geopolitines erdves ir jų kultūrinius ypatumus. **Darbo tikslas** Išsamiai ištirti ir aprašyti populiariosios kultūros atsiradimo ir vystymosi procesus XIX a. pabaigoje – XX a. pradžioje, atskleidžiant pagrindines priežastis, raidos veiksnius bei įtaką socialiniams sluoksniams. **Darbo uždaviniai** 1. Apibrėžti populiariosios kultūros sąvoką ir jos vaidmenį visuomenėje. 2. Išanalizuoti pramonės revoliucijos, urbanizacijos, masinės spaudos bei švietimo pokyčius bei jų įtaką populiariosios kultūros formavimuisi. 3. Aptarti politines, ekonomines ir technologines priežastis, skatinusias populiariosios kultūros atsiradimą. 4. Atskleisti, kaip populiarioji kultūra veikė prastuomenės ir aukštuomenės gyvenimą bei santykius. 5. Identifikuoti pagrindines populiariosios kultūros sritis ir jų ryškiausius aspektus bei žanrus. 6. Ištirti populiariosios kultūros reiškinius ir jų atsiradimo veiksnius minėtu laikotarpiu. 7. Palyginti Europos valstybių ir Japonijos populiariosios kultūros ypatumus bei jų raidos skirtumus. **Problematika ir aktualumas** Populiarioji kultūra yra reikšmingas šiuolaikinės visuomenės bruožas, tad suprasti jos pamatus ir raidos etapus reikšminga norint suvokti šiuolaikines kultūros formas ir tendencijas. Be to, šis tyrimas suteikia unikalią galimybę pažvelgti į kultūrinės globalizacijos pradžios etapus, kai lokalios tradicijos susipynė su masinėmis kultūrinėmis reiškiniais, formuojant naujas socialines ir kultūrines praktikas bei identitetus. Studijuojant populiariosios kultūros atsiradimą įžvelgiame ir technologijų, ekonomikos, socialinių ir politinių veiksnių sąveiką, kas yra būtina norint suprasti platesnius istorinius procesus. Akivaizdu, kad populiarioji kultūra ne vien atspindi svarbius istorinius pokyčius, bet ir pati juos kuria bei palaiko, o tai yra reikšmingas aspektas žmogaus kultūros ir socializacijos studijose."},{"instruction":"ar gali parašyti I Skyrių remiantis autoriais, bei cituojant jų kūrinius","output":"Atsiprašau, tačiau negaliu tiesiogiai cituoti autorių kūrinių, nes neperžiūriu ir neanalizuoju turinio iš nurodytų knygų; taip pat mano funkcija neapima teksto generavimo tiesiogiai iš autorių kūrinių.

Их имена могут быть адаптированы для англоязычной аудитории таким образом, чтобы сохранить их уникальность и оригинальное звучание. Вот примеры такой адаптации: 1. Кролик Крош — Rabbit Krosh (персонажу могут оставить оригинальное имя \\"Крош\\" в английской транскрипции \\"Krosh\\", добавив к нему слово \\"Rabbit\\" для обозначения его вида). 2. Ёжик Ёжик — Hedgehog Yozhik (имя \\"Ёжик\\" можно адаптировать к английскому произношению как \\"Yozhik\\", поскольку \\"yo\\" является английским звуком, близким к русскому \\"ё\\", а \\"Hedgehog\\" означает \\"ёж\\"). 3. Ворон Кар-Карыч — Raven Kar-Karych (звукоподражательное имя можно оставить почти неизменным, а \\"Raven\\" указывает на вид птицы). 4. Поросёнок Нюша — Piglet Nyusha (имя \\"Нюша\\" адаптировано в виде транслитерации \\"Nyusha\\", а \\"Piglet\\" — общепринятое обозначение для маленького поросенка на английском языке).

Вот предложения адаптаций: 1. Кролик Крош: - Английское имя: Hoppy или Bounce Обоснование: Эти имена играют на соединении характера кролика с прыжками (\\"hop\\" - прыгать). Это дает понять, что персонаж активен и имеет характеристики, связанные с кроликами. 2. Ёжик Ёжик: - Английское имя: Spiny Обоснование: Имя \\"Spiny\\" происходит от слова \\"spines\\", обозначающего иглы ежа, таким образом, сохраняется звучание и в то же время передается одна из основных черт ежа - его иглы. 3. Ворон Кар-Карыч: - Английское имя: Caw-Caw или Cawley Обоснование: \\"Caw\\" - это звук, который издают вороны на английском, и использование такого имени подчеркивает характер звукоподражания вороньего крика. \\"Cawley\\" может быть вариантом, если нужно более персонализированное имя. 4. Поросёнок Нюша: - Английское имя: Pinky или Snouty Обоснование: \\"Pinky\\" может быть выбрано из-за розового цвета поросенка, что делает имя милым и подходящим. \\"Snouty\\" играет на характерной черте свиней - их характерном рыле (snout).

Jika kamu ingin mencari kata kunci dalam satu kolom dan mengabaikan susunan kata-kata, kamu bisa menggunakan \`SEARCH\` dengan mencari setiap kata kunci secara terpisah dan memeriksa apakah semuanya ada di dalam teks. Namun, jika data yang ingin dicari ada di kolom yang sama dan kamu ingin menemukan semua kata kunci tidak peduli dengan urutannya, kamu dapat memisah kata kunci dan mencari masing-masing secara terpisah. Dengan mengingat kondisi tersebut di atas, mari kita buat rumus yang dimodifikasi dan diperbarui. Kita asumsikan bahwa: - Kolom A3 hingga E3 adalah di mana kata kunci diinput. - Kolom F3 hingga F282 adalah di mana data untuk difilter berada. - Rumus untuk menampilkan hasil filter akan diletakkan di G283. Berikut rumusnya: \`\`\`excel =IF(AND(A3=0, B3=0, C3=0, D3=0, E3=0), \\"Silahkan tulis detail jaringan\\", IF(AND(A3=\\"\\", B3=\\"\\", C3=\\"\\", D3=\\"\\", E3=\\"\\"), \\"Master tidak ditemukan\\", LET( text, TEXTJOIN(\\"|\\", TRUE, IF(A3<>\\"\\", A3, \\"\\"), IF(B3<>\\"\\", B3, \\"\\"), IF(C3<>\\"\\", C3, \\"\\"), IF(D3<>\\"\\", D3, \\"\\"), IF(E3<>\\"\\", E3, \\"\\")), FILTER(F3:F282, IF(A3&B3&C3&D3&E3=\\"\\", FALSE, ISNUMBER(SEARCH(text, UPPER(F3:F282)))), \\"Master tidak ditemukan\\") ) ) \`\`\` Penjelasan: - Pertama, kita menggunakan \`IF\` untuk memeriksa apakah semua kolom A3 hingga E3 bernilai 0. Jika ya, kita akan menampilkan pesan \\"Silahkan tulis detail jaringan\\". - Jika kondisi pertama tidak terpenuhi, kita menggunakan \`LET\` untuk menyederhanakan rumus dengan menetapkan variabel \`text\` yang merupakan gabungan dari semua kata kunci, dipisahkan oleh garis vertikal (\`|\`), yang digunakan sebagai delimeter regex untuk \`SEARCH\`. - Fungsi \`TEXTJOIN\` digunakan untuk membuat string tunggal dari kata kunci dengan pemisah \\"|\\". Ini memungkinkan \`SEARCH\` untuk mencari beberapa kata kunci dalam satu panggilan. - Kemudian, kita menggunakan \`FILTER\` untuk menyaring kolom F3 hingga F282 berdasarkan keberadaan teks dalam \`text\`. Jika tidak ada baris yang cocok, maka akan menampilkan \\"Master tidak ditemukan\\". - Nota: Fitur seperti \`TEXTJOIN\`, \`LET\` dan \`FILTER\` hanya tersedia di versi Excel terbaru yang mendukung formulir Array Dinamis.

However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the \\"program,\\" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 19/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE. We show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied to steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness, as well as to improve few-shot learning performance by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts.

If the Yireh stems from your seychel, that means you have an understanding, you have a clarity, you have a havone, clear havone, that you have to put your Yiras Shomayim on a higher level than your tayveh. You know that. And you know the toichen and you know everything. But Yireh in the end is a t’chusha. It is a feeling. So because Yireh is a feeling, like all the feelings it has ups and downs. One of the biggest difficulties we have is that we want to build our avoidas Hashem on feelings. We want to do that. When we feel something in tefilah, we feel something in learning, or we feel something in anything we have, any activity which is considered a mitzvah, and we have a feeling associated with it, we seem to think that we have reached what we have to reach and now we will be able to build on that. Because this feeling is real. And that's what it feels like. It's real. So you have this real feeling. And then you think, now I can build on it. No, you are actually building on quicksand. You build on a thing which is not able to keep up, not shayach. It's not built like this. We must repeat that to ourselves over and over again. Feelings are not built to be there in a constant way. I don't know why people think like this. It's really misusing the thing. It's wrong. It doesn't work like this. It is a fatal mistake. People give up on avoideh because they believe that is what they should build upon. And then they build on quicksand. And then they are meuyash. They despair of avoideh. So that's terrible. The regesh is only one aspect of avoidas Hashem, and is not the right thing to build on. And now this is the riddle. Even though Yiras Shomayim is built from your Seychel, and the Seychel is not subject to change, because the Seychel by definition does not change, otherwise it means you made a mistake. We are not speaking of mistakes over here. You have a solid insight, a right insight that stays forever. That doesn't change. So even though Yireh is a feeling or a hergesh associated with your thoughts, but because it's a hergesh, it has its ups and downs. You can't help it. So design all of this element. Won't always be on the same level. It can't be. I think it is one of the central difficulties, especially by the American Tzibur, is they are very much into that feeling. You know, they had to feel something. Feeling excited, feeling connected. They have all different kind of names for feelings, which I don't know what it means. You feel connected, does it mean like some kind of connection to electricity? You have different kinds of feelings. And then you want to build on that. And this is a disaster. This is a way straight to yiush. There's no choice. You will have yiush. It won't keep up. It's quicksand. It's not built like this. It's a good thing to feel something. It's like a reward. It's a good thing. But it's not the basis, because it doesn't keep up. So the same thing is the Yiras Shomayim. That's the riddle, that even though Yireh is built from your Segel, and the Segel doesn't change, but the Yireh changes. The Yireh has its ups and downs. So מימלא Mela, the Yireh, אמנם אין היראה מתוקנת תמיד במדריגה עליונה אשר יהיה בכחה להגביר חיילים תמיד נגד התאוה היותר גדולה Yireh is built from the Segel. If you build a house, you will have the Yireh and the Segel. You are not built. Yireh is built in that way even when you acquired it through these hisbonenus. But it's not built in that way that is always on this high madreigah. That you are able to be stronger than an attack of tayveh.","output":"Indeed, the cultivation of true fear of Heaven isn't always maintained at the highest level capable of overpowering the mightiest of desires. Therein lies a profound conundrum inherent within the concept of Yirah. When Yirah is derived from the intellect – your seychel – it signifies that you possess clear understanding and discernment, a crystalized havonah, recognizing the imperative to elevate your Yiras Shamayim above your physical cravings. You are equipped with knowledge and full awareness of the content. However, ultimately, Yirah is a sensation, an emotional experience. Like any emotion, it fluctuates, marked by highs and lows. Our venerable tradition acknowledges one of the formidable challenges is the inclination to anchor our Avodas Hashem in these transient feelings. We long for it particularly when we sense a spiritual awakening within our tefillah, during moments of Torah study, or any mitzvah-related endeavor – these feelings tempt us into believing we've achieved our spiritual goal, on which we can solidly build. Yet, in truth, what we're experiencing is not a firm base but rather ephemeral; it's akin to building on quicksand. This needs to be reiterated because the nature of emotions isn't to linger unchangingly. Misjudging this can lead to misuse and is fundamentally misguided – a perilous error. When we rely on this unstable foundation, we set ourselves up for disillusionment and may fall into despair when our efforts in Avodah inevitably falter. This misstep is grave. Emotion – regesh – is only one facet of serving the Almighty and should not be the cornerstone. And here lies the riddle: Although Yiras Shamayim is anchored in the seychel, which by its nature is constant and unswerving (for to say otherwise would imply error, which is not our present discussion), we're dealing with a solid and consistent insight that remains unaltered. Even so, while Yirah may stem from cognitive processes, given that it is also an hergesh – a felt experience – it is susceptible to variances. You cannot avoid this - it is inherent to its design. It simply cannot remain static at its apex. I've observed that this specific struggle seems especially pronounced within the American community. There is a marked fixation on 'feeling' – being excited, feeling connected – and they've coined all manner of nomenclature for these sensations, whose meanings are often elusive. Is feeling connected akin to an electrical link? They endeavor to build upon this shaky ground, which is a direct path to disillusionment. You cannot avert the ensuing sense of defeat and despondency. Emotions, though validating and gratifying like a reward, cannot serve as a foundation since they lack the stability. Thus, the enigma returns: despite Yirah being rooted in the intellect – which is unchangeable – Yirah itself is subject to change, to rise and fall. Consequently, although it is a product of contemplation and intellect, Yirah cannot continuously sustain its most elevated state whereby it can invariably withstand the assault of intense desire."},{"instruction":"try again in a more natural tone","output":"Absolutely, it's a mistake to think that yirah, fear of Heaven, can always be perfectly aligned at the highest level, strong enough to overpower even the greatest desires. So here's the big conundrum we've got with Yirah. If your Yirah comes from your seychel, from your intellect, you've obviously got a good head on your shoulders. You've figured it out – that Yiras Shamayim should be a notch above your cravings. You've got a good handle on the concept, clarity in your understanding – no question about it. But let's not forget, Yirah, at the end of the day, is a feeling. It's emotional. And feelings? They're not the flat line on a heart monitor – they go up, they go down. Here's where it gets tricky. We all like to think that our Avodas Hashem, our service of God, can be built on these feelings. That's what we want, deep down. You get a lift in davening, a spark in learning, a buzz from doing a mitzvah, and you feel like, \\"This is it, I've arrived! Now I can build my spiritual skyscraper on this spot.\\" But in truth, those feelings? They're like sand slipping through your fingers. We've got to remind ourselves, time and again, you can't hang your hat on feelings and expect them to stay put. They're just not made for that. It's a common mistake – and a big one at that. People sometimes chuck in the towel on their Avodas Hashem because they've put all their chips on something as flimsy as a feeling. And that's just the sad part. Emotions? They're part of serving Hashem, but they're not the whole foundation. They're just one piece of the puzzle. Now here's where it gets interesting. You’ve got Yiras Shamayim which is supposed to be based on your seychel, on solid reasoning, right? And seychel, real seychel, isn't fickle; it doesn't flip-flop. A true insight stays with you – it's not coming and going. Yet, even though Yirah is tangled up with your thoughts, it's also got this hergesh, this emotional side, and that part naturally has its highs and lows. It's just how it is. Because of that, you can't always expect your Yirah to be top-notch, always in fighting shape to tackle the big temptations. This seems to be a particularly tough nut to crack for many, especially in the American crowd. They want to feel everything – the excitement, that special connection. They've got all sorts of labels for these feelings, which to be honest, sometimes sound pretty foreign to me. What does \\"feeling connected\\" mean, anyway? Feels a bit like trying to grab hold of some vague notion. And building a spiritual life on that? That's just an invitation to disappointment. Feelings can be beautiful, they can give you a taste of something special – but they're not what you want to base your whole Avodas Hashem on because, let's face it, they're not reliable. So, back to Yirah. Even though it originates from your seychel, and that part of you doesn't change, Yirah itself isn't immune to change. It can't always keep you on the high ground, ready to resist those big temptations. That's just not how it works."},{"instruction":"try again while maintaining the author's tone","output":"Admittedly, the full calibration of yirah isn't always at a lofty level that can, with its strength, muster regiments against the grandest of desires. Now, let's delve into this interesting puzzle presented by Yirah. When Yirah is drawn from your seychel – when you've got a firm grasp, a clarity, an understanding that your fear of Heaven needs to overshadow your earthly wants – that's knowledge. And yet, despite being rooted in your intellect, Yirah is, in essence, a sensation. Emotions by their very nature have their peaks and valleys. Many of us mistakenly aspire to lay the foundations of our Avodas Hashem, our service to God, upon these fluctuating feelings. When we experience an emotional upswing during prayer, study, or any mitzvah, we're tempted to believe we've achieved a sustainable spiritual plateau. We see these genuine feelings as starting blocks for something more. In reality, though, such a foundation is unstable, akin to quicksand. Emotions, by design, are fleeting and unreliable, contrary to what some may think. This misconception can be catastrophic, leading some to abandon their spiritual efforts when they realize they're on shaky ground, sinking into disillusionment and despair. This scenario is disastrous. Regesh – the emotional aspect of Divine service – though important, is not the substance upon which to build. And here's the puzzling part: even though Yiras Shamayim is established through your seychel, and seychel is steady and resistant to change (otherwise, it would imply an error, which is not our subject here), the Yirah interwoven with our intellect is subject to the ebb and flow of emotions. Hence, not all elements of Yirah will be consistent. They're incapable of constant superiority and cannot guarantee perennial dominance over more formidable temptations. I believe this is one of the key struggles, especially within the American community, with its penchant for \\"feeling\\": the need for excitement, the desire for connection. They've created various terms for their emotional experiences, the meanings of which can be rather elusive. And out of this desire to \\"feel,\\" they construct their spiritual edifices – an approach that swiftly leads to despair, as those emotions cannot be sustained. Feeling inspired is like a bonus; it's rewarding, but it's not a foundation because it lacks durability. So too with Yiras Shamayim; it's the enigma that, though stemming from the unwavering intellect, it fluctuates. It cannot be at a perpetual zenith, continually poised to combat the allure of greater desires."},{"instruction":"try again with more natural words","output":"Honestly, it's not realistic to expect that our sense of awe for the Divine – our yirah – is always going to be at that supreme level that can take on the mightiest of urges. Here's the thing: We've got a bit of a puzzle when it comes to Yirah. If it's coming from your seychel – your brain smarts – that means you've got a solid grip on things. You 'get' that your reverence for the Almighty should take priority over your earthly cravings. That's clear. But here's the twist: Yirah, while it starts in the intellect, is also all about feeling. Like any feeling, it's a roller coaster – sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. A lot of us fall into the trap of thinking that these emotional highs are the foundation we can build our Avodas Hashem upon. That sense of uplift during davening or learning, that emotional zing from doing a mitzvah – we convince ourselves that we've hit the jackpot and that this emotional high ground is where we can plant our flag. But really, those emotions are like a sandcastle at the beach – not exactly a solid base. It's key to keep reminding ourselves: emotions aren't meant to be the floorboards of our spiritual house. They're temperamental, not permanent – that's just how they're wired. Banking on them is a serious miscue. It leads to folks feeling let down by their spiritual work because they've mistaken these ephemeral feelings for something solid. And that's no small problem. Sure, the emotional part of connecting with Hashem, the regesh, has its place – but it's not the foundation stone. Now onto the conundrum: Despite Yiras Shamayim having its roots in your seychel, which doesn't change (because if your intellect changes, there's been some error, and that's not what we're talking about), Yirah is tied up with feelings, and feelings have their ups and downs. And that's just the way it is. You can't always expect Yirah to be at the top of its game, always ready to go head-to-head with the biggest temptations. This seems to be particularly challenging for the American crowd, with a strong emphasis on 'feeling it': whether that's feeling pumped, feeling a connection, or whatever new terms are in vogue. But what does all that actually mean? And trying to construct your spiritual life on something so vague? That's just asking for trouble. Feeling inspired can be great, like getting a pat on the back – but it's not the bedrock of Avodas Hashem, because it's not sturdy. It doesn't hold up. So it circles back to Yirah. Even though it's based on your unchanging seychel, Yirah itself changes. It's got its own rhythm – it's not endlessly at its peak, ever-victorious over the pull of desires."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

(And what are related 'offiices'?)","output":"Compline, also known as Night Prayer, is the final church service (or office) of the day in the Christian tradition of canonical hours. The canonical hours are part of the Liturgy of the Hours, also known as the Divine Office, which is the set of daily services by which the Church marks the hours of the day and sanctifies the day with prayer. The Liturgy of the Hours is a form of prayer that clergy, many religious communities, and some laypeople perform daily. The primary offices that make up the Liturgy of the Hours include: 1. Matins (or Vigils) - This is the first office of the day, traditionally said during the night or very early morning before dawn. 2. Lauds (Morning Prayer) - This office is prayed at dawn and is often seen as a prayer of praise for the new day. 3. Prime (abolished after the Second Vatican Council) - Historically, this was the first hour of the day, prayed at sunrise (around 6:00 AM). 4. Terce (Midmorning Prayer) - This office is prayed around the third hour of the day, approximately 9:00 AM. 5. Sext (Midday Prayer) - This is the fourth office, prayed at noon or the sixth hour of the day. 6. None (Midafternoon Prayer) - Prayed around 3:00 PM or the ninth hour of the day. 7. Vespers (Evening Prayer) - This office is prayed at sunset or in the early evening and is a time of thanksgiving for the day that is past. 8. Compline (Night Prayer) - Being the last office of the day, Compline is prayed before retiring for the night. The structure of these hours can include hymns, psalms, prayers, readings from scripture, and other writings. The purpose of the Divine Office is to sanctify the day and provide regular intervals for prayer and reflection. Compline, with its contemplative nature, often includes an examination of conscience, a penitential rite, and prayers for a restful and peaceful night. It is a quiet service with an emphasis on spiritual peace and thanksgiving at the day's end. While historically the preserve of clergy and monastic communities, the Divine Office has experienced a renewal of interest among laypeople who seek to incorporate its rhythms into their own spiritual practices."},{"instruction":"Who invented television?","output":"The invention of television was the result of work by a number of individuals, and cannot be attributed to a single inventor. It was a gradual process involving several key developments by various inventors over the years. Here are some of the key figures who contributed to the creation of television: 1. **Paul Nipkow** (1860–1940): A German inventor who developed the Nipkow disk in 1884, an early mechanical scanning device that could transmit images through wires using a spinning disk. 2. **John Logie Baird** (1888–1946): A Scottish inventor who is often credited with the first demonstration of a working television system in 1925.

Silicon and graphene indeed have different crystal structures, which impact the way they can be exfoliated into thinner structures. Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. Its structure is inherently layered due to the weak van der Waals forces between the sheets of carbon atoms, which allows for easy exfoliation into thin sheets, whether mechanically or chemically. Bulk silicon, on the other hand, has a diamond cubic crystal structure without the weak interlayer forces found in graphite. As such, silicon does not naturally come off in thin sheets through simple mechanical exfoliation, as graphene does. However, methods have been developed to create thin silicon structures, albeit not in the same way as graphene. Here is where the term \\"Liquid Exfoliation\\" might have been misleading. In the context of silicon, thinning down to nanosheets through \\"exfoliation\\" might not be accurate in the traditional sense. Instead, techniques involving top-down fabrication processes, such as etching or grinding in a liquid medium with subsequent ultrasonication, might create small silicon particles or nanostructures. These processes do not produce silicon in planar sheets, but rather in various nanoforms such as nanoparticles, nanowires, or quantum dots, depending on the process particulars. For creating thin silicon layers, a more appropriate process might be epitaxial growth or thin-film deposition techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD), rather than exfoliation in the way we describe for graphene. These techniques enable the formation of thin, coherent, crystalline layers of silicon on a substrate. Thus, when referring to exfoliation in the context of silicon, it's important to clarify that it involves generating smaller particles or structures through mechanical or chemical action in a liquid medium, rather than peeling off flat sheets like you would with graphite to obtain graphene."},{"instruction":"lets look at other materials that can be exfoliated either as a main material or a co material for photocatalysts","output":"Exfoliation is an attractive technique for preparing layered materials that are suitable as photocatalysts or as components in photocatalytic systems. Materials that can be exfoliated include a variety of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and other van der Waals solids. Here's a look at some of these materials: 1. **Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs):** - **Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2):** A prominent member of the TMD family, MoS2 can be exfoliated to produce thin layers and has shown great potential in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions due to its suitable bandgap and active edge sites. - **Tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and Tungsten disulfide (WS2):** Similar to MoS2, these materials can also be exfoliated into thin layers and have photocatalytic properties, especially when used in heterojunctions with other semiconductors. 2. **Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs):** - These are layered materials with a brucite-like structure and charge-compensating interlayer anions. LDHs are interesting for photocatalysis because their composition can be easily tuned, and they can be intercalated with various anionic species. - Exfoliation of LDHs allows the creation of thinner layers with more active sites and improved access for reactant molecules. 3. **Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4):** - Although g-C3N4 is not layered like graphite, its structure comprises weakly stacked layers via van der Waals forces. It can be exfoliated into thin sheets, which are found to enhance photocatalytic performance by increasing surface area and light absorption efficiency. 4. **Bismuth-Based Materials:** - **Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, I):** These materials possess a layered structure and have shown promise in photodegradation reactions. Exfoliation into nanosheets exposes more active sites that can interact with pollutants and absorb light more effectively. - **Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4):** Though not naturally layer-structured, nanostructuring BiVO4 can improve its photocatalytic efficiency. While it's not typically exfoliated, nanostructuring aims to achieve similar benefits as exfoliation, such as increased surface area and light absorption. 5. **Layered Perovskites:** - Certain perovskite structures are formed in layers, which can be exfoliated to make 2D perovskites. These materials are being explored for their optoelectronic properties, and the exfoliated thin films can also be investigated for photocatalytic applications. 6. **Black Phosphorus (Phosphorene):** - Black phosphorus is a layered material that can be mechanically or liquid exfoliated into phosphorene, which shows promise in electronics and optoelectronics. Exfoliated phosphorene might also present opportunities in photocatalysis due to its direct bandgap and high carrier mobility. The exfoliation of these materials can create ultrathin nanostructures with high surface-to-volume ratios, more active sites, and potentially unique electronic properties compared to their bulk counterparts. These features can greatly benefit photocatalytic applications by promoting more efficient light harvesting, charge carrier separation, and reaction kinetics, ultimately leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance for environmental remediation or energy conversion."},{"instruction":"Tungsten disulfide is it made by gassing a tungsten salt in solution ?","output":"Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is not typically synthesized by \\"gassing\\" a tungsten salt in solution. Instead, there are several common methods for synthesizing WS2, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), hydrothermal synthesis, and the direct sulfidation of tungsten or tungsten oxides. Here's a brief look at these methods: 1. **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):** - CVD is a technique used to form high-purity, high-performance solid materials. For synthesizing WS2, this process generally involves the reaction of a tungsten-containing precursor (such as tungsten hexafluoride, WF6) and a sulfur-containing gas (such as hydrogen sulfide, H2S) at high temperatures. The reaction results in the deposition of WS2 on a substrate. 2. **Hydrothermal Synthesis:** - This method involves reacting tungsten salts (like ammonium tetrathiotungstate, (NH4)2WS4) with sulfur sources in a high-pressure, high-temperature aqueous solution, typically in an autoclave. The hydrothermal conditions facilitate the growth of WS2 crystals. 3. **Direct Sulfidation:** - Direct sulfidation involves the reaction of tungsten or tungsten oxide powders with gases containing sulfur, such as H2S, at elevated temperatures. This process forms WS2 through the direct chemical reaction between the solid and gas phases. 4. **Mechanochemical Synthesis:** - WS2 can also be synthesized by ball milling tungsten powder with sulfur in a controlled environment. The mechanical force during milling facilitates the reaction, resulting in the formation of WS2. 5. **Solid-State Reaction:** - This process involves mixing tungsten or tungsten oxide powders with sulfur and heating the mixture in an inert or reducing atmosphere to allow for the formation of WS2. For synthesizing WS2 nanopowders or nanosheets, which are often used for their unique electrical and optical properties, methods like hydrothermal synthesis and sulfurization processes can be well-suited. Alternatively, liquid-phase exfoliation can be used to produce thin layers or flakes of WS2 from bulk material that has already been synthesized, using shear forces or ultrasonication in appropriate solvents. Each synthesis method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and the appropriate method is chosen based on the desired purity, crystallinity, morphology, and size of the WS2 product, as well as the intended application."},{"instruction":"I asked you the question and you said no , as if i'm a cave man , and then proceded to write : Direct Sulfidation: - Direct sulfidation involves the reaction of tungsten or tungsten oxide powders with gases containing sulfur, such as H2S, at elevated temperatures.

To clarify, the direct sulfidation process does indeed involve a form of \\"gassing,\\" specifically by reacting tungsten or tungsten oxide with sulfur-containing gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at high temperatures. This reaction can lead to the formation of tungsten disulfide (WS2). In more detail, during the direct sulfidation method: 1. A tungsten source, which can be either metallic tungsten (W) or tungsten oxide (WO3), is placed in a reaction chamber or furnace. 2. The chamber is then heated to a suitable temperature, typically in a range that allows for the reaction to proceed efficiently, which could be anywhere from several hundred to over a thousand degrees Celsius. 3. A gas containing sulfur, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), is introduced into the chamber. 4. The sulfur from the H2S reacts with the tungsten source to form tungsten disulfide (WS2) as a solid product. The result is the formation of WS2, which can be in the form of powder, crystalline flakes, or even a thin film, depending on the specific conditions and methods used in the process. This method is a chemical vapor synthesis technique and is commonly used in materials science and engineering to produce high-purity compounds. The phrase \\"gassing a tungsten salt in solution\\" might suggest a liquid-phase reaction, whereas direct sulfidation typically occurs in the gas phase or a solid-gas reaction environment."},{"instruction":"hmm i'd like to know the temperature at which it occurs ,","output":"The temperature at which direct sulfidation occurs to form tungsten disulfide (WS2) depends on various factors including the specific precursors used, the reaction environment, and the desired properties of the final product. However, the process commonly takes place at elevated temperatures usually ranging from 500°C to 1000°C. For example, when sulfidizing tungsten oxide (WO3) with hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the reaction might typically be carried out at temperatures between 600°C and 850°C. It's important to control the temperature to ensure that the reaction proceeds efficiently and to control the crystallinity and morphology of the produced WS2. Specific conditions, such as the rate of heating, the flow of reactive gases, and the duration of the process, are also critical and need to be optimized for the desired outcome. In industrial settings, the conditions are carefully controlled to ensure the reproducibility and quality of the WS2 produced. For precise temperatures and conditions for a particular synthesis route, one would need to refer to the scientific literature or specific process documentation where these parameters are reported in detail for the synthesis of WS2."},{"instruction":"ok so its no beond the realm of possibilities . interesting ,, hmmm and does it suffer from photocorrosion","output":"Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is generally considered to be a stable semiconductor material, and it does not suffer from photocorrosion as severely as some other materials do, especially under standard conditions. Photocorrosion is a process where a material degrades or decomposes upon exposure to light, particularly ultraviolet (UV) light, which can be an issue for some photocatalysts as it affects their stability and long-term catalytic performance. WS2 has been investigated for various applications including photocatalysis, due to its suitable band gap and good stability under light illumination. Its properties make it a candidate for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and other photocatalytic processes. However, the stability of WS2 under photocatalytic conditions can depend on several factors, such as: 1. The surrounding environment (e.g., pH, presence of oxidizing or reducing agents). 2. The intensity and wavelength of light used for photocatalysis. 3. The presence of co-catalysts or sensitizers. 4. The form of the WS2 material (e.g., nanoparticles, bulk crystal, thin films). While WS2 is generally robust against photocorrosion, under harsh conditions or in the presence of strong oxidizing agents, some degradation might occur. For example, in aqueous solutions with highly oxidative or basic conditions, there might be some level of corrosion or dissolution of WS2. Overall, as with any material, the likelihood and extent of photocorrosion for WS2 will depend on the precise conditions of its application. It is typically necessary to encapsulate or support the material on stable substrates, or combine it with other materials to enhance its stability and efficiency for long-term photocatalytic applications."},{"instruction":"does its activity extend to infrared light ?","output":"Tungsten disulfide (WS_2) is a semiconductor with a band gap that typically falls within the visible light range. The exact value of the band gap for WS_2 can vary slightly depending on its physical structure (bulk, few-layer, or monolayer), but it is generally in the range of approximately 1.3 eV to 2.0 eV. For monolayer WS_2, the band gap is around 2.0 eV, which corresponds to the blue light part of the visible spectrum. As the band gap energy corresponds to the visible light spectrum, WS_2 primarily absorbs visible light rather than infrared (IR) light, which has lower energy. Photons in the IR spectrum do not have enough energy to excite electrons across the band gap of WS_2 from the valence band to the conduction band, which is necessary for generating electron-hole pairs that drive photocatalytic reactions. However, it's worth noting that for some materials, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) or defect states can sometimes allow sub-band gap light absorption, including in the IR range. Yet, this is not typically expected for WS_2 without modifications or in conjunction with other materials that could extend the absorption into the IR region. In applications where harvesting IR light is important, materials with narrower band gaps are typically used. These materials can absorb the lower-energy IR photons and participate in photocatalytic processes under IR illumination. If one wished to use WS_2 for applications involving IR light, it might have to be combined with other materials or utilize upconversion techniques to make efficient use of the IR spectrum."},{"instruction":"are there any exfoliable materials that extend to the IR range ?","output":"Yes, there are exfoliable materials with band gaps that extend into the infrared (IR) range. Such materials can absorb IR light and could be used in applications where IR light harnessing is desired. Some exfoliable materials that can absorb IR light include: 1. **Black Phosphorus (Phosphorene):** - Black phosphorus is a layered material that can be mechanically or liquid exfoliated into few-layer or monolayer sheets known as phosphorene. Black phosphorus has a band gap that varies with the number of layers, ranging from around 0.3 eV (bulk form) to 2.0 eV (monolayer), covering a significant part of the IR spectrum. 2. **Bismuth Chalcogenides:** - Materials such as bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) and bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) have relatively small band gaps, typically around 0.3 eV, which allows them to absorb IR light. They can be exfoliated into thin layers or nanosheets, and they are known for their thermoelectric properties but have also been explored for optoelectronic applications. 3. **Transition Metal Trichalcogenides:** - Compounds such as titanium trisulfide (TiS3) exhibit band gaps that can absorb in the near-infrared range and can be exfoliated into thin nanoribbons or nanosheets. 4. **Indium Selenide (InSe):** - A member of the III-VI semiconductor family, indium selenide can have a band gap in the range of 1.2 to 2.0 eV depending on the number of layers and exhibits strong absorption in the visible to near-IR range. 5. **Molybdenum and Tungsten Ditellurides (MoTe2 and WTe2):** - These transition metal dichalcogenides can have small band gaps that extend into the near-IR, especially in their semiconducting forms (2H phase for MoTe2 and 1T' phase for WTe2). They can be mechanically or chemically exfoliated to produce thin layers with variable electronic properties. It's important to note that when exfoliating materials into very thin layers, such as going from bulk to few-layer or monolayer, the band gap can change significantly due to quantum confinement effects. This change could shift the absorption properties of the material, expanding or restricting its ability to absorb IR light. When designing devices or systems that utilize IR light, the choice of material and its form (bulk, thin films, layers) plays a crucial role, and exfoliation can be a useful technique to alter material properties for specific applications. Additionally, the exact response in the IR range will depend on factors such as material thickness, crystallinity, and the presence of any defects or dopants."},{"instruction":"titanium trisulfide how is this made ?","output":"Titanium trisulfide (TiS3) is a less common transition metal chalcogenide compared to the more widely studied materials like MoS2 and WS2. However, like many other layered materials, TiS3 can be synthesized using various methods, including chemical vapor transport (CVT), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and flux zone growth. Below are brief outlines of possible synthesis methods for TiS3: 1. **Chemical Vapor Transport (CVT):** - Chemical vapor transport is a technique in which a compound is transported from one part of a closed system to another via the gas phase, facilitated by a transport agent (usually a halogen or a halide). - For synthesizing TiS3, powdered precursors of titanium and sulfur are typically placed in a sealed tube along with a transport agent like iodine. - The tube is then placed in a temperature gradient furnace, where one end (the source end) is hotter than the other (the deposition end). - The temperature gradient causes the reactants to sublimate, react in the vapor phase with the aid of the transport agent, and then recondense into crystalline TiS3 at the cooler end of the tube. 2. **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):** - CVD involves the reaction of volatile precursor gases on a heated substrate to form a solid material. - For TiS3, vapors of a titanium precursor (such as TiCl4) and a sulfur source (such as H2S or elemental sulfur) are introduced into a reaction chamber with a suitable substrate. - The substrate is heated to a high temperature, prompting the chemical reaction between the precursors and resulting in the deposition of TiS3 onto the substrate. 3. **Flux Zone Growth:** - This method uses a metal flux to dissolve and transport the reactants within a sealed system, allowing them to crystallize upon cooling. - Precursors of titanium and sulfur are placed in a crucible with a flux (commonly a low-melting metal or a salt) and subjected to high temperatures. - After complete dissolution, the mixture is slowly cooled to precipitate out crystals of TiS3. 4. **Solid State Reaction:** - Solid-state synthesis might be used as a more straightforward approach, though it tends to yield polycrystalline materials. - Stoichiometric amounts of titanium powder or TiO2 and sulfur are mixed and reacted in a sealed container under an inert atmosphere or vacuum. - The container is heated to a temperature sufficient for the reaction to occur, generally between 700°C and 900°C. 5. **Mechanical Alloying:** - Mechanical alloying or ball milling involves repeatedly deforming, fracturing, and welding powders of the reactants by high-energy ball impacts in a controlled atmosphere. - Titanium powder and sulfur can be mechanically alloyed in an inert atmosphere to promote a solid-state reaction and form TiS3. These methods can be fine-tuned and varied in detail depending on the desired properties of the TiS3, such as purity, crystallinity, size, and morphology. For most synthesis routes, maintaining an inert or reducing atmosphere (often using gases like argon, nitrogen or forming gas) is critical to prevent the oxidation of either titanium or sulfur during the high-temperature process."},{"instruction":"For synthesizing TiS3, powdered precursors of titanium and sulfur are typically placed in a sealed tube along with a transport agent like iodine.. which titanium precursor ?","output":"For the synthesis of TiS3 using the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method, the titanium precursor is often not a volatile compound but rather the elemental titanium metal itself in powdered form. The CVT process leverages the chemical reactivity of the elemental titanium with sulfur in the presence of a transport agent, such as iodine, to facilitate the growth of TiS3 crystals. To clarify the CVT process for TiS3: 1. **Powdered Titanium Metal:** Elemental titanium powder is often used as the precursor because it can directly react with sulfur under the right conditions. 2. **Sulfur:** Elemental sulfur powder is the source of sulfur for the reaction. 3. **Transport Agent (Iodine):** Iodine is added to the sealed tube and serves as the transport agent. It reacts with titanium and sulfur to form volatile iodide compounds, which are then transported from the hotter to the cooler zone of the reaction tube. During the CVT process, the combination of heat and the presence of iodine vapors allows the titanium and sulfur to interact and form TiS3. Both the titanium and sulfur are transported through the gas phase, and the growth of TiS3 crystals occurs at a lower temperature zone in the tube. The use of iodine helps in the formation and subsequent transport of the volatile compounds that facilitate the deposition and growth of TiS3 crystals. The sealed tube is placed in a furnace with a managed temperature gradient where the end with the reactants (the source zone) is kept at a higher temperature than the end where the TiS3 crystals will grow (the deposition zone). Through this process, you can achieve the synthesis and crystal growth of titanium trisulfide."},{"instruction":"and what temperature does this occur at please boss","output":"The synthesis of titanium trisulfide (TiS3) using the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method typically occurs at high temperatures, often in the range of 700°C to 900°C. However, the actual temperature used can vary based on several factors, such as the specifics of the experimental setup, the reactivity of the precursors, and the desired crystal size and quality. In a typical CVT setup, the sealed tube containing elemental titanium powder, sulfur, and the transport agent (like iodine) is placed in a horizontal tube furnace with a controlled temperature gradient. The source end, where the reactants are located, is heated to a higher temperature (the exact temperature within the mentioned range), promoting the formation of volatile iodides and subsequent transport of material. The deposition zone where TiS3 crystals are intended to grow is kept at a lower temperature, which allows the gaseous intermediates to cool, react, and form solid TiS3 crystals. Maintaining a temperature gradient between the source and deposition zones is crucial for the successful transport and growth of TiS3 crystals. The temperature should be carefully optimized to ensure adequate volatility of the intermediates, effective transport, and high-quality crystal growth while avoiding any unwanted byproducts or decomposition. For precise temperature settings and process details, one would typically refer to the specific research literature on TiS3 synthesis, as experimental procedures can vary to tailor material properties as needed for specific applications."},{"instruction":"what apperatus would you suggest for this , and does it need to be sealed","output":"For the synthesis of titanium trisulfide (TiS3) via chemical vapor transport (CVT), a specific type of apparatus is typically used, and yes, it needs to be sealed to contain the reactants and the transport agent under controlled conditions. The following components are part of the typical apparatus setup for CVT: 1. **Quartz or Silica Tube:** - A high-purity quartz or silica glass tube is commonly used because it can withstand high temperatures and is chemically inert to the reactants and products. Its transparency also allows for monitoring of the process to a certain extent. 2. **Sealing Equipment:** - The tube needs to be vacuum-sealed to maintain an inert atmosphere and to prevent contamination or reaction with air. To seal the quartz tube, a torch or furnace capable of locally heating the quartz to its melting point is used. After filling the tube with the reactants and transport agent, the tube is evacuated using a vacuum pump, then sealed while hot to trap the inert or vacuum conditions inside. 3. **Vacuum Pump:** - A vacuum pump is required to evacuate air from the quartz tube before sealing to ensure a controlled atmosphere for the reaction and to prevent oxidation or contamination. 4. **Inert Gas Supply:** - An inert gas (typically argon or nitrogen) may be used to fill the tube after evacuation and before sealing if the reaction is to be carried out under a specific inert gas pressure. 5. **Furnace with Temperature Control:** - A tube furnace capable of providing a stable and controlled temperature gradient is needed. Often, a programmable furnace is used to maintain different temperatures at the source zone (higher temperature) and the deposition zone (lower temperature). 6. **Temperature Monitoring:** - Thermocouples should be placed at various points along the tube, especially near the reaction zone and the deposition zone, to accurately measure and maintain the desired temperature gradient. 7. **Safety Equipment:** - Adequate shielding, personal protective equipment, and safety measures should be in place to protect against the high temperatures and potential hazards, such as toxic gases from the transport agents and reactants. A typical CVT process in this setup would involve the following steps: 1. The powdered titanium, sulfur, and iodine are weighed and placed inside the quartz tube. 2. The tube is connected to a vacuum pump, and air is evacuated to create a vacuum or backfilled with inert gas. 3. While under vacuum or inert gas atmosphere, the tube is sealed using a high-temperature torch or sealing apparatus. 4. The sealed tube is then placed in the tube furnace, with the reactants located in the hotter zone and a cooler zone allocated for crystal growth. 5. The furnace is heated to the desired temperatures, and the reaction is carried out over hours to days, depending on the growth rate required. 6. After the reaction, the furnace is cooled down, and the tube is removed and carefully opened to harvest the TiS3 crystals. It is crucial to perform the CVT process in a controlled and safe environment since the reaction involves high temperatures and potentially hazardous materials. Additionally, proper handling and disposal of the materials, following relevant safety protocols, are necessary to avoid any risks associated with the reactants and products."},{"instruction":"ok thanks , now .. Flux Zone Growth: - This method uses a metal flux to dissolve and transport the reactants within a sealed system, allowing them to crystallize upon cooling. - Precursors of titanium and sulfur are placed in a crucible with a flux (commonly a low-melting metal or a salt) and subjected to high temperatures. - After complete dissolution, the mixture is slowly cooled to precipitate out crystals of TiS3. can you give me more detail about this","output":"The flux zone growth method is a type of crystal growth technique used for synthesizing single crystals of various compounds, including TiS3. This method uses a \\"flux,\\" which is typically a metal or a salt with a low melting point, to dissolve the precursors at high temperatures. Upon cooling, the compound of interest crystallizes out of the flux. Here's a more detailed look at the steps involved in the flux zone growth process: 1. **Selection of Precursors and Flux:** - The choice of flux is essential, and it must be something in which the desired compound is soluble at high temperatures but less so at lower temperatures. - For TiS3, appropriate precursors are typically titanium metal or titanium compounds (such as titanium chloride or titanium oxide) and elemental sulfur. - The flux can be a low-melting-point metal (such as tin or indium) or salt (such as an alkali halide) that does not react with the precursors or the product. 2. **Preparing the Crucible:** - A high-purity, refractory crucible is used to contain the precursors and the flux. The crucible must withstand the high temperatures and corrosive nature of the melt without contaminating it. - The precursors and flux are loaded into the crucible in the desired stoichiometric ratio, often with excess flux. 3. **Heating and Dissolving:** - The loaded crucible is placed in a furnace and heated to a temperature where both the precursors and the flux become molten, and a homogeneous solution is formed. - The temperature must be carefully chosen to be high enough for the precursors to dissolve in the flux but not so high as to cause unwanted reactions or decomposition. 4. **Zone Melting and Mixing:** - In some variations of flux growth, a temperature gradient is set up within the crucible, creating a molten zone that slowly travels from one end to the other. This is known as \\"zone melting.\\" - This molten zone can help ensure mixing and homogeneity, which is important for the formation of uniform crystals. 5. **Cooling and Crystallization:** - After complete dissolution and homogeneous mixing, the crucible is slowly cooled. - Cooling rates are crucial and must be carefully controlled to promote the nucleation and growth of single crystals. Too fast cooling might lead to many small crystals, while too slow cooling may not produce crystals at all. 6. **Separation of Crystals from Flux:** - Once the crystals have formed and the solution has cooled to an appropriate temperature, the excess flux is removed. This can be done by decanting the liquid flux, dissolving the flux in a suitable solvent, or by centrifuging the mixture. 7. **Harvesting the Crystals:** - The remaining solid is composed of the crystallized compound (TiS3, in this case) and potentially some trapped flux. The harvested crystals may require further cleaning to remove any flux impurities. The flux zone growth method is particularly useful for materials that are difficult to crystallize from aqueous solutions or materials that decompose at their melting points. By using a flux, the effective operating temperatures can be reduced, and better-quality crystals can often be obtained compared to other high-temperature crystal growth methods. The method demands a good understanding of the phase diagram for the system, as well as considerable skill and experience to optimize the numerous variables involved. These include the choice of flux, temperature gradients, cooling rates, and methods for recovering the crystals from the flux."},{"instruction":"and at what temperature does this occur , i assume around the melting point of tin or whatever metal is chosen as the flux","output":"The temperature at which the flux zone growth process occurs can indeed be influenced by the melting point of the selected flux since it should ideally be within the molten state to dissolve the precursors. However, the exact temperature will not only depend on the flux's melting point but also on the solubility of the precursors in the flux, the temperature required for a homogeneous mixture, and crystallization kinetics. For example, if tin (Sn) is chosen as the flux for its low melting point (around 232°C), the operational temperature for the whole process will be higher than this because it must account for the solubility of titanium and sulfur within the molten tin. Generally, the process occurs at temperatures considerably above the flux's melting point to ensure complete dissolution. It is not unusual for the temperatures to range from 500°C to above 1000°C, depending on the specific system. Once the precursors are fully dissolved in the flux at these high temperatures, the mixture is then carefully and slowly cooled. The cooling rate is critical for the successful growth of the desired crystals. Cooling can be done by reducing the furnace temperature at a controlled rate, which can vary significantly depending on the desired size and quality of the crystals; slower cooling rates tend to promote larger crystal growth. It's important to consult the appropriate phase diagrams and literature to ascertain the optimal temperatures for the flux zone growth of any specific compound. For example, if the aim is to grow TiS3 crystals using tin as a flux, the initial temperature would likely be set to fully dissolve the precursors in molten tin, which could be significantly above the melting point of tin, followed by a controlled cooling sequence to allow for TiS3 crystal formation."},{"instruction":"how is the tin flux removed after the process","output":"After the flux zone growth process, the excess tin flux used to grow crystals like titanium trisulfide (TiS_3) needs to be removed without damaging the crystals. There are several methods for removing the residual flux: 1. **Decanting the Liquid Flux:** - If the synthesis is designed such that the tin remains in a liquid state after the crystals have formed, simply tilting and pouring off the liquid can separate it from the solid crystalline product. This requires careful handling to avoid losing any crystals. 2. **Dissolving the Flux:** - A chemical method involves dissolving the tin flux in a solvent that does not react with the TiS_3 crystals. Acids, like hydrochloric acid or nitric acid, can remove tin by forming soluble tin salts, which can then be washed away with water or another solvent. Care must be taken to choose a solvent that will not dissolve or damage the TiS_3 crystals. 3. **Centrifugation:** - Centrifugation can be effective if there is a significant density difference between the solid crystals and the molten flux. By spinning the product at high speeds, the heavier crystals settle to the bottom, and the liquid flux can be carefully decanted or siphoned off. 4. **Heat Treatment:** - For removing solidified flux, a subsequent heat treatment in a furnace under a controlled atmosphere can be used. This method involves heating the crystals to just above the melting point of the tin, allowing the flux to melt and be poured off or evaporated without affecting the crystals. 5. **Mechanical Removal:** - When the flux solidifies, it might be possible to separate it mechanically by carefully breaking or peeling it away from the crystals. This method can be time-consuming and risks damaging the crystals, so it is typically used as a last resort or prelude to further cleaning steps. 6. **Leaching:** - Leaching involves soaking the solidified mass in a liquid that selectively dissolves the flux. The flux dissolves into the solvent, leaving the TiS_3 crystals behind. Following the chemical dissolution, thorough rinsing with deionized water might be necessary to remove any residual flux or dissolved salts. After the initial removal of flux, additional cleaning steps, including rinsing and drying, are usually necessary to ensure that the crystals are completely free of contaminants. These steps will vary depending on the type of crystal, its susceptibility to solvents or mechanical handling, and the requirements of downstream processing or analysis."},{"instruction":"so do TiS_3 crystals dissolve in hot hcl , does it damage them ?","output":"Titanium trisulfide (TiS_3) is generally expected to be resistant to hydrochloric acid (HCl), especially at room temperature or when used in dilute concentrations. However, strong acids and elevated temperatures can increase the reactivity, so care needs to be taken when handling any chemicals. The behavior of TiS_3 in hot HCl isn't extensively documented in available literature due to its relatively niche research status as compared to more common materials like TiO_2 or MoS_2. However, chalcogenides are often less resistant to acids at elevated temperatures, so there is a potential for some degree of decomposition or alteration to occur. The interaction of TiS_3 with hot HCl could potentially lead to reactions forming titanium chlorides and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), though the practical outcome would depend on variables such as: - The concentration of the HCl solution - The temperature at which the reaction is performed - The time the crystals are exposed to the acid - The physical form of the TiS_3 material (e.g., bulk crystals versus thin layers) If trying to remove tin flux from TiS_3 crystals, it's important first to perform a small-scale test under controlled conditions to determine whether the TiS_3 crystals are indeed resistant to the conditions you plan to use for flux removal. If hot HCl is found to damage the crystals, alternative approaches such as mechanical removal, centrifugation, or the use of milder solvents may be necessary. Working with strong acids and at elevated temperatures requires strict safety precautions, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), proper ventilation, and appropriate waste disposal procedures. Safety data sheets (SDS) and related literature should be consulted for information on chemical compatibility and safety guidelines before proceeding with any cleaning process."},{"instruction":"so decanting as much as possible my be the way , but what is the density of TiS_3 would it sink or float on liquid tin metal","output":"The density of a material is a key factor in determining whether it will sink or float when placed in a liquid with a different density. For titanium trisulfide (TiS_3), specific data on its density is less commonly available in the literature than for more widely studied materials, and it may also depend on the method of synthesis and the crystal structure. However, in general, TiS_3 is expected to be a solid with a density higher than that of the liquid metals commonly used as fluxes, including tin (Sn). The density of solid TiS_3 is not readily available in standard references, but we can infer that as a solid compound it likely has a density greater than liquid tin. For reference, the density of liquid tin at its melting point (232°C) is around 6.99 g/cm³, which is lower than densities typical for most solid semiconductors and metal chalcogenides. Given that other transition metal chalcogenides tend to have densities in the range of roughly 5 to 8 g/cm³ or more in solid form, and considering that titanium is a relatively dense metal while sulfur is comparatively light, we can conservatively estimate TiS_3 to be within this range or higher. If this estimate holds true, TiS_3 crystals would be expected to sink in liquid tin flux. When using the flux zone growth method for synthesizing TiS_3 crystals, it is commonplace for the crystals to sink to the bottom of the crucible as they typically have a higher density compared to the liquid metal flux. Decanting would then be a viable approach for flux removal, as you suggested. After the growth process, the crucible would be allowed to cool just enough so that the tin flux becomes liquid while the TiS_3 remains solid. The liquid tin can then be poured off, leaving the TiS_3 crystals at the bottom. Further cleaning may be required to remove any residual tin from the surface of the crystals."},{"instruction":"ok lets look at other fluxes for this","output":"When choosing a flux for the growth of titanium trisulfide (TiS3) crystals, one must consider factors like the solubility of the reactants in the flux, the melting point of the flux, chemical compatibility, and ease of removal after the crystal growth process. Here are some potential fluxes that may be utilized, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: 1. **Iodine:** - Iodine can be used as a transport agent in a chemical vapor transport (CVT) process, as previously discussed, and in some cases, it can also act as a flux for growth from a melt. It is particularly useful for materials that do not readily form large crystals by other methods. Iodine has a relatively low melting point (113.7°C), and it sublimates at a moderate temperature, making recovery of crystals easier by sublimation. 2. **Eutectic Mixtures:** - Eutectics are mixtures of two or more materials that have a lower melting point than any of the pure components. They may be metallic alloys or mixtures of salts. For example, a eutectic mixture of potassium iodide and tin might provide a low-melting flux that has suitable solubility for the precursors. 3. **Alkali Metal Halides:** - Common fluxes include potassium bromide (KBr), potassium iodide (KI), and sodium iodide (NaI), among others. These halide salts typically have high solubility for metal chalcogenides, reasonable melting points, and can be easily removed later by washing with water or other solvents. 4. **Low-Melting Metals:** - Metals such as indium (In; melting point 156.6°C) and bismuth (Bi; melting point 271.5°C) can serve as fluxes for the growth of chalcogenide crystals. These metals have higher melting points than tin, but still, allow manageable processing temperatures, and can often be mechanically separated from the grown crystals due to their malleability. 5. **Borates and Phosphates:** - Boron oxide (B2O3) and various phosphates can be used as glassy fluxes; they typically melt and decompose into borates or phosphates at high temperatures, which can help in dissolving metallic elements and fostering crystal growth. 6. **Chlorides:** - Metal chlorides such as sodium chloride (NaCl) or calcium chloride (CaCl2) can also be used. They have melting points that are relatively accessible with standard equipment and can be easily washed away with water. Additionally, they tend to be compatible with a variety of precursors. The selection of flux is critical, as it greatly impacts the quality of crystals produced, their size, and the feasibility of flux removal post-synthesis. The chosen flux not only needs to dissolve the precursors well at a certain temperature but should also be easy to handle during recovery and environmentally benign, or easy to neutralize. Each candidate flux must be tested experimentally with the specific precursors used for the synthesis of TiS3, as each system can display unique solubility characteristics and crystal growth behavior. Flux removal is typically done by exploiting the physical and chemical properties that distinguish the flux from the synthesized compound—mechanical separation when the flux freezes, dissolution in a suitable solvent, or gentle heating to volatilize the flux if it has a relatively low boiling point compared to the decomposition temperature of the target compound."},{"instruction":"so what is the melting point of sodium chloride","output":"The melting point of sodium chloride (NaCl), also known as table salt, is approximately 801°C (1474°F). This relatively high melting point means that it can be used as a flux for high-temperature processes, including the growth of certain types of crystals that require such conditions. However, for materials that are sensitive to high temperatures or that decompose at temperatures close to or below the melting point of NaCl, it might not be a suitable choice as a flux."},{"instruction":"that would be idea i think , great idea","output":"Using sodium chloride (NaCl) as a flux for crystal growth can indeed be a practical option, especially for materials that are stable at higher temperatures and can be synthesized above NaCl's melting point of about 801°C. Here are some reasons why NaCl might be ideal as a flux: 1. **High Melting Point:** The relatively high melting point of NaCl allows for crystal growth at elevated temperatures, which can be necessary for certain compounds. 2. **Solubility:** NaCl can dissolve a variety of metal oxides and salts, making it useful for growing a range of crystals. 3. **Ease of Removal:** After crystal growth, NaCl can be washed away with water as it is highly soluble, making post-growth cleanup straightforward. 4. **Non-Toxic:** NaCl is non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and easy to handle compared to other flux materials that may require special handling or disposal procedures. 5. **Availability and Cost:** It is readily available and relatively inexpensive, which can be advantageous for large-scale or repeated synthesis. 6. **Chemical Inertness:** NaCl does not readily react with many compounds at high temperatures, increasing the likelihood of obtaining pure crystals. When considering NaCl as a flux, it's important to ensure that the target compound (in this case, TiS3) is also stable at the operational temperatures required to melt the NaCl. Since the melting point of NaCl is quite high, the entire system must be able to withstand temperatures above 801°C without decomposing or undergoing unwanted reactions. For the synthesis of titanium trisulfide (TiS3), you would need to examine the phase diagrams and perform exploratory experiments to confirm that NaCl is a suitable flux. It's crucial to ascertain whether TiS3 remains stable in molten NaCl and doesn't react with it to form any side products. If NaCl proves to be an appropriate flux, it could indeed be an ideal choice for TiS3 crystal growth due to the aforementioned advantages."},{"instruction":"so ordinary pyrex is no good i guess","output":"That's correct; ordinary Pyrex glassware is not suitable for high-temperature processes that exceed its maximum working temperature. Pyrex, which is a brand of borosilicate glass, is known for its excellent thermal stability compared to regular soda-lime glass, and it can typically withstand temperatures up to about 500°C (932°F) without deforming. However, at temperatures approaching its softening point (around 820°C or 1508°F), Pyrex will begin to soften, and thus it is not suitable for holding molten salts like NaCl at their melting point of approximately 801°C. For crystal growth processes that require holding molten salts at temperatures near or above NaCl's melting point, you should use a material that can handle higher temperatures, such as: 1. **Alumina (Aluminum Oxide) Crucibles:** These have excellent thermal stability and can withstand temperatures well above 1000°C. 2. **Platinum or Platinum Alloy Crucibles:** They have very high melting points and can handle temperatures up to 1750°C, but they are very expensive and can be reactive with certain chemicals. 3. **Graphite Crucibles:** These also have high thermal resistance and can be used at temperatures above 2000°C in inert or reducing atmospheres but will oxidize in the presence of air at high temperatures. 4. **Refractory Ceramics:** Other types of refractory ceramic materials, like zirconia (ZrO2), are also used for high-temperature applications. Always consider the reactivity of the crucible material with the melt contents to avoid contamination of the crystals and ensure that the selected crucible won't react or degrade at the operating temperatures. Safety considerations are also paramount when working at high temperatures, including the potential for thermal shock or reaction with atmospheric oxygen. Proper handling equipment, personal protective gear, and procedures must be in place to ensure safe operations."},{"instruction":"ahh just stainless 316 or 304 would be ok , it doesnt need to be structurally strong to simply act as a container for this","output":"Stainless steel types 304 and 316 are indeed resistant to a wide range of temperatures and have good corrosion resistance, which makes them generally suitable for various high-temperature applications. However, when using stainless steel as a container or crucible for high-temperature crystal growth processes, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind: 1. **Maximum Service Temperature:** - Stainless steel 304 has a maximum service temperature of about 870°C (1598°F), and stainless steel 316 has a slightly higher maximum service temperature of about 900°C (1652°F). This means that both could potentially be used to contain molten NaCl at its melting point of around 801°C (1474°F), but you'd be operating close to the limits, especially for type 304. 2. **Reactivity:** - At high temperatures, stainless steel can react with certain chemicals. For example, sulfur can be problematic as it may form metal sulfides, leading to corrosion. Given that titanium trisulfide involves sulfur, this reactivity might be a concern. 3. **Contamination:** - Impurities from the stainless steel could leach into your product, potentially affecting the purity of the crystals. This is especially critical in applications where the highest purity is required. 4. **Structural Stability:** - Although the crucible doesn't need to be structurally strong, it should maintain its shape and rigidity at the operating temperature to ensure safe handling and process integrity. 5. **Thermal Conductivity:** - Stainless steel has significantly higher thermal conductivity compared to ceramic crucibles, which can lead to different temperature distribution and potentially affect crystal growth. If you decide to use stainless steel for your process, it would be sensible to perform preliminary tests to ensure there is no undesired interaction between the crucible material and the contents at the operating temperatures. A dedicated high-temperature stainless steel crucible designed for such applications could be a viable option. Despite these considerations, the use of stainless steel crucibles for high-temperature work, including for salt melts, is documented in industrial and research contexts—given that the materials are compatible, and the temperature and environmental conditions are controlled. If you're not working at the very limits of the steel's temperature range and if the potential for contamination is not an issue for your application, stainless steel might be an acceptable material choice. However, precautionary steps should be taken to avoid any unwanted reactions or structural failures, especially when working with high-temperature processes."},{"instruction":"now the million dollar question... Is titanium trisulfide conductive","output":"Titanium trisulfide (TiS3) is a semiconductor material with quasi-one-dimensional conductive characteristics. Its unique structure, composed of chains of Titanium and Sulfur atoms, gives rise to anisotropic electrical properties, meaning that its conductivity can be highly directional. As a semiconductor, TiS3 does not have the high electrical conductivity of metals, but it can conduct electricity under certain conditions, particularly when doped or subjected to external stimuli such as light or electric fields. The degree of conductivity depends on factors such as: - Purity and defect density - Crystal structure and orientation - The number of layers (in the case of thin films or exfoliated layers) - Doping with other elements - Temperature TiS3 has a direct band gap and, like other semiconductors, can have its electrical properties tuned for various applications, including photodetectors, field-effect transistors (FETs), and potentially in areas like photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Its band gap is typically in the range that allows for visible-light absorption, which is useful for optoelectronic applications that take advantage of its semiconducting properties. In summary, while TiS3 is not \\"conductive\\" in the same sense as metals, it is a semiconductor that can conduct electricity under certain conditions and its electrical properties can be engineered for specific uses."},{"instruction":"Among all TMTCs, titanium trisulfide (TiS3) has optical bandgap around 1.0eV, while its electronic bandgap reported as 1.0 ± 0.1eV","output":"Titanium trisulfide (TiS3) is indeed a member of the family of transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), which are interesting materials due to their quasi-one-dimensional structure and electronic properties. The distinction between optical and electronic (or fundamental) bandgap is important: - The **electronic bandgap** refers to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band. This is the fundamental bandgap that determines the electronic properties of the semiconductor and affects its behavior as a material for electronic devices, such as transistors or diodes. - The **optical bandgap** is generally derived from optical absorption measurements and refers to the energy at which the material begins to absorb photons and generate electron-hole pairs. This gap is important for applications in photodetectors and solar cells. For TiS3, you are correct that both the electronic and optical bandgaps have been reported in the range of about 1.0 ± 0.1 eV, though precise values can vary depending on sample preparation, measurement techniques, and the number of layers in the material (for example, bulk versus few-layer versus monolayer TiS3). A bandgap in this range makes TiS3 promising for applications in infrared sensors and other optoelectronic devices that operate in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. In addition, the one-dimensional nature of TiS3 can lead to anisotropic conductivity, where the material's electrical characteristics differ along the chains as opposed to the directions perpendicular to them. It's worth noting that the properties of layered materials like TiS3 are quite sensitive to their physical dimensions and morphology, which means the bandgap can change as the material is thinned down to the nanoscale or when it is integrated into heterostructures with other materials. This tunability allows researchers to customize the properties of TiS3 for specific technological applications."},{"instruction":"Titanium disulfide is an inorganic compound with the formula TiS2. A golden yellow solid with high electrical conductivity,[1] it belongs to a group of compounds called transition metal dichalcogenides, which consist of the stoichiometry ME2. TiS2 has been employed as a cathode material in rechargeable batteries. Structure With a layered structure, TiS2 adopts a hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure, analogous to cadmium iodide (CdI2). In this motif, half of the octahedral holes are filled with a \\"cation\\", in this case Ti4+.[1][2] Each Ti centre is surrounded by six sulfide ligands in an octahedral structure. Each sulfide is connected to three Ti centres, the geometry at S being pyramidal. Several metal dichalcogenides adopt similar structures, but some, notably MoS2, do not.[2] The layers of TiS2 consist of covalent Ti-S bonds. The individual layers of TiS2 are bound together by van der Waals forces, which are relatively weak intermolecular forces. It crystallises in the space group P3m1.[3] The Ti-S bond lengths are 2.423 Å.[4] Cartoon for intercalation of Li into TiS2 cathode. The process involves swelling of one crystal axis and charge transfer from Li to Ti. Intercalation Further information: Intercalation (chemistry) The single most useful and most studied property of TiS2 is its ability to undergo intercalation upon treatment with electropositive elements. The process is a redox reaction, illustrated in the case of lithium: TiS2 + Li → LiTiS2 LiTiS2 is generally described as Li+[TiS2−]. During the intercalation and deintercalation, a range of stoichimetries are produced with the general formul LixTiS2 (x < 1). During intercalation, the interlayer spacing expands (the lattice \\"swells\\") and the electrical conductivity of the material increases. Intercalation is facilitated because of the weakness of the interlayer forces as well as the susceptibility of the Ti(IV) centers toward reduction. Intercalation can be conducted by combining a suspension of the disulfide material and a solution of the alkali metal in anhydrous ammonia. Alternatively solid TiS2 reacts with the alkali metal upon heating. The Rigid-Band Model (RBM), which assumes that electronic band structure does not change with intercalation, describes changes in the electronic properties upon intercalation. Deintercalation is the opposite of intercalation; the cations diffuse out from between the layers. This process is associated with recharging a Li/TiS2 battery. Intercalation and deintercalation can be monitored by cyclic voltammetry. The microstructure of the titanium disulfide greatly affects the intercalation and deintercalation kinetics. Titanium disulfide nanotubes have a higher uptake and discharge capacity than the polycrystalline structure.[5] The higher surface area of the nanotubes is postulated to provide more binding sites for the anode ions than the polycrystalline structure.[5]","output":"Titanium disulfide (TiS2) is indeed a well-documented member of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) group, which are compounds typically characterized by the formula ME2, where M is a transition metal and E is a chalcogen (sulfur, selenium, or tellurium). TiS2 exhibits several interesting properties including high electrical conductivity and the ability to undergo intercalation, making it valuable for various applications including battery technology. Below is a more detailed description of TiS2: **Structure:** - As stated, TiS2 has a layered structure with individual layers adopting a hexagonal close packed (hcp) arrangement, similar to cadmium iodide (CdI2). This describes the atomic arrangement within the layers; the sulfur atoms form a hexagonal lattice with titanium atoms occupying half of the octahedral sites between them. - Each Ti atom is octahedrally coordinated by six S atoms, and each S atom is trigonally coordinated by three Ti atoms, with the sulfur atoms adopting a pyramidal geometry. - The layers are held together by van der Waals forces, which are much weaker than the covalent Ti-S bonds within the layers, allowing for intercalation. **Intercalation:** - Intercalation is the reversible inclusion of a molecule (or ion) between two other molecules (or ions). In the case of TiS2, it can reversibly incorporate alkali metal ions, such as lithium, between its layers without significantly damaging its crystal structure. - The reaction with lithium can be represented as: TiS2 + Li → LiTiS2, producing Li+[TiS2−]. This process involves the physical insertion of lithium ions into the TiS2 structure, resulting in the expansion of the interlayer spacing and an increase in electrical conductivity. - The material's ability to be reversibly intercalated with lithium ions, along with a corresponding change in oxidation state of the titanium atoms, is what makes it a candidate for use as a cathode material in rechargeable lithium batteries. - Intercalation can occur through various methods, such as immersing TiS2 in a solution containing the desired cation or heating solid TiS2 with the cation. **Deintercalation:** - Deintercalation is the removal of the previously intercalated species, and in battery recharge, it refers to the lithium ions moving out of the TiS2 structure. - This process is crucial for the charging cycle of lithium batteries with TiS2 cathodes. **Rigid-Band Model (RBM):** - The RBM assumes that the band structure of a material does not change upon intercalation; only the electron filling of the bands changes. While this is a simplification, it can provide initial insights into the material's behavior upon intercalation. **Nanostructure Impact:** - The nanostructure of TiS2, such as TiS2 nanotubes, can significantly affect its ability to intercalate and deintercalate ions. These nanotubes potentially have a higher surface area and more accessible active sites than bulk or polycrystalline TiS2, leading to better battery performance in terms of charge/discharge rates and capacity. TiS2's intercalation chemistry is a fundamental aspect of battery research and has contributed significantly to the development of lithium-ion battery technologies. Its layered structure that allows easy intercalation and deintercalation makes it particularly appealing for electrodes where rapid ion transport is required."},{"instruction":"ok so knowing what we know do you think it will be a good candidate for electrochemical exfoliation , i can sandwich it between 2 sheets of nickel foam if its as a powder or crystals","output":"Electrochemical exfoliation is a technique used to peel apart the layers of certain materials to produce thin sheets or few-layer structures by applying an electrical bias in an electrochemical cell. This technique has been employed successfully with materials like graphite to create graphene. For titanium disulfide (TiS₂), you are correct in considering its layered structure, which lends itself to intercalation and suggests the potential for electrochemical exfoliation. The weak van der Waals forces between the TiS₂ layers allow for the intercalation of ions, which can then facilitate the exfoliation process. Here is how TiS₂ might be a suitable candidate for electrochemical exfoliation: 1. **Layered Structure:** - TiS₂'s structure features a sequence of titanium and sulfur layers, similar to other TMDCs like MoS₂. These layers can potentially be separated through electrochemical methods, as with graphitic materials. 2. **Intercalation Capability:** - The ability to intercalate ions such as lithium, sodium, or potassium suggests that TiS₂ could be expanded and potentially exfoliated through electrochemical means. 3. **Conductivity:** - TiS₂'s high electrical conductivity is favorable for electrochemical processes, as it ensures efficient charge transfer during the intercalation and exfoliation stages. For experimental electrochemical exfoliation of TiS₂, here is how the process might look like: - **Electrochemical Cell Setup:** - Use TiS₂ as the working electrode material, possibly by pressing TiS₂ powder onto a conductive substrate like nickel foam. - Sandwich the TiS₂ between two sheets of nickel foam that act as current collectors and protect the material during the electrochemical process. - Submerge the sandwiched setup in an electrolytic solution containing ions that can intercalate into TiS₂, such as lithium, sodium, or potassium ions. - **Application of Voltage:** - Apply an electrical bias to intercalate ions into the TiS₂ structure, causing expansion of the layers. - The induced stress can cause separation along the layers, facilitating exfoliation. - **Monitoring and Control:** - The process will require careful control of the voltage and current, as well as real-time monitoring to prevent overcharging, which could lead to irreversible damage, like phase changes or decomposition of TiS₂. - **Post-Exfoliation Treatment:** - After exfoliation, the thin TiS₂ sheets will likely need washing and purification to remove any remaining electrolyte and intercalated ions. Keep in mind that the success and efficiency of electrochemical exfoliation of TiS₂ will depend on various experimental conditions such as the choice of electrolyte, voltage, current density, time, and the mechanical properties of the TiS₂ itself. While promising, electrochemical exfoliation may need optimization for TiS₂, and the resulting material will need to be characterized to ascertain the quality and number of layers obtained through this process. Overall, given the right conditions, TiS₂ might be a good candidate for electrochemical exfoliation, and your approach with nickel foam seems practical for initial experimentation.

In a heterojunction, two different semiconductors are joined together to form a junction with distinctive electronic properties, which are leveraged for devices like solar cells, photodetectors, and transistors. The advantages of using TiS₂ in a heterojunction include: 1. **Band Gap Tuning:** The narrow band gap of TiS₂ (approximately 1.0 eV), which lies in the near-infrared region, can be combined with materials of varying band gaps. This can help in creating heterojunctions that are responsive to different regions of the solar spectrum for photovoltaic applications or that have specific electronic characteristics for transistors. 2. **Broad Absorption Range:** A heterojunction that includes TiS₂ can absorb a broad range of light, which is beneficial for harvesting solar energy and for sensitivity in photodetectors. 3. **Improved Charge Separation:** Pairing TiS₂ with another semiconductor can enhance charge separation and transport at the heterojunction interface, which is critical for the efficiency of photovoltaic cells and the responsiveness of photodetectors. 4. **Field Effect Transistor (FET) Applications:** TiS₂ can be used as the channel material in FETs, with the heterojunction serving to modulate the charge carrier dynamics for improved device performance. Possible materials to pair with TiS₂ in a heterojunction might include: - **Wide Band Gap Semiconductors:** Materials like TiO₂, ZnO, or GaN can provide a high energy offset with TiS₂, which is useful for UV photodetectors or for creating a type-II heterojunction for efficient charge separation in solar cells. - **Other TMDCs:** Combining TiS₂ with TMDCs that have different electronic properties, like MoS₂ or WS₂, could result in heterostructures with unique optoelectronic properties, suitable for flexible electronics or advanced sensory devices. - **Organic Semiconductors:** Pairing TiS₂ with organic semiconductors could yield flexible, lightweight devices with complementary absorbance spectra for organic photovoltaics. - **Perovskites:** Hybrid perovskites are a hot topic in solar cell research due to their high efficiencies and tunable band gaps. A heterojunction with TiS₂ could enhance stability and widen the absorbance range. When creating heterojunctions, careful consideration must be given to lattice matching between the materials to minimize defects at the interface, alignment of energy levels for efficient charge transfer, and thermal stability during device fabrication. Additionally, the method by which the TiS₂ is prepared can greatly influence the interface quality and, consequently, the device performance. Techniques such as atomic layer deposition, vapor-phase deposition, or mechanical stacking techniques might be employed, depending on the materials and applications. The design of such heterojunction devices, therefore, requires a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together materials science, chemistry, and solid-state physics, often with advanced computational modeling to predetermine the best material combinations and configurations."},{"instruction":"I'd only want it for hydrogen production as part of a hetarojunction to optimise light absorption for H2 production","output":"Using titanium disulfide (TiS₂) in a heterojunction for hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting is indeed a promising approach. For photocatalysis, particularly solar-driven hydrogen production, a heterojunction can offer several benefits: 1. **Enhanced Light Absorption:** - By pairing TiS₂ with another semiconductor that absorbs light at different wavelengths, you can extend the range of light absorption across the solar spectrum, potentially harvesting more solar energy to drive the photocatalytic reaction. 2. **Improved Charge Carrier Separation:** - In a heterojunction, the conduction and valence band alignments of the two semiconductors can facilitate better separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which is crucial for efficient photocatalysis. The separated electrons and holes can participate in reduction and oxidation reactions on the catalyst surface, respectively. 3. **Stabilization of Photogenerated Charge Carriers:** - The heterojunction interface can serve to spatially separate charge carriers, reducing the rate of electron-hole recombination and leading to more effective utilization of photogenerated charges for the production of hydrogen. When using TiS₂ for this purpose, consider pairing it with materials that complement its properties for enhanced photocatalytic activity, such as: - **Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂):** - TiO₂ is a common photocatalyst with strong oxidation power, good stability, and a band gap that's active under UV light. A TiS₂/TiO₂ heterojunction could leverage the visible light absorption of TiS₂ and the UV absorption and photocatalytic strength of TiO₂. - **Cadmium Sulfide (CdS):** - CdS has a band gap that absorbs visible light and could be a good match for TiS₂, creating a staggered band alignment (type II heterojunction) that promotes charge separation and extends the light absorption into the visible range. - **Gallium Phosphide (GaP) or Gallium Arsenide (GaAs):** - These semiconductors have suitable band gaps for visible light absorption and could be paired with TiS₂ to form heterojunctions that take advantage of both materials' properties. When designing the heterojunction, it's critical to ensure proper alignment of the energy levels, interfacial contact, and stability of the materials under the operating conditions. The photocatalyst materials also need to be dispersed in a manner that allows good interaction with the water to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, co-catalysts such as platinum, palladium, or nickel sulfides can be added to the heterojunction system to provide active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), improving the kinetics and overall efficiency of the photocatalytic process. Ultimately, the goal in designing such a heterojunction system for hydrogen production is to create a material that absorbs a large portion of the solar spectrum, efficiently separates and transports charge carriers, and provides catalytic sites for the generation of hydrogen at minimal overpotentials. Experimental evaluation and optimization are key to finding the most effective material combinations and configurations."},{"instruction":"yes exactly , i have other things lined up to do also , mainly focusing on nanosheets which is why this compound sparked my interest and its possible IR wavelenth absorption , since Ir is the dominant wavelength from the sun","output":"It's great to hear that you're targeting the development of nanosheets and specifically looking at materials that can harness infrared (IR) light, given its prevalence in the solar spectrum. Titanium disulfide (TiS₂) can indeed be an attractive material for such applications because of its relatively narrow band gap, which allows it to absorb near-infrared light, and its layered structure that's conducive to exfoliation into nanosheets. Material strategies that emphasize IR light utilization are particularly interesting for a few reasons: 1. **Broadened Spectral Utilization:** - Most of the solar energy reaching the Earth's surface is in the infrared range of the spectrum. By targeting this range, you can potentially harness a larger portion of the solar irradiance for photocatalytic processes. 2. **Enhanced Thermal Management:** - Materials that interact with IR light can also manage thermal effects, as IR is associated with heat. This can be beneficial for preventing overheating in solar devices, which can otherwise reduce efficiency and longevity. 3. **Complementary Material Pairings:** - Materials with band gaps in the visible range can be combined with those absorbing in the IR range (like TiS₂) to form heterojunctions that cover a wider spectrum of light. This can lead to more effective use of solar energy. 4. **Nanosheet Advantages:** - Nanosheets provide high surface-to-volume ratios, which is beneficial for photocatalytic reactions. Plus, their two-dimensional structure can facilitate faster electron transport, improving the kinetics of charge carrier separation and recombination. In crafting a heterostructure for IR light absorption, TiS₂ nanosheets can be paired with other semiconductors or materials to form a system tailored for the effective generation of hydrogen through photocatalysis. Materials like silicon, which has a band gap in the range of IR light, might be a good complement to TiS₂ for solar energy applications. Moreover, doping or combining TiS₂ with narrower band gap materials could further enhance its IR absorption capabilities. When synthesizing TiS₂ nanosheets for these applications, careful control of the exfoliation and processing conditions is necessary to preserve the desired electronic properties and maximize the effective surface area. As you continue your research and development in this area, consider the following steps: - **Material Characterization:** - After the preparation of TiS₂ nanosheets, thorough characterization is important to understand their thickness, morphological features, crystal structure, and electronic properties. - **Device Fabrication:** - Construct prototypes of photocatalytic systems using the prepared TiS₂ nanosheets, possibly in combination with other materials that have complementary absorption characteristics. - **Performance Testing:** - Evaluate the photocatalytic activity of your prototypes under simulated solar light, paying special attention to their efficiency under IR illumination. - **Optimization:** - Use performance data to refine the material properties and system design to maximize the photocatalytic hydrogen production.

The bandgaps of the materials used for each half of the reaction do play a crucial role, but it's not solely about the bandgap values; their positions relative to the redox potentials of water are also important. Here are the basic criteria related to the bandgaps and band energies for the water splitting reaction: 1. **Bandgap Size:** - A semiconductor material must have a bandgap that is large enough to provide the energy to split water molecules. The thermodynamic potential for splitting water is 1.23 eV, but in practice, a larger bandgap is often necessary to account for overpotentials and kinetic limitations. Typically, a bandgap between 1.6 and 2.4 eV is considered ideal for efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion. 2. **Redox Potential Alignment:** - The conduction band (CB) minimum of the semiconductor must be more negative than the hydrogen evolution potential to facilitate proton reduction to hydrogen gas. - The valence band (VB) maximum must be more positive than the oxygen evolution potential to enable water oxidation to oxygen gas. For an ideal water-splitting photoelectrode system: - The **hydrogen production photocathode** should have a conduction band edge that is slightly more negative than the potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is -0.41 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 7. - The **oxygen production photoanode** should have a valence band edge that is more positive than the potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is +0.82 V vs. SHE at pH 7. Combining these potentials means that the total potential difference required for water splitting under standard conditions is at least 1.23 volts, so the semiconductor's bandgap must straddle these levels effectively. However, practical considerations often necessitate a larger bandgap due to overpotentials and the kinetics of the respective half-reactions. It is also important to note that the absolute energy levels of the CB and VB can shift depending on the pH of the solution and the surface chemistry of the semiconductor. Therefore, while bandgap is a fundamental characteristic of the material selection for photocatalytic water splitting, it's not just about the absolute value of the bandgap. The relative positioning of the band edges (the CB minimum and the VB maximum) with respect to the redox potentials of the HER and OER is also key. Additionally, the optical absorption properties need to be such that the material can effectively absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs for the photochemical reactions. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the photocatalytic process will depend on these energetic considerations, as well as other factors like charge carrier lifespan, transport properties, surface reaction kinetics, and overall system design."},{"instruction":"hmm ok , so TIN isnt ideal with its bandgap being around 1ev I guess it needs raising a bit to be ideal ?","output":"Yes, titanium nitride (TiN) with a bandgap of around 1 eV is not optimal for water splitting because the bandgap is below the minimum energy needed to split water molecules, which is approximately 1.23 eV. Moreover, the band positioning with respect to the redox potentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution is also important, as previously discussed. To improve the performance of TiN or other materials with similar bandgaps for water splitting, modification strategies might be employed to effectively raise the bandgap or alter the band edge positions: 1. **Doping:** - Introducing dopants can manipulate the electronic structure and bandgap of a material. By careful selection of the type and amount of dopant, it's possible to raise the bandgap to a more suitable value for water splitting. 2. **Forming Heterojunctions:** - Combining TiN with a material with a larger bandgap can create a heterojunction that benefits from the bandgap of the second material. This heterostructure could have a staggered band alignment, which might provide the necessary energy levels for water splitting and enhanced charge separation. 3. **Surface Modifications:** - Employing surface treatments that result in the formation of surface states or the application of cocatalysts that can modify the energy levels at the surface, facilitating the HER or OER. 4. **Quantum Dot Sensitization:** - Incorporating quantum dots with wider bandgaps on the surface of TiN can extend light absorption into the visible range and potentially enable the use of its sub-bandgap photon energy for photocatalysis via a sensitization mechanism. 5. **Nanostructuring:** - Nanostructuring can change the apparent bandgap of the semiconductor through quantum confinement effects, especially when material dimensions approach the exciton Bohr radius. When modifying or combining materials for photocatalytic applications, it is important to ensure that any modifications do not negatively impact other critical properties, such as stability, carrier mobility, or surface reactivity. The modification approach should be tailored to maintain or enhance the charge carrier dynamics and lifetime, as well as to maximize the absorption of the solar spectrum. Even with modifications, TiN might not be the first-choice material for direct water splitting due to its smaller bandgap. More commonly, materials like TiO2, WO3, ZnO, or those with bandgaps in the range of 2 eV and above, are used as photocatalysts for water splitting. These materials are not only effective in absorbing a portion of the solar spectrum but also have band edge positions that are well-aligned with the redox potentials of water."},{"instruction":"ok but you said it might be ok if the other part of the heterojunction has a larger bandgap , so i'm guessing it might be fine if the other part of the junction is suited ? am i getting this right , or is it still unfavorable with a bandgap of 1ev","output":"In principle, it's theoretically possible for a semiconductor with a smaller band gap, such as TiN (around 1 eV), to contribute to a heterojunction pair for water splitting if the other semiconductor material in the heterojunction possesses a larger band gap that is well-suited for the reaction. Let's clarify how this might work: 1. **Band Alignment:** - When two semiconductors form a heterojunction, their respective band edges align to create a type I, II, or III band alignment. - For photocatalytic water splitting, a type II alignment is often favorable because it helps spatially separate the photogenerated electrons and holes, encouraging them to move in opposite directions (toward the respective surfaces where reduction and oxidation reactions occur). 2. **Complementary Properties:** - If the larger band gap semiconductor has a conduction band minimum (CBM) that is sufficiently negative to reduce water to hydrogen, and a valence band maximum (VBM) appropriately positive to oxidize water to oxygen, it could effectively drive the water-splitting reaction. - The smaller band gap material (TiN in this case) contributes by potentially absorbing lower-energy photons that the wider band gap material cannot, thereby extending the range of usable solar radiation. 3. **Practical Considerations:** - Even though the heterojunction might be theoretically capable of driving the reaction, the overall system efficiency will depend on factors like the charge carrier lifetime, mobility, and the efficiency of charge separation. - A material with a band gap of 1 eV would also absorb a significant amount of IR radiation, which might not be energetically favorable in producing the necessary chemical reactions for water splitting but could assist in charge separation if it complements the other material's band structure. - The smaller band gap material would need to be stable under operational conditions, and its band edges should not recombine the charges before they participate in the water-splitting reactions. In reality, TiN is not commonly used for photocatalytic water splitting, mainly because its inherent properties are not ideal. TiN is known for its metallic properties, including high electrical conductivity and reflectivity, which aren’t typically desired in a photocatalyst. However, in a tailored heterojunction, where TiN might serve a particular role that complements another semiconductor, it could possibly add value to the system under the right conditions. In conclusion, while TiN's small band gap presents challenges, it's the interface between the two semiconductors in a heterojunction that can ultimately determine the performance of the system. The other semiconductor would need a band gap that is not only large enough but also has properly aligned band edges relative to the water reduction and oxidation potentials. Therefore, the combination of material properties and the architecture of the device are crucial for any potential application in photocatalysis."},{"instruction":"hmm i need to look at some diagrams and think on it all for a while to unverstand more about the CB minimum and the VB maximum) with respect to the redox potentials of the HER and OER I've only been thinking about bandgap , i need to get myself educated more","output":"It's great that you're looking to deepen your understanding of semiconductor physics and photoelectrochemistry, especially concerning the intricacies of energy band alignment in relation to redox potentials. Here's a bit more information to help you as you delve into these concepts: **Understanding the Valence Band Maximum (VBM) and Conduction Band Minimum (CBM):** The VBM is the highest energy level of the valence band, where the electrons are present naturally. Conversely, the CBM is the lowest energy level of the conduction band, where electrons can move freely and contribute to electrical conduction. The bandgap is the energy difference between the VBM and CBM. **Redox Potentials in Water Splitting:** For water splitting, two reactions are necessary: - The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which occurs at the cathode and produces hydrogen gas by reduction of protons. - The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which occurs at the anode and generates oxygen gas by the oxidation of water. Each of these reactions has a standard redox potential, which corresponds to the energy needed to drive the reaction: - HER: 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂ (0 V vs. SHE at standard conditions of pH 0) - OER: 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ (1.23 V vs. SHE at standard conditions of pH 0) **Importance of Band Edge Positions:** The CBM must be more negative than the potential for the HER for electrons to be able to reduce protons to hydrogen. The VBM must be more positive than the potential for the OER for holes to oxidize water into oxygen. **External Bias and Overpotentials:** In practical systems, overpotentials—additional voltages above the thermodynamic requirements—are needed to overcome kinetic barriers and drive the reactions at a significant rate. This means the actual required bandgap can be larger than 1.23 eV, and the CBM and VBM need to be positioned even more favorably. **Visualizing Energy Levels with Band Diagrams:** Band diagrams provide visual representation of energy levels for the VBM, CBM, and redox potentials. These diagrams often use a vacuum level as a common reference point, with all energy values being expressed relative to this level. **Educational Resources:** To further your education, you can explore textbooks and online resources on semiconductor physics, photoelectrochemistry, and materials science. Topics such as solid-state physics, electronic band structures, and electrochemistry will be particularly useful. Additionally, many scientific journals publish review articles that summarize key principles and recent advancements in the field. Understanding these concepts will equip you with the knowledge to design and analyze photoelectrochemical systems effectively. Knowing how to tailor the energetics of your materials to align with the desired chemical reactions is crucial for developing efficient water-splitting devices.

For large transformer language models at and beyond 6.7B parameters, the feed-forward and attention projection layers and their matrix multiplication operations are responsible for 95%2 of consumed parameters and 65-85% of all computation (Ilharco et al., 2020). One way to reduce the size of the parameters is to quantize them to less bits and use low-bit-precision matrix multiplication. With this goal in mind, 8-bit quantization methods for transformers have been developed (Chen et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Zafrir et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020). While these methods reduce memory use, they degrade performance, usually require tuning quantization further after training, and have only been studied for models with less than 350M parameters. Degradation-free quantization up to 350M parameters is poorly understood, and multi-billion parameter quantization remains an open challenge. ∗Majority of research done as a visiting researcher at Facebook AI Research. 2Other parameters come mostly from the embedding layer. A tiny amount comes from norms and biases. 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022). arXiv:2208.07339v2 [cs.LG] 10 Nov 2022 In this paper, we present the ﬁrst multi-billion-scale Int8 quantization procedure for transformers that does not incur any performance degradation. Our procedure makes it possible to load a 175B parame- ter transformer with 16 or 32-bit weights, convert the feed-forward and attention projection layers to 8-bit, and use the resulting model immediately for inference without any performance degradation. We achieve this result by solving two key challenges: the need for higher quantization precision at scales beyond 1B parameters and the need to explicitly represent the sparse but systematic large magnitude outlier features that ruin quantization precision once they emerge in all transformer layers starting at scales of 6.7B parameters. This loss of precision is reﬂected in C4 evaluation perplexity (Section 3) as well as zeroshot accuracy as soon as these outlier features emerge, as shown in Figure 1. 125M 350M 1.3B 2.7B 6.7B 13B 30B 66B 175B Parameters 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 Mean zeroshot accuracy Method 8-bit baseline 16-bit baseline emergence of outlier features LLM.int8() Figure 1: OPT model mean zeroshot accuracy for WinoGrande, HellaSwag, PIQA, and LAMBADA datasets. Shown is the 16-bit baseline, the most precise previous 8-bit quantization method as a baseline, and our new 8-bit quantization method, LLM.int8(). We can see once systematic outliers occur at a scale of 6.7B parameters, regular quan- tization methods fail, while LLM.int8() maintains 16-bit accuracy. We show that with the ﬁrst part of our method, vector-wise quantization, it is possible to retain performance at scales up to 2.7B parameters. For vector-wise quantization, matrix multiplica- tion can be seen as a sequence of independent inner products of row and column vectors. As such, we can use a separate quantization nor- malization constant for each inner product to improve quantization precision. We can recover the output of the matrix multiplication by de- normalizing by the outer product of column and row normalization constants before we perform the next operation. To scale beyond 6.7B parameters without perfor- mance degradation, it is critical to understand the emergence of extreme outliers in the feature dimensions of the hidden states during infer- ence. To this end, we provide a new descriptive analysis which shows that large features with magnitudes up to 20x larger than in other di- mensions ﬁrst appear in about 25% of all trans- former layers and then gradually spread to other layers as we scale transformers to 6B parame- ters. At around 6.7B parameters, a phase shift occurs, and all transformer layers and 75% of all sequence dimensions are affected by extreme magnitude features. These outliers are highly systematic: at the 6.7B scale, 150,000 outliers occur per sequence, but they are concentrated in only 6 feature dimensions across the entire transformer. Setting these outlier feature dimensions to zero decreases top-1 attention softmax probability mass by more than 20% and degrades validation perplexity by 600-1000% despite them only making up about 0.1% of all input features. In contrast, removing the same amount of random features decreases the probability by a maximum of 0.3% and degrades perplexity by about 0.1%. To support effective quantization with such extreme outliers, we develop mixed-precision decomposi- tion, the second part of our method. We perform 16-bit matrix multiplication for the outlier feature dimensions and 8-bit matrix multiplication for the other 99.9% of the dimensions. We name the combination of vector-wise quantization and mixed precision decomposition, LLM.int8(). We show that by using LLM.int8(), we can perform inference in LLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation. Our method not only provides new insights into the effects of these outliers on model performance but also makes it possible for the ﬁrst time to use very large models, for example, OPT-175B/BLOOM, on a single server with consumer GPUs. While our work focuses on making large language models accessible without degradation, we also show in Appendix D that we maintain end-to-end inference runtime performance for large models, such as BLOOM-176B and provide modest matrix multiplication speedups for GPT-3 models of size 6.7B parameters or larger. We open-source our software3 and release a Hugging Face Transformers (Wolf et al., 2019) integration making our method available to all hosted Hugging Face Models that have linear layers. 3https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes 2 0 -1 -1 2 3 0 -1 45 -1 2 -1 2 0 3 -1 0 0 -2 -2 2 X W FP16 FP16 12 37 -17 -63 -83 Outliers Regular values + Out FP16 16-bit Decomposition (1) Decompose outliers 45 12 37 -17 -63 -83 2 0 3 -2 X W F16 F16 (2) FP16 Matmul X W = Out F16 F16 F16 8-bit Vector-wise Quantization (1) Find vector-wise constants: C & C 0 -1 2 3 -1 -1 0 2 -1 -1 0 -1 0 -2 2 W 1 3 2 1 2 C C F16 F16 X (2) Quantize (3) Int8 Matmul X * (127/C ) = X W * (127/C ) = W F16 I8 F16 I8 X W = Out I8 I8 I32 Out * (C C ) I32 F16 127*127 = Out + (4) Dequantize x w w x x w w x LLM.int8() Figure 2: Schematic of LLM.int8(). Given 16-bit ﬂoating-point inputs Xf16 and weights Wf16, the features and weights are decomposed into sub-matrices of large magnitude features and other values. The outlier feature matrices are multiplied in 16-bit. All other values are multiplied in 8-bit. We perform 8-bit vector-wise multiplication by scaling by row and column-wise absolute maximum of Cx and Cw and then quantizing the outputs to Int8. The Int32 matrix multiplication outputs Outi32 are dequantization by the outer product of the normalization constants Cx ⊗ Cw. Finally, both outlier and regular outputs are accumulated in 16-bit ﬂoating point outputs. 2 Background In this work, push quantization techniques to their breaking point by scaling transformer models. We are interested in two questions: at which scale and why do quantization techniques fail and how does this related to quantization precision? To answer these questions we study high-precision asymmetric quantization (zeropoint quantization) and symmetric quantization (absolute maximum quantization). While zeropoint quantization offers high precision by using the full bit-range of the datatype, it is rarely used due to practical constraints. Absolute maximum quantization is the most commonly used technique. 2.1 8-bit Data Types and Quantization Absmax quantization scales inputs into the 8-bit range [−127, 127] by multiplying with sxf16 which is 127 divided by the absolute maximum of the entire tensor. This is equivalent to dividing by the inﬁnity norm and multiplying by 127. As such, for an FP16 input matrix Xf16 ∈ Rs×h Int8 absmax quantization is given by: Xi8 = � 127 · Xf16 max ij (|Xf16ij|) � = � 127 ∥Xf16∥∞ Xf16 � = � sxf16Xf16 � , where ⌊⌉ indicates rounding to the nearest integer. Zeropoint quantization shifts the input distribution into the full range [−127, 127] by scaling with the normalized dynamic range ndx and then shifting by the zeropoint zpx. With this afﬁne transformation, any input tensors will use all bits of the data type, thus reducing the quantization error for asymmetric distributions. For example, for ReLU outputs, in absmax quantization all values in [−127, 0) go unused, whereas in zeropoint quantization the full [−127, 127] range is used. Zeropoint quantization is given by the following equations: ndxf16 = 2 · 127 max ij (Xij f16) − min ij (Xij f16) (1) zpxi16 = � Xf16 · min ij (Xij f16) � (2) Xi8 = � ndxf16Xf16 � (3) 3 To use zeropoint quantization in an operation we feed both the tensor Xi8 and the zeropoint zpxi16 into a special instruction4 which adds zpxi16 to each element of Xi8 before performing a 16-bit integer operation. For example, to multiply two zeropoint quantized numbers Ai8 and Bi8 along with their zeropoints zpai16 and zpbi16 we calculate: Ci32 = multiplyi16(Azpai16 , Bzpbi16 ) = (Ai8 + zpai16)(Bi8 + zpbi16) (4) where unrolling is required if the instruction multiplyi16 is not available such as on GPUs or TPUs: Ci32 = Ai8Bi8 + Ai8zpbi16 + Bi8zpai16 + zpai16zpbi16, (5) where Ai8Bi8 is computed with Int8 precision while the rest is computed in Int16/32 precision. As such, zeropoint quantization can be slow if the multiplyi16 instruction is not available. In both cases, the outputs are accumulated as a 32-bit integer Ci32. To dequantize Ci32, we divide by the scaling constants ndaf16 and ndbf16. Int8 Matrix Multiplication with 16-bit Float Inputs and Outputs. Given hidden states Xf16 ∈ Rs×h and weights Wf16 ∈ Rh×o with sequence dimension s, feature dimension h, and output dimension o we perform 8-bit matrix multiplication with 16-bit inputs and outputs as follows: Xf16Wf16 = Cf16 ≈ 1 cxf16cwf16 Ci32 = Sf16 · Ci32 ≈ Sf16 · Ai8Bi8 = Sf16 · Q(Af16) Q(Bf16), (6) Where Q(·) is either absmax or zeropoint quantization and cxf16 and cwf16 are the respective tensor- wise scaling constants sx and sw for absmax or ndx and ndw for zeropoint quantization. 3 Int8 Matrix Multiplication at Scale The main challenge with quantization methods that use a single scaling constant per tensor is that a single outlier can reduce the quantization precision of all other values. As such, it is desirable to have multiple scaling constants per tensor, such as block-wise constants (Dettmers et al., 2022), so that the effect of that outliers is conﬁned to each block. We improve upon one of the most common ways of blocking quantization, row-wise quantization (Khudia et al., 2021), by using vector-wise quantization, as described in more detail below. To handle the large magnitude outlier features that occur in all transformer layers beyond the 6.7B scale, vector-wise quantization is no longer sufﬁcient. For this purpose, we develop mixed- precision decomposition, where the small number of large magnitude feature dimensions (≈0.1%) are represented in 16-bit precision while the other 99.9% of values are multiplied in 8-bit. Since most entries are still represented in low-precision, we retain about 50% memory reduction compared to 16-bit. For example, for BLOOM-176B, we reduce the memory footprint of the model by 1.96x. Vector-wise quantization and mixed-precision decomposition are shown in Figure 2. The LLM.int8() method is the combination of absmax vector-wise quantization and mixed precision decomposition. 3.1 Vector-wise Quantization One way to increase the number of scaling constants for matrix multiplication is to view matrix multiplication as a sequence of independent inner products. Given the hidden states Xf16 ∈ Rb×h and weight matrix Wf16 ∈ Rh×o, we can assign a different scaling constant cxf16to each row of Xf16 and cw to each column of Wf16. To dequantize, we denormalize each inner product result by 1/(cxf16cwf16). For the whole matrix multiplication this is equivalent to denormalization by the outer product cxf16 ⊗ cwf16, where cx ∈ Rs and cw ∈ Ro. As such the full equation for matrix multiplication with row and column constants is given by: Cf16 ≈ 1 cxf16 ⊗ cwf16 Ci32 = S · Ci32 = S · Ai8Bi8 = S · Q(Af16) Q(Bf16), (7) which we term vector-wise quantization for matrix multiplication. 4https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pmaddubsw 4 3.2 The Core of LLM.int8(): Mixed-precision Decomposition In our analysis, we demonstrate that a signiﬁcant problem for billion-scale 8-bit transformers is that they have large magnitude features (columns), which are important for transformer performance and require high precision quantization. However, vector-wise quantization, our best quantization technique, quantizes each row for the hidden state, which is ineffective for outlier features. Luckily, we see that these outlier features are both incredibly sparse and systematic in practice, making up only about 0.1% of all feature dimensions, thus allowing us to develop a new decomposition technique that focuses on high precision multiplication for these particular dimensions. We ﬁnd that given input matrix Xf16 ∈ Rs×h, these outliers occur systematically for almost all sequence dimensions s but are limited to speciﬁc feature/hidden dimensions h. As such, we propose mixed-precision decomposition for matrix multiplication where we separate outlier feature dimensions into the set O = {i|i ∈ Z, 0 ≤ i ≤ h}, which contains all dimensions of h which have at least one outlier with a magnitude larger than the threshold α. In our work, we ﬁnd that α = 6.0 is sufﬁcient to reduce transformer performance degradation close to zero. Using Einstein notation where all indices are superscripts, given the weight matrix Wf16 ∈ Rh×o, mixed-precision decomposition for matrix multiplication is deﬁned as follows: Cf16 ≈ � h∈O Xh f16Wh f16 + Sf16 · � h̸∈O Xh i8Wh i8 (8) where Sf16 is the denormalization term for the Int8 inputs and weight matrices Xi8 and Wi8. This separation into 8-bit and 16-bit allows for high-precision multiplication of outliers while using memory-efﬁcient matrix multiplication with 8-bit weights of more than 99.9% of values. Since the number of outlier feature dimensions is not larger than 7 (|O| ≤ 7) for transformers up to 13B parameters, this decomposition operation only consumes about 0.1% additional memory. 3.3 Experimental Setup We measure the robustness of quantization methods as we scale the size of several publicly available pretrained language models up to 175B parameters. The key question is not how well a quantization method performs for a particular model but the trend of how such a method performs as we scale. We use two setups for our experiments. One is based on language modeling perplexity, which we ﬁnd to be a highly robust measure that is very sensitive to quantization degradation. We use this setup to compare different quantization baselines. Additionally, we evaluate zeroshot accuracy degradation on OPT models for a range of different end tasks, where we compare our methods with a 16-bit baseline. For the language modeling setup, we use dense autoregressive transformers pretrained in fairseq (Ott et al., 2019) ranging between 125M and 13B parameters. These transformers have been pretrained on Books (Zhu et al., 2015), English Wikipedia, CC-News (Nagel, 2016), OpenWebText (Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019), CC-Stories (Trinh and Le, 2018), and English CC100 (Wenzek et al., 2020). For more information on how these pretrained models are trained, see Artetxe et al. (2021). To evaluate the language modeling degradation after Int8 quantization, we evaluate the perplexity of the 8-bit transformer on validation data of the C4 corpus (Raffel et al., 2019) which is a subset of the Common Crawl corpus.5 We use NVIDIA A40 GPUs for this evaluation. To measure degradation in zeroshot performance, we use OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022), and we evaluate these models on the EleutherAI language model evaluation harness (Gao et al., 2021). 3.4 Main Results The main language modeling perplexity results on the 125M to 13B Int8 models evaluated on the C4 corpus can be seen in Table 1. We see that absmax, row-wise, and zeropoint quantization fail as we scale, where models after 2.7B parameters perform worse than smaller models. Zeropoint quantization fails instead beyond 6.7B parameters. Our method, LLM.int8(), is the only method that preserves perplexity. As such, LLM.int8() is the only method with a favorable scaling trend. 5https://commoncrawl.org/ 5 Table 1: C4 validation perplexities of quantization methods for different transformer sizes ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. We see that absmax, row-wise, zeropoint, and vector-wise quantization leads to signiﬁcant performance degradation as we scale, particularly at the 13B mark where 8-bit 13B perplexity is worse than 8-bit 6.7B perplexity. If we use LLM.int8(), we recover full perplexity as we scale. Zeropoint quantization shows an advantage due to asymmetric quantization but is no longer advantageous when used with mixed-precision decomposition.

On the other hand, the baseline, 8-bit absmax vector-wise quantization, scales poorly and degenerates into random performance. Although our primary focus is on saving memory, we also measured the run time of LLM.int8(). The quantization overhead can slow inference for models with less than 6.7B parameters, as compared to a FP16 baseline. However, models of 6.7B parameters or less ﬁt on most GPUs and quantization is less needed in practice. LLM.int8() run times is about two times faster for large matrix multiplications equivalent to those in 175B models. Appendix D provides more details on these experiments. 4 Emergent Large Magnitude Features in Transformers at Scale As we scale transformers, outlier features with large magnitudes emerge and strongly affect all layers and their quantization. Given a hidden state X ∈ Rs×h where s is the sequence/token dimension and h the hidden/feature dimension, we deﬁne a feature to be a particular dimension hi. Our analysis looks at a particular feature dimension hi across all layers of a given transformer. We ﬁnd that outlier features strongly affect attention and the overall predictive performance of transformers. While up to 150k outliers exist per 2048 token sequence for a 13B model, these outlier features are highly systematic and only representing at most 7 unique feature dimensions hi. Insights from this analysis were critical to developing mixed-precision decomposition. Our analysis explains the advantages of zeropoint quantization and why they disappear with the use of mixed-precision decomposition and the quantization performance of small vs. large models. 4.1 Finding Outlier Features The difﬁculty with the quantitative analysis of emergent phenomena is two-fold. We aim to select a small subset of features for analysis such that the results are intelligible and not to complex while also capturing important probabilistic and structured patterns. We use an empirical approach to ﬁnd these constraints. We deﬁne outliers according to the following criteria: the magnitude of the feature is at least 6.0, affects at least 25% of layers, and affects at least 6% of the sequence dimensions. More formally, given a transformer with L layers and hidden state Xl ∈ Rs×h, l = 0...L where s is the sequence dimension and h the feature dimension, we deﬁne a feature to be a particular dimension hi in any of the hidden states Xli. We track dimensions hi, 0 ≤ i ≤ h, which have at least one value with a magnitude of α ≥ 6 and we only collect statistics if these outliers occur in the same feature dimension hi in at least 25% of transformer layers 0...L and appear in at least 6% of all sequence dimensions s across all hidden states Xl.

Lines are B-spline interpolations of 4 and 9 linear segments for (a) and (b). Once the phase shift occurs, outliers are present in all layers and in about 75% of all sequence dimensions. While (a) suggest a sudden phase shift in parameter size, (b) suggests a gradual exponential phase shift as perplexity decreases. The stark shift in (a) co-occurs with the sudden degradation of performance in quantization methods. (key/query/value/output) and the feedforward network expansion layer (ﬁrst sub-layer), we ignore the attention function and the FFN contraction layer (second sub-layer) for this analysis. Our reasoning for these thresholds is as follows. We ﬁnd that using mixed-precision decomposition, perplexity degradation stops if we treat any feature with a magnitude 6 or larger as an outlier feature. For the number of layers affected by outliers, we ﬁnd that outlier features are systematic in large models: they either occur in most layers or not at all. On the other hand, they are probabilistic in small models: they occur sometimes in some layers for each sequence. As such, we set our threshold for how many layers need to be affected to detect an outlier feature in such a way as to limit detection to a single outlier in our smallest model with 125M parameters. This threshold corresponds to that at least 25% of transformer layers are affected by an outlier in the same feature dimension. The second most common outlier occurs in only a single layer ( 2% of layers), indicating that this is a reasonable threshold. We use the same procedure to ﬁnd the threshold for how many sequence dimensions are affected by outlier features in our 125M model: outliers occur in at least 6% of sequence dimensions. We test models up to a scale of 13B parameters. To make sure that the observed phenomena are not due to bugs in software, we evaluate transformers that were trained in three different software frameworks. We evaluate four GPT-2 models which use OpenAI software, ﬁve Meta AI models that use Fairseq (Ott et al., 2019), and one EleutherAI model GPT-J that uses Tensorﬂow-Mesh (Shazeer et al., 2018). More details can be found in Appendix C. We also perform our analysis in two different inference software frameworks: Fairseq and Hugging Face Transformers (Wolf et al., 2019). 4.2 Measuring the Effect of Outlier Features To demonstrate that the outlier features are essential for attention and predictive performance, we set the outlier features to zero before feeding the hidden states Xl into the attention projection layers and then compare the top-1 softmax probability with the regular softmax probability with outliers. We do this for all layers independently, meaning we forward the regular softmax probabilities values to avoid cascading errors and isolate the effects due to the outlier features. We also report the perplexity degradation if we remove the outlier feature dimension (setting them to zero) and propagate these altered, hidden states through the transformer. As a control, we apply the same procedure for random non-outlier feature dimensions and note attention and perplexity degradation. Our main quantitative results can be summarized as four main points. 7 15 20 25 30 35 C4 perplexity 10 20 30 40 50 Median feature outlier magnitude emergence of outlier features 60 (a) 15 20 25 30 35 C4 perplexity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Outlier features count emergence of outlier features (b) Figure 4: The median magnitude of the largest outlier feature in (a) indicates a sudden shift in outlier size. This appears to be the prime reason why quantization methods fail after emergence. While the number of outlier feature dimensions is only roughly proportional to model size, (b) shows that the number of outliers is strictly monotonic with respect to perplexity across all models analyzed. Lines are B-spline interpolations of 9 linear segments. (1) When measured by the number of parameters, the emergence of large magnitude features across all layers of a transformer occurs suddenly between 6B and 6.7B parameters as shown in Figure 3a as the percentage of layers affected increases from 65% to 100%. The number of sequence dimensions affected increases rapidly from 35% to 75%. This sudden shift co-occurs with the point where quantization begins to fail. (2) Alternatively, when measured by perplexity, the emergence of large magnitude features across all layers of the transformer can be seen as emerging smoothly according to an exponential function of decreasing perplexity, as seen in Figure 3b. This indicates that there is nothing sudden about emergence and that we might be able to detect emergent features before a phase shift occurs by studying exponential trends in smaller models. This also suggests that emergence is not only about model size but about perplexity, which is related to multiple additional factors such as the amount of training data used, and data quality (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Henighan et al., 2020). (3) Median outlier feature magnitude rapidly increases once outlier features occur in all layers of the transformer, as shown in Figure 4a. The large magnitude of outliers features and their asymmetric distribution disrupts Int8 quantization precision. This is the core reason why quantization methods fail starting at the 6.7B scale – the range of the quantization distribution is too large so that most quantization bins are empty and small quantization values are quantized to zero, essentially extinguishing information. We hypothesize that besides Int8 inference, regular 16-bit ﬂoating point training becomes unstable due to outliers beyond the 6.7B scale – it is easy to exceed the maximum 16-bit value 65535 by chance if you multiply by vectors ﬁlled with values of magnitude 60. (4) The number of outliers features increases strictly monotonically with respect to decreasing C4 perplexity as shown in Figure 4b, while a relationship with model size is non-monotonic. This indicates that model perplexity rather than mere model size determines the phase shift. We hypothesize that model size is only one important covariate among many that are required to reach emergence. These outliers features are highly systematic after the phase shift occurred. For example, for a 6.7B transformer with a sequence length of 2048, we ﬁnd about 150k outlier features per sequence for the entire transformer, but these features are concentrated in only 6 different hidden dimensions. These outliers are critical for transformer performance. If the outliers are removed, the mean top-1 softmax probability is reduced from about 40% to about 20%, and validation perplexity increases by 600-1000% even though there are at most 7 outlier feature dimensions. When we remove 7 random feature dimensions instead, the top-1 probability decreases only between 0.02-0.3%, and perplexity increases by 0.1%. This highlights the critical nature of these feature dimensions. Quantization precision for these outlier features is paramount as even tiny errors greatly impact model performance. 8 4.3 Interpretation of Quantization Performance Our analysis shows that outliers in particular feature dimensions are ubiquitous in large transformers, and these feature dimensions are critical for transformer performance. Since row-wise and vector- wise quantization scale each hidden state sequence dimension s (rows) and because outliers occur in the feature dimension h (columns), both methods cannot deal with these outliers effectively. This is why absmax quantization methods fail quickly after emergence. However, almost all outliers have a strict asymmetric distribution: they are either solely positive or negative (see Appendix C). This makes zeropoint quantization particularly effective for these outliers, as zeropoint quantization is an asymmetric quantization method that scales these outliers into the full [−127, 127] range. This explains the strong performance in our quantization scaling benchmark in Table 1. However, at the 13B scale, even zeropoint quantization fails due to accumulated quantization errors and the quick growth of outlier magnitudes, as seen in Figure 4a. If we use our full LLM.int8() method with mixed-precision decomposition, the advantage of ze- ropoint quantization disappears indicating that the remaining decomposed features are symmetric. However, vector-wise still has an advantage over row-wise quantization, indicating that the enhanced quantization precision of the model weights is needed to retain full precision predictive performance. 5 Related work There is closely related work on quantization data types and quantization of transformers, as described below. Appendix B provides further related work on quantization of convolutional networks. 8-bit Data Types. Our work studies quantization techniques surrounding the Int8 data type, since it is currently the only 8-bit data type supported by GPUs. Other common data types are ﬁxed point or ﬂoating point 8-bit data types (FP8). These data types usually have a sign bit and different exponent and fraction bit combinations. For example, a common variant of this data type has 5 bits for the exponent and 2 bits for the fraction (Wang et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019; Cambier et al., 2020; Mellempudi et al., 2019) and uses either no scaling constants or zeropoint scaling. These data types have large errors for large magnitude values since they have only 2 bits for the fraction but provide high accuracy for small magnitude values. Jin et al. (2022) provide an excellent analysis of when certain ﬁxed point exponent/fraction bit widths are optimal for inputs with a particular standard deviation. We believe FP8 data types offer superior performance compared to the Int8 data type, but currently, neither GPUs nor TPUs support this data type. Outlier Features in Language Models. Large magnitude outlier features in language models have been studied before (Timkey and van Schijndel, 2021; Bondarenko et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2021). Previous work proved the theoretical relationship between outlier appearance in transformers and how it relates to layer normalization and the token frequency distribution (Gao et al., 2019). Similarly, Kovaleva et al. (2021) attribute the appearance of outliers in BERT model family to LayerNorm, and Puccetti et al. (2022) show empirically that outlier emergence is related to the frequency of tokens in the training distribution. We extend this work further by showing how the scale of autoregressive models relates to the emergent properties of these outlier features, and showing how appropriately modeling outliers is critical to effective quantization. Multi-billion Scale Transformer Quantization. There are two methods that were developed in parallel to ours: nuQmm (Park et al., 2022) and ZeroQuant (Yao et al., 2022). Both use the same quantization scheme: group-w2ise quantization, which has even ﬁner quantization normalization constant granularity than vector-wise quantization. This scheme offers higher quantization precision but also requires custom CUDA kernels. Both nuQmm and ZeroQuant aim to accelerate inference and reduce the memory footprint while we focus on preserving predictive performance under an 8-bit memory footprint. The largest models that nuQmm and ZeroQuant evaluate are 2.7B and 20B parameter transformers, respectively. ZeroQuant achieves zero-degradation performance for 8-bit quantization of a 20B model. We show that our method allows for zero-degradation quantization of models up to 176B parameters. Both nuQmm and ZeroQuant suggest that ﬁner quantization granularity can be an effective means to quantize large models. These methods are complementary with LLM.int8(). Another parallel work is GLM-130B which uses insights from our work to achieve zero-degradation 8-bit quantization (Zeng et al., 2022). GLM-130B performs full 16-bit precision matrix multiplication with 8-bit weight storage. 9 6 Discussion and Limitations We have demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that multi-billion parameter transformers can be quantized to Int8 and used immediately for inference without performance degradation. We achieve this by using our insights from analyzing emergent large magnitude features at scale to develop mixed-precision decomposition to isolate outlier features in a separate 16-bit matrix multiplication. In conjunction with vector-wise quantization that yields our method, LLM.int8(), which we show empirically can recover the full inference performance of models with up to 175B parameters. The main limitation of our work is that our analysis is solely on the Int8 data type, and we do not study 8-bit ﬂoating-point (FP8) data types. Since current GPUs and TPUs do not support this data type, we believe this is best left for future work. However, we also believe many insights from Int8 data types will directly translate to FP8 data types. Another limitation is that we only study models with up to 175B parameters. While we quantize a 175B model to Int8 without performance degradation, additional emergent properties might disrupt our quantization methods at larger scales. A third limitation is that we do not use Int8 multiplication for the attention function. Since our focus is on reducing the memory footprint and the attention function does not use any parameters, it was not strictly needed. However, an initial exploration of this problem indicated that a solution required additional quantization methods beyond those we developed here, and we leave this for future work. A ﬁnal limitation is that we focus on inference but do not study training or ﬁnetuning. We provide an initial analysis of Int8 ﬁnetuning and training at scale in Appendix E. Int8 training at scale requires complex trade-offs between quantization precision, training speed, and engineering complexity and represents a very difﬁcult problem. We again leave this to future work. Table 2: Different hardware setups and which methods can be run in 16-bit vs. 8-bit precision. We can see that our 8-bit method makes many models accessible that were not accessible before, in particular, OPT-175B/BLOOM.

This enables research and applications which were not possible before due to limited GPU memory, in particular for researchers with the least resources. See Table 3 for model/GPU combinations which are now accessible without performance degradation. However, our work also enables resource-rich organizations with many GPUs to serve more models on the same number of GPUs, which might increase the disparities between resource-rich and poor organizations. In particular, we believe that the public release of large pretrained models, for example, the recent Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) (Zhang et al., 2022), along with our new Int8 inference for zero- and few-shot prompting, will enable new research for academic institutions that was not possible before due to resource constraints. The widespread accessibility of such large-scale models will likely have both beneﬁcial and detrimental effects on society that are difﬁcult to predict.

We can see, that LLM.int8() allows to run the largest open source models OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B on a single node equipped with consumer-grade GPUs. Table 3: Different hardware setups and which methods can be run in 16-bit vs. 8-bit precision.

Versions of 8-bit BERT/RoBERTa include Q8BERT (Zafrir et al., 2019), QBERT (Shen et al., 2020), product quantization with quantization noise (Fan et al., 2020), TernaryBERT (Zhang et al., 2020), and BinaryBERT (Bai et al., 2021). Work by Zhao et al. (2021) performs both quantization and pruning. All these models require either quantization-aware ﬁnetuning or post-training quantization to make the model usable in low-precision. In contrast with our methods, the model can be used directly without performance degradation. If one views matrix multiplication as 1x1 convolution, vector-wise quantization is equivalent to channel-wise quantization for convolution combined with row quantization (Khudia et al., 2021). For matrix multiplication, this was used by Wu et al. (2020) for BERT-sized transformers (350M parameters), while we are the ﬁrst to study vector-wise quantization for autoregressive and large-scale models. The only other work that we are aware of that quantizes transformers other than BERT is Chen et al. (2020), which uses post-training quantization with zeropoint quantization in the forward pass and zeropoint-row-wise quantization in the backward pass. However, this work is still for sub-billion parameter transformers. We compare with both zeropoint and row-wise quantization in our evaluations and do not require post-training quantization. Low-bitwidth and Convolutional Network Quantization Work that uses less than 8-bits for data types is usually for convolutional networks (CNNs) to reduce their memory footprint and increase inference speed for mobile devices while minimizing model degradation. Methods for different bit-widths have been studied: 1-bit methods (Courbariaux and Bengio, 2016; Rastegari et al., 2016; Courbariaux et al., 2015), 2 to 3-bit (Zhu et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019), 4-bits (Li et al., 2019), more bits (Courbariaux et al., 2014), or a variable amount of bits (Gong et al., 2019). For additional related work, please see the survey of Qin et al. (2020). While we believe that lower than 8-bit width with some performance degradation is possible for billion-scale transformers, we focus on 8-bit transformers that do not degrade performance and that can beneﬁt from commonly used GPUs that accelerates inference through Int8 tensor cores. Another line of work that focuses on convolutional network quantization is to learn adjustments to the quantization procedure to improve quantization errors. For example, using Hessian information (Dong et al., 2019), step-size quantization (Esser et al., 2019), soft quantization (Gong et al., 2019), mixed- precision via linear programming optimization (Yao et al., 2021), and other learned quantization methods (Zhang et al., 2018; Gholami et al., 2021). 16 Table 4: Summary statistics of outliers with a magnitude of at least 6 that occur in at least 25% of all layers and at least 6% of all sequence dimensions. We can see that the lower the C4 validation perplexity, the more outliers are present. Outliers are usually one-sided, and their quartiles with maximum range show that the outlier magnitude is 3-20x larger than the largest magnitude of other feature dimensions, which usually have a range of [-3.5, 3.5]. With increasing scale, outliers become more and more common in all layers of the transformer, and they occur in almost all sequence dimensions. A phase transition occurs at 6.7B parameters when the same outlier occurs in all layers in the same feature dimension for about 75% of all sequence dimensions (SDim). Despite only making up about 0.1% of all features, the outliers are essential for large softmax probabilities. The mean top-1 softmax probability shrinks by about 20% if outliers are removed. Because the outliers have mostly asymmetric distributions across the sequence dimension s, these outlier dimensions disrupt symmetric absmax quantization and favor asymmetric zeropoint quantization. This explains the results in our validation perplexity analysis. These observations appear to be universal as they occur for models trained in different software frameworks (fairseq, OpenAI, Tensorﬂow-mesh), and they occur in different inference frameworks (fairseq, Hugging Face Transformers). These outliers also appear robust to slight variations of the transformer architecture (rotary embeddings, embedding norm, residual scaling, different initializations).

We provide the quartiles of the most common outlier in each transformer and the number of outliers that are one-sided, that is, which have asymmetric distributions which do not cross zero. D Inference Speedups and Slowdowns D.1 Matrix Multiplication benchmarks While our work focuses on memory efﬁciency to make models accessible, Int8 methods are also often used to accelerate inference. We ﬁnd that the quantization and decomposition overhead is signiﬁcant, and Int8 matrix multiplication itself only yields an advantage if the entire GPU is well saturated, which is only true for large matrix multiplication. This occurs only in LLMs with a model dimension of 4096 or larger. Detailed benchmarks of raw matrix multiplication and quantization overheads are seen in Table 5. We see that raw Int8 matrix multiplication in cuBLASLt begins to be two times faster than cuBLAS at a model size of 5140 (hidden size 20560). If inputs need to be quantized and outputs dequantized – a strict requirement if not the entire transformer is done in Int8 – then the speedups compared to 16-bit is reduced to 1.6x at a model size of 5140. Models with model size 2560 or smaller are slowed down. Adding mixed precision decomposition slows inference further so that only the 13B and 175B models have speedups. These numbers could be improved signiﬁcantly with optimized CUDA kernels for the mixed precision decomposition. However, we also see that existing custom CUDA kernels are much faster than when we use default PyTorch and NVIDIA-provided kernels for quantization which slow down all matrix multiplications except for a 175B model. 17 Table 5: Inference speedups compared to 16-bit matrix multiplication for the ﬁrst hidden layer in the feed-forward of differently sized GPT-3 transformers. The hidden dimension is 4x the model dimension. The 8-bit without overhead speedups assumes that no quantization or dequantization is performed. Numbers small than 1.0x represent slowdowns. Int8 matrix multiplication speeds up inference only for models with large model and hidden dimensions.

Hugging Face uses an optimized implementation with cached attention values. Since this type of inference is distributed and, as such, communication dependent, we expect the overall speedup and slowdown due to Int8 inference to be smaller since a large part of the overall inference runtime is the ﬁxed communication overhead. We benchmark vs. 16-bit and try settings that use a larger batch size or fewer GPUs in the case of Int8 inference, since we can ﬁt the larger model on fewer devices. We can see results for our benchmark in Table 6. Overall Int8 inference is slightly slower but close to the millisecond latency per token compared to 16-bit inference. Table 6: Ablation study on the number of GPUs used to run several types of inferences of BLOOM- 176B model. We compare the number of GPUs used by our quantized BLOOM-176B model together with the native BLOOM-176B model. We also report the per-token generation speed in milliseconds for different batch sizes. We use our method integrated into transformers(Wolf et al., 2019) powered by accelerate library from HuggingFace to deal with multi-GPU inference. Our method reaches a similar performance to the native model by ﬁtting into fewer GPUs than the native model.

We test separate settings for running the transformer with 8-bit feed-forward networks with and without 8-bit linear projections in the attention layer, as well at the attention iteself in 8-bit and compare against 32-bit performance. We test two tasks (1) language modeling on part of the RoBERTa corpus including Books (Zhu et al., 2015), CC-News (Nagel, 2016), OpenWebText (Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019), and CC-Stories (Trinh and Le, 2018); and (2) neural machine translation (NMT) (Ott et al., 2018) on WMT14+WMT16 (Macháˇcek and Bojar, 2014; Sennrich et al., 2016). The results are shown in Table 7 and Table 8. We can see that for training, using the attention linear projections with Int8 data types and vector-wise quantization leads to degradation for NMT and for 1.1B language model but not for 209M language modeling. The results improve slightly if mixed-precision decomposition is used but is not sufﬁcient to recover full performance in most cases. These suggests that training with 8-bit FFN layers is straightforward while other layers require 18 additional techniques or different data types than Int8 to do 8-bit training at scale without performance degradation. Table 7: Initial results on small and large-scale language modeling. Doing attention in 8-bit severely degrades performance and performance cannot fully recovered with mixed-precision decomposition. While small-scale language models is close to baseline performance for both 8-bit FFN and 8-bit linear projects in the attention layers performance degrades at the large scale.

We run two different setups: (1) we compare with other Int8 methods, and (2) we compare degradation of ﬁnetuning with 8-bit FFN layers as well as 8-bit attention projection layers comparel to 32-bit. We ﬁnetune with 5 random seeds and report median performance. Table 9 compares with different previous 8-bit methods for ﬁnetuning and shows that vector-wise quantization improves on other methods. Table 10 shows the performance of FFN and/or linear attention projections in 8-bit as well as improvements if mixed-precision decomposition is used. We ﬁnd that 8-bit FFN layers lead to no degradation while 8-bit attention linear projections lead to degradation if not combined with mixed-precision decomposition where at least the top 2% magnitude dimensions are computed in 16-bit instead of 8-bit. These results highlight the critical role of mixed-precision decomposition for ﬁnetuning if one wants to not degrade performance.

Here's how you can approach this: # Step 1: Potentiometer Replacement To replace the SMD potentiometer with a DIP type potentiometer, you must ensure that the new potentiometer has the same resistance value and similar or better power ratings as the old one. You will need to desolder the SMD potentiometer from the board and solder wires to the pads where it was connected. Then, connect these wires to your DIP potentiometer. # Step 2: Reading Potentiometer Values The voltage across the potentiometer gives you the light intensity level which is controlled by the LM3433's ADJ pin. To read this value with your ATmega328, you should set up one of its analog pins as an input and connect it to the wiper (middle terminal) of your DIP potentiometer. Make sure that this connection is done safely, avoiding any interference with the original circuitry and keeping in mind that the voltage levels match the acceptable input range for the ATmega328's ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). # Step 3: Dividing the Range Once you have the potentiometer's voltage signal coming into the ATmega328, use its ADC to read the voltage level and convert it into a digital value. You can then write a program to divide this range into three equal parts corresponding to your low, medium, and high intensity levels. For a 10-bit ADC (like the one in the ATmega328), the values will typically range from 0 to 1023, so you can set thresholds; for example, 0-341 for low, 342-682 for medium, and 683-1023 for high. # Step 4: Lighting Up LEDs You will need three GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins set as outputs on your ATmega328 to control your three indicator LEDs. You can add current-limiting resistors to each LED to prevent them from burning out. Based on the range in which the potentiometer's value falls, use your program to light up the corresponding LED(s). # Step 5: Powering the ATmega328 You mentioned you want to give a separate 5V to your ATmega328. You can use a small 5V voltage regulator (if the board's supply doesn't have an extra 5V available for you), or you can tap into the onboard 5V from the LM5002 if it has sufficient spare capacity to feed both the control circuitry and the ATmega328. # Sample Code Snippet (for ATmega328) Here is a sample code snippet in Arduino-compatible pseudo-code that might help you to start: \`\`\`cpp const int POT_PIN = A0; // Replace with the actual ADC input pin const int LED_LOW_PIN = 2; // Replace with the actual GPIO output pins const int LED_MED_PIN = 3; const int LED_HIGH_PIN = 4; void setup() { pinMode(POT_PIN, INPUT); pinMode(LED_LOW_PIN, OUTPUT); pinMode(LED_MED_PIN, OUTPUT); pinMode(LED_HIGH_PIN, OUTPUT); } void loop() { int potValue = analogRead(POT_PIN); // Read potentiometer value // Turn off all LEDs first digitalWrite(LED_LOW_PIN, LOW); digitalWrite(LED_MED_PIN, LOW); digitalWrite(LED_HIGH_PIN, LOW); // Determine and light up the corresponding LED if (potValue <= 341) { digitalWrite(LED_LOW_PIN, HIGH); } else if (potValue <= 682) { digitalWrite(LED_MED_PIN, HIGH); } else { digitalWrite(LED_HIGH_PIN, HIGH); } // Use a delay for debouncing if necessary delay(100); } \`\`\` # Things to Keep in Mind: - When working with high-power circuits, safety is crucial. Always power down the circuit and discharge any capacitors before soldering or modifying it. - Be careful not to accidentally create shorts or overload any part of the existing circuit when adding your new components. - The resistances, power ratings, and voltage compatibility should be carefully matched to avoid damaging the circuit or the controller. - Make sure to use proper ESD precautions when handling electronic components, especially CMOS devices like the ATmega328. - The sample code provided is a basic guideline. You will likely need to refine the code and adapt it to your specific setup, especially if you want to achieve more nuanced control or add additional features. Implementing this project will require a moderate amount of electronics knowledge as well as familiarity with microcontroller programming. If you feel uncertain about any steps or require further assistance, visiting a dedicated electronics forum or consulting with a professional may be beneficial."},{"instruction":"write me a code to read the potentiometer value from pin A0 of arduino uno","output":"To read the potentiometer value from pin A0 on an Arduino Uno, you can use the \`analogRead\` function provided by the Arduino framework.

If the Arduino Serial Monitor only reads values in a 200 range (for example, only between 0 and 200 when you expect 0 to 1023), there are several potential causes that are not directly related to the code: 1. **Potentiometer Issues**: The potentiometer may not have a full 0 to 10K Ohm sweep or it could be damaged. 2. **Wiring Issues**: The wiring might be incorrect. Ensure that one side of the potentiometer is connected to GND, the other side to 5V, and the wiper (middle pin) to A0. 3. **Poor Contact/Connection**: There could be a bad connection at the wiper or a solder joint could be poor, causing resistance changes. 4. **Voltage Reference Problems**: The default voltage reference for analogRead is the Arduino 5V supply (AVCC). If this supply is noisy or if there is a drop in voltage due to poor supply or load, that will reflect on the ADC readings. 5. **Incorrect Potentiometer Value**: The potentiometer might not be 10K Ohms as expected. Verify its value with a multimeter. 6. **ADC Resolution or Malfunction**: It's possible (though less likely) that the ADC on the Arduino is not functioning correctly. Here are some troubleshooting steps: - **Check the Potentiometer**: Confirm that the potentiometer has a full resistance sweep using a multimeter. Test from end to end and wiper to end to confirm it's operating normally. - **Check the Connections**: Ensure the potentiometer is wired correctly, with the ends to 5V and GND and the wiper to A0. - **Test with a Fixed Voltage**: Instead of the potentiometer, try applying a known stable voltage (e.g., from a voltage divider or a battery) to pin A0 and see if the readings are as expected. - **Use a Different Pin**: Try a different analog pin in case there is an issue with pin A0. - **Check Power Supply**: Verify that the Arduino's 5V supply is stable and clean. If after checking all these points the problem persists, try using a simple sketch that just reads a fixed voltage and see if the reading is stable and accurate. If it is not, the problem may lie within the Arduino Uno board itself."},{"instruction":"write me a code to read the potentiometer value in my board with A5 pin in Arduino uno","output":"Certainly!

Test me as medical student in thyroid surgery through a case scenario","output":"Alright, let's begin with a case scenario for a thyroid surgery. I will walk you through the scenario step by step, and at each stage, I'll ask you questions relevant to the situation. Your task is to provide medically sound responses based on your studies and understanding. Ready? Let’s begin. Case Scenario: A 34-year-old woman presents with a 2 cm solitary, non-tender nodule on the right lobe of her thyroid gland. She reports a history of rapid growth over the past 3 months and some difficulty swallowing. There’s no history of radiation exposure, and she's otherwise healthy. Her family history is unremarkable for endocrine diseases. On examination, the nodule is firm, and there are no palpable lymph nodes. Thyroid function tests are within normal limits. An ultrasound confirms the presence of a solid, hypoechoic nodule with microcalcifications without cervical lymphadenopathy. Question 1: Based on this presentation, what is your differential diagnosis, and why? Question 2: Given the patient's presentation and ultrasound findings, what would be the next best step in the management of this patient? Question 3: The fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) returns as Bethesda Category IV: Follicular neoplasm or suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. How will this result affect your management plan? Question 4: The patient is scheduled for surgery. Describe the surgical procedure you would recommend, including any preoperative preparations and the rationale behind choosing this procedure. Question 5: During the surgery, you identify what appears to be a parathyroid gland adherent to the posterior surface of the thyroid. How will you proceed, and what steps will you take to preserve parathyroid function? Provide thorough and considered answers to each of these questions to demonstrate your understanding of thyroid pathology and surgical management."},{"instruction":"1.Malignant nodule (papillary follicular, medullary, anaplastic). Because presence of dysphagia and hypoechoic with microcalcification. And she is euthyroid . Us findings rule out bengin condition","output":"Your consideration for malignancy is appropriate given the features you've identified. Hypoechoic nodules with microcalcifications, a rapid increase in size, and symptoms such as difficulty swallowing are indeed suspicious for malignancy. The euthyroid status doesn't necessarily rule out a malignancy either, as many thyroid cancers do not affect thyroid function until late in the disease. While your differential includes the main types of thyroid malignancies, remember also to consider benign possibilities in your differential diagnosis, which may include: - Follicular adenoma: A benign but solitary follicular nodule that can look similar to malignant nodules. It’s essential to distinguish this from follicular carcinoma. - Colloid nodules: These are benign and often result in a \\"spongiform\\" appearance on ultrasound but can sometimes present as a solid nodule. - Hashimoto's thyroiditis: A common cause of a goiter or nodules, often associated with hypothyroidism, but can occasionally appear as a solitary nodule. - Subacute thyroiditis (De Quervain's): Rarely, this can present with a nodular swelling, though it’s typically painful and associated with systemic symptoms. Now, let's proceed to your response to the second question."},{"instruction":"Remend me of 2nd question","output":"Certainly, the second question was: Given the patient's presentation and ultrasound findings, what would be the next best step in the management of this patient?"},{"instruction":"Fine needle aspiration, thyroid scan.","output":"Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is indeed the next best step. It is a minimally invasive procedure to obtain a cytological sample from the thyroid nodule, which helps distinguish between benign and malignant nodules, guiding further management. Since the thyroid function tests are normal and the ultrasound showed suspicious characteristics like hypoechoic nature and microcalcifications, FNAC is warranted for definitive cytology. A thyroid scan, typically involving a radionuclide such as technetium-99m or iodine-123, is generally used to assess the functional status of the thyroid tissue, categorizing nodules as \\"hot\\" (functioning) or \\"cold\\" (non-functioning). Cold nodules have a higher risk for malignancy. However, given the ultrasound features suggestive of malignancy in this patient, many clinicians would proceed directly to FNAC since it provides more definitive cytologic information, regardless of nodule function. In this case, the thyroid scan might not add significant diagnostic value but can occasionally be used where FNAC results are inconclusive or to plan the extent of surgery in certain differentiated thyroid cancers. Now let's discuss your response to the third question regarding the Bethesda Category IV result from FNAC."},{"instruction":"3.Hemithyroidectomy and send the for pathalogical examination. According to the results if follicular adenoma just follow up. If follicular carcinoma then do total thyroidectomy and give l-thyroxine for lifetime","output":"Your approach is sound. A Bethesda Category IV lesion has a 15-30% risk of malignancy, and surgical excision is recommended because cytology cannot distinguish between benign follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma. The initial surgical management with a hemithyroidectomy (also known as lobectomy) is appropriate, as it allows for definitive histopathological examination of the thyroid tissue. During this procedure, the involved lobe of the thyroid and the isthmus are removed, while preserving the contralateral lobe and its function. If pathology confirms a follicular adenoma, which is benign, the patient may be followed up clinically without further surgical intervention. However, if the nodule is a follicular carcinoma, additional treatment will be necessary. In cases of follicular carcinoma, a completion thyroidectomy, which is a removal of the remaining thyroid tissue, may be necessary for several reasons: - To increase the efficacy of radioactive iodine ablation, if needed, by removing all thyroid tissue that could take up iodine. - To facilitate follow-up with thyroglobulin levels as a tumor marker. - To ensure removal of any potential multifocal disease. Following total thyroidectomy, the patient will require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine. The goal of levothyroxine therapy post-thyroidectomy for cancer is not only to replace the thyroxine but also to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to lower the risk of recurrent disease. Let's discuss the surgical procedure you would recommend further in response to the fourth question."},{"instruction":"Write fourth question","output":"Certainly. The fourth question is: Question 4: The patient is scheduled for surgery. Describe the surgical procedure you would recommend, including any preoperative preparations and the rationale behind choosing this procedure."},{"instruction":"Totall thyroidectomy with or without block neck dissection. Preoperative operation preparation include giving patient legols iodine , improve general condition,","output":"Total thyroidectomy is an appropriate surgical procedure in cases where malignancy is confirmed or highly suspected, especially for larger nodules, those with aggressive features, or if there is evidence of thyroid cancer. However, in this scenario with a Bethesda Category IV lesion, as previously discussed, an initial hemithyroidectomy is typically the first step for these indeterminate nodules. A total thyroidectomy may be required if pathology confirms malignancy, as also previously discussed. Block neck dissection (central compartment node dissection) might not be indicated at this point because there is no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy on ultrasound, and it would not be part of the initial surgery unless metastasis is confirmed preoperatively or intraoperatively. It could be considered if during surgery, suspicious lymph nodes are identified. As for preoperative preparations: - Lugol's iodine is used preoperatively to reduce thyroid vascularity in cases of hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease, making surgical dissection easier and reducing intraoperative blood loss. However, for euthyroid patients with non-toxic nodules, this may not be necessary. - The general condition of the patient should be optimized, including control of any comorbid conditions, ensuring adequate nutrition, and addressing any bleeding disorders. - Patients should be informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure, including possible complications like hypocalcemia from inadvertent injury to the parathyroid glands, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury causing hoarseness or voice changes. - Consent should be obtained after discussing these possible complications and the potential need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy if a total thyroidectomy is performed. - Voice assessment preoperatively, with either direct laryngoscopy or another suitable method, is beneficial to document baseline vocal cord function. - Ensure that relevant imaging studies and biopsy results are reviewed and available. In cases of well-differentiated thyroid cancers, a preoperative ultrasound of the neck is important to assess the cervical lymph nodes for potential metastatic involvement, which would alter the surgical plan to include therapeutic lymph node dissection. To summarize, for this patient, the decision to proceed with total thyroidectomy should be dependent on intraoperative findings and final histopathological diagnosis. The surgery should be carried out with careful preparation, attention to detail, and informed patient consent."},{"instruction":"Now give me a grade from 100","output":"As a virtual surgery professor, I can provide feedback on the answers you've given: You showed awareness of the appropriate diagnostic steps including the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) to further investigate the thyroid nodule, which is essential for the management of thyroid nodules. When prompted, you demonstrated knowledge on the appropriate surgical management of a Bethesda Category IV thyroid nodule with the initial step of a hemithyroidectomy to allow for definitive histopathological diagnosis. You recognized the necessity for total thyroidectomy in the case of a confirmed follicular carcinoma and understood the importance of postoperative thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. Regarding preoperative preparations, while you mentioned optimizing the general condition of the patient, which is crucial, some of your points were not completely aligned with the scenario presented (e.g., use of Lugol's iodine is not standard for euthyroid patients with non-toxic nodules).

One question at a time","output":"Certainly, let's start with a multiple-choice question related to thyroid surgery: Question 1: Which of the following serum markers is most useful for monitoring recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma post-thyroidectomy? A) Thyroglobulin B) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) C) Calcitonin D) Free triiodothyronine (T3) E) Free thyroxine (T4) Please select the correct answer."},{"instruction":"A","output":"Correct! Answer A) Thyroglobulin is the most useful serum marker for monitoring recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma post-thyroidectomy. Thyroglobulin is a protein produced by normal thyroid tissue and most differentiated thyroid cancers, including papillary and follicular carcinoma. After total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation (if performed), the thyroglobulin levels should be very low or undetectable. A rise in thyroglobulin levels could indicate recurrent or metastatic disease. Let's move on to the next question: Question 2: What is the main function of the parathyroid glands? A) Regulation of blood glucose levels B) Regulation of blood calcium levels C) Stimulation of thyroid hormone production D) Regulation of blood pressure E) Stimulation of red blood cell production Please select the correct answer."},{"instruction":"B. Please make mcqs harder","output":"Correct again! Answer B) Regulation of blood calcium levels is indeed the main function of the parathyroid glands. They secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases blood calcium levels by promoting calcium release from bone, increasing calcium absorption in the intestines, and reducing calcium loss through the kidneys. Alright, let's increase the difficulty with the following question: Question 3: A 45-year-old female undergoes thyroidectomy for a papillary thyroid carcinoma. Postoperatively, she complains of numbness around her lips and tingling in her hands and feet. Her bloodwork shows a serum calcium level of 7.2 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms? A) Thyroid storm B) Hypoparathyroidism C) Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury D) Hypercalcemia E) Hemorrhage causing tracheal compression Please select the correct answer."},{"instruction":"B","output":"Correct, answer B) Hypoparathyroidism is the most likely cause of her symptoms. The low serum calcium level (normal range is typically 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL) along with clinical symptoms such as numbness around the lips and tingling in hands and feet suggest hypocalcemia, which is a common complication after thyroid surgery due to inadvertent damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. Treatment typically involves calcium supplementation and sometimes vitamin D analogs to restore calcium levels. Question 4: A 55-year-old man with a history of total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer presents with a new 2 cm firm, non-tender mass in the left lateral neck that moves with swallowing. Ultrasound imaging of the neck shows a nodule at the site of the mass with suspicious features. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

A) Persistent hoarseness and a bovine cough B) Inability to generate a high-pitched voice C) Severe hypoparathyroidism requiring calcium replacement D) Dysphagia for solids but not for liquids E) Complete loss of voice Please select the correct answer."},{"instruction":"B","output":"Correct, answer B) Inability to generate a high-pitched voice is the most likely complication resulting from an injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN). The EBSLN innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for tension and elongation of the vocal cords. Its injury can lead to difficulty with the production of high-pitched sounds and may also affect voice projection and fatigue, while the more common symptom of persistent hoarseness is typically associated with recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Let's continue with another challenging question: Question: A 30-year-old woman with a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which was resected 2 years ago, presents for follow-up. She has no evidence of structural disease on imaging, but her calcitonin levels have been slowly rising on consecutive measurements every 6 months. Genetic testing for RET mutations had been negative at the time of her initial diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

There are several AI-based tools and applications designed to simulate the look of various film stocks, grain patterns, and color palettes associated with analog photography. Here are some ways to achieve a film look using AI technology: 1. **AI Photo Editing Software**: Some photo editing software now incorporates AI to improve the editing process. Programs like Adobe Lightroom and Skylum Luminar have built-in presets and editing capabilities powered by AI that can mimic the look of film photography. 2. **AI-Powered Mobile Apps**: There are numerous mobile apps that apply AI technology to transform the aesthetic of digital images. Apps like VSCO and Afterlight offer filters and tools that can replicate the look of analog film. 3. **AI Style Transfer**: Tools like DeepArt and Prisma use AI algorithms such as neural style transfer allowing users to apply the style of one image (e.g., a classic film look) to another image. 4. **Custom Presets and LUTs (Look Up Tables)**: Some photo and video editors use AI to create custom presets or LUTs that can provide a consistent film-like look across various images or footage. 5. **Machine Learning Platforms**: Advanced users with technical capabilities might train custom machine learning models on datasets of film images to learn the distinctive styles and apply them to digital photos. When using these tools, you can often adjust specific parameters such as grain intensity, color grading, contrast, and more to fine-tune the desired film effect. Remember that achieving a convincing film look is not only about applying filters but also about understanding the characteristics of film photography and trying to replicate aspects such as lighting, exposure, and composition to enhance the authenticity of the digital-to-film conversion."},{"instruction":"What is the best tool to make digital photos look like Kodak Portra 400?","output":"Kodak Portra 400 is known for its fine grain, excellent skin tones, and natural color reproduction, making it a favorite among portrait and wedding photographers. To emulate the look of Kodak Portra 400 on digital photos, you would typically look for editing software with presets that mimic this specific film stock, or you could manually adjust settings to resemble its characteristics. Here are some tools and methods popular among photographers for achieving the Portra 400 look: 1. **Adobe Lightroom & Photoshop**: Adobe's software offers a range of presets and the capacity to create custom presets. You can also purchase presets from third-party creators that closely mimic the Kodak Portra 400 look. In addition, the Camera Raw filter in Photoshop has options to tweak the color profile to resemble various film stocks. 2. **VSCO**: The VSCO app and presets for desktop editors are well-known for their film emulation capabilities. They offer specific presets that are designed to mimic the look of Kodak Portra 400. 3. **RNI Films**: Really Nice Images (RNI) offers a plugin for Lightroom with a set of film presets, including ones designed to replicate Kodak film stocks like Portra 400. 4. **Mastin Labs**: Mastin Labs specializes in creating presets for Lightroom and Photoshop that closely mimic the look of real film, with a Kodak Portra pack available. 5. **Alien Skin Exposure X**: Now known as Exposure Software, this program offers film emulation presets, including ones for Portra 400, along with a robust set of editing tools for fine-tuning. 6. **Capture One**: Capture One Pro also provides film simulations through styles and presets, some of which are aimed at reproducing the look of Portra 400. To achieve the best results, you may need to do some manual adjustments even after applying presets, such as softening the contrast, altering the color balance for skin tones, reducing digital sharpness, and perhaps adding a subtle grain overlay to emulate the film texture. Also, consider the lighting conditions and dynamic range of the original photo, as film has distinct characteristics in different contexts. Note that third-party presets for Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and other editing software may come at an additional cost, and the results can vary based on the quality of the presets and how well they are applied to your original photos."},{"instruction":"What is the all time mickey mouse selling memorabillia?","output":"The most valuable and sought-after piece of Mickey Mouse memorabilia ever sold is likely \\"Mickey Mouse\\" by Damien Hirst, a household name in contemporary art. This piece was auctioned at Christie's in London in February 2014 and sold for a staggering £902,500 (about 1.5 million at the time). While not a traditional piece of Disney merchandise, Hirst's \\"Mickey Mouse\\" is a 3-foot-tall silkscreen print with diamond dust. However, when it comes to traditional Disney memorabilia, one notable sale includes an original film sales kit for the 1928 cartoon \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" which features one of the first appearances of Mickey Mouse. The item fetched 35,850 at an auction. Another significant item is the original 1930s Charlotte Clark Mickey Mouse doll. These dolls are considered the first Mickey Mouse plush ever produced. Depending on the condition and provenance, they can sell for several thousands of dollars. Moreover, vintage Mickey Mouse watches have also become collectible items. An original Mickey Mouse watch from the 1930s by Ingersoll can fetch a high price among collectors if it's in good working condition. This watch introduced Mickey Mouse to the timepiece world and was a significant factor in the financial saving of the Ingersoll-Waterbury watch company during the Great Depression. Collectibles' values can fluctuate based on their condition, rarity, historical importance, and the market's interest at the time of the sale. Disneyana (collectibles related to Disney characters) can command high prices at auctions, particularly items dating back to the early days of Mickey Mouse and those with a significant place in Disney history."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Mickey Mouse is an iconic character created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks in 1928, and he remains one of the most recognized and beloved cartoon characters in the world. The enduring appeal of Mickey Mouse has led to a vast array of merchandise, including T-shirts, which are sold at Disney theme parks, Disney Stores, online platforms like shopDisney, and through other retailers that carry licensed Disney merchandise. Mickey Mouse T-shirts come in many styles, designs, and sizes, catering to different tastes and preferences. They are bought not only as casual wear but also as souvenirs, gifts, and for special occasions such as birthdays, family trips, themed parties, or Disney vacations. Disney continuously releases new apparel collections that often include Mickey Mouse-themed items, ensuring that the character remains fashionable and relevant. Additionally, Mickey Mouse T-shirts and other merchandise are sometimes created in collaboration with famous designers or brands, keeping the products trendy and appealing to those who follow fashion closely."},{"instruction":"When does the mickey mouse copy right end?","output":"The copyright status of Mickey Mouse is a complex issue tied to multiple pieces of legislation and specific works. Currently, the iconic character's earliest appearances, specifically in \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" which was released on November 18, 1928, are expected to enter the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2024, assuming no further changes to copyright law are made that would affect this. \\"Steamboat Willie\\" is significant because it was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon to be widely distributed and is often mistakenly thought to be his first appearance. The actual first appearances, which were silent films titled \\"Plane Crazy\\" and \\"The Gallopin' Gaucho,\\" were released later in the year after \\"Steamboat Willie\\" introduced Mickey Mouse with synchronized sound, which helped propel his popularity. The copyright for most characters, including Mickey Mouse, was originally set for a term of 56 years under the Copyright Act of 1909. However, the law has gone through multiple changes. The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, often referred to as the \\"Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,\\" extended the term of copyrights to life of the author plus 70 years for individual works, and 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation (whichever is shorter) for corporate works. Since Mickey Mouse's debut was a corporate creation by Walt Disney Company, the 95 years from publication date makes 2023 the 95th year since \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" which sets the stage for Mickey Mouse's earliest incarnation to enter the public domain on January 1, 2024. It's important to note that while his initial appearance may become public domain, many other aspects of Mickey Mouse's portrayal, including later versions, trademarked images, and distinctive elements of the character, are still protected by copyright and trademarks owned by Disney. Therefore, the character of Mickey Mouse as he is widely recognized today remains a protected intellectual property of Disney, limiting the use of the character's likeness for commercial purposes."},{"instruction":"Abraxos dans l’autocollant de fleurs | Trône de verre inspiré","output":"Abraxos est un personnage de la série de livres \\"Throne of Glass\\" (Trône de verre en français) écrite par Sarah J. Maas. Dans l'histoire, Abraxos est un wyvern (une créature semblable à un dragon) qui crée un lien avec l'une des protagonistes, Manon Blackbeak. L'expression \\"Abraxos dans l’autocollant de fleurs | Trône de verre inspiré\\" pourrait se référer à un produit dérivé inspiré de la série, possiblement un autocollant (sticker) représentant le wyvern Abraxos entouré de fleurs ou dans un design floral. Ce genre d'article peut être populaire parmi les fans de la série qui voudraient personnaliser leurs objets personnels avec des motifs inspirés de leurs personnages préférés. L'image d'Abraxos entouré de fleurs peut sembler à première vue contradictoire, car les wyverns sont généralement associés à des images de puissance et de destruction, tandis que les fleurs sont souvent représentatives de la beauté et de la délicatesse. Il y a de fortes chances que des autocollants comme celui-ci soient disponibles sur des plateformes en ligne spécialisées dans les produits personnalisés ou les marchandises pour fans.

Исходя из контекста, это может означать фактическое изменение хода времени (например, окончание года и начало нового), или это может быть способом сказать о том, что прошедший год был очень непростым или полным неожиданных событий. Таким образом, если это выражение относится к хронологическому процессу, то фразу можно понять как \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд прошли, закручиваясь\\", что может иметь в виду окончание очередного года или его кардинальные изменения. Если речь идёт о более образном или переносном значении, то можно понять это как \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд прошли как бы в суматохе/сумасшествии\\", подразумевая возможно суматошный или полный стрессов период."},{"instruction":"Мне нужно чтобы эта фраза значила \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд ушли за поворот. \\"","output":"Если ваша цель состоит в том, чтобы выразить мысль \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд ушли за поворот\\" в английском языке, вы можете переформулировать исходную фразу для большей ясности, так как буквальный перевод может не передать полностью замысел. Например, можно сказать: - \\"Twelve consecutive months have passed by.\\" - \\"A full year has slipped away.\\" Эти предложения отражают идею, что период в двенадцать месяцев прошел, возможно, незаметно или быстро. Если важно подчеркнуть момент изменения направления или исчезновения времени за неким символическим моментом ('за поворотом'), можно также использовать следующие варианты: - \\"Twelve consecutive months have turned the corner.\\" - \\"A year has gone around the corner.\\" \\"Turned the corner\\" и \\"gone around the corner\\" являются более буквальными переводами и могут передать идею об исчезновении прошедшего времени, как будто оно скрылось из виду за поворотом."},{"instruction":"Как сказать \\"Снежный лист\\" (метафора)","output":"Снежный лист как метафора может переводиться по-разному в зависимости от того, что конкретно вы хотите подчеркнуть этой метафорой. Если речь идет о чем-то красивом, но хрупком и кратковременном, то можно использовать следующие английские выражения: - \\"Snow leaf\\" — буквальный перевод; подходит, если в контексте понятно, что речь идет о метафоре. - \\"Snowflake leaf\\" — играет на схожести терминов \\"snowflake\\" (снежинка) и \\"leaf\\" (лист), подчеркивая уникальность и непостоянство объекта метафоры. При использовании метафор важно объяснить их значение, если контекст не делает его очевидным, так как буквальный перевод может не всегда носить тот же смысл в английском языке."},{"instruction":"leaf это лист бумаги?","output":"В английском языке слово \\"leaf\\" можно использовать в двух основных значениях: 1. Leaf (лист дерева) - это плоская, зеленая структура, которая вырастает на ветке дерева или куста и необходима для процесса фотосинтеза. 2. Leaf (лист бумаги) - это один лист бумаги, особенно когда он является частью книги или тетради. В этом контексте иногда используется также слово \\"page\\" (страница). Если ваша метафора \\"снежный лист\\" относится к листу бумаги, который напоминает снег по своей белизне или хрупкости, то буквальный перевод будет \\"snow leaf\\" или \\"snowy leaf\\". Однако нужно иметь в виду, что в английском языке эта метафора может оказаться неочевидной и потребует дополнительного объяснения для понимания."},{"instruction":"Как по английски сказать похвалу \\"какие молодцы!\\"","output":"Для выражения похвалы \\"какие молодцы!\\" в английском языке нет прямого эквивалента слову \\"молодцы\\", но есть множество других вариантов для этого. Некоторые из них: - Good job! - Well done! - Great work! - Nice going! - You did really well! - Excellent work! - Bravo! - Keep it up! - That's the way to do it! - Fantastic! Выбор конкретного выражения может зависеть от контекста и того, какой уровень неформальности или энтузиазма вы хотите передать."},{"instruction":"А \\"what fine fellows\\"?","output":"Выражение \\"What fine fellows!\\" действительно является комплиментом и может передать любование или одобрение. Оно звучит довольно формально и слегка устаревшим, так как слово \\"fellows\\" чаще использовалось в старом английском. Сейчас это слово может употребляться реже в повседневной речи, но вполне подходит в некоторых контекстах, особенно если вы хотите подчеркнуть дружескую или мужскую солидарность группы людей. В зависимости от ситуации, это может быть переведено как \\"Какие молодцы!\\" или \\"Какие замечательные ребята!\\". В любом случае, такое выражение определенно является похвалой."},{"instruction":"В чём разница между \\"He-he, we will make it out of snow.\\" и \\"Hehe, we're making it out of snow.\\"","output":"Два предложения, \\"He-he, we will make it out of snow.\\" и \\"Hehe, we're making it out of snow.\\" различаются по времени глагола, что влияет на значение предложений: 1. \\"He-he, we will make it out of snow.\\" Это предложение выражает намерение или план на будущее. Использование времени будущего простого (will make) указывает на то, что действие по созданию объекта из снега планируется, но еще не началось. \\"He-he\\" в начале предложения выражает легкость или забаву. 2. \\"Hehe, we're making it out of snow.\\" Здесь говорится о действии, происходящем в настоящий момент. Прогрессивная форма настоящего времени (we're making) показывает, что процесс создания объекта из снега уже идет. \\"Hehe\\" также передает легкость или радость от процесса. Поэтому главная разница между предложениями заключается в том, когда происходит действие: первое говорит о будущем, второе — о настоящем."},{"instruction":"Как по английски спросить \\"Успел?\\"","output":"В английском языке вопрос \\"Успел?\\" можно перевести различными способами в зависимости от контекста. Несколько примеров: 1. \\"Did you make it on time?\\" – это наиболее близкий перевод и подходит в ситуации, когда вы хотите узнать, успел ли человек к какому-то событию или встрече вовремя. 2. \\"Did you finish in time?\\" – этот вариант лучше использовать, если интересуете, успел ли собеседник завершить какое-либо дело до определенного момента времени. 3. \\"Were you able to make it?\\" – подразумевает вопрос о том, успел ли человек прибыть куда-то или сделать что-то. 4. \\"Did you manage to make it?\\" – схож с предыдущим вопросом, но с более явным акцентом на личных усилиях в преодолении возможных трудностей. 5. \\"Have you made it?\\" – этот вариант может использоваться, если вы подразумеваете, что действие должно было завершиться в прошлом, и интересуетесь результатом. Выбор наиболее подходящего выражения зависит от контекста разговора и от того, что именно вы хотите уточнить."},{"instruction":"А более короче?","output":"Если вам нужен более короткий и прямой вариант спросить \\"Успел?\\" по-английски, вы можете использовать следующие фразы: 1. \\"On time?\\" 2. \\"Made it?\\" 3. \\"In time?\\" Эти варианты очень краткие и используются обычно в неформальном общении, когда уже понятен контекст вопроса."},{"instruction":"Так как диалог перевести: - Успел? - Пока нет.","output":"Для перевода такого диалога на английский язык можно использовать следующие варианты: - Made it? - Not yet. Этот короткий и простой обмен фразами подходит для неформального общения. \\"Made it?\\" это краткий вариант вопроса \\"Did you make it?\\" который подразумевает успех в достижении чего-то, например прибытие вовремя или завершение задачи. Ответ \\"Not yet.\\" означает, что человек еще не достиг желаемого результата."},{"instruction":"В чем разница между \\"The old year is going away\\" и \\"The old year is leaving.\\"","output":"Оба предложения, \\"The old year is going away\\" и \\"The old year is leaving,\\" обозначают процесс завершения или ухода уходящего года, но есть небольшие нюансы в их использовании и звучании. 1. \\"The old year is going away\\" - это фраза, которая носит более поэтический или образный характер. \\"Going away\\" может вызывать ассоциации с чем-то, что исчезает постепенно и быть может несколько эмоционально окрашенным. 2. \\"The old year is leaving\\" - эта фраза кажется более прямой и конкретной. \\"Leaving\\" подразумевает действие ухода, оно может быть воспринято как более окончательное и менее плавное по сравнению с \\"going away\\". Оба предложения грамматически правильны и могут быть использованы для выражения того же самого отношения к концу года, но выбор между ними может зависеть от желаемого стиля или эмоционального подтекста, которые автор хочет передать."},{"instruction":"В чём разница \\"It's a pity\\" и \\"It’s a shame\\"","output":"Выражения \\"It's a pity\\" и \\"It’s a shame\\" оба используются для выражения сожаления или разочарования по поводу какой-либо ситуации, но могут несколько отличаться по своему эмоциональному оттенку и контексту использования. \\"It's a pity\\" — это фраза, которая обычно выражает сожаление по поводу потерянной возможности или нежелательного события. Она немного более формальна и в некотором роде может звучать более сдержанно. \\"It’s a shame\\" — эта фраза также указывает на сожаление или упущенную возможность, однако может нести в себе более сильный оттенок разочарования или даже осуждения, в зависимости от контекста. Варьирование использования может зависеть от личных предпочтений или региональных особенностей английского языка. В общем, эти выражения взаимозаменяемы и любое из них может использоваться для выражения сожаления в большинстве ситуаций."},{"instruction":"В чём разница \\"It is a pity that it is impossible to repeat the outgoing year from us.\\" и \\"It’s a pity, it’s impossible to repeat the year that’s already going away us.\\"","output":"Оба предложения пытаются выразить сожаление о том, что уходящий год нельзя повторить. Однако есть некоторые существенные различия в формулировке и плавности английского языка. 1. \\"It is a pity that it is impossible to repeat the outgoing year from us.\\" – Это предложение кажется несколько неправильно сформулированным с точки зрения грамматики и естественного употребления английского языка. Фраза \\"from us\\" здесь не имеет смысла и не используется в английском в данном контексте. 2. \\"It’s a pity, it’s impossible to repeat the year that’s already going away us.\\" – Это предложение также имеет проблемы с грамматикой и естественностью языка. Фраза \\"going away us\\" некорректна, и слово \\"us\\" в этом случае является лишним. Корректной и плавной английской фразой, которая передает эту мысль, могла бы быть, например: \\"It's a pity that we can't repeat the year that's already coming to an end.\\" или \\"It’s a shame that the year which is ending cannot be relived.\\" В этих предложениях нет лишних слов и они строятся так, как это принято в английском языке."},{"instruction":"Как сказать по английски \\"Жаль, невозможно повторить от нас уже уходящий год.\\"?","output":"На английском это предложение можно перевести как: \\"It's a pity that we can't repeat the year that's already slipping away from us.\\""},{"instruction":"Нужно что бы там было \\"going away \\"","output":"Тогда можно сказать: \\"It's a pity we cannot repeat the year that's going away from us.\\""},{"instruction":"И должно быть слово \\"невозможно\\"","output":"В таком случае: \\"It's a pity it's impossible to repeat the year that's going away from us.\\""},{"instruction":"Переведи на английский сохранив игру слов \\"С Новым годом, С Новым счастьем, С Новым списком!\\"","output":"Перевод фразы с сохранением игры слов может выглядеть следующим образом: \\"Happy New Year, Happy New Cheer, Happy New List!\\""},{"instruction":"А что значит \\"Happy New Cheer,\\"?","output":"\\"Happy New Cheer\\" – это попытка сохранить рифму и ритм исходной фразы с помощью подбора аналогично звучащих слов. В данном контексте \\"cheer\\" означает веселье, радость, бодрость. Так что буквально \\"Happy New Cheer\\" можно перевести как \\"С Новым весельем\\" или \\"С Новой радостью\\".

Draw two straight lines for the arms, extending outwards from the upper part of the body line. 4. Add two straight lines for legs, coming down from the lower part of the body line. 5. If you desire, you can add small horizontal lines at the ends of the arms and legs to represent hands and feet. This should give you a very basic stick figure. If you want a visual, you can easily find one through a quick image search on the web or by using a drawing app to create it based on these instructions."},{"instruction":"i need camera code that follows mouse in gdscript","output":"In Godot Engine, you can create a script that makes the camera follow the mouse cursor by updating the camera's position based on the mouse position. Below is an example of how you can achieve this in GDScript, the scripting language used in Godot. Let's assume you have a Camera2D node in your scene and you want it to follow the mouse cursor. Here's a simple script you could attach to the camera: \`\`\`gdscript extends Camera2D # Speed at which the camera follows the mouse. var follow_speed = 5.0 func _process(delta): var viewport_size = get_viewport_rect().size var mouse_position = get_global_mouse_position() # You can adjust the smoothing or the 'follow_speed' to get the desired camera responsiveness. var target_position = mouse_position.linear_interpolate(global_position, follow_speed * delta) # This will set the camera's position, but won't go out of the limits, if set. global_position = target_position.clamped(global_position - viewport_size / 2, global_position + viewport_size / 2) \`\`\` Make sure to attach this script to your Camera2D node. What this script does is: - It gets the global position of the mouse every frame (\`_process\` function). - It then interpolates the camera's current position towards the mouse's position using the \`linear_interpolate\` function, with \`follow_speed\` as the rate at which the camera should follow. - It finally sets the camera's \`global_position\` to the interpolated position. The script assumes you're not using the built-in smoothing of Camera2D, as it performs its own smoothing function. If you want the camera to strictly follow the mouse without interpolation, you can directly set \`global_position\` to \`mouse_position\`. Please adjust \`follow_speed\` according to your needs. A higher value makes the camera follow the mouse cursor more quickly, while a lower value results in a smoother follow effect. Also, keep in mind that this script will move the camera without any boundaries. If you have a particular area where the camera should stay within, you will need to implement some additional logic to make sure the camera's position does not go beyond these limits."},{"instruction":"3d camera","output":"In a 3D environment within Godot Engine, setting up a camera to follow the mouse involves a different strategy compared to a 2D environment. You typically want to move the camera based on mouse movement, either to rotate the camera around a point or to move the camera's viewing direction. Below you will find an example code snippet that allows a 3D camera to rotate around an object or position based on mouse input. This could be part of an orbit-style camera control. Assuming you have a \`Camera\` node in your scene, you can attach the following script to it. Remember to tweak the script according to your needs, such as adjusting the sensitivity or implementing constraints on the rotation: \`\`\`gdscript extends Camera var last_mouse_position = Vector2() var mouse_sensitivity = 0.1 var camera_rotation_y = 0.0 var camera_rotation_x = 0.0 func _input(event): if event is InputEventMouseMotion: rotate_camera(event.relative) func rotate_camera(mouse_motion): camera_rotation_y += -mouse_motion.x * mouse_sensitivity camera_rotation_x += -mouse_motion.y * mouse_sensitivity camera_rotation_x = clamp(camera_rotation_x, -PI / 2, PI / 2) # Compute the new rotation. This setup assumes Y is up. var new_rotation = Quat(Vector3(0, 1, 0), camera_rotation_y) * Quat(Vector3(1, 0, 0), camera_rotation_x) # Apply the rotation to the camera's orientation. self.global_transform.basis = new_rotation func _process(delta): # Custom processing can go here. pass \`\`\` In the \`_input()\` function, we check for mouse motion events and call \`rotate_camera()\` with the mouse motion's relative value, which represents how much the mouse has moved. In the \`rotate_camera()\` function, we adjust the camera's y rotation based on the horizontal mouse movement (left and right) and its x rotation based on the vertical mouse movement (up and down). We then apply this rotation to the camera. The \`clamp()\` function is used to limit the up and down pitch of the camera to prevent it from rotating too far and flipping over. The script's \`rotate_camera()\` math assumes that the camera's up direction is the positive Y-axis, which is standard in most 3D applications. You can also implement zoom and pan movements if you need more control over the camera. Remember to handle the input actions in the \`_input()\` function and apply any additional transformations or movements in the \`_process()\` or \`_physics_process()\` functions as needed. Please adjust this script as needed for your particular use case. This is just a basic starting point for a 3D camera that follows mouse movement in Godot Engine."},{"instruction":"Invalid set index 'basis' (on base: 'Transform3D') with value of type 'Quaternion'.","output":"My apologies for the oversight. In Godot, Transform basis cannot be set directly using a Quaternion. It needs to be converted to a Basis first. You can achieve this by creating a \`Basis\` from the \`Quaternion\` and then setting that to the Transform's \`basis\`. Here's the corrected \`rotate_camera()\` function: \`\`\`gdscript func rotate_camera(mouse_motion): camera_rotation_y += -mouse_motion.x * mouse_sensitivity camera_rotation_x += -mouse_motion.y * mouse_sensitivity # Clamp the camera's vertical rotation to avoid flipping camera_rotation_x = clamp(camera_rotation_x, -PI / 2, PI / 2) # Compute the new rotation using Euler angles directly. # This setup assumes Y is up. var new_rotation = Basis(Vector3(1, 0, 0), camera_rotation_x) * Basis(Vector3(0, 1, 0), camera_rotation_y) # Apply the rotation to the camera's orientation. self.global_transform.basis = new_rotation \`\`\` In this code, \`Basis(Vector3(1, 0, 0), angle)\` creates a rotation around the X axis, and \`Basis(Vector3(0, 1, 0), angle)\` creates a rotation around the Y axis. The \`*\` operator combines these two rotations, and the resulting \`Basis\` object represents the camera's orientation in 3D space. Make sure to plug this code into the rest of the camera script, connecting it to the input processing and ensuring that \`camera_rotation_y\` and \`camera_rotation_x\` are correctly updated and read. Always test modifications to confirm it behaves as desired within the context of your Godot project."},{"instruction":"Переведи на китайский (имена Ёжик, Крош, Нюша, Лосяш и Кар-Карыч не переводи): Куда уходит Старый год?

We developed an explicit formula for hitting times in terms of the irreducible representations of the group. We also have a way of computing cover times in terms of these hitting times. This computation is based on a quantity we indentiﬁed, which we call the volume growth function. And we believe that it is the right object to study in order to understand the cover time. 1 Introduction The hitting time of a Markov chain is the time for a Markov chain to reach a certain state. These values have long been studied such as in problems like gambler’s ruin. More recently, there has been interest in the cover time i.e. the time it takes for a ﬁnite Markov chain to hit all of its states. Computing cover times has applications in Markov chain algorithms such as page rank. Here we are interested in the asymptotics of the cover times of a family Markov chains, where the size of the state space goes to inﬁnity. Matthews [6] shows a relationship between cover times and a natural object of study, the maximum hitting time. For a Markov chain with state space Ω, the Matthews upper and lower bounds diﬀer by a factor of log |Ω|. Both the upper and lower Matthews bounds can be achieved for example with the cycle and the hypercube (see examples 4.14 and 4.16). The paper of Ding, Lee, and Peres [3] was a big breakthrough for the theory showing the cover times for random walks on graphs are asymptotic to the expected maximum of an associated Gaussian process. Their results can be sharper than Matthews bounds as they encapsulate the information of all of the hitting times instead of only the maximum hitting time. However in the general case, computing the maximum of this Gaussian process is diﬃcult to compute. For example, it can be computed with Talagrand’s theory of majorizing measures [4]. We consider a case in which there are many symmetries, a random walk on a group. This allows us to do explicit computations of hitting times and cover times. We derive an explicit formula for hitting times for random walks on group in terms of its irreducible representations. The strength of this method is that it is exact and general. The formulas hold for any random walk on a group while conventional hitting time calculations only hold for random walks where the transition probabilities are very carefully chosen. However, the drawback is that the formulas are often diﬃcult to calculate or bound by hand, but they can be calculated with high precision on a computer. In the case of cover times, the associated Gaussian process of Ding, Lee, Peres also has many symmetries. Formally, it is a stationary Gaussian process. In this case, more simple arguments can be used to calculate the maximum of the Gaussian process. Ultimately, this allows us to compute the cover time as an integral of an important quantity, which we call the volume growth function. We can 1 compute this function with our formulas for hitting times. We believe the volume growth function is the right quantity to understand in order to understand cover times, and is computed on a case by case basis. This method is extremely general, but it faces the diﬃculty of being very hard to compute since the behavior of all hitting times are needed to understand the volume growth function. 2 Background We review the basics of random walks on groups and Fourier transforms on ﬁnite groups that we will later use for the following sections. 2.1 Random Walks on Groups These are very basic facts about random walks on groups that are needed for this paper. See [5] for a more in depth discussion. Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G be a group. Let p be a probability measure on G. A random walk on a group G generated by p is a Markov chain with state space G with the following transition probabilities. For g, h ∈ G, the probability of going from g to h is P(g, h) = p(hg−1) We note the symmetry in this deﬁnition P(g, hg) = P(e, h) = p(h) (2.1) The random walk is irreducible/reversible if it is an irreducible/reversible Markov chain. Note that the random walk is reversible iﬀ the support of p generates G. Lemma 2.2. The stationary distribution π of an irreducible random walk on a group G is the uniform distribution. Proof. For g ∈ G, � h∈G P(h, g) 1 |G| = � h∈G P(h−1g, g) 1 |G| = 1 |G| � h∈G p(h) = 1 |G| Deﬁnition 2.3. For a discrete Markov chain (Xt)t≥0, let τx = min{t ≥ 0 : Xt = x} be the hitting time. We will also call Ey[τx] hitting times. For τ + x = min{t > 0 : Xt = x}, we call Ex[τ + x ] the ﬁrst return time. Corollary 2.4. For an irreducible random walk on a group G. The ﬁrst return time Ee[τ + e ] of a random walk on a group is |G|. Proof. If π is the stationary distribution, then Ee[τ + e ] = 1 π(e) (see [5] section 1.5). 2 Lemma 2.5. A random walk on a group G generated by distribution p is reversible iﬀ p(g) = p(g−1) for all g ∈ G. Proof. Let π be the stationary distribution. A Markov chain is reversible iﬀ for all g, h π(g)p(g, h) = π(h)p(h, g) By lemma 2.2, this is 1 |G|p(hg−1) = 1 |G|p(gh−1) which is true iﬀ p(g) = p(g−1) for all g ∈ G. Remark 2.6. A reversible random walk on a group G is a random walk on the Cayley graph with edge weights given by p. (This is true for random walks that are not reversible for a directed Cayley graph.) 2.2 Fourier Transform on Finite Groups We review the basics of Fourier transforms on ﬁnite groups which will be used in the next section. Proofs will be omitted, but can be found in [2]. Theorem 2.7 (Fourier Transform). Let G be a ﬁnite group and f : G → R≥0. Then we deﬁne the Fourier transform ˆf as a function that takes representations ρ of G and gives complex matrices according to the formula ˆf(ρ) = � g∈G f(g)ρ(g) Deﬁnition 2.8. Let f1, f2 : G → R≥0 and let G be a ﬁnite group. Then the convolution is (f1 ∗ f2)(h) := � g∈G f1(hg−1)f2(g) Remark 2.9. We note that for a random walk on a group with transition probability P and initial distribution Q. The distribution at time one is P ∗ Q. Remark 2.10. Convolution is in non-commutative in general. As in standard Fourier analysis, the Fourier transform takes convolutions to products. Lemma 2.11. � f1 ∗ f2(ρ) = ˆf1(ρ) ˆf2(ρ) Theorem 2.12 (Fourier Inversion). Let f : G → R≥0 and G a ﬁnite group. Let ρ1, . . . , ρr be the irreducible representations of G. Let di be the degree of ρi. Then for g ∈ G, f(g) = 1 |G| r � i=1 di Tr(ρi(g−1) ˆf(ρi)) Remark 2.13. The Fourier inversion formula shows that f is determined by how ˆf acts on the irreducible representations. Theorem 2.14. Consider a random walk on a group G generated by a probability distribution p. Let P be the transition matrix. Then P = φ−1D∗φ where D is the block diagonal matrix with blocks of the form ˆp(ρi) and φ are the change of basis matrices into the Fourier basis. 3 See section 3E of [2] for a more detailed statement of the theorem and a proof. The following is a lemma of representation theory we will use in the next section. We provide it here as to not interrupt the ﬂow of the next section Lemma 2.15. Let ρ be a non-trivial irreducible representation of a ﬁnite group G on a vector space V . Then, � g∈G ρ(g) = 0 Proof. Let A = � g∈G ρ(g) be an endomorphism on V . Then ρ(g)A = A = Aρ(g), so by Schur’s lemma, A = λI is a multiple of the identity. Tr A = � g∈G χ(g) = 0, by the orthogonality relations for characters, so A = 0. 3 Hitting Times We will prove the following formula for the hitting time (deﬁnition 2.3) for random walks on a group using Fourier transforms. Our main idea was that the Fourier basis “almost diagonalizes” matrices of a group, and is thus the natural basis to compute the matrix of hitting times. Theorem 3.1. Let G be an abelian group, and ρ1, . . . , ρr be the irreducible representations with ρ1 the trivial representation. Let p a probability distribution on G, and consider the random walk on G generated by p. Then, Ee[τg] = r � i=2 1 − ρi(g−1) 1 − ˆp(ρi) We will prove a more general formula for not-necessarily abelian groups. Let G be a group with |G| = n. Consider a random walk on G generated by a probability p. Lemma 3.2. The hitting times satisfy the following system of linear equations Ee[τe] = 0 (3.1) Ee[τg] = 1 + � s∈S Es[τg]P(e, s), g ̸= e Proof. By deﬁnition Ee[τe] = 0. Let (Xt)t≥0 be a random walk on G generated by p s.t. X0 = e under a probability distribution P. Then Ee[τg] = EP[τg] = � s∈G P(e, s)EP[τg | X1 = s] = � s∈G P(e, s)Es[τg] To analyze equation (3.1), we use the following simplifying notation. For g, h ∈ G and e the identity element, the hitting times are h(g) := Ee[τg] = Eh[τgh] Thus, we view these two quantities as vectors instead of matrices. Writing equation (3.1) in the above notation we get h(e) = 0 (3.2) h(g) = 1 + � s∈S h(gs−1)p(s), g ̸= e 4 This system of equations looks very similar to a convolution. In order to make this true, we rewrite the equation h(e) = 0. We calculate 1 + � s∈S h(es−1)p(s) which is Es[τ + e ] the ﬁrst return time. By lemma 2.4, Ee[τ + e ] = 1 π(e) = n Now we can write equations (3.2) as h(e) = 1 − n + � s∈S h(es−1)p(s) (3.3) h(g) = 1 + � s∈S h(gs−1)p(s), g ̸= e We take the constant terms in the above system, and create a function k(g) = � 1 − n, g = e 1, otherwise The equations (3.3) become h(g) = k(g) + (h ∗ p)(g) (3.4) Let ρ1, . . . , ρr be the irreducible representations of G. Now we may take the Fourier transform to get ˆh(ρi) = ˆk(ρi) + ˆh(ρi)ˆp(ρi) (3.5) or equivalently ˆh(ρi)(I − ˆp(ρi)) = ˆk(ρi) (3.6) where I is the identity matrix of appropriate dimension. We compute 1 − ˆp(ρ1) = 1 − � g∈G p(g)ρ1(g) = 1 − � g∈G p(g) = 0 and thus we cannot solve for ˆh(ρ1) with this equation. However, we can solve for ˆh(ρi) with this equation for all i ̸= 1. Lemma 3.3. Consider the random walk on a group G generated by the distribution p. If the random walk is irreducible, then I − ˆp(ρi) is invertible for all nontrivial irreducible representations. Proof. Let P be the matrix of transition probabilities. The solutions v to v(I − P) = 0 are multiples of the stationary distribution. This distribution is unique, since the Markov chain is irreducible. Thus, the nullspace of I − P is 1, so the matrix has rank n − 1. By lemma 2.14, I − P = φ−1D∗φ, where D is the block diagonal matrix with I − ˆp(ρi) along the diagonal, and where φ is a nonsingular matrix. Since I − P has rank n − 1, D must have rank n − 1. Since 1 − ˆp(ρ1) = 0, the rest of the blocks must be nonsingular. Thus from equation (3.6), we have ˆh(ρi) = ˆk(ρi)(I − ˆp(ρi))−1, i ̸= 1 (3.7) 5 Lemma 3.4. Let ρi be a non-trivial representation. Then, ˆk(ρi) = −nI Proof. By lemma 2.15, ˆk(ρi) = � g∈G k(g)ρi(g) = � ρi(g) − nρi(e) = −nI From equation (3.7), we get the equation ˆh(ρi) = −n(I − ˆp(ρi))−1, i ̸= 1 (3.8) We may now compute ˆh(ρ1). Using Fourier inversion, we have 0 = h(e) = r � i=1 di Tr(ˆh(ρi)) so ˆh(ρ1) = − r � i=2 di Tr(ˆh(ρi)) We summarize our results in the following theorem. Theorem 3.5. Conisder an irreducible random walk on a ﬁnite group G. Let h be the hitting times h(g) := Ee[τg] = Eh[τgh] We have a formula for the Fourier transform ˆh, and thus we can compute h with Fourier inversion. Let ρ1, . . . , ρr be the irreducible representations of G with ρ1 the trivial representation. The formula is ˆh(ρi) = −n(I − ˆp(ρi))−1, i ̸= 1 ˆh(ρ1) = − r � i=2 di Tr(ˆh(ρi)) Theorem 3.6. Let G be an abelian group. Using the same notation from the above theorem, h(g) = r � i=2 1 − ρi(g−1) 1 − ˆp(ρi) Proof. Abelian groups have one-dimensional representations, so ˆh(ρ1) = − r � i=2 ˆh(ρi) where ˆh(ρi) = − n 1 − ˆp(ρi) We get the desired equation by plugging into the Fourier inversion formula. 6 Example 3.7 (Cycle). We compute the hitting times for the random walk on Zn, n ≥ 2 generated by the probability distribution p assigning probability 1/2 to 1, n − 1 ∈ Zn. (We also may deﬁne a random walk on Z2 by assigning probability 1 to 1 ∈ Z2. The formulas we derive will still hold in this case.) This is an irreducible Markov chain. We will show the hitting times h(k) = k(n − k) For another proof of this fact, see [5]. The representations of Zn are for 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1, ρj(k) = e2πijk/n So ˆp(ρj) = n � k=1 ρj(k)p(k) = e 2πij n + e −2πij n 2 = cos 2πj n By theorem 3.1, h(k) = n−1 � i=1 1 − e−2πijk/n 1 − cos 2πj n = n−1 � i=1 1 − cos −2πjk n + i sin −2πjk n 1 − cos 2πj n Since h(k) is real, we may ignore the imaginary components h(k) = n−1 � i=1 1 − cos −2πjk n 1 − cos 2πj n Now we simplify this formula. Lemma 3.8. n−1 � i=1 1 − cos −2πjk n 1 − cos 2πj n = k(n − k) Proof. We ﬁrst note for k not a multiple of n, n−1 � i=1 e2πik/n = −1 so taking the real part of this equation n−1 � i=1 cos(2πk/n) = −1 Let z = eπi/n, then n−1 � i=1 1 − cos −2πjk n 1 − cos 2πj n = n−1 � i=1 1 − z2jk+z−2jk 2 1 − z2j+z−2j 2 = n−1 � i=1 (zjk − z−jk)2 (zj − z−j)2 = n−1 � i=1 (zj(k−1) + zj(k−3) + · · · + z−j(k−1))2 = n−1 � i=1 (z2j(k−1) + z−2j(k−1) + 2(z2j(k−2) + z−2j(k−2)) + · · · + (k − 1)(z2j + z−2j) + k) = n−1 � i=1 (2 cos[2πj(k − 1)] + 4 cos[2πj(k − 2)] + · · · + 2(k − 1) cos[2πj] + k) = −2 − 4 − · · · − 2(k − 1) + k(n − 1) = k(n − k) 7 Example 3.9 (Hypercube). Consider the random walk on the group Zm 2 generated by the probability distribution assigning probability 1/m to each of the elements (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ Zm 2 . We will show the non-trivial hitting times are all of order 2m. The representations for this group are the Walsh functions, which are deﬁned as follows. For an element x ∈ Zm 2 , we let xi be the i-th component. For each k ∈ Zm 2 we deﬁne a representation ρk on x ∈ Zm 2 by ρk(x) = (−1) �m i=1 xiki We note that for k = (0, . . . , 0) =: 0, this is the trivial representation. For x ∈ Zm 2 , let |x| be the number of nonzero entries. We compute the Fourier transform ˆp(ρk) = � x∈Zm 2 p(x)ρk(x) = 1 m m � i=1 (−1)ki = m − 2|k| m By theorem 3.1, the hitting time is h(x) = � k̸=0 1 − (−1)− �m i=1 xiki 1 − m−2|k| m = m � k̸=0 1 − (−1)− �m i=1 xiki 2|k| Because the hypercube is symmetric up to relabeling of the coordinates, h(x) depends only on |x|. Let |x| = j. It suﬃces to calculate the hitting times for x = (1, . . . , 1, 0 . . . , 0) the element with j copies of 1 followed by n − j copies of 0. When k has an odd number of 1’s among its ﬁrst j coordinates, (−1)− �m i=1 xiki = −1. Thus let S be the subset of Zm 2 s.t. that there are an odd number of 1’s among the ﬁrst j components. Then, h(x) = m � k̸=0 1 − (−1)− �m i=1 xiki 2|k| = m � k∈S 1 |k| We count the number of k ∈ S. There must be an odd number i of 1’s among the ﬁrst j components of k. For a ﬁxed i, there are �j i � to pick these ones. For a ﬁxed l, there are �m−j l � ways to choose these ones among the last m − j elements. Such an element of S has |k| = i + l and there are �j i ��m−j l � of these. Thus, hitting time is h(x) = m � i odd m−j � l=0 �j i ��m − j l � 1 l + i (3.9) There are cases in which we can compute the exact hitting time. We will use the following lemma Lemma 3.10. 2m+1 − 1 m + 1 = m � i=0 1 i + 1 �m i � Proof. We have the binomial formula (x + 1)m = m � i=0 �m i � xi Taking the integral � x 0 to both sides, we get 1 m + 1(x + 1)m+1 − 1 m + 1 = m � i=0 �m i � xi+1 i + 1 We plug in x = 1 to get the identity. 8 Proposition 3.11. Let x ∈ Zm 2 . If |x| = 1, h(x) = 2m − 1 If |x| = 2, h(x) = m m − 1(2m − 2) (The |x| = 1 case is proven with a diﬀerent method in [7].) Proof. For |x| = 1, the formula is h(x) = m � i odd m−1 � l=0 �1 i ��m − 1 l � 1 l + i = m m−1 � l=0 �m − 1 l � 1 l + 1 = 2m − 1 In the last step, We can do a similar calculation for |x| = 2. h(x) = m � i odd m−2 � l=0 �2 i ��m − 2 l � 1 l + i = 2m m−2 � l=0 �m − 2 l � 1 l + 1 = m m − 1(2m − 2) Now we prove sharp bounds for the hitting times. We start with a lemma Lemma 3.12. � i+l=s �j i ��m − j l � = �m s � where the sum is over all pairs of non-negative integers (i, l) s.t. i + l = s. Proof. The right hand side counts the number of ways to choose s marbles out of m. We can count this in another way. Color j marbles red and m − j marbles blue. Then the number of ways to choose s marbles is the sum over all i + l = s of choosing i red marbles and l blue marbles. Proposition 3.13. There are non-zero constants c, C such that for x ∈ Zm 2 , c2m ≤ h(x) ≤ C2m for all x ̸= (0, 0, . . . , 0). Proof. First we prove the upper bound. 9 h(x) = m � i odd m−j � l=0 �j i ��m − j l � 1 l + i ≤ m j � i=0 m−j � l=0 �j i ��m − j l � 1 l + i ≤ m m � s=1 � i+l=s �j i ��m − j l �1 s rearranging the sum = m m � s=1 �m s �1 s by lemma 3.12 ≤ 2m m � s=1 �m s � 1 s + 1 = 2m m + 1(2m+1 − 1) by lemma 3.10 Now we prove the lower bound. Lemma 3.14. First we note that for i < j/2, j odd, 3 � i odd �j i � 1 l + i ≥ j � i=0 �j i � 1 l + i for l ≥ 1 and 3 � i odd �j i �1 i ≥ j � i=1 �j i �1 i Proof. First we note that for i < j/2, i + l ≥ 2, �j i � 1 l + i ≥ � j i − 1 � 1 l + i − 1 ⇔ j − i + 1 i ≥ i + l i + l − 1 ⇔ il + l + i − 2 ≥ 0 Thus for l ≥ 1, � i odd,i<j/2 �j i � 1 i + l ≥ � i even,i<j/2 �j i � 1 i + l (3.10) Similarly for i < j/2, �j i � 1 l + i ≥ � j j − i � 1 l + j − i so � i odd,i<j/2 �j i � 1 i + l ≥ � i even,i≥j/2 �j i � 1 i + l (3.11) Using equations (3.10) and (3.11), we have for j odd, l ≥ 1, 3 � i odd,i<j/2 �j i � 1 i + l + � i odd,i>j/2 �j i � 1 i + l ≥ j � i=0 �j i � 1 i + l The same argument holds for l = 0. 10 Thus by the lemma, we compute the lower bound of the hitting time. h(x) = m � i odd m−j � l=0 �j i ��m − j l � 1 l + i ≥ m 3 j � i=1 � l≤m−j,i+l≥1 �j i ��m − j l � 1 l + i by lemma 3.14 ≥ m 3 m � s=1 � i+l=s �j i ��m − j l �1 s by lemma 3.12 ≥ m 3 m � s=1 � i+l=s �j i ��m − j l � 1 s + 1 = m 3 m � s=1 �m s � 1 s + 1 = m 3 2m+1 − 1 m + 1 − m 3 by lemma 3.10 4 Cover Times In this section we would like to use our computations of hitting times to compute cover times deﬁned as follows tcov := max h∈G Eh[max g∈G τg] = Ee max g∈G[τg] We will describe our asymptotic bounds with the following notation. Deﬁnition 4.1. We say f(n) ≲ g(n) if there is a universal constant C s.t. f(n) ≤ Cg(n). as similarly for ≳. If f(n) ≲ g(n) and f(n) ≳ g(n), then we write f(n) ≍ g(n) We will use some results of Ding, Lee, Peres [3] to compute cover times, which we summarize here. Consider a random walk on a group G generated by a distribution p. We deﬁne the follow Gaussian process (ηg)g∈G associated to th random walk, based on the commute time κ(g, h) := Eg[τh] + Eh[τg]. It is the centered Gaussian process with ηe = 0, and E[|ηg − ηh|2] = κ(g, h) These statistics fully determine the Gaussian process. Theorem 4.2 (Ding, Lee, Peres). For a random walk on a group G with vertex set V , tcov ≍ � E max v∈V ηv �2 for the associated Gaussian processes η deﬁned above. 11 Remark 4.3. The results of Ding, Lee, Peres are presented in the more general setting of electrical networks, which we will not use in the result of the paper. For an electrical network, let cgh be the conductance from g to h. And cg = � h∈G cgh. The total conductance is C := � g,h∈G cgh. We deﬁne the transition probabilities by P(g, h) = cgh cg . Ding, Lee, Peres deﬁne E[|ηg − ηh|2] = Reff = κ(g, h) C (see [2]). Then, tcov ≍ C � E max v∈V ηv �2 Scaling all the conductances, does not change the transition probabilities of the random walk, so C changes but tcov remains the same. We can also see this in the formula in theorem 4.12 below. In our case, we let the conductances be c(g, h) = 1 |G|p(hg−1). The total conductance is C := � g,h∈G cgh = 1 for this network. The case of a random walk on a group is much simpler than a general random walk on a graph. This will simplify calculations considerably. Deﬁnition 4.4. For a Gaussian process (ηt)t∈T , d(t, s) = E[|ηt − ηs|2]1/2 is a distance on T induced by this process. In our setting of a random walk on a group with associated Gaussian process, we may check this distance is a metric. Commute time satisﬁes the triangle inequality because for all s, t, u ∈ G, Et[τs] ≤ Et[τu] + Eu[τs] Thus d(t, s) = E[|ηt − ηs|2]1/2 = � κ(t, s) ≤ � κ(t, u) + κ(u, s) ≤ � κ(t, u) + � κ(u, s) = d(t, u) + d(u, s) Deﬁnition 4.5. A Gaussian process (ηt)t∈T is stationary, if there is a transitive group action G ↷ T s.t. for g ∈ G, d(g · t, g · s) = d(t, s) Lemma 4.6. Let G be a random walk on a group. The associated Gaussian process is stationary. Namely, the associated metric d(g, h) is ﬁxed by the action of right multiplication by an element of G. Proof. Recall the Gaussian process is deﬁned by for t, s ∈ G, d(t, s) = E[|ηt − ηs|2]1/2 = � κ(t, s) The group G has a transitive action on itself by right multiplication which ﬁxes κ(t, s) since for g ∈ G, κ(g · t, g · s) = Etg[τsg] + Esg[τtg] = Et[τs] + Es[τt] = κ(t, s) Thus d(t, s) is ﬁxed by this action. Deﬁnition 4.7. Let d be any metric on a set T. Deﬁne N(T, d, ϵ) to be the maximum number of points t1, . . . , tN ∈ T s.t. d(ti, tj) > ϵ for all i ̸= j. Theorem 4.8 (Fernique). Let (ηt)t∈T be a stationary Gaussian process with ﬁnite index set. Then E � max t∈T Xt � ≍ � ∞ 0 � log N(T, d, ϵ)dϵ (See [4] for a proof.) 12 Consider a random walk on a group G. Combining theorems 4.2 and 4.8, we have tcov ≍ �� ∞ 0 � log N(G, d, ϵ)dϵ �2 (4.1) where d(g, h) = � κ(s, t). Now we would like to understand the quantity N(G, d, ϵ). Lemma 4.9. Let G be a group with metric d. Let Bg(ϵ) = {h ∈ G : d(g, h) ≤ ϵ} be the closed ball of radius ϵ around g. Then |Bg(ϵ)| is independent of g. We deﬁne the quantity Vd(ϵ) := |Bg(ϵ)| the volume growth function. Proof. We will show |Bg(ϵ)| = |Bh(ϵ)| for any g, h ∈ G. Let k ∈ Bg(ϵ). Then by lemma 4.6, d(g, k) = d(h, kg−1h) ≤ ϵ Right multiplication by g−1h is injective, so it maps Bg(ϵ) into Bh(ϵ). Similarly, right multiplication by h−1g maps Bh(ϵ) into Bg(ϵ). Remark 4.10. The term volume growth function already exists in the literature [8]. Here we use the term in a more general context than the existing usage. [8] uses the term volume growth function to refer to the particular case where the distance d is words size. We will be studying a diﬀerent distance on the group. Lemma 4.11. Let G be a group with metric d, N(G, d, ϵ)Vd(ϵ/3) ≤ |G| and N(G, d, ϵ)Vd(ϵ) ≥ |G| Proof. First we show the upper bound. Let S ⊂ G be a set with N(G, d, ϵ) elements s.t. d(s, t) ≥ ϵ for s, t ∈ S. Then the balls Bs(ϵ/3) for s ∈ S are disjoint. Now we show the lower bound. Let S be as above. We claim the Bs(ϵ) cover G. If this is true, the inequality holds. Assume by contradiction g ∈ G is not in Bs(ϵ) for any s ∈ S, then d(g, s) > ϵ for all s ∈ S, so S′ = S ∪ {g} satisfy d(s, t) > ϵ for all s, t ∈ S′ and |S′| > N(G, d, ϵ). However, this contradicts the deﬁnition of N(G, d, ϵ). Now, we can understand the cover time in terms of the volume growth function. Theorem 4.12. tcov ≍ �� ∞ 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 Proof. From equation (4.1) and lemma 4.11, tcov ≍ �� ∞ 0 � log N(G, d, ϵ)dϵ �2 ≳ �� ∞ 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 Similarly, we can get the upper bound tcov ≍ �� ∞ 0 � log N(G, d, ϵ)dϵ �2 ≲ �� ∞ 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ/3)dϵ �2 = � 3 � ∞ 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 13 Corollary 4.13 (Matthew’s Bounds [6]). Let M = max g1,g2∈G κ(g1, g2) = max g∈G κ(e, g), then M ≲ tcov ≲ M log |G| We note M ≍ maxg∈G Ee[τg] the maximum hitting time. Proof. The maximum distance d(s, t) = √ M for s, t ∈ T. Thus, for ϵ ≥ √ M, Vd(ϵ) = |G|, so � ∞ 0 log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ = � √ M 0 log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ Since Vd(ϵ) ≥ 1, tcov ≲ �� √ M 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 ≤ �� √ M 0 � log |G|dϵ �2 = M log |G| For the lower bound, let s, t be s.t. d(s, t) = M. Then Bs(M/3) and Bt(M/3) are disjoint, so Vd(M/3) ≤ |G|/2. tcov ≍ �� ∞ 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 ≥ �� √ M/3 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 ≥ �� √ M/3 0 � log 2dϵ �2 ≳ M The following examples show that both the upper and lower bounds may be achieved. Example 4.14 (Cycle). We consider the random walk Zn generated by the distribution that assigns probability 1/2 to each of ±1. We will prove tcov ≍ n2 This is the lower bound of the Matthews bounds, so we must only prove the upper bound. Using example 3.7, d(0, k) = � 2k(n − k) for k ∈ Zn. Thus for k < n/2, � 2k(n − k) ≤ ϵ < � 2(k + 1)(n − k − 1) (4.2) implies Vd(ϵ) = 2k + 1. The maximum value of d is achieved when k = ⌊n/2⌋. Thus for ϵ ≥ � n2/2 = n/ √ 2, Vd(ϵ) = n, so log n V (ϵ) = 0. Thus, tcov ≍ �� ∞ 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 = �� 3√n 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ + � n/ √ 2 3√n � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 We bound the ﬁrst summand � 3√n 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ ≤ � 3√n 0 � log ndϵ = 3 � n log n Thus, it suﬃces to show � n/ √ 2 3√n � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ ≲ n 14 Rearranging equation (4.2), we have 2(k + 1) ≥ ϵ2 n − k − 1 ≥ ϵ2 3n Thus Vd(ϵ) ≥ ϵ2 3n − 1 ≥ ϵ2 6n for 3√n ≤ ϵ ≤ � 2⌊n/2⌋2, and we can manually check this inequality for � 2⌊n/2⌋2 ≤ ϵ ≤ n/ √ 2. Thus, � n/ √ 2 3√n � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ ≤ � n/ √ 2 3√n � log 6n2 ϵ2 dϵ ≤ � n/ √ 2 3√n log 6n2 ϵ2 dϵ = (n/ √ 2 − 3√n) log 6 + 2(n/ √ 2 − 3√n) log n − 2(x log x − x) ��� n/ √ 2 3√n = nlog 6 √ 2 + √ 2n log n − √ 2n log(n/ √ 2) + √ 2n + o(n) ≍ n Thus, tcov ≍ n2 The cover times of our other examples can be computed with the following proposition. Proposition 4.15. Let f be a ﬁxed function. Consider a random walk on a group G with |G| = N s.t. h(g) ≍ f(N) for all g ̸= e. Then, tcov ≍ f(N) log N Proof. The maximum hitting time is ≍ f(n), so this is the Matthews upper bound. It suﬃces to prove a lower bound. The minimum distrance α := min g̸=e d(e, g) ≍ � f(n). Then for ϵ < α, Vd(ϵ) = 1. Thus, tcov ≍ �� ∞ 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 ≥ �� α 0 � log |G| Vd(ϵ)dϵ �2 = �� α 0 � log |G|dϵ �2 = α2 log |G| ≍ f(n) log n Example 4.16 (Hypercube). From proposition 3.13, Ee[τg] ≍ 2m for all g ̸= e, so by the above proposition the cover time of the hypercube Zm 2 is tcov ≍ m2m Example 4.17 (Finite-Dimensional Torus). We consider a random walk on a torus Zm n . For n = 2, we have the hypercube discussed in example 3.9. For n > 2, this random walk is generated by the distribution p that assigns probability 1/2m to each element {0, . . . , 0, ±1, 0 . . . , 0}. We consider the case when m is ﬁxed and n grows. The hitting times for this random walk are computed in section 10.4 of Levin, Peres, Wilmer [5] with electrical network methods. They prove for m ≥ 3, Ee[τx] ≍ nm Thus by proposition 4.15, tcov ≍ nm log n 15 5 Further Directions Our method gives us explicit formula for hitting times for random walks on any ﬁnite groups whose representations are understood, which includes all ﬁnite abelian groups. However, we were only able to analyze and understand these formula for a few simple cases. A generalization of the cases considered would be the torus Zm n , letting both n and m grow. This specializes to both the examples of the hypercube (example 3.9) and the ﬁnite-dimensional torus (example 4.17). In the cases in this paper, it seems that for large m, the hitting times are all of the same order, the order of the group. If this were the case, proposition 4.15, gives us that tcov ≍ mnm log n for these cases. This conjecture can be generalized to random walks on a group G generated by a probability distribution p. In the above case, we had that the support of p was large enough, and that p was uniform on the support. In these cases, will we also have the phenomenon that the hitting times all are on the order of |G|? In these cases where the support of p is large, intuitively it is easy for the random walk to get “lost” even if it starts very close to its destination, which is reason to believe the hitting times would all be of the same order. A diﬀerent direction may be the following. The representation theory methods we developed were for the expected values of speciﬁc hitting times τg = {min t ≥ 0 : Xt = g}. Thus, techniques may also be generalized to certain settings for hitting times of the form τA = {min t ≥ 0 : Xt ∈ A} for appropriately chosen sets such as cosets. There is also freedom to choose the initial distribution µ so that Eµ[τA] may be easier to compute and understand. 16 References [1] A. Chandra, P. Raghavan, W. Ruzzo, R. Smolensky, and P.

Дошкольный период, как правило, является периодом наиболее интенсивного формирования познавательной деятельности и личности. Если интеллектуальный и эмоциональный потенциал ребенка дошкольного возраста не развит должным образом, он не сможет быть полностью использован в будущем. Особенно это касается детей с умственной отсталостью (МДР). С нашей точки зрения, дошкольники с задержкой психического развития мало чем отличаются от своих сверстников. Родители часто не обращают внимания на то, что их ребенок несколько позже начал самостоятельно ходить, пользоваться предметами или что у него задерживается речевое развитие. Повышенная возбудимость, неустойчивость внимания и быстрая утомляемость проявляются сначала на поведенческом уровне, а затем и в способности ребенка выполнять учебные задания. Трудности в освоении программы детского сада проявляются у детей старшего возраста еще до поступления в школу. Дети плохо запоминают материал, малоактивны на уроке, легко отвлекаются. Уровень развития его познавательной и речевой деятельности ниже нормы. После поступления в школу клиническая картина нарушений становится более выраженной. Психологические проблемы становятся более глубокими и стойкими. Серьезные трудности возникают при освоении школьной программы; многие дети не могут с этим справиться. Проблему школьной дезадаптации во многом можно решить путем раннего выявления и коррекции умственной отсталости на дошкольном этапе. Термин «умственная отсталость» применяется по отношению к детям с легкими органическими дефектами центральной нервной системы. У них нет каких-либо особых нарушений слуха, зрения, опорно-двигательного аппарата или речи, которые не являются умственной отсталостью. В то же время у многих из них наблюдаются такие клинические симптомы, как незрелое и сложное поведение, целенаправленная деятельность, а также утомляемость, снижение работоспособности и энцефалопатические расстройства. В основе этих симптомов лежат органические нарушения ЦНС и резидуальная недостаточность. Другая возможная причина – функциональная незрелость нервной системы. По мнению В.И. Любовского, психолого-педагогические исследования психического развития детей с задержкой психического развития «важнейшей целью должно быть не только установление факта задержки развития, но и выявление своеобразия проявлений этой задержки» [ 10 ]. В настоящее время достигнуты важные успехи в клинических, психологических и педагогических исследованиях детей с умственной отсталостью.

В середине XX века бурное развитие науки и техники и усложнение системы общего образования привели к появлению большого количества детей с трудностями в обучении. Педагоги и психологи придавали большое значение анализу причин этой неуспеваемости, которую очень часто объясняли умственной отсталостью, что сопровождало направление таких детей в вспомогательные школы, появившиеся в России в 1908-1910 годах. Однако клинические обследования все чаще не позволяли выявить признаки, характерные для умственной отсталости, у многих из этих детей, не справлявшихся с общеобразовательной программой; в 1950-1960-е годы эта проблема приобрела особую актуальность, в результате чего Л.С. Выготский, специалист в области лечения умственной отсталости, был назначен первым экспертом в области умственной отсталости. Под руководством М.С. Певзнера, ученика Л.С. Выготского, было начато многоплановое исследование причин академической неуспеваемости. Быстрый рост неуспеваемости в условиях усложнения образовательных программ заставил ее предположить существование определенных психических недостатков, проявляющихся в условиях повышенных образовательных требований. Комплексное клиническое, психологическое и педагогическое изучение устойчиво неуспевающих учеников школ разных регионов страны и анализ огромного количества данных привели к формированию представления о ребенке с ЗПР. Таким образом, появилась новая категория аномальных детей, составляющая значительную часть (около 50 %) учащихся, которые не могли быть помещены в дополнительные школы и отвергались системой общего образования; книги М.С. Певзнера \\" Дети с отклонениями в развитии: отграничение олигофрении от сходных состояний\\" (1966) и \\" Учителю о детях с отклонениями в развитии\\" (1967), написанные совместно с Т.А. Власовой, стали первыми в серии психолого-педагогических публикаций, посвященных изучению и коррекции ЗПР. Комплексные исследования этой аномалии развития, начатые в 1960-е годы в НИИ дефектологии АПН СССР под руководством Т.А. Власовой и М.С. Певзнер, основывались, с одной стороны, на необходимости выявления причин неуспеваемости в коллективных школах и поиска путей борьбы с ней, а с другой - на необходимости выявления причин задержки психического развития и познавательной деятельности, определяемой настоятельной необходимостью дальнейшей дифференциации других клинических нарушений. За 15 лет комплексных психолого-педагогических исследований детей с диагнозом ЗПР накоплен большой объем данных, характеризующих особенности психического развития этой категории детей. По всем изученным показателям психосоциального развития дети данной категории отличаются от других нарушений развития, с одной стороны, и от \\"нормального\\" развития - с другой, занимая по уровню психического развития промежуточное положение между умственно отсталыми и нормально развивающимися сверстниками. Поэтому по уровню интеллектуального развития, диагностируемого по тесту Векслера, дети с ЗПР часто находятся в так называемой пограничной умственной отсталости (IQ в норме 70-90 единиц). Согласно международной классификации, ЗПР определяется как \\"общее расстройство психологического развития\\". В международной литературе дети с ЗПР рассматриваются с чисто педагогической точки зрения и обычно описываются как дети с нарушениями обучаемости или определяются как дезадаптированные дети, которые педагогически запущены и подвергаются социальной и культурной депривации, в основном из-за неблагоприятных условий жизни. В эту группу детей также входят дети с нарушениями поведения. Другие авторы называют детей этой категории детьми с минимальным повреждением мозга или детьми с минимальной (легкой) мозговой дисфункцией, следуя идее, что задержки в развитии, проявляющиеся в нарушениях обучаемости, связаны с остаточными (резидуальными) органическими повреждениями мозга. Термин \\"дети с синдромом дефицита внимания и гиперактивности\\" - СДВГ - широко используется для описания детей со специфическими парциальными трудностями обучения. Дети с задержкой психического развития - это дети, не имеющие явных отклонений в развитии (умственная отсталость, тяжелые нарушения развития речи и языка, явные первичные нарушения в функционировании отдельных анализаторных систем, таких как слуховая, зрительная и моторная). Дети этой категории страдают от различных биосоциальных причин (незначительные повреждения центральной нервной системы или последствия ее функциональной незрелости, физическая слабость, церебральные состояния, незрелость эмоционально-волевой сферы, неблагоприятные социально-педагогические условия на ранних этапах онтогенеза ребенка). Трудности, испытываемые детьми с ЗПР, включают трудности адаптации, в том числе школьной, как следствие регуляционного компонента психической деятельности (дефицит внимания, незрелость мотивационной сферы, общая познавательная пассивность, плохой самоконтроль) так и операционального компонента (сниженный уровень развития отдельных психических процессов, двигательные нарушения, нарушения работоспособности), которые могут быть вызваны дефицитом и того, и другого. Вышеперечисленные особенности не препятствуют освоению ребенком общеобразовательной программы, но требуют определенной адаптации к психофизическим особенностям ребенка. Частичное, а в некоторых случаях и полное преодоление таких отклонений в развитии возможно при оказании своевременной коррекционно-педагогической и, в некоторых случаях, медицинской помощи. Для психической сферы детей с ЗПР характерно сочетание дефицитарных и сохранных функций. Частичный (парциальный) дефицит высших психических функций может сопровождаться инфантильными чертами личности и поведения ребенка. Это может выражаться в снижении работоспособности ребенка в одних случаях, произвольной организации деятельности в других, мотивации к различным видам познавательной деятельности в-третьих и т.д. Задержка психического развития у детей - это сложное полиморфное расстройство, с различными компонентами психической, психологической и физической активности у разных детей. Чтобы понять, каковы основные нарушения в структуре этого отклонения, необходимо вспомнить структурно-функциональную модель работы мозга (А.Р. Лурия). Согласно этой модели, выделяют три блока - энергетический, блок приема, обработки и хранения информации и блок программирования, регуляции и контроля. Согласованная работа этих трех блоков приводит к интегрированной деятельности мозга, благодаря чему все функциональные системы постоянно обогащаются друг другом. Известно, что в детстве функциональные системы с более коротким периодом развития более уязвимы к повреждениям. Это особенно характерно для продолговатого и среднего мозга. Системы с более длительным постнатальным периодом развития, такие как третичные поля анализатора и лобная формация, демонстрируют признаки функциональной незрелости. Поскольку функциональные системы мозга созревают гетерохронно, при наличии этиологических факторов, влияющих на разные периоды пренатального или раннего постнатального развития, может наблюдаться сложное сочетание симптомов как тонких повреждений, так и функциональной незрелости различных участков коры головного мозга. Подкорковая система обеспечивает оптимальный энергетический тонус коры головного мозга и регулирует ее деятельность. При нефункциональной или органической недостаточности у детей возникают нейродинамические расстройства - неустойчивость (нестабильность) и истощаемость психического тонуса, нарушение концентрации внимания, уравновешенности и подвижности процессов возбуждения и торможения, явления вегетативно-сосудистой дистонии, нарушения обмена веществ и питания, эмоциональные расстройства. (13) Третичные зоны анализатора относятся к блокам, которые получают, перерабатывают и хранят информацию, поступающую из внешней и внутренней среды. Морфофункциональные недостатки этих областей приводят к дефициту модально-специфических функций, к которым относятся практика, гнозис, язык, зрительная и слуховая память. Лобная формация относится к блоку программирования, регуляции и контроля. Она организует совместное участие различных функциональных подсистем мозга для построения и выполнения сложнейших умственных, познавательных и сознательных действий. Незрелость этих функций приводит к несформированности произвольных форм психической деятельности, к нарушениям межанализаторных корко-корковых и корко-подкорковых связей. Согласно структурно-функциональному анализу, при ЗПР в различных сочетаниях могут быть первично нарушены как вышеуказанные изолированные структуры, так и их основные функции. При этом глубина поражения и (или) степень незрелости могут быть различными. Это определяет разнообразие психиатрических симптомов, наблюдаемых у детей с ЗПР. Различные вторичные стратификации еще больше увеличивают внутригрупповой разброс в рамках этой категории.

Дети с задержкой психического развития – это дети, у которых нет явных нарушений развития (умственная отсталость, тяжелые нарушения речевого и языкового развития, выявленные первичные нарушения в функционировании отдельных анализаторных систем, например, слуховой, зрительной, двигательной). Дети этой категории страдают от различных биосоциальных причин (легкие поражения центральной нервной системы или последствия ее функциональной незрелости, физическая слабость, мозговые нарушения, незрелость эмоционально-волевой сферы, неблагоприятные социально-педагогические условия на ранних этапах онтогенеза ребенка). К трудностям, с которыми сталкиваются дети с задержкой психического развития, относятся трудности адаптации, в частности трудности обучения, являющиеся следствием регуляционного компонента психической деятельности (дефицит внимания, незрелость мотивационной сферы, общая познавательная пассивность, плохой самоконтроль) и операционального компонента (сниженный уровень развития отдельных психических процессов, двигательные нарушения, недостатки), что может быть вызвано дефицитом того и другого. Перечисленные характеристики не препятствуют освоению ребенком общеобразовательной программы, но требуют определенной адаптации к психофизическим особенностям ребенка. Частично, а в некоторых случаях и полностью преодолеть эти отклонения в развитии можно путем оказания своевременной коррекционной, а в некоторых случаях и медико-педагогической помощи. Психическая сфера детей с задержкой психического развития характеризуется сочетанием нарушенных и сохранных функций. Частичный (частичный) дефицит высших психических функций может сопровождаться инфантильными особенностями личности и поведения ребенка. Это может проявляться в одних случаях снижением трудоспособности ребенка, в других произвольной организацией деятельности, в-третьих мотивацией к различным видам познавательной деятельности и т. д. Задержка психического развития у детей — сложное полиморфное расстройство, имеющее разные компоненты психичекой, психологической и двигательной активности у разных детей. Чтобы понять, каковы основные нарушения в структуре этого отклонения, необходимо вспомнить структурно-функциональную модель работы мозга (А. Р. Лурия). Согласно этой модели, имеется три блока: энергетический блок, блок приема, обработки и хранения информации и блок программирования, регулирования и управления. Слаженная работа этих трех блоков приводит к сложной деятельности мозга, благодаря которой все функциональные системы непрерывно обогащают друг друга. Известно, что в детском возрасте более уязвимы к повреждениям функциональные системы с более коротким периодом развития. Особенно это касается продолговатого мозга и среднего мозга. Системы с более длительным периодом постнатального развития, такие как поля третичных анализаторов и лобная формация, обнаруживают признаки функциональной незрелости. Поскольку функциональные системы головного мозга созревают гетерохронологически, то при наличии этиологических факторов, влияющих на разные периоды внутриутробного или раннего постнатального развития, может наблюдаться сложное сочетание симптомов малозаметного поражения и функциональной незрелости различных областей коры головного мозга. Подкорковая система обеспечивает оптимальный энергетический тонус коры головного мозга и регулирует ее деятельность. При нефункциональных или органических нарушениях у детей наблюдаются нейродинамические нарушения: неустойчивость и истощение психического тонуса, снижение концентрации внимания, уравновешенности и подвижности процессов возбуждения и торможения, явления вегетососудистой дистонии, нарушения обмена веществ и питания, эмоциональные расстройства. (13) К третичным частям анализатора относятся блоки, принимающие, обрабатывающие и хранящие информацию из внешней и внутренней среды. Морфофункциональный дефицит в этих областях приводит к дефициту модально-специфичных функций, включая гнозис, язык, а также зрительную и слуховую память. Лобная формация относится к блоку программирования, регулировки и контроля. Он организует совместное участие различных функциональных подсистем мозга для построения и выполнения сложных мыслительных, познавательных и сознательных действий. Незрелость этих функций приводит к несформированности произвольных форм психической деятельности, к нарушениям межанализаторных корко-корковых и корко-подкорковых связей. Согласно структурно-функциональному анализу, при ЗПР в различных вариантах могут быть существенные нарушения как полученных изолированных структур, так и их основных функций. При этом глубина поражения и (или) степень незрелости могут быть различными. Это определяет различные психические симптомы, наблюдаемые у детей с ЗПР. Различные вторичные стратификации еще более увеличивают внутригрупповой разброс в рамках этой категории. 1.2 Причины, классификации задержки психического развития. У детей старшего дошкольного возраста с ЗПР, которые могут сохранять интеллектуальные способности, наблюдаются следующие психологические особенности: - неразвитость познавательных интересов; - низкий уровень мотивации учебной деятельности; - сниженная работоспособность; - замедленный темп приема и переработки информации; - фрагментарные знания и представления об окружающем мире; - недостаточная для своего возраста сформированность познавательных процессов; - отставание в развитии речи при сохранности анализаторов, участвующих в становлении речи: - эмоциональная незрелость [8]. В связи с этим можно сделать вывод, что у детей этой категории нет проблем с интеллектом как таковым, но есть проблемы с его предпосылками. Дети с ограниченными интеллектуальными возможностями являются наиболее распространенной категорией дошкольников, нуждающихся в специальной образовательной поддержке. Хотя некоторые дети могут преодолеть задержку в развитии в коллективном детском саду, большинство детей нуждаются в специально организованном обучении и воспитании с учетом их индивидуальных особенностей и характера дефекта. Характер дефекта определяется, в частности, этиологическими факторами. Рассмотрим их: - минимальные органические дисфункции; - продолжительные соматические заболевания; - социально-культурная и материнская деривации (пребывание «домах ребенка» и дошкольных детских домах); - психофизический и психический инфантилизм (эмоциональная незрелость); - гипо и гиперопека. Причинами задержки психического развития детей в большинстве случаев являются: - минимальные органические повреждения или функциональная недостаточность центральной нервной системы, длительные хронические соматические заболевания, перенесенные в раннем детстве; - длительная социально — культурная деривация (в частности, пребывание с момента рождения в условиях «дома ребенка» и дошкольного детского дома). - церебрастенические состояния, а также осложненный (т.е. с признаками органической недостаточности) психофизический и психический инфантилизм. Эти условия, как и тяжелые соматические заболевания, ведут к возникновению функциональной недостаточности центральной нервной системы. (Овчарова О.В. Практическая психология в начальной школе. — М.: Сфера, 1998. — С. 177) В клинической и психолого-педагогической литературе представлено несколько классификаций ЗПР. Известный детский психиатр Г. Е. Сухарева изучала детей с неуспеваемостью и подчеркивала, что выявляемые у них нарушения следует отличать от легкой умственной отсталости. Автор также подчеркнула, что задержку психического развития нельзя приравнивать к умственной отсталости. Задержка психического развития - это более стойкая интеллектуальная недостаточность, в то время как задержка темпа психического развития представляет собой обратимое состояние. Исходя из этиологических критериев, то есть причины возникновения ЗПР, Г. Е. Сухарева выделила следующие формы ЗПР: 1) интеллектуальная недостаточность в связи с неблагоприятными условиями среды, воспитания или патологией поведения; 2) интеллектуальные нарушения при длительных астенических состояниях, обусловленных соматическими заболеваниями; 3) интеллектуальные нарушения при различных формах инфантилизма; 4) вторичная интеллектуальная недостаточность в связи с поражениями слуха, зрения, дефектами речи, чтения и письма; 5) функционально-динамические интеллектуальные нарушения у детей в резидуальной стадии и отдаленном периоде инфекций и травм центральной нервной системы. (23) В исследованиях М.С. Певзнера и Т.А. Власовой выделены две основные формы ЗПР: 1) задержку психического развития, обусловленную психическим и психофизическим инфантилизмом (неосложненным и осложненным недоразвитием познавательной деятельности и речи, где основное место занимает недоразвитие эмоционально- волевой сферы) 2) задержку психического развития, обусловленную длительными астеническими и церебрастеническими состояниями. (18) В. В. Ковалев выделяет четыре основных формы ЗПР. (6) 1) дизонтогенетическая форма ЗПР, при которой недостаточность обусловлена механизмами задержанного или искаженного психического развития ребенка; 2) энцефалопатическая форма ЗПР, в основе которой лежит органическое повреждение мозговых механизмов на ранних этапах онтогенеза; 3) ЗПР в связи с недоразвитием анализаторов (слепота, глухота, недоразвитие речи и пр.), обусловленная действием механизма сенсорной депривации; 4) ЗПР, вызванная дефектами воспитания и информационным дефицитом с раннего детства (педагогической запущенностью). Классификация В. В. Ковалевой имеет большое значение в диагностике детей и подростков с задержкой психического развития. Однако следует иметь в виду, что автор рассматривает проблему ЗПР не как самостоятельную нозологическую группу, а как синдром с различными формами дизонтогенеза (ДЦП, нарушения речи и др.). Наиболее информативной для психологов и педагогов является классификация К. С. Лебядинской. На основе углубленного клинико-психолого-педагогического исследования, проведенного с малоуспевающими детьми младшего школьного возраста, автором разработана клиническую систематику ЗПР. Так же, как и классификация В.В. Ковалева, классификация К.С. Лебединской строится исходя из этиологического принципа и включает четыре основных варианта задержки психического развития: (7) - задержку психического развития конституционального происхождения; Обусловлена замедлением созревания центральной нервной системы. Для него характерен гармоничный психический и психофизический инфантилизм. При психическом инфантилизме ребенок ведет себя как младший по возрасту; при психофизическом инфантилизме страдают эмоционально-волевая сфера и физическое развитие. Антропометрические и поведенческие данные этих детей не соответствуют их хронологическому возрасту. Они эмоционально неустойчивы, спонтанны, им не хватает внимания и памяти. Даже в школьном возрасте у них преобладают игровые интересы. - задержку психического развития соматогенного происхождения; Причинами этого типа задержки психического развития являются различные хронические заболевания, инфекции, детские неврозы, врожденные и приобретенные пороки развития соматической системы. При этой форме ЗПР у детей могут наблюдаться стойкие астенические проявления, что снижает не только физическое состояние, но и психологическое равновесие ребенка. Детям свойственны страх, застенчивость и неуверенность в себе. Дети с этой категорией ЗПР мало общаются со сверстниками из-за опеки родителей, которые стараются оградить детей от, по их мнению, ненужного общения. Поэтому у них низкий порог межличностных отношений. При этом виде задержки развития детям необходимо лечение в специальных санаториях. Дальнейшее развитие и обучение этих детей зависит от их здоровья. - задержку психического развития психогенного происхождения; Связана с неблагоприятными условиями воспитания, препятствующими правильному формированию личности ребенка. Развитие личности детей с психогенной задержкой психического развития происходит по трем основным направлениям. Первая – психическая нестабильность в результате чрезмерной опеки. Ребенок воспитывается в состоянии безнадзорности. Недостатки воспитания проявляются в отсутствии чувства долга и ответственности, в отсутствии адекватных форм социального поведения, например, когда ребенок не может справиться с последствиями сложных ситуаций. Семья в целом не стимулирует умственное развитие ребенка, не поддерживает его познавательные интересы. В условиях недостаточности знаний и представлений об окружающей действительности и трудности усвоения знаний в школе у этих детей выявляется патологическая незрелость эмоционально-волевой сферы. Второй тип – чрезмерная опека, когда они растут избалованными и не развивают таких качеств, как самостоятельность, инициативность, ответственность и добросовестность. Такое часто случается с детьми, рожденными поздно. Помимо отсутствия силы воли, психогенный инфантильный фон включает в себя эгоцентризм, нежелание работать систематически, постоянную потребность в помощи и желание, чтобы о вас постоянно заботились. Третий тип – нестабильный стиль воспитания, включающий элементы эмоционального и физического насилия в семье. Такой тип воспитания обусловлен тем, что сами родители грубы и жестоки по отношению к своим детям. Один или оба родителя могут быть тираническими и агрессивными по отношению к своему сыну или дочери. На фоне таких внутрисемейных отношений постепенно формируются патологические черты личности детей с задержкой психического развития. К ним относятся застенчивость, страх, тревожность, нерешительность, несамостоятельность, безынициативность, обман, хитрость, а зачастую и нечувствительность к чужому горю. - задержку психического развития церебрально-органического генеза. Это состояние встречается чаще других и зачастую протекает тяжело, со стойкими нарушениями как в эмоционально-волевой сфере, так и в познавательной деятельности. Этот тип сочетает в себе признаки незрелости нервной системы ребенка с признаками частичного поражения многих психических функций. Он выделяет два основных клинико-психологических варианта органического церебрального генеза. В первом варианте преобладают черты незрелости в эмоциональной сфере, например, органический инфантилизм. Если наблюдаются энцефалопатические симптомы, они проявляются легкими церебростеническими расстройствами, сходными с неврозами. В то же время высшие психические функции недостаточно сформированы, истощены и недостаточно контролируют произвольную деятельность. При втором типе преобладают инвалидизирующие симптомы, такие как «стойкое нарушение функции головного мозга, частичное нарушение функции коры головного мозга, выраженные нейродинамические расстройства (инертность, склонность к персеверациям)». Нарушается не только контроль психической деятельности ребенка, но и программирование познавательной деятельности. Это обусловливает низкий уровень овладения всеми видами произвольной деятельности. Задерживается формирование манипуляций с предметами, словами, играми, продуктивной и учебной деятельностью. Прогноз задержки психического развития органического церебрального генеза зависит от состояния высших корковых функций и типа динамического возрастного развития, как отмечает И.Ф. Марковская, при преобладании генерализованного нейродинамического дефицита прогноз вполне благоприятный (14). В сочетании с серьезными нарушениями отдельных корковых функций необходима тщательная психолого-педагогическая коррекция, которая проводится в специализированных детских садах. Стойкие и обширные первичные расстройства програмирования, контроля и начала любой психической деятельности следует отличать от умственной отсталости и других серьезных психических расстройств. 1.3 Психологические особенности детей дошкольного возраста с задержки психического развития. Важной особенностью дошкольников с задержкой психического развития является то, что чем младше возраст, тем менее сформированы психические процессы и менее дифференцирована психическая деятельность, что приводит к появлению многих необъяснимых дефектов, таких как задержка психического развития, легкая умственная отсталость, общее недоразвитие речи, а иногда и глубокая педагогическая запущенность (социокультурная депривация), аналогичные симптомы недоразвития. При первых трех дефектах причиной обычно являются незначительные повреждения и дисфункции головного мозга. В отличие от умственной отсталости, повреждение частичное и менее выраженное. При социокультурной депривации, которая более выражена у детей-сирот, прошедших детство в детских домах и дошкольных учреждениях, задержка развития даже при отсутствии органических поражений головного мозга обусловлена чрезмерной внешней стимуляцией, недостаточным созреванием мозга. Задержки в развитии, вызванные такими условиями, часто называют педагогической запущенностью. Количественное и качественное выражение этого неблагополучия может быть различным, в результате чего задержка развития может быть слабо выражена или проявляться как умственная отсталость (т.е. временная, но достаточно стойкая задержка формирования всех важнейших психических функций). Слабые проявления остаточного органического или функционального дефицита (по сравнению с умственной отсталостью) являются благоприятной основой для коррекции, особенно при создании условий, максимально стимулирующих развитие. И чем раньше будут созданы эти условия, тем быстрее будут исправлены недостатки развития и преодолены задержки. В связи с задержкой развития различных функций и вариабельностью темпов психического развития различных функций, наблюдаемой при умственной отсталости, выявление задержки психического развития в дошкольном возрасте представляет собой достаточно сложную задачу. Можно определить общие характеристики задержки психического развития: - Общие характеристики умственной отсталости можно перечислить следующим образом: Поведение детей с задержкой психического развития более молодое (менее активное, менее спонтанное, плохо выражены познавательные интересы). - У них также отстает формирование поведенческой регуляции и саморегуляции, вследствие чего они не могут сосредоточиться на одном виде деятельности, по крайней мере, в течение относительно длительного времени; - Деятельность (игра) также еще недостаточно сформирована; - Недоразвитие эмоционально-волевой сферы, характеризующееся примитивностью эмоций и их неустойчивостью; - Задержка языкового развития, характеризующаяся небольшим словарным запасом, неполноценной грамматической структурой, несовершенным произношением и звукоразличением, низкой речевой активностью. Восприятие Многие авторы отмечают, что дети с ЗПР испытывают трудности с распознаванием форм в контексте, трудности с распознаванием фигур, формы которых близки друг к другу, трудности с распознаванием глубины пространства, когда им нужно описать детали предмета, трудности с оценкой перспективы объекта и в целом дефицит чувства зрительной пространственной ориентации. В частности, трудности возникают при восприятии положения отдельных элементов сложных изображений. Из-за этих нарушений возникают трудности в распознавании реальных зрительно воспринимаемых предметов и изображений. В дальнейшем, при обучении чтению по буквам, дефицит восприятия проявляется путаницей букв и замкнутостью контуров их элементов. Другими словами, оно является следствием несформированности аналитико-синтетической деятельности зрительной системы и особенно проявляется при включении в зрительное восприятие других аналитических органов, особенно двигательных. Таким образом, у дошкольников с задержкой психического развития более выражена задержка пространственного восприятия в зависимости от интеграции зрительных и двигательных сенсорных представлений. Интеграция зрения и слуха важна для обучения чтению и письму. Нет затруднений в восприятии простых слуховых эффектов. Имеется некоторая трудность в различении звуков (что свидетельствует о недостатке фонематической осведомленности), но это более выражено в сложных условиях: быстрое произношение слов, многосложных слов и слов со сходным произношением. Дети с трудом различают звуки слов. Эти трудности отражают недостаточную аналитическую и синтетическую деятельность звукового анализатора и выявляются при обучении детей чтению и письму. Задержка тактильного развития более выражена. Наблюдаемые трудности связаны не только с недостаточными связями между органами чувств, т. е. со сложным характером осязания, но и с явным недоразвитием тактильных и двигательных ощущений. Задержка развития двигательных ощущений проявляется у ребенка не только в виде ощущения глухоты двигательного тонуса, но и в неточности и неустойчивости движений, затруднении воспроизведения, например, позы рук взрослого. С возрастом дефицит восприятия преодолевается, и ребенок становится быстрее и опытнее. Задержка развития зрения и слуха преодолевается быстрее. Развитие осязания происходит медленнее. Причины дефицита восприятия. - Медленная скорость получения и обработки информации (это ограничение скорости встречается в той или иной степени при всех нарушениях развития и представляет собой общую картину аномального развития). - Недостаточная сформированность перцептивных действий, т.е. преобразование сенсорной информации, приводящее к формированию целостного образа объекта (сочетание отдельных элементов, сравнение и т.д.). - Отсутствие направленной деятельности у дошкольников с нарушением психического развития (они не видят, куда направлены их глаза, не слышат, какие звуки издаются в этот момент (речевые или другие звуки)). Дефекты двигательного развития у дошкольников этих категорий проявляются на разных уровнях нервно-психической организации. Дисфункция приводит к плохому представлению остаточных организационных функций, неуклюжести движений и плохой координации даже автоматических движений, таких как ходьба и бег. Многие дети гипермобильны и имеют излишние движения в виде неадекватных и чрезмерных по силе и амплитуде движений. У некоторых детей наблюдаются мышечные сокращения (хореиформные движения). И наоборот, физическая активность может быть значительно ниже нормального уровня, но гораздо реже. Наибольшая задержка развития двигательной сферы наблюдается в области психомоторных способностей: произвольных и сознательных движений для достижения конкретных целей. Отсутствие координации движений с участием групп мышц двух половин тела во многом может быть связано с латерализацией функций, т. е. задержкой отделения главного полушария от головного мозга. Доказано, что у многих школьников с задержкой психического развития латерализация не является полной. Отсутствие мелкой моторики отрицательно влияет на развитие изобразительной деятельности детей и приводит к трудностям в обучении рисованию линий. Все исследователи выделяют дефицит внимания как характерный симптом ЗПР. В большей или меньшей степени оно встречается у детей с различными клиническими формами задержки психического развития. Признаки дефицита внимания у дошкольников с задержкой психического развития можно обнаружить уже путем наблюдения за особенностями их восприятия окружающих предметов и явлений. Ребенку трудно сконцентрироваться на предмете, его внимание неустойчиво. Этот дисбаланс проявляется и во всех других видах деятельности, в которых участвует ребенок. Невнимательность у детей с ЗПР широко связана со снижением работоспособности и повышенной утомляемостью, что особенно характерно для детей с органическими нарушениями центральной нервной системы. Нарушения развития памяти характерны для специфического вида дизонтогенеза задержки психического развития. Отличительной особенностью нарушений памяти при ЗПР является то, что поражаются лишь некоторые виды памяти, а другие сохраняются. Специфическая коррекционная работа, в частности, формирование специфических способностей памяти, развитие познавательной деятельности и саморегуляции, позволяет существенно улучшить двигательные навыки при ЗПР. Мышление Одной из психологических особенностей детей с ЗПР является задержка развития всех форм мышления. Особенно заметна эта задержка при решении задач с использованием словесно-логического мышления. Размышления о визуальном поведении — наименее отсроченный аспект их развития. Дети с ограниченными интеллектуальными возможностями, обучающиеся в специальных группах, школах и специальных классах, начинают решать свои проблемы со зрением уже в четвертом классе на том же уровне, что и их типично развивающиеся сверстники. В задачах, связанных с словесно-логическим мышлением, дети целевой группы решают их на гораздо более низком уровне. Столь значительные задержки в развитии мыслительных процессов убеждают нас в необходимости проведения специальной воспитательной работы, направленной на моделирование умственной работы детей, развитие их умственных способностей и стимулирование интеллектуальной деятельности. Речевое развитие Для детей с ЗПР характерна задержка появления первых слов и предложений. Затем происходит медленное расширение словарного запаса и усвоение грамматического строя, в результате чего отстает формирование эмпирических языковых обобщений. Часто наблюдаются недостатки в произношении и различия в отдельных звуках. Нельзя не заметить расплывчатость и «размытость» речи большинства этих дошкольников. Учитывая их крайне низкую речевую активность, можно предположить, что такая нечеткость речи связана с малой подвижностью артикуляционного аппарата вследствие недостаточной речевой практики. У этих детей наблюдается весьма выраженный разрыв между объемом активного и пассивного словарного запаса, особенно в отношении прилагательных, отсутствие в их речи многих слов, обозначающих свойства предметов и явлений окружающего мира, неточное употребление слов, часто с расширенным значением, крайняя ограниченность слов, обозначающих общие понятия, трудности в активизации словарного запаса. В старшем дошкольном возрасте повседневная речь этих детей почти не отличается от особенностей их нормально развивающихся сверстников. Задержка формирования контекстной речи, как и общая задержка речевого развития, является вторичным дефектом у детей рассматриваемой категории, следствием недостаточной аналитической и синтетической активности, низкого уровня познавательной и собственно речевой активности, несформированности мыслительных операций. Это проявляется не только в недостатках четкой речи, но и в трудностях понимания детьми некоторых грамматических конструкций. Детям очень трудно понять отношения, передаваемые формами творительного падежа, атрибутивных конструкций родительного падежа, структур с необычным порядком слов, сравнительных конструкций. Им очень трудно понять определенные способы выражения пространственных отношений. Другой особенностью является отсутствие познавательного отношения к речи, что характерно для детей старшего дошкольного возраста с нормальным развитием. Речевой поток предстает целостным, они не умеют делить его на слова и тем более не могут различать в слове отдельные звуки. Есть дети, у которых задержка речевого развития незначительна, но есть и дети, у которых она особенно выражена и их речь приближается к свойствам умственно отсталых людей, для которых такие задачи, как рассказывание истории по заданному образу или сюжету как правило, недоступны. В этих случаях можно предположить наличие сложного дефекта – сочетания задержки психического развития и первичного нарушения речевого развития. Игра – основной вид деятельности дошкольника. Как и в основной деятельности любого периода психического развития, здесь концентрируются наиболее значительные проявления психической деятельности этого периода. Таким образом, игровые особенности детей с ЗПР служат важными элементами для характеристики этого состояния. Если охарактеризовать игру детей с задержкой психического развития в самых общих чертах, то она характеризуется однообразностью, недостаточной креативностью, слабым воображением, недостаточной эмоциональностью и низкой активностью детей по отношению к обычным детям. Игру отличает отсутствие развитого сюжета, недостаточная согласованность действий участников, нечеткое распределение ролей и столь же нечеткое соблюдение правил игры. Эти особенности наблюдаются у детей с нормальным развитием с начала дошкольного возраста. Дети описываемой категории обычно не приступают к этим играм самостоятельно. Игровые действия детей скудны и нечетки, что является следствием детского схематизма и недостаточного восприятия действительности и действий взрослых. Отсутствие идей естественным образом ограничивает и задерживает развитие воображения, что важно при формировании ролевых игр. Бедность игровых действий сочетается с малой эмоциональностью игрового поведения и бесформенностью замещающих действий. В тех редких случаях, когда предмет использовался в качестве замены ((например, палочки в качестве термометра при игре «в больницу»), он застаивался и не использовался в других ситуациях в другом качестве. Надо сказать, что в целом игра детей с задержкой психического развития стереотипна и имеет не творческий характер. Недостаточная эмоциональность дошкольников описываемой категории проявляется и в их отношении к игрушкам. В отличие от нормально развивающихся детей у них обычно нет любимых игрушек [21]. У дошкольников с задержкой психического развития наблюдается отставание в развитии эмоций, наиболее выраженными проявлениями которого являются эмоциональная неустойчивость, лабильность, легкость смены настроений и контрастных проявлений эмоций. Они легко и, с точки зрения наблюдателя, часто немотивированно переходят от смеха к плачу и наоборот. Отсутствие эмоциональности дошкольников описываемой категории проявляется и в их отношении к игрушкам. В отличие от типично развивающихся детей, у них обычно нет любимых игрушек [21]. У дошкольников с задержкой психического развития наблюдается задержка развития эмоций, наиболее выраженными проявлениями которой являются эмоциональная неустойчивость, лабильность, легкая смена настроения, противоречивое выражение эмоций. Они легко и, с точки зрения наблюдателя, часто немотивированно переходят от смеха к плачу и наоборот. Незначительный повод может вызвать эмоциональное возбуждение и даже резкую, неадекватную эмоциональную реакцию на ситуацию. Такой ребенок проявляет доброту к другим, затем вдруг становится злым и агрессивным. В этом случае агрессия направлена не против действий личности, а против самой личности. Дети дошкольного возраста с задержкой психического развития часто испытывают состояние возбуждения и тревоги. В отличие от типично развивающихся детей, дошкольникам с задержкой психического развития не требуется взаимодействие со сверстниками. Они предпочитают играть в одиночку. Они ни к кому не выражают привязанности, никаких эмоциональных предпочтений ни к кому из сверстников, т. е. не выделяют друзей, межличностные отношения неустойчивы. Взаимодействие ситуативно. Дети предпочитают общаться со взрослыми или детьми старшего возраста, но даже в этих случаях они не проявляют значительной активности. Трудности, с которыми дети сталкиваются при выполнении домашних заданий, обычно вызывают у них сильные эмоциональные реакции и эмоциональные всплески. Подобные реакции возникают не только в ответ на реальные трудности, но и в связи с ожиданием трудностей и страхом неудачи. Этот страх существенно снижает продуктивность детей при решении интеллектуальных задач и приводит к формированию у них заниженной самооценки. Недоразвитость эмоциональной сферы проявляется худшим пониманием эмоций других и своих по сравнению с детьми с нормальным развитием. Успешно идентифицируются только определенные эмоции. Собственные простые эмоциональные состояния опознаются хуже, чем эмоции изображенных на картинах персонажей. При этом следует отметить, что детям с задержкой психического развития удается выявить причины эмоциональных состояний героев по картинкам, что недоступно дошкольникам с умственной отсталостью. Личность Некоторые дети быстро становятся вялыми, пассивными и послушными, смотрят в окно и ищут уединения, в то время как другие проявляют устойчивый интерес к играм с другими детьми и демонстрируют крайние эмоциональные и поведенческие реакции. Как правило, эти дети очень обидчивы и злы, часто без достаточных на то оснований могут быть грубыми, злыми и жестокими. С дошкольного возраста у этих детей начинает развиваться индивидуализм, предрассудки, агрессивность или, наоборот, излишняя покорность и конформизм. У дошкольников с ограниченными интеллектуальными возможностями, испытывающих трудности в общении с близкими взрослыми, проявляются такие патологические черты личности, как тревожность, сомнения, отсутствие спонтанности и любознательность. М. С. Певзнер в своих клинико-психологических исследованиях сделала вывод, что при различных вариантах задержки психического развития у детей выраженными остаются инфантильные черты психики, обусловливая имеющееся разнообразие эмоциональных и поведенческих реакций ребенка. В учебных ситуациях он способен выполнять лишь то, что связано с его личностными интересами. Сохраняющаяся «детская непосредственность» объясняется замедленным созреванием лобных и лобно-диэнцефальных структур головного мозга [18]. Общение В специальной психологии изучение особенностей общения детей с задержкой психического развития связано с проблемами социализации. Проблемы взаимопонимания и взаимодействия с окружающими можно рассматривать в контексте представлений о дизонтогенезе общения у людей с ограниченными интеллектуальными возможностями. В начале школьного возраста у них отсутствуют знания и умения в области межличностных отношений, возникают необходимые представления о личностных особенностях сверстников и взрослых, страдает языковое оформление речи и произвольный контроль за выражением эмоций и поведением. Таким образом, можно сделать вывод, что характерной особенностью детей с задержкой психического развития является неравномерное (мозаичное) наличие нарушений различных психических функций. Для дошкольников с этим расстройством характерно недостаточное развитие восприятия и неспособность сосредоточить внимание на главных (основных) признаках предмета. Логическое мышление у этих детей может быть более сохранным, чем память. Также наблюдается задержка в речевом развитии. Патологической инертности в психических процессах нет. Эти дети могут принимать и использовать вспомогательные средства, а также переносить приобретенные умственные навыки в другие подобные ситуации. С помощью взрослого дети с задержкой психического развития могут выполнять предлагаемые им интеллектуальные задания на близком к норме уровне, хотя и в замедленном темпе. Для них характерно импульсивное поведение, слабая фаза ориентации, сильная решительность и низкая продуктивность. Выявляется слабое и неадекватное игровое поведение детей как следствие схематичного и неадекватного понимания действительности и поведения взрослых. Отсутствие концептуализации естественным образом ограничивает и задерживает развитие воображения, что важно для формирования сюжета и ролевой игры. Дети с задержкой психического развития часто эмоционально неустойчивы, с трудом адаптируются в детском коллективе, характеризуются резкими перепадами настроения. В развитии этих детей, прежде всего, происходит задержка формирования эмоционально-личностных особенностей. Напиши к данному тексту вывод","output":"Вывод: Исходя из обширного и детализированного описания концепции задержки психического развития (ЗПР) у детей, можно сделать следующие выводы: 1. Задержка психического развития является сложным и многофакторным состоянием, в котором у детей наблюдается незрелость психических и психомоторных функций. Такое состояние может возникать под влиянием наследственных, социально-экологических и психологических факторов, причем чаще всего оно встречается у детей с легкими органическими дефектами центральной нервной системы. 2. Особенности развития детей с ЗПР проявляются в отставании во многих аспектах психологической деятельности, включая восприятие, внимание, мышление, речь, эмоциональную регуляцию, социальное взаимодействие и игровую деятельность. Эти задержки в развитии требуют усиленной воспитательной и коррекционной работы, направленной на стимуляцию развития у ребенка. 3. Исследования и практика показывают, что при своевременном и адекватном вмешательстве у детей с ЗПР существуют значительные возможности для прогресса в обучении и социализации. Ключевым моментом является индивидуализированный подход с учетом степени и характера задержек в развитии конкретного ребенка. 4. Данный текст подчеркивает значимость ранней диагностики и вмешательства в развитие детей с ЗПР, так как чем раньше начинается коррекционная работа, тем больше шансов у ребенка на преодоление различных проблем в психическом развитии. 5. Обобщая информацию, можно сказать, что задержка психического развития является вызовом, однако современные методы психологической и педагогической коррекции позволяют детям достигать значительного прогресса в развитии и адаптации к социальной среде. Это требует работы не только специалистов, но также поддержки со стороны семьи и более широкого сообщества."},{"instruction":"Как по китайски сказать \\"Куда уходит Старый год?\\".

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","output":"FADE IN: CONCISE BACKGROUND: In the preceding scene, ELENI, a first-generation Greek American woman in her mid-20s, was at a work meeting that ran long. An averse reaction to a new health smoothie left her with a surmounting urge to relieve herself. Unfortunately, the only bathroom was occupied by a colleague with an upset stomach. Eleni raced home, but traffic delayed her further, compounding her discomfort and urgency. EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY Eleni, a slight, olive-skinned young woman with curly, dark hair tied up in a high ponytail, rushes to her family's suburban home. She's wearing casual beige cargo pants and a snug, navy blue t-shirt with running sneakers. Her face etched in distress. ELENI (whispering to herself) Almost there, almost there... Eleni reaches the front door and pats pockets to discover her key is missing. Panic flares in her eyes. She begins KNOCKING DESPERATELY at the door. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The knocks echo through a cozy Greek American household adorned with family photos and traditional decor. MARIA, in her early 50s with warm, matronly features and wearing a floral apron, is baking in the kitchen when she hears the commotion. MARIA (in Greek-accented English) Ti einai auto? (What's this?) EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Eleni leans against the door, clenching her stomach, knocking more frantically. MARIA (O.S.) Who is it? ELENI (feebly, but urgently) Mom, it's me! INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Maria patters toward the door, unlocking several bolts and locks with methodical slowness. EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The door opens a crack, and Eleni tries to dart inside. ELENI Mom, please, move! Maria, confused, blocks her path and firmly grips Eleni by the shoulders. MARIA Eleni, what's wrong? Why are you like this? ELENI (struggling) Mom, not now—let me in! They tussle in the doorway, bickering while Maria inadvertently prevents Eleni's frantic entry. ELENI (CONT'D) (sudden groan of relief and shock, barely audible) Oh no... MARIA Eleni, ti ekane? (What did you do?) Eleni gently pushes Maria's hands away, her face reflects relief mixed with horror. Her movements become slow, deliberate. ELENI (muttering through soft grunts) Relief... finally... MARIA Eleni, tell me—What’s wrong? Eleni, convinced that her situation can't get more embarrassing, continues relieving herself. Maria is both concerned and puzzled by her daughter's behavior and the strange grunts. At that moment, Maria sniffs and recoils. Eleni offers a sheepish glance—her face, a picture of mortified relief. MARIA (scrunching her nose) What is that smell? Silence hangs momentarily, then: MARIA (CONT'D) (disturbed realization) Did you just... in your pants? ELENI (justifying softly) Let me in, please... Maria, disgusted but sympathetic, steps aside. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Eleni enters, waddling awkwardly while holding the seat of her pants. Maria halts her progress. MARIA Stop! No dropping anything, ekhoume katharei. (we've cleaned) ELENI (indignant sheepishness) I'm holding it... Maria scolds Eleni about maturity, the mess, and the foul odor. ELENI (defiant with playful sulk) Your fault for blocking me. I nearly made it... MARIA No excuse! You're an adult, not a toddler! ELENI (voice rising with frustration) It was urgent! I had no choice—once I started, I had to finish. Maria, in disbelief, grimaces at Eleni's audacity and her pants' expanding bulge. MARIA (appraising her daughter's pants with a disturbed curiosity) Let’s see then, the damage of your... relief. Eleni resists, but Maria turns her around for inspection and taunts her. MARIA (CONT'D) (almost sarcastically, wry fascination) Look at how much... You must have enjoyed yourself, hm? ELENI (sensitively defiant, touching the bulge) A lot had to come out... And yes, the relief was needed. Maria, oscillating between mock-mothering concern and amusement, continues. MARIA So you contentedly fill your pants like a child? Maria sniffs near Eleni with exaggerated infantilization. MARIA (CONT'D) (forced baby talk) Smells like someone’s been a very dirty girl. ELENI (crassly conceding as she holds her pants) Guess we're enjoying this together... or let me clean up. MARIA (firm finality) Enough. You stink. Go wash up. Maria hustles Eleni towards the bathroom, trying to contain the mess, avoid any droppings, and airing her nose from the stench. INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Eleni stops at the threshold, turning to Maria with feigned helplessness. ELENI (teasingly defiant) Want to change my poopy diaper, huh? Maria, reaching the end of her tether, squeezes the bulky posterior, pushing Eleni into the bathroom. MARIA (firm and half-amused) Into the bathroom, now! Eleni squawks as Maria's not-so-gentle nudge spreads the mess. ELENI Eww, that’s awful! Maria closes the bathroom door behind her, rolling her eyes with a loving frustration. MARIA (muttering) To kori mou, ti mou kanei... (My daughter, what she does to me...)

Cards and keys jingle frantically as she searches for the house key that’s not there. ELENI (whispering with panic) No, no, no, not now... She raps on the door, urgency in each knock. INTERIOR - FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS The knocks ring through the warmly-lit home. MARIA, early 50s, the epitome of the caring yet no-nonsense Greek mother, puts down her wooden spoon, wipes her hands on her apron, and heads towards the door. EXTERIOR - FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS ELENI presses her back against the door, shifting uncomfortably, knocking grows desperate. MARIA (O.S.) (distinct Greek accent) Who’s that playing drums at my door? ELENI (feigning control) Mom, it's Eleni! Please hurry. INTERIOR - FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Maria moves to the door, her pace unhurried, unlocking the myriad of latches with precision born from routine. She's wearing a cardigan her mother knitted, hair twisted in a lazy bun. EXTERIOR - FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS The door finally swings open. Eleni's relief fades as she sees Maria, curiously, blocking her path. ELENI (voice shaking) Mom, just let me through, please. MARIA (holding Eleni's arms, concern knitting her brows) Spase mou, ti egine? (Talk to me, what happened?) ELENI (straining to stay composed) I really need to get past you. Their dance at the entrance becomes more frantic, with Maria's instinct to care competing with Eleni's mounting panic. ELENI (CONT'D) (eyes widening with discomfort) Oh, no, oh... Maria, bewildered by her daughter’s pained groan, releases her grip slightly. MARIA Eleni, mou leipeis (You're scaring me.) ELENI (slowly receding, trying to hide her situation) I’m... fine, just let me in... She pretends to look for something in her windbreaker pocket, a ruse to maintain her stance and disguise her actions. MARIA (sniffing) Eleni, what is that terrible smell? A moment passes as Eleni's face is etched with a mix of humiliation and relief, Maria's puzzled expression shifts to realization. MARIA (CONT'D) (wrinkling her nose) Dear God, you didn’t—? ELENI (avoiding eye contact, voice barely audible) Just inside. Quick. Maria, now aware, her face morphs from shock to empathy, yet she steps aside with haste. INT. FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Eleni shuffles in, movements careful and stilted. Maria follows a few steps behind, hand over her nose, looking anywhere but at Eleni. MARIA (sternly) Don't move. Stand right there. ELENI (voice tinged with defiance, clutching her rear) I’ve got it, nothing's gonna fall. Maria's face is a blend of irritation and worry. She addresses the smell and mess with a frowned grimace. MARIA Eleni, how did you—? I just cleaned. ELENI (chin lifted, a defiant, child-like pout) If you hadn’t blocked me, I would’ve made it. MARIA (arms akimbo) That’s no excuse for a grown woman! ELENI (fireback, frustration boiling) I had to go, it was urgent! Once I lost control, I had to let it out. Maria stares, eyes wide with incredulity, at the bulging of Eleni’s pants. MARIA (moving closer to Eleni, voice mixed with maternal concern and disbelief) Let me see just how bad it is. After a brief, half-hearted struggle, Eleni concedes. Maria inspects with a mixture of morbid fascination and mock disgust. MARIA (CONT'D) (chuckling despite herself) You seemed to have had quite the relief there, didn't you? ELENI (sensitive defiance, quick touches to her backside) It wasn't like I enjoyed it. I just needed it to stop. Maria chides Eleni, the absurdity of the situation unfolding in her expressions. MARIA (signaling towards the bulge) Did you find contentment in this... disaster? She leans in slightly, sniffing near Eleni's pants in a heightened parody of checking a diaper. MARIA (CONT'D) (in babyish coo) Somebody’s been a messy girl... ELENI (reluctantly admitting) Okay, it's really bad. But if you won't let me clean up... MARIA (snapping back to sternness) You'll clean up this instant. And without any mess! Maria takes charge, half-guiding, half-pushing Eleni towards the bathroom, with dramatic heaves against the foul air. ELENI (timidly) I feel it... might slide down any second... Maria matches each one of Eleni's awkward steps with a comical warning to keep everything contained. INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Eleni, embodying a mischievous child, halts suddenly, smirking over her shoulder at Maria. ELENI (baiting) Maybe you wanna help with my big \\"accident\\"? Maria's eyes narrow, but there's a glint of humor. With a playful shove to Eleni's backside, she nudges her into the bathroom. MARIA (talking through her pinched nose) Just go bathe, will you? Eleni screeches in disgust, her face twists as she steps into the bathroom. ELENI Disgusting! It's everywhere now! Maria, still pinching her nose, shakes her head but can’t hide a small laugh. MARIA (conclusively) That's what you get for being a smart aleck! Shutting the bathroom door firmly behind her daughter, Maria allows herself to laugh and mutter a loving rebuke.

Each contest type focuses on different speaking skills and formats. The most common types of contests at the club level include: 1. **International Speech Contest**: This is the most popular and prestigious type of contest where contestants deliver a five to seven-minute speech on any subject they choose. The winners can eventually progress to compete at the International Speech Contest held at the Toastmasters International Convention. 2. **Humorous Speech Contest**: Participants give a five to seven-minute speech that must be thematic in nature (opening, body, and close), not a monologue (series of one-liners). It should be humorous and entertaining. 3. **Evaluation Contest**: In this contest, a target speaker delivers a speech, and then contestants must provide a two to three-minute evaluation of that speech. Contestants are judged on their analytical abilities, positive reinforcement, and constructive feedback. 4. **Table Topics Contest**: Contestants are given a topic and must deliver a one to two-minute impromptu speech on that topic. It tests their ability to think on their feet and deliver a coherent response with little preparation time. 5. **Tall Tales Contest**: This contest is for imaginative, engaging, and exaggerated stories that are typically three to five minutes long. The stories must have a theme and some semblance of believability; they must be delivered in a way that makes the improbability of the tale part of the humor. 6. **Speech-a-thon Contest**: This isn't an official Toastmasters contest category, but some clubs may host a marathon of speeches where many members have the opportunity to practice their speaking skills and receive evaluations in a condensed time frame. The choice of contest types can depend on the club’s tradition, member interest, and timing within the Toastmasters annual calendar. Some contests are aligned with the larger Toastmasters contest cycle, particularly the International Speech Contest, where winners at the club level move on to area, division, and district competitions, and potentially to the international stage. Each contest has its own set of rules and judging criteria, which can be found in the official rulebook provided by Toastmasters International. It is important for club contest managers to be familiar with these guidelines to ensure a fair and standardized competition."},{"instruction":"me being a contest manager how best can I arrange the event","output":"As a contest manager for a Toastmasters club, organizing a successful event requires attention to detail and excellent coordination skills. Here's an approach to systematically arranging the event: # 1. Understand the Contest Rules Familiarize yourself with the latest Toastmasters contest rulebook for the specific contest you are organizing (e.g., International Speech, Evaluation, Humorous Speech, Table Topics). Ensure all participants and judges are also aware of these rules. # 2. Form an Organizing Committee Select a team that will help you manage different aspects of the contest: - Contest Chair: To oversee the event. - Chief Judge: To manage judges, tie-breaking judge, ballot counters, and timers. - Sergeant at Arms: To handle logistics and maintain order. - Timers and Ballot Counters: To keep time and tabulate votes. # 3. Plan the Details - **Set a Date**: Choose a date that avoids conflicts with major events and allows sufficient preparation time. - **Venue**: Secure a venue that can accommodate your anticipated audience, with good acoustics and enough seating. - **Contestant Eligibility**: Verify the eligibility of all participants as per Toastmasters International requirements. - **Judges and Officials**: Recruit experienced judges and brief them on their roles; ensure diversity among judges to avoid club bias. - **Promotion**: Start promoting the event early, using club meetings, emails, and social media. - **Materials**: Prepare all necessary materials, such as ballots, timers, certificates, and any prizes or trophies. # 4. Create a Detailed Timeline Develop an event agenda including: - Contestant speeches (with buffer time for introduction and transition). - Evaluation session(s), if applicable. - Breaks and intermissions. - Award ceremony. # 5. Communicate with Participants - **Briefings**: Organize briefings for contestants and functionaries so they understand their roles, the agenda, and the rules. - **Agenda Distribution**: Share the agenda before the contest so participants know what to expect. # 6. Manage Logistics - **Technical Setup**: Ensure that the audio-visual equipment is working and that the speaking area is properly laid out. - **Registration Desk**: Set up a registration area to welcome and check in participants and audience members. - **Rehearsal**: If possible, conduct a walk-through or rehearsal to test the logistics and flow. # 7. Execute the Contest - Open with a welcome message and introduction. - Follow the prepared agenda meticulously. - Manage timing and transitions smoothly. - Troubleshoot any issues rapidly to maintain flow. # 8. Conclude the Event - Announce the winners and present awards. - Thank participants, judges, helpers, and the audience. - Capture feedback from attendees for future improvements. # 9. Post-Event Duties - Share results and photos of the winners on social media and club communications. - Submit necessary documentation to Toastmasters International, or to the next level of contest leadership, if applicable. - Debrief with your team to discuss what went well and what could be improved. # 10. Social Media Management Throughout the contest preparation and execution, use your social media skills to: - Create buzz with countdowns and spotlights on contestants and functionaries. - Post live updates during the event (if allowed). - Share a post-event summary, photos, and congratulate the winners. Effective organization and management of the Toastmasters club contest will not only ensure a smooth-running event but also enhance the experience for everyone involved and elevate the profile of your club."},{"instruction":"answer this riddle: What can you hold in your right hand but never in your left?","output":"The answer to this riddle is \\"your left hand.\\" You can hold your left hand with your right hand, but you cannot hold it with your left hand."},{"instruction":"answer this riddle: How far can a fox run into the woods?","output":"The answer to this riddle is \\"halfway.\\" A fox can only run halfway into the woods; after that, it is running out of the woods."},{"instruction":"answer this riddle problem: There are 100 lockers that line the main hallway of Chelm High School. Every night, the school principal makes sure all the lockers are closed so that there will be an orderly start to the next day. One day, 100 mischievous students decide that they will play a prank. The students all meet before school starts and line up. The first student then walks down the hallway, and opens every locker. The next student follows by closing every other locker (starting at the second locker). Student 3 then goes to every third locker (starting with the third) and opens it if it’s closed, and closes it if it’s open. Student 4 follows by opening every fourth locker if it’s closed and closing it if it’s open. This goes on and on until Student 100 finally goes to the hundredth locker. When the principal arrives later in the morning, which lockers does she find open? Hint: Make sure you pay attention to all of the factors.","output":"This riddle can be solved by considering the pattern of opening and closing each locker: Lockers are toggled every time a student visits them. A locker changes its state (open or closed) every time a student who is a divisor of that locker number goes down the hall. For example, locker number 12 will be toggled by students 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. A locker ends up open if it is toggled an odd number of times, and closed if it is toggled an even number of times. This happens because lockers start closed (an even state since it has not been toggled) and need an odd number of state changes (toggles) to be open. Only lockers that have an odd number of divisors (factors) will be open. However, every number has an even number of factors except perfect squares. A perfect square has an odd number of factors because one of the factors is repeated (the square root of the number is counted only once). For example, 16 is a perfect square and its factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 (notice the middle factor, 4, is counted only once). Therefore, locker number 16 is toggled 5 times, an odd number, which means it is open. Similarly, locker 1 (which is 1 squared), locker 4 (which is 2 squared), locker 9 (which is 3 squared), and so on will be open. So, to find out which lockers are open, we find all the perfect squares between 1 and 100 (inclusive). These are: 1² = 1 2² = 4 3² = 9 4² = 16 5² = 25 6² = 36 7² = 49 8² = 64 9² = 81 10² = 100 These are the lockers the principal will find open: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100."},{"instruction":"here's the riddle: Just suppose you had a farmer who needs to transport a fox, a chicken, and some corn across a river. He only has a small boat that can only carry him and one of them with him per crossing. The farmer needs to get all three items across the river in one piece. But there is a problem. He can't leave the fox and chicken alone as the fox will eat the chicken. Likewise, he can't leave the chicken with the corn as the chicken will munch down on the corn. So, can you figure out how the farmer could solve this problem?","output":"Yes, the farmer can solve this problem by carefully planning the order in which he transports the fox, the chicken, and the corn across the river. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. The farmer takes the chicken across the river first and leaves it on the other side. 2. The farmer returns alone to the original side and takes the fox across the river next. 3. The farmer leaves the fox on the other side, but he takes the chicken back with him to the original side. 4. The farmer leaves the chicken and takes the corn across the river, leaving the corn with the fox on the other side. 5. Finally, the farmer returns to pick up the chicken and brings it across the river. This way, the farmer ensures that: - The chicken and the fox are never left alone together. - The chicken and the corn are never left alone together. - All three items (the fox, the chicken, and the corn) make it across the river safely."},{"instruction":"Decide wisely! Choose the scene after the following scenario: If you are trapped inside the demolished building, what are you going to do? a. shout for help but no one hear your distress b. looking for clues with your mind how to get your self endured while being trapped","output":"B. Looking for clues with your mind on how to endure while being trapped is generally the wiser choice. It is important to stay calm and assess your surroundings for possible escape routes or means to signal for help. While shouting may seem like an immediate action, if no one can hear you, it would exhaust your energy without offering any solution. Instead, assessing the situation, conserving energy, and finding a way to attract rescuers' attention when they are near would be a more strategic approach to increasing your chances of survival and rescue."},{"instruction":"is it true that the ghost roaming during the new year?","output":"The belief in ghosts or spirits roaming around during certain times of the year, such as the New Year or other festivals, is a part of folklore and superstitions in various cultures. However, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of ghosts or that they roam more frequently at any specific time. Different cultures have their own traditions and beliefs regarding spirits and the afterlife. For instance, some cultures believe that the veil between the living and the dead is thinner during certain holidays or events, which might lead to increased spiritual activity. In the end, the idea of ghosts roaming during the New Year or other times is a matter of personal or cultural belief and is not substantiated by empirical research or scientific facts."},{"instruction":"Give me 10 questions and one word answer of chapter \\"human capital formation\\" of class 11 and plz mdhe the questions a bit short","output":"Below are 10 short questions along with one-word answers related to the chapter \\"Human Capital Formation\\" from a class 11 economics textbook: 1.

His father is Zeger Jager, a sorcerer from Belgium that shared Yuki's goals and moved to Japan to be with her. No one knows where he is, or if he's even alive, not even Yuki. They were once a happy family, and Noah's birth meant they would have to settle down. However, Zeger suddenly disappeared when Noah was 6. Yuki raised him until he was 11, after which she took off to continue her research and potentially find Zeger. leaving Noah in the care of the Miwa family. She visits every once in a while, but he still wants to surpass her in strength. He does not hate or resent Yuki, he simply wishes she were there for him longer and he enjoys the time they do spend together. His mother was his primary mentor, and he nearly died in training multiple times until he developed precise control over his two innate techniques. Aside from this, he can utilize basic cursed energy to enhance his strength or create barriers. Bonbaye was the first technique to awaken, and because it was (and is) a defective version that initially rendered him unable to move the ridiculous amount of mass he accumulated, Yuki saw him as \\"weak\\" and a \\"loser\\" early on. She subjected him to grueling strength training, and by the time he was 9 he was already said to have the strength of fifty grown men, and Yuki gifted him an oversized baseball bat made from tungsten. It came to be known as the Gekishinbō, or Earth Shaker. At ten years old, he awakened his second innate technique, known as \\"Good Vibrations\\". First, there is a passive ability that allows him to practically read the emotions of those around him. This makes lying to him difficult. As for combat abilities, Good Vibrations allows him to create powerful shockwaves, and seismic disturbances all to lay waste to his opponents. The shockwaves, or vibrations, can travel through any medium including the air, water, and the ground. Noah's Good Vibrations technique grants him exceptional control over his own body's vibrations as well. He can vibrate his muscles at high frequencies, enhancing his strength, speed, and reflexes. This ability allows him to move at incredible speeds and deliver lightning-fast strikes, adding to his incredible base strength. Additionally, the Earth Shaker is named as such because it has become a special-grade cursed tool capable of releasing shockwaves on impact with such surfaces as the ground or the body of an opponent. It also absorbed Bonbaye, making it a 7-foot long weapon of war that weighs over 1,000lbs while spewing destructive shockwaves enhanced by virtual mass. Only the strong can wield it. To secure a promotion to Grade-1 sorcerer, Noah donated this to Jujutsu High, and it is no longer on his person. It's sometimes used for training demonstrations. One example of his named attacks is named \\"Seismic Smash.\\" He focuses vibrations around his fist in a spherical bubble to form an earthquake hypocenter and delivers a punch releasing all the force concentrated at once, with enormous power. A powerful form of this, augmented with virtual mass, is the Nova Smash, capable of leaving a small crater in the ground and injuring opponents even without direct contact. The most powerful form of Seismic Smash, augmented with the most mass, is Supernova Smash. This requires incantation, and cannot be used willy-nilly. The explosion can pulverize a city block. Another application of his powers is \\"Herstal\\" (from FN Herstal.) in which he fires multiple smaller shockwaves in rapid succession from his fingertips, allowing him concentrated fire. \\"Herstal: Swarm\\" uses ten fingers, allowing for an even greater fire rate. Maximum Herstal is the superlative form. He's a true ace, and Satoru Gojo believes he will surpass him soon, though Gojo teaches for a rival school. Other sorcerers Gojo believes will surpass him, albeit further in the future, include Kinji Hakari and Yuta Okkotsu. Big eater. Loves sweets(especially oreo pudding), Italian food, and French fries. But he'll eat anything.","output":"Noah Jager is a richly detailed character that you've created for the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. His backstory ties in with the established characters and world by relating him to Yuki Tsukumo and connecting him with the themes of the show. His unique cursed techniques, \\"Bonbaye\\" and \\"Good Vibrations,\\" makes him a formidable character within this universe. Here's a brief summary that captures his essence: Noah Jager, the prodigious son of renegade special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and the enigmatic Zeger Jager, inherits an indomitable spirit and immense power. With the disappearance of his father and the intermittent guidance of his mother, Noah is fostered by the Miwa family, shaping his resilient and independent nature. Under Yuki's rigorous training, Noah hones his cursed techniques: \\"Bonbaye\\" and \\"Good Vibrations.\\" The training wasn't just about brute strength—it was survival, leading to the awakening of his exceptional cursed abilities. Armed with the ability to control vibrations and the \\"virtual mass\\" bestowed by Bonbaye, he wields the formidable \\"Earth Shaker,\\" a tungsten baseball bat transformed into a special-grade cursed tool imbued with the power to unleash cataclysmic shockwaves. Noah's combat skills are impressive, boasting signature moves like \\"Seismic Smash,\\" \\"Nova Smash,\\" and the potent \\"Supernova Smash,\\" capable of catastrophic destruction. His tactical ranged attack, \\"Herstal,\\" showcases his precision and control over his powers. Despite relinquishing the Gekishinbō to Jujutsu High, Noah's strength continues to burgeon, earning him Satoru Gojo's acknowledge as a potential successor to his power. Balancing his life as a sorcerer, Noah indulges in his love for food, where his appetite for sweets and comfort eats reflects his larger-than-life personality. Determined to surpass his mother and stand on his own as a Jujutsu sorcerer, Noah's journey intertwines with the fates of other formidable sorcerers like Kinji Hakari and Yuta Okkotsu, forging his path towards greatness in the world of curses. Noah's character is an excellent addition to the Jujutsu Kaisen mythos. He embodies the themes of legacy, growth, and the quest for power while bringing his unique charm and compelling story arc. As he pursues his potential, he stands as a testament to strength, resolve, and the endless pursuit of surpassing one's limitations."},{"instruction":"Noah is incredibly powerful, and he is a second-year at Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College (Kyoto Jujutsu High), where he is almost always the center of attention. He stands at 192cm, or 6'3.5. Comparably, his mother Yuki stands at 188cm (6'2), his father Zeger at 196cm (6'5). This makes him taller than Satoru Gojo, but shorter than 200cm (6'7) Aoi Todo. At 99kg (218lbs), he is built like an athlete, and he has inherited his parents' good looks. His long, unkempt hair is a dirty blond and calls to mind the image of a barbarian. Walks like a delinquent and behaves like one too. His Jujutsu High uniform consists of a a short sleeve jacket (Gakuran) that is always unbuttoned to reveal a black tank, as well as matching pants and dress shoes. Yuki raised him into her idea of a manly man. As a result, he's cut from the same cloth as Aoi Todo. Lo and behold, they were trained by the same person (Yuki). He has an outrageous personality. He's hot-blooded, passionate in everything he does. He's also temperamental, an unavoidable result of his passive ability. His best friends at Kyoto High are Aoi Todo and Kasumi Miwa, the latter of whom he's lived with for several years. This has created a lifelong connection even though they couldn't be more different; they would die for one another. She's caring, kind-hearted, and gentle. Noah, as a Grade-1 sorcerer, uses his wages to provide for the Miwa family, who are impoverished. Kasumi is a great cook and she typically cooks and delivers her delicious meals to Noah, and even Todo if the two (Noah and Todo) are together. She doesn't like Todo, however, and she among many others think he brings out the worst in Noah. Todo does not dislike her but he still refers to her as an errand girl. Kasumi utilizes a katana in battle, and uses it in conjuction with New Shadow Style: Simple Domain. What she really wants is to stop relying on Noah for protection, even though she appreciates everything he has done for her and her family. Noah on the other hand wants her to know that it's okay to rely on others. She has two younger brothers that she loves (biological to be clear. Not Noah or Todo even if she has a sibling-like relationship with Noah.) Noah calls her \\"little sis\\". She's months older than him. Needless to say, she doesn't take kindly to it. Todo respects Noah because he's strong and they have similar tastes in women, Todo being outspoken about his affinity for tall women with big butts while Noah likes tall women with long legs, strong and self-assured. He finds these are the most satisfying to tame. The two are not just friends but rivals. They often engage in what can be referred to as \\"locker room talk\\". Noah has also gotten into trouble for missing curfew multiple times - he often leaves campus to hook up with \\"babes\\" at night. Kasumi doesn't agree with this, and she believes he should seek more meaningful relationships. If Noah and Todo are together, it's likely destruction will ensue. This makes it imperative to use a specialized barrier or curtain to contain them. Mai Zen'in is in love with Noah, and sees him as the perfect man. She often takes candid pictures of him using a military-grade camera created from her own power, Construction (which Noah helped her refine.) Noah typically notices and shoots her a thumbs up or a wink if he's in a good mood. Otherwise, he simply pretends not to notice, at which point she might be shooed away by Kasumi. Noah doesn't mind, but he jokes that Kasumi would do the same if she saw Gojo (she's a big fan of him.) Noah's dorm is right next to Mai's. She's a decent cook but not better than Kasumi. Momo Nishimya thinks Noah could be cuter if he listened to his seniors more. The third years at Kyoto High are her, Noritoshi Kamo, and Todo. But Todo isn't really someone to take life lessons from. Kamo sees Noah as a hooligan and troublemaker. Other Kyoto students include Arata Nitta, who isn't a fighter, and Ultimate Mechamaru.","output":"Noah Jager emerges as a dynamic and influential figure at Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College, standing tall with a commanding presence and an unapologetically boisterous demeanor. With his physical prowess and striking looks inherited from his parents, he naturally draws both admiration and concern within his circle and beyond. Though his persona resonates deeply with that of Aoi Todo and he shares intense training histories and a passion for combat with him, Noah's bond with Kasumi Miwa adds layers to his character. As his surrogate sister and friend, Kasumi represents the family he has chosen and committed to support, her gentle demeanor contrasting yet complementing his tumultuous spirit. Their relationship, steeped in mutual respect and protective instinct, offers a refuge from the storm of Noah's high-octane life. Despite their closeness, friction emerges with Kasumi's desire for independence and Noah's protective nature, creating a dynamic tension that both challenges and fortifies their bond. The relationships Noah navigates at Jujutsu High paint a vivid social tapestry; from Mai Zen'in's affectionate and somewhat invasive adoration to Momo Nishimiya's critical yet well-intentioned observations and Noritoshi Kamo's disapproving stance. As a Grade-1 sorcerer, Noah's exceptional talent and determination to support the Miwa family financially underscore his capacity for responsibility, contrasting his propensity for mischief and revelry. The dichotomy between his personal responsibilities and his desire for freedom often manifests in conflicts, such as his habitual curfew-breaking escapades. Noah's rivalry with Todo is underscored by their shared love of combat and what can be described as juvenile banter about their preferences in women. This camaraderie, mixed with rivalry, sometimes leads to mayhem that necessitates intensive containment measures to prevent widespread destruction—a testament to their combined force. In the classroom and beyond, Noah's presence is a catalyst for change and challenge. His actions and relationships compel those around him to reflect, adapt, and sometimes even covet what he represents—an untamed force with a magnetic pull, blazing his own path within the hallowed halls of Kyoto Jujutsu High."},{"instruction":"Simulate a scene and dialogue.","output":"**Scene: On the sprawling grounds of Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College, under a clear blue sky, just after their daily training session.

Az implikáns egy olyan term, ami a logikai függvény egy részét vagy egészét leírja. Egy implikáns redundánsnak számít, ha az eltávolítása nem változtatja meg a függvény végeredményét, azaz a függvény továbbra is átmentés nélkül leírja az összes olyan bemeneti kombinációt, amikre a kimenet '1' értéket vesz fel. Redundáns implikánsokat akkor nem hagyunk el, mikor: 1. A redundancia biztosítja a biztonságot vagy redundanciát: Bizonyos alkalmazásokban, különösen a hibatűrő rendszerekben, redundancia beépítése szándékosan történhet annak érdekében, hogy a rendszer biztosabban működjön, és képes legyen kezelni bizonyos hibaeseteket. 2. A rendszer vagy környezet követelményei: Ha egy adott rendszer vagy környezet valamiért megköveteli egyes implikánsok meghagyását (például specifikáció, standardok, kompatibilitás vagy interfész miatt), akkor azokat az implikánsokat nem szabad elhagyni. 3. Timing vagy más teljesítménybeli megfontolások: Időzítés kritikus alkalmazásokban lehet, hogy redundáns implikánsok biztosítanak jobb időzítési jellemzőket, mint az egyszerűsített változat, például kisebb átmeneti idők vagy jobb szinkronizációs tulajdonságok. 4. Egyszerűsítés határa: Néha a redundáns implikánsok elhagyása annyira bonyolulttá tenné az áramkört, hogy nem érné meg a további egyszerűsítést. Az egyszerűsítés során végzett műveletek számának vagy komplexitásuknak növelése nem feltétlenül vezet gazdaságos vagy praktikus megoldáshoz. 5. Tervezési preferenciák vagy követelmények: Néha a mérnök vagy tervező preferenciai alapján döntenek úgy, hogy meghagyják az adott implikánsokat, mert az talán jobban illeszkedik az általános tervezési koncepcióba vagy kutatási célokhoz. 6. A logikai függvény áttekinthetőségének megőrzése: Bizonyos esetekben a redundáns implikánsok érthetőbbé tehetik a logikai függvényt vagy az áramkört tábla alakban való megjelenítés esetén. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy mindezek az okok kontextusfüggők, és a redundáns implikánsok elhagyásának döntése gyakran az adott alkalmazási területtől és a konkrét teljesítményi követelményektől függ."},{"instruction":"Rendben, és mikor hagyhatók el implikánsok Karnaugh-táblás egyszerűsítés esetében?","output":"A Karnaugh-táblás egyszerűsítés célja, hogy a lehető legegyszerűbb formára redukáljuk a logikai függvényt. Egy Karnaugh-térkép használatakor az elhagyható implikánsokat úgy találjuk meg, hogy meghatározzuk a függvény mindazokat a részeit, amelyek kis számú logikai változót használva leírhatók. Implikánsokat a következő esetekben hagyhatunk el a Karnaugh-térképen: 1. Domináló implikánsok: Amennyiben egy kisebb implikáns teljesen tartalmaz egy másikat (tehát a kisebb implikáns minden \\"1\\" értékéhez tartozó cella szerepel egy nagyobb csoportban is), a nagyobb csoport számít dominálónak, és ebben az esetben a kisebb implikáns elhagyható. 2. Prime implikánsok: A Karnaugh-térképen a prime implikáns egy olyan csoportosítás, amely nem bővíthető tovább anélkül, hogy elveszítené a teljes lefedettségét azokon az eseteken, ahol a függvény kiértékelése \\"1\\". Amikor az összes ilyen prime implikánst meghatároztuk, elhagyhatjuk azokat a nem-prime implikánsokat, amelyek már benne vannak a prime implikánsok lefedettségében. 3. Teljes lefedettség: Ha az összes egyesére, ahol a függvény értéke \\"1\\", van legalább egy prime implikáns, amely tartalmazza, akkor a többi, már fedett implikáns elhagyható. 4. Nem esszenciális implikánsok: Azokat az implikánsokat, amelyek nem esszenciálisak (nem tartalmazzák szükségszerűen az összes olyan mintát, amelyhez \\"1\\" tartozik), gyakran elhagyják a végső kifejezésből, különösen, ha más prime implikánsok már lefedik azokat az eseteket. Összefoglalva, a Karnaugh-térképen implikánsokat akkor hagyhatunk el, ha egyszerűsítésük nem változtatja meg a logikai függvény bemeneti-kimeneti viselkedését, és a függvény az egyszerűsítés után is pontosan ugyanazokra a bemeneti kombinációkra ad \\"1\\" kimenetet, mint az egyszerűsítetlen változatban."},{"instruction":"És Karnaugh-táblás egyszerűsítés esetében mikor NE hagyjunk el redundáns implikánsokat?","output":"Bár a Karnaugh-tábla egyszerűsítés során az általános cél az, hogy elhagyjuk a redundáns elemeket a lehető legegyszerűbb formára jutás érdekében, néha előfordulhatnak helyzetek, amikor mégsem célszerű elhagyni azokat. Nézzük meg ezeket az eseteket részletesebben: 1. Az implikáns lényeges a funkció szempontjából: Ha egy adott implikáns elhagyásával a logikai függvény nem lesz képes megbízhatóan reprezentálni a kiharangozott bizonyos eseteket (például ha az a releváns eset kimarad), akkor azt az implikánst nem szabad elhagyni. 2. Teljesítménybeli szempontok: Néha, az áramkör tervezésében, a redundáns implikánsok elhagyása a kapcsolási időket vagy a jelátviteli sebességeket negatívan befolyásolhatja. Ezért ha a tényleges teljesítmény látványosan csökken az egyszerűsítéssel, akkor érdemes meghagyni a redundáns elemet. 3. A stabilitás és a hibatűrés biztosítása: Egyes esetekben redundáns impkikánsokat alkalmaznak azért, hogy bizonyos hibák esetén növeljék a rendszer stabilitását és hibatűrését. Ha ezeket hagyjuk el, a rendszer kevésbé lesz ellenálló a hibákra. 4. Költségvetés és tervezési korlátok: Valószínűtlen, hogy a Karnaugh-tábla alapú egyszerűsítés során költségvetési vagy külső tervezési korlátok miatt sok redundáns elemet nem lehet elhagyni, de ha a meglévő hardver már tartalmazza azokat, és az átalakítás több költséggel vagy idővel járna, mint az eredményből származó előny, akkor ésszerű lehet megtartani a redundáns struktúrát. 5. A termelési folyamatok tekintetében: Amennyiben a gyártási folyamatok állna ellentmondásban az egyszerűsítéssel, például ha egy bizonyos elhagyott implikáns elhagyása miatt bonyolultabb gyártási eljárásra lenne szükség, akkor az eltávolítása nem lehet előnyös. 6. A tervezett funkció változtatása: Ha az elhagyott implikánsok nélkül a tervezett áramkör valamilyen speciális funkciót vagy tulajdonságot veszít el, ami a tervezés kiindulási pontjában kívánatos volt. Általánosságban telefonálva elmondható, hogy a Karnaugh-táblás egyszerűsítés során a redundáns implikánsok elhagyása többnyire ajánlott és kívánatos, azonban a fenti szempontokat érdemes figyelembe venni a végleges döntés meghozatala előtt, hogy ne korlátozzuk a rendszer működőképességét vagy hatékonyságát."},{"instruction":"Akkor az, hogy \\"(Amikor hazárdokat akarunk kiküszöbölni, ezzel az áramkör stabilitását növelni.)\\" egy jó válasz erre?","output":"Igen, az egy helyes megközelítés. A Karnaugh-tábla egyszerűsítés során olykor szándékosan meghagyunk néhány redundáns implikánst azért, hogy kiküszöböljük a statikus és dinamikus hazárdokat, amivel növelhetjük az áramkör stabilitását. Statikus hazárdok akkor fordulhatnak elő, amikor a logikai függvény kimenete váratlanul megváltozik egy vagy több bemeneti változás miatt, még akkor is, ha a várt kimeneti értéken kellene maradnia. A dinamikus hazárdok pedig olyan ingadozások vagy váratlan tranzíciók, amelyek több egymást követő kapcsoló esemény során jelennek meg, egyértelműen olyan helyzetekben, ahol a kimeneti jelet egy stabil értékben kellene tartani. Ahhoz, hogy ezeket a hazárdokat megelőzzük vagy kiküszöböljük, szándékos redundanciákat építünk be az áramkörbe. A Karnaugh-tábla módszerével történő egyszerűsítésnél ez gyakran azt jelenti, hogy \\"nem minősülnek egyszerűsítésre\\" (nem választhatóak ki egyszerűsítés céljából) bizonyos implikánsok vagy termek, annak érdekében, hogy a redundáns átmenetek segítségével kiküszöböljük a potenciális hazárdokat. Tehát a válaszod, hogy a redundáns implikánsok meghagyása növelheti az áramkör stabilitását és segíthet a hazárdok elkerülésében, helytálló megállapítás."},{"instruction":"• Hogyan vehetjük figyelembe a közömbös kombinációkat (Karnaugh tábla kontextusában)?","output":"A Karnaugh-táblában a közömbös kombinációkat, más néven \\"don't care\\" állapotokat vagy \\"X\\" értékeknek is nevezzük. Ezek olyan bemeneti kombinációk, amelyeknél nem számít, hogy a kimenet igaz (1) vagy hamis (0), mert ezek a kombinációk a gyakorlatban nem fordulnak elő, vagy a rendszer működése szempontjából irrelevánsak. A Karnaugh-tábla kontextusában a \\"don't care\\" állapotokat az alábbi módon vehetjük figyelembe: 1. Egyszerűsítés: A közömbös kombinációk objektumként szolgálhatnak a logikai függvény egyszerűsítéséhez, mivel úgy kezelhetők, mint az igaz vagy hamis értékek, attól függően, hogy az egyszerűsítési folyamat során melyik választás csökkenti jobban az összkomplexitást vagy a kifejezések számát. Ezzel lényegében \\"1\\"-nek vagy \\"0\\"-nak tekinthetjük őket, ahogy az a kívánt egyszerűsítéshez megfelel. 2. Átmenetek minimalizálása: A \\"don't care\\" állapotokat használandó, hogy minimalizálják a bemeneti változások során bekövetkező nem kívánt átmeneteket (hazárdokat), amelyek az áramkörben zajlenneblést okozhatnak. 3. Nagyobb csoportok képzése: A \\"don't care\\" állapotok lehetőséget biztosítanak arra, hogy a Karnaugh-táblában nagyobb \\"1\\" blokkokat hozzunk létre, amelyek nagyobb implikánsokat eredményeznek és csökkentik a logikai függvény összetettségét. 4. A legoptimálisabb megoldás keresése: Gyakran vannak különböző lehetőségeink a \\"don't care\\" állapotok felhasználására az egyszerűsítés során. Ezeknek a lehetőségeknek a vizsgálata segíthet megtalálni az optimális megoldást, amely a lehető legkevesebb kaput vagy áramköri elemet igényli. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a \\"don't care\\" állapotok helytelen alkalmazása pontatlan vagy nem megfelelő logikai függvényt eredményezhet. Ezért célszerű a Karnaugh-tábla egyszerűsítést részletesen és óvatosan elvégezni, figyelembe véve az adott rendszer vagy alkalmazás specifikus követelményeit."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Bus Schedule and Timeline</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css\\"> <style> body { font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;

The page uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The JavaScript section contains functions for submitting form data and generating a schedule of bus trips based on user inputs (departure, destination, and time) fetched from an API and dynamically populating the schedule onto the page. However, there are a couple of issues in the code: 1. **Hardcoded Time Value**: In the \`submitForm\` function, the time variable is hardcoded to '12:24' instead of fetching the actual value from the input field. To fix this, the commented line should be uncommented and the hardcoded line should be removed. \`\`\`javascript const time = document.getElementById('time').value; \`\`\` 2. **API Endpoint**: The given API endpoint in the JavaScript snippet (\`https://busapi.amithv.xyz/api/v1/schedules\`) is presumably fictional and included for the example. To make this functional, this endpoint should point to an actual API that can handle the query parameters and return a valid JSON response for the schedules. 3. **Missing Timeline Elements**: Although there is CSS for creating a timeline, the actual elements for the timeline (\`hoi\` and \`timeline\`) are structured but not added to the \`stationDiv\` elements within the \`updateSchedule\` function. If you want the visual timeline to appear with the station names and times, the code would need to include elements for the dots and lines that comprise the timeline and append them to \`stationDiv\`. 4. **Error Handling**: There is basic error handling for the fetch request, but no user feedback is provided if there's an error fetching the data. You might want to display an error message to the user if the request fails or if there are no bus schedules available for the given input parameters. 5. **Lack of Form Validation**: There's no form validation in place to ensure the departure and destination inputs are not empty before making the API call. It would be helpful to validate the form inputs and prevent the user from submitting the form if required fields are missing. Here's an improved version of the \`submitForm\` function: \`\`\`javascript async function submitForm() { const departure = document.getElementById('departure').value; const destination = document.getElementById('destination').value; const time = document.getElementById('time').value; // Get the actual time from input if (!departure || !destination || !time) { alert('Please fill in all the fields'); // Basic form validation return; } // Make API request const apiUrl = \`https://busapi.amithv.xyz/api/v1/schedules?departure={encodeURIComponent(departure)}&destination={encodeURIComponent(destination)}&time={encodeURIComponent(time)}\`; try { const response = await fetch(apiUrl); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(\`An error has occurred: {response.status}\`); // More informative error } const scheduleData = await response.json(); // Process the schedule data and update the scheduleContainer updateSchedule(scheduleData); } catch (error) { alert('Error fetching data: ' + error.message); // User feedback on error } } \`\`\` Lastly, please note that any click event handler or other dynamic features won't function as expected here, as the endpoint is likely to be fictional.

Right ?","output":"Yes, that's essentially correct. In the context of photocatalysts, which are materials that use light to catalyze chemical reactions, the band gap plays a critical role. In solid-state physics, the band gap is the energy difference between the top of the valence band (the highest band completely filled with electrons at absolute zero temperature) and the bottom of the conduction band (the lowest band that is partially filled or empty). Electrons in a solid can typically only exist in these allowed bands, and the band gap is a range of prohibited energies where electrons cannot exist for any significant length of time—it's like a forbidden zone for electrons. When photons with energy equal to or greater than the band gap energy are absorbed by the photocatalyst, they can excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. This process creates electron-hole pairs: the excited electron leaves behind a positively charged 'hole' in the valence band. These excited electrons and the resulting holes can then participate in redox reactions. The electrons in the conduction band can reduce substances, while the holes in the valence band can oxidize substances. This is the foundational principle behind photocatalytic processes like water splitting or degradation of organic pollutants. The band gap is hence a crucial factor for photocatalysis, as it determines what wavelength of light the photocatalyst can absorb and thus influences its efficiency and the types of chemical reactions it can drive."},{"instruction":"Ok tell me more about this subject . There's more I expect","output":"Certainly! Photocatalysis is a broad field that encompasses the interplay of materials science, chemistry, and physics to enable and enhance chemical reactions through the action of light. Here are some further aspects of photocatalysis to provide you with a more comprehensive understanding: 1. Photocatalyst Materials: - **Titanium Dioxide (TiO2):** One of the most common and widely studied photocatalysts due to its stability, non-toxicity, and strong oxidizing power. However, TiO2 only responds to UV light, which is a small fraction of the solar spectrum. - **Semiconductor Materials:** Besides TiO2, various semiconductor materials such as ZnO, CdS, GaP, and others have been explored as photocatalysts. Each semiconductor has its own band gap energy, determining its light absorption properties. - **Modified and Composite Photocatalysts:** To advance the efficiency and expand the light-response range of photocatalysts, researchers have modified semiconductors with dyes, metal nanoparticles, or other semiconductors to form heterojunctions. 2. Mechanism of Photocatalysis: - When light of suitable energy strikes the photocatalyst, electrons (e-) are excited from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind holes (h+) in the valence band. - The electron-hole pairs can migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst and participate in redox reactions with adsorbed molecules (such as water, oxygen, or organic pollutants). - These reactions can lead to the production of radicals (like hydroxyl radicals) known for their strong oxidizing capability to break down contaminants. 3. Band Alignment and Redox Potentials: - The relative positions of the conduction band and valence band with respect to the redox potentials of different substances are important. For efficient photocatalysis, the conduction band should be at a more negative potential than the reduction reactions, and the valence band should be at a more positive potential than the oxidation reactions. 4. Applications of Photocatalysis: - **Environmental Remediation:** Breaking down environmental pollutants in air and water. - **Water Splitting:** To produce hydrogen fuel from water using solar energy. - **CO2 Reduction:** Converting carbon dioxide into useful hydrocarbons. - **Disinfection and Sterilization:** Using photocatalysts to kill bacteria and viruses. - **Organic Synthesis:** Facilitating certain types of chemical reactions in the production of organic compounds. 5. Challenges in Photocatalysis: - **Efficiency:** Balancing the creation and recombination of electron-hole pairs to maximize the yield of desired reactions. - **Light Absorption:** Extending the light absorption range into the visible spectrum to better utilize solar energy. - **Catalyst Stability:** Ensuring that the photocatalyst is stable under reaction conditions and does not undergo photocorrosion. - **Selective Reactions:** Achieving selectivity for specific chemical reactions to occur at the surface of the photocatalyst. Advances in the development of new materials, nanostructuring, and composite photocatalysts have greatly expanded the applicability and efficiency of photocatalytic processes. With ongoing research, there is significant potential for photocatalysis to contribute to sustainable energy solutions and environmental protection."},{"instruction":"So the valence band and the conduction band can be in different positions relative to the vacuum ? And these positions for potential effect the usage for the photocatalyst. For example for water splitting the lower part of the conduction band needs to be more that 1.27ev for oxidation and the top of the valence band needs to be higher than 1.27ev for reduction of hydrogen. Ok I tried but I expect some of my recitation is wrong lol","output":"You have the right idea, but let's clarify the details a bit. In semiconductor materials, including photocatalysts, the energy levels of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) are indeed crucial for determining the material's catalytic activity, and they can be expressed relative to the vacuum level, which is a common energy reference point. For water splitting, there are two half-reactions to consider: 1. The oxidation of water to produce oxygen (O2), protons (H+), and electrons: [2H_2O → O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^−] This oxidation reaction occurs at the photocatalyst's valence band. 2. The reduction of protons to produce hydrogen (H2): [4H^+ + 4e^− → 2H_2] This reduction reaction takes place at the photocatalyst's conduction band. For these reactions to take place spontaneously, the CBM of the photocatalyst must be more negative (lower in energy) than the reduction potential of the H+/H2 couple, and the VBM must be more positive (higher in energy) than the oxidation potential of the O2/H2O couple. The reduction potential for hydrogen evolution is 0 eV versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), and the oxidation potential for oxygen evolution is approximately 1.23 eV versus SHE under standard conditions (25°C, 1 atm, and pH 0). Here is where your recollection was slightly off. The energy difference required for splitting water is not 1.27 eV for each reaction; rather, the minimum band gap energy required for the entire process of water splitting is 1.23 eV, which is the thermodynamic minimum needed to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. However, in practical terms, a larger band gap is typically necessary (usually greater than 1.7 eV) due to overpotential losses and the need to absorb a significant portion of the solar spectrum, which includes visible light. The positions of the conduction and valence bands with respect to the redox potentials are often elucidated using a diagram known as a band edge diagram, which helps researchers determine the suitability of a given photocatalyst for a particular redox reaction, such as water splitting. So, in summary, the utility of a photocatalyst for a specific application like water splitting depends on the alignment of its CBM and VBM with the relevant redox potentials, as well as the overall band gap energy to ensure that the material can absorb sufficient light to drive the photocatalytic process."},{"instruction":"I see so the band gap is kind of like the distance needed to pull the elastic band (water) enough to break it in two. I hope you like my analogy","output":"That's an imaginative analogy, and it does capture the essence of the concept in a broad sense! In your analogy, the elastic band represents the water molecule, and the act of pulling the elastic band to the point of breaking symbolizes the energy required to overcome the chemical bonds of the water molecule during the photocatalytic process. The band gap in a photocatalyst can indeed be likened to the \\"strength\\" needed to \\"pull\\" electrons from the valence band (where they are bound to atoms) to the conduction band (where they are free to move and participate in chemical reactions). The \\"distance\\" the electrons are \\"pulled\\" corresponds to the energy of the incoming photons that are absorbed: - If the photon energy is lower than the band gap (the \\"strength\\" is insufficient), the electrons won't be excited across the band gap, similar to an elastic band not being stretched far enough to break. - If the photon energy is equal to or higher than the band gap (the \\"strength\\" is sufficient or more than needed), the electrons are excited across the band gap and can then participate in reactions leading to the breaking of the chemical bonds, analogous to the elastic band being stretched to the point of breaking into two pieces. Hence, the band gap energy must be accurately matched to the energy required to drive the desired chemical reactions, and this requirement guides the design and selection of materials for specific photocatalytic applications. It's always good to remember, however, that while analogies like this can help in explaining complex scientific concepts, they simplify actual physical processes. The real behavior of electrons in a semiconductor and their interactions with light involve quantum mechanics and are more complex than the analogy conveys. Nevertheless, it's a helpful starting point for understanding the basic principles at work!"},{"instruction":"Thanks . The simplified idea helped me think of it easier. Also knowing electrons can't stay in the band gap helped too. And when you say hole pairs .( I think that's what you said) you mean the hole and the electron . Right ?","output":"I'm glad the simplified idea was helpful for you! Yes, when discussing \\"hole pairs,\\" what is really meant is \\"electron-hole pairs.\\" In the context of semiconductors and photocatalysis, an electron-hole pair is created when a photon with enough energy (equal to or greater than the band gap energy of the material) hits the semiconductor and excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Here's what happens in the process: - The excited electron leaves behind a vacancy or \\"hole\\" in the valence band. While the electron is a negatively charged particle, the hole behaves as if it were a positively charged particle. - The electron is now in the conduction band, which means it has enough energy to move freely and conduct electricity. - The hole remains in the valence band, and it also has the ability to move, as neighboring electrons can \\"jump\\" into the hole, effectively causing the hole to move in the opposite direction of the electron movement. The generation of electron-hole pairs is fundamental to the operation of photocatalysts. These carriers can then reach the surface of the photocatalyst and engage in separate redox reactions: - The electron (from the conduction band) can participate in reduction reactions, typically reducing other substances or molecules adsorbed on the photocatalyst's surface. - The hole (in the valence band) can cause oxidation reactions, typically oxidizing substances or molecules in contact with the photocatalyst. Careful control of the recombination of these electron-hole pairs (where the electron falls back into the hole) is crucial for the efficiency of photocatalytic processes, as recombination without productive redox reactions wastes the absorbed energy and reduces the efficacy of the photocatalyst."},{"instruction":"Yes I read that fast recombination to the holes means poor performance. Ok now I guess it's relative but what if I had some TIN . Its bandgap ev is 1ev . Now I wanted to increase its bandgap . Whereas nickel might reduce the bandgap in tio2 . Would it increase it for TIN? Is it relative ?","output":"Tin (IV) nitride (Sn3N4 or \\"TIN\\") is a material with semiconductor properties, and as you mentioned, it has a band gap of approximately 1 eV. In general, engineering the band gap of a semiconductor to either increase or decrease it involves changing the material's electronic structure. This can be done through several methods, including doping with other elements, creating alloys, changing the particle size (quantum confinement in nanoparticles), or forming heterojunctions with other semiconductors. The effect of doping with a specific element, such as nickel (Ni), on the band gap of a semiconductor is not solely determined by the dopant itself; it also depends on the host material's crystal structure, electronic configuration, and the nature of the interaction between the dopant and the host material. With TiO2, which is commonly used as a photocatalyst, doping with nickel and other transition metals has sometimes been reported to result in a reduced band gap. This reduction is often due to the introduction of new electronic states within the band gap of TiO2, which arise from the d-orbital electrons of the transition metal dopants. These new states can facilitate absorption of lower-energy (visible) light. However, this doesn't mean that nickel doping will have the same effect on Sn3N4. The change in the band gap of Sn3N4 upon doping with nickel would be determined by the specific electronic interactions that occur as a result of nickel being incorporated into the Sn3N4 lattice. It could lead to an increase, decrease, or no significant change in the band gap, depending on how the nickel atoms influence the electronic structure of the Sn3N4. Therefore, if the goal is to modify the band gap of Sn3N4, it would be necessary to carry out experimental studies or computational modeling to determine the effect of nickel or any other dopants on the electronic properties of the material. Each semiconductor material has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as the outcomes can vary widely depending on the system being studied."},{"instruction":"Is there software or a website that can predict what Ni doping would do to TIN's bandgap ?","output":"Yes, predicting the effects of doping on a semiconductor's band gap often involves computational methods based on quantum mechanical calculations. Several software tools rooted in Density Functional Theory (DFT) or related ab initio (from first principles) approaches are available for simulating the electronic structure of materials and can be used to predict the impact of doping. Here are a few examples: 1. **VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package):** VASP is a highly regarded software for atomic scale materials modeling, particularly for performing DFT calculations. It can simulate the electronic structure and physical properties of materials, including the effects of doping. 2. **Quantum ESPRESSO:** This is another powerful suite for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It's an open-source project, making it accessible to researchers who may not have access to proprietary software like VASP. 3. **CASTEP (Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package):** CASTEP is a commercial code that uses plane-wave pseudopotentials to perform DFT calculations. It can be used to study the structural, dynamical, and electronic properties of solids. 4. **ABINIT:** Another open-source tool for DFT calculations that can model the geometry, band structure, and other properties affected by doping. 5. **CrySPY:** A Python-based software that can automate the process of crystal structure prediction, which could be useful in doping studies. 6. **Materials Studio:** A computational environment that offers tools for simulating a wide array of properties and can be used to investigate how doping would affect a semiconductor's band gap. Using these tools generally requires expertise in computational materials science, as well as knowledge of the software itself. One has to carefully configure the computational parameters such as the type of pseudopotentials used, the exchange-correlation functional, the k-point mesh for Brillouin zone sampling, and the cutoff energy for plane waves, among other settings. While it's less common to find a simple website or an online service that would directly and accurately predict the effects of doping on the band gap for a specific material like Sn3N4 doped with Ni, there are materials databases and online platforms like the Materials Project or AFLOWlib that might have relevant pre-calculated information or offer tools for submitting calculation jobs. For someone not familiar with these computational techniques, collaboration with a computational materials science research group or consulting with experts in the field would be advisable to gain insights regarding the doping effects in Sn3N4 or similar materials."},{"instruction":"Wow that will be interesting. Hmm what next... teach me more please","output":"Certainly! Since we've been discussing photocatalysis and semiconductors, let's explore some additional topics that build upon what we've already discussed. # Advanced Concepts in Photocatalysis **1. Charge Carrier Dynamics:** Understanding how photogenerated electron-hole pairs (excitons) move within a photocatalyst and how quickly they recombine is crucial for optimizing photocatalytic efficiency. Advanced techniques such as time-resolved spectroscopy can be used to study these dynamics and inform material design to minimize recombination rates. **2. Surface and Interface Engineering:** The activity of a photocatalyst is heavily influenced by its surface properties since that's where the redox reactions occur. By modifying the surface with various treatments or coatings, it's possible to enhance selectivity, improve stability, and increase the rate of reactions. **3. Plasmonic Photocatalysis:** Metals such as gold and silver can support surface plasmon resonances — collective oscillations of conductive electrons that strongly absorb and scatter light. Placing plasmonic nanoparticles on the surface of a photocatalyst can enhance light absorption and generate highly energetic \\"hot\\" electrons, which can be injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor to drive photocatalytic reactions. **4. Band Structure Engineering:** Beyond doping, the band structure of semiconductors can be precisely engineered through the creation of solid solutions, application of strain, or design of specific crystal facets. This tailoring can optimize the band edge positions relative to the redox potentials for targeted reactions. **5. Z-Scheme Photocatalysis:** This concept is inspired by the natural photosynthesis process and involves coupling two different semiconductors with staggered band structures. It mimics the Z-scheme of photosynthesis to facilitate effective separation of charge carriers and enhance redox reaction capabilities. # Innovative Materials for Photocatalysis **1. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs):** MOFs are a class of porous materials made from metal ion or cluster nodes connected by organic linkers. Some MOFs have shown photocatalytic properties, with the added benefit of a high surface area for reactions and tunable porosity. **2. Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs):** COFs are constructed from light elements (B, C, N, O, etc.) through strong covalent bonds, resulting in a porous crystalline structure. Their tailorability and light-absorbing properties make them candidates for photocatalytic applications. **3. Two-Dimensional Materials:** Materials like graphene, MoS2, and other transition metal dichalcogenides have unique electronic and light-harvesting properties due to their two-dimensional structure. Their ultrathin nature enables efficient charge transport and offers new possibilities in photocatalysis. # Analytical Techniques in Photocatalysis Research **1. Electron Microscopy:** Techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provide images with nanoscale resolution. These tools can reveal the morphology and structure of photocatalytic materials. **2. X-ray Diffraction (XRD):** XRD is used to determine the crystalline structure of photocatalysts, providing information about lattice parameters and the presence of different crystal phases, which can influence photocatalytic performance. **3. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS):** XPS can analyze the surface chemistry of photocatalysts by measuring the binding energies of core electrons. It can provide insights into oxidation states, surface composition, and the presence of dopants. As you can see, photocatalysis is a diverse and multi-disciplinary field that draws on concepts from physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering. The development of new materials and the understanding of fundamental processes are ongoing, as researchers strive to create more efficient and versatile photocatalytic systems for energy and environmental applications."},{"instruction":"Ok ty.. do electron hole pairs always recombine in the end ?","output":"In semiconductor materials, when electron-hole pairs are generated, they do eventually recombine. There are two main pathways for this recombination: 1. **Radiative Recombination:** Also known as radiative decay, this occurs when the electron falls back into the hole and releases the excess energy as a photon. This is the process that leads to photoluminescence, and it's how light-emitting diodes (LEDs) work. In photovoltaic cells, this process is undesired because it represents a loss mechanism where the light-generated energy is not harnessed as electrical energy but is instead re-emitted as light. 2. **Non-Radiative Recombination:** In this pathway, the energy is not given off as light but is transferred to the crystal lattice as vibrations or heat. This can occur through several processes, such as Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, where defects in the crystal lattice assist in the recombination process, or Auger recombination, where the energy is given to another electron or hole, which then releases the energy thermally. In the context of photocatalysis, the efficiency of a photocatalytic material depends heavily on prolonging the lifetime of the electron-hole pairs so they can reach the surface of the material to drive chemical reactions. Several factors can either promote or limit the recombination, including: - **Material Quality:** Defects and impurities in the crystal structure can serve as recombination centers. - **Material Morphology:** Particle size and shape can influence how quickly charge carriers can move to the surface. - **Charge Carrier Concentration:** High levels of dopants can increase the rate of Auger recombination. - **Surface States:** Surface properties can either promote the transfer of charge carriers to the reactants or act as traps that enhance recombination. In practical applications, materials scientists and engineers aim to manage the recombination rates to optimize performance. For example, in photovoltaics, you want to minimize recombination to maximize the number of electrons that contribute to the electric current. In contrast, for light-emitting diodes, radiative recombination is encouraged to maximize light emission. Ultimately, all electron-hole pairs will recombine, but controlling the rate at which this occurs is key to designing efficient semiconductor devices, whether they're intended for energy conversion, sensing, lighting, or photocatalysis."},{"instruction":"Ok but how does the electron gain energy. ?","output":"The electron in a semiconductor gains energy primarily through the absorption of photons, which are particles of light. When a semiconductor material is exposed to light, the photons interact with the electrons and can transfer their energy to them. However, not all photons are capable of exciting electrons; only those with enough energy to overcome the band gap of the semiconductor can successfully do so. Here's a step-by-step overview of how an electron gains energy from light absorption: 1. **Photon Absorption:** - An incoming photon with an energy equal to or greater than the semiconductor's band gap (E_gap) collides with an electron in the valence band. 2. **Excitation:** - If the photon's energy (E_photon) is at least as large as the band gap (E_photon ≥ E_gap), the electron can absorb the photon's energy and become excited. 3. **Transition to the Conduction Band:** - Upon absorbing the necessary energy, the electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole in the valence band where the electron once was. This electron-hole pair is what participates in photocatalytic processes, as previously mentioned. 4. **Additional Energy:** - If the photon's energy is notably higher than the band gap, the excess energy (E_photon - E_gap) will initially boost the excited electron to a higher energy state within the conduction band. 5. **Thermalization:** - Electrons that have been excited to higher energy states within the conduction band usually lose their excess energy very quickly (on the order of picoseconds) through collisions with the lattice in a process called thermalization, settling into the lowest energy state available within the conduction band. 6. **Relaxation:** - Eventually, through various recombination processes, as described in previous answers, the electron releases its energy and returns to the valence band, either by emitting a photon (radiative recombination) or dissipating energy as heat (non-radiative recombination). The ability of a semiconductor to convert photon energy into excited electrons (and thus electrical energy) is the basis of many photonic and electronic devices, including photovoltaic cells, photodetectors, and photocatalysts. The efficiency of this energy conversion process is a key factor in the performance of such devices."},{"instruction":"Ok wow. An informative day.

MOONLIT FOREST - NIGHT Under the silver glow of a crescent moon, a traditional NINJA, KUROSAWA, clad in black garb with a face mask, swiftly darts from tree to tree. Silent as the night breeze, his movements are invisible to the untrained eye. A rustling in the distance catches his attention. KUROSAWA halts, crouched atop a thick branch. His sharp eyes scan the dense thickets below, searching for the source of the disturbance. Suddenly, a figure emerges—a MODERN-DAY NINJA, named WALKER. His gear is strange and foreign to KUROSAWA: a sleek wetsuit that glistens with condensation, sturdy combat boots that grip the forest floor, and night vision goggles that give his eyes an alien green glow. KUROSAWA (murmurs to himself) (Confused, whispering) Who is this outsider donning the attire of a fish and the vision of an owl? WALKER strolls with clear intention, his stance exuding confidence. Attached to his hip, a stealthy MK 23 SOCOM pistol, the silencer attached like a whisper of death, the laser sight cutting through the darkness. The two warriors' paths intersect; they bump shoulders, KUROSAWA loses his balance and drops to the ground, landing nimbly on his feet. They stare at each other: a silent acknowledgment of skill. KUROSAWA (Surprised yet composed) Who are you, clad in ocean's cloth, yet stalking the land as a shadow? WALKER (Undisturbed, noticing the traditional attire) They call me Walker. A warrior of the modern age, much like you, though our battlefields differ. You must be one of the ancient shinobi. KUROSAWA (Nods, inspecting WALKER's gear) Indeed, but tell me, Walker of the New Age, why doth your attire lack the verdant beret of your namesake? And where hides your katana, the soul of our kinship? WALKER (Chuckles softly) The beret is but a symbol, and it has no place amidst the shadows. My blade is of a different kind. (patting his MK 23) This is my katana—swift, silent, and deadly. KUROSAWA (Appreciative and curious) Ah, I see the evolution of the warrior's path... Steel forged not in fires but in factories of modernity. Tell me, does it slice through the air with the same poetry as our blades? WALKER (With a sly grin) Perhaps not with poetry, but the end it brings is just as final. Care for a demonstration? KUROSAWA nods, and WALKER quickly draws the MK 23, firing at a nearby tree. The muffled shot rings out, and a small red dot appears on the trunk—a perfect hit. KUROSAWA (Impressed) Most impressive. The silence of the owl's flight and the strike of the viper. The spirit of the ninja endures, even through the march of time and technology. WALKER holsters his pistol, nodding with respect. WALKER It does. Our methods may differ, but the essence of a warrior remains unchanged. Shadows and silence are our shared language. The moon peeks through the leaves, casting light upon the two warriors. Sharing a moment of mutual respect, they part ways—KUROSAWA into the darkness of the canopy, WALKER disappearing into the night's embrace, both aware that the soul of the ninja is timeless, merely taking new shapes to adapt to an ever-changing world.

} }in function withdraw why there is no event logging for this operations as i know Without event logs, it becomes difficult to track the history of transactions and to audit the contract's behavior over time","output":"The code you've presented appears to be for a smart contract meant to manage liquidity positions within a decentralized finance (DeFi) framework, most likely on the Solana blockchain, given the references to SPL tokens and program addresses. Event emissions (or the equivalent in Solana, which are event logs) are important in smart contracts for the reasons you've mentioned: tracking transaction history and auditing contract behavior. However, not all blockchain platforms treat event logging the same way. In Ethereum, for example, events are well-supported and commonly used to signal that a particular state transition has occurred within a smart contract. On the Solana blockchain, logging is typically used instead of events. When a program executes on Solana, it can include logging instructions that write data to the transaction log. These logs can be parsed by clients and off-chain tools to reconstruct transaction history and to facilitate smart contract monitoring and debugging. The provided code snippet doesn't contain explicit log instructions, which would indeed be a gap if this were an Ethereum-based contract. For Solana, if you wanted to add logging to the \`withdraw\` function, you would include logging invocations using the Solana programming model, which might look something like: \`\`\`rust solana_program::msg!(\\"Your log message here\\"); \`\`\` The \`solana_program::msg!\` macro is used to record arbitrary messages in the transaction log. These messages can be used just like events in Ethereum to signal various stages or actions within the contract. If you're looking to ensure that the contract is audit-friendly, including sufficient logging is definitely a good practice. Make sure to log all significant state changes, user actions, and any errors or reverts. These logs aid in troubleshooting, analysis, and verification of the contract's behavior. Remember that the example code and comments given above are based on the assumption that this contract is intended for the Solana blockchain. If the contract operates on a different blockchain with different conventions, the mechanism for event logging or the equivalent might differ."},{"instruction":"The default spl-token events must be there. Again, things are different in Solana, and usually accounts where tokens are transferred from are deleted right away. Solana accounts in program calls are mostly a one-time thing, and not something to keep track of.","output":"You're correct that the event model in Solana is different from those in Ethereum-like blockchains. In Solana, instead of relying on an event-emitting paradigm, accounts and their associated data are the primary means of recording the state of the program. The Solana runtime provides a logging feature accessible to programs, which is used to output messages during transaction processing. These logged messages get included in the transaction receipts and are recorded in the ledger. When it comes to the SPL Token program on Solana, it does not emit events in the same way an Ethereum contract would. Instead, transaction histories are reconstructed by interpreting Solana's account state changes and the transaction logs produced by the runtime during transaction processing. The SPL Token program operations, like transfers, minting, or burning, result in state changes that are immediately observable in the affected accounts (e.g., the token accounts will show updated balances). These operations can include logging messages from the SPL Token program itself, but more detailed logging from higher-level programs (like the one in your example) would need to be done explicitly by the developer. Regarding the deletion of accounts, Solana does support a \`close\` operation for accounts, which frees up their allocated space and recycles the rent-exempt deposit. This is useful for temporary accounts or when a program-dictated lifecycle for an account has ended. However, accounts associated with SPL Token balances are not ordinarily deleted after transfers. Instead, an SPL Token account will persist until explicitly closed, usually by the holder of the tokens in that account. Thus, if you want to have the equivalent of event logging for your higher-level operations in Solana, you'd emit log messages within your program functions. Here's an example snippet in Rust pseudo-code for Solana, with log messages: \`\`\`rust pub fn process_withdraw(accounts: &[AccountInfo], ...) -> ProgramResult { msg!(\\"Withdraw function called\\"); // ... rest of your processing logic ... let remaining_balance = //...; msg!(\\"Withdraw succeeded: {} tokens withdrawn, {} tokens remaining\\", withdrawn_amount, remaining_balance); Ok(()) } \`\`\` The \`msg!\` macro is used to write to the transaction log, which is stored on the blockchain along with the transaction result. It's also important to note that while off-chain processes can reconstruct the history by parsing both the logs and the ledger's account state, on-chain programs need to explicitly pass all necessary information through accounts in cross-program invocation calls since they don't have access to historical logs or account states outside the scope of the current transaction. In summary, to achieve event logging in Solana, you need to include explicit logging in your smart contract code where needed. These logs will be recorded in the transaction details and can be retrieved and parsed by clients and block explorers after the transactions have been processed by the network."},{"instruction":"so where the vulnerability can be found here","output":"In smart contract security, vulnerabilities can arise from many different places, such as the logic itself, how the code interfaces with the blockchain platform, external calls or dependencies, and the economic design of the contract. Reviewing the code snippet provided, here are some areas that could potentially harbor vulnerabilities: 1. **Access Controls:** - The contract should authenticate that the callers (external accounts or contracts) are authorized to perform actions like withdrawals or updating positions. Make sure only the rightful owner or an approved delegate can perform sensitive transactions. - Verify that modifier-like constructs (such as \`@signer(userWallet)\`) are correctly implemented to enforce access controls. 2. **Input Validation:** - Check that function parameters and inputs are being validated properly against invalid or unexpected values that could lead to issues like re-entrancy or the manipulation of the contract state. 3. **Arithmetic Operations:** - Solidity smart contracts on Ethereum have vulnerabilities associated with integer overflows and underflows. While this is less common in high-level Solana Contract development (since it uses Rust, which panics on integer overflow in debug builds), it's important to verify that the contract manages numerical operations safely. 4. **External Calls:** - The contract's interactions with external programs (\`orca\`, \`whirlpool\`, \`SplToken.transfer\`, etc.) need to be reviewed thoroughly to ensure they are called as intended, and that they don't introduce unexpected behaviors. - The integrity of the data returned from external calls should not be implicitly trusted without proper checks. 5. **Logic Flaws:** - Review the logic for state transitions and ensure that functions like \`deposit\` and \`withdraw\` are performing the correct operations, updating state variables accurately, and can't be abused to cause inconsistent state or asset loss. - Ensure there are no \\"unreachable\\" funds or tokens due to logical oversights that could permanently lock funds in the contract. 6. **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs):** - Verify that PDAs are generated correctly and securely using correct seeds and that they match what's expected (for authentication of token transfers, account updates, etc.). - Ensure that only the contract can control funds in those PDAs and that the logic for generating and using them is sound. 7. **Correctness of State Updates:** - Ensure that when the contract updates internal mappings and arrays, it does so accurately and without the possibility of creating unreachable or \\"dead\\" entries, which could lead to an incorrect representation of the state. 8. **Contract Upgradeability (if applicable):** - Check if the contract has any form of upgradeability mechanism and review that process for potential vulnerabilities or centralization concerns. 9. **Reverting Logic and Error Handling:** - Make sure that errors are handled correctly and that transactions revert upon failures rather than continue in an indeterminate state. The contract should clean up any half-updated states on failure. 10. **Data Consistency:** - Check that all the data structures, such as mappings and arrays, remain consistent after each operation. For example, \`numPositionAccounts\`, \`totalLiquidity\`, and the various mappings all need to consistently represent the contract's state. Without a complete review and formal verification or testing, it's difficult to identify specific vulnerabilities in your contract code. You should conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and consider getting the contract audited by professional security auditors who specialize in smart contract security. This is a critical step in verifying the contract's safety, especially given that it handles financial transactions and could have significant monetary value at stake."},{"instruction":"Опиши на примере Нового года деконструкцию Жака Деррида.","output":"Деконструкция Жака Деррида — это философский метод анализа, который стремится раскрыть предположения и двоичные оппозиции, заложенные в текстах и мышлении. Этот подход критикует традиционные идеи о структуре, смысле и трактовках, пытаясь показать, что любое понятие или идея содержит в себе элементы своего \\"андрога\\" — то есть имеет внутри себя начала своего противоположного значения. Для применения деконструкции к понятию Нового года начнем с рассмотрения основных представлений, связанных с этим праздником: 1. Новый год часто ассоциируется со стартом, новыми начинаниями и надеждами на будущее. Это разделение времени на \\"старое\\" и \\"новое\\" подразумевает линейное понимание времени и прогресса. 2. Во многих культурах Новый год отмечается весельем, радостью и праздником, подразумевая, что это время оптимистичного взгляда на будущее. 3. Новый год также ассоциируется с ритуалами и традициями, такими как фейерверки, новогодние решения и праздничные застолья, указывая на социальные и культурные конструкции, которые придают событию особый смысл. Теперь применим деконструкцию: 1. Изучая бинарные оппозиции, Деррида бы осветил то, как понятие \\"нового\\" неизбежно связано со \\"старым\\". Фактически, новизна понимается только через отсутствие старости. Объявление определенного дня Новым годом — это произвольное деление, которое делает очевидным, что границы между \\"новым\\" и \\"старым\\" размыты и взаимосвязаны. 2. Взгляд на Новый год как на время оптимизма скрывает другую сторону, а именно беспокойство, неопределенность и даже страх перед неизвестным будущим. Деконструкция позволяет увидеть, что радость и оптимизм не существуют без своих противоположностей; они включают в себя скрытую тревогу, которая часто не выражается открыто. 3. Ритуалы и традиции, отмечающие Новый год, хотя и кажутся устоявшимися и постоянными, фактически проходят постоянное изменение и переосмысление. Применяя деконструкцию, можно увидеть, что эти традиции не естественны, а являются частью социальной конструкции, которая не всегда поддерживает универсальное значение. Итак, через процесс деконструкции показывается, что понятие Нового года выстраивается на взаимных исключениях и зависимостях между противоположными понятиями (\\"новое\\" vs \\"старое\\", \\"радость\\" vs \\"тревога\\"), а также тем, что традиции и празднования являются социальными конструктами, которые постоянно эволюционируют и интерпретируются вновь."},{"instruction":"Говори от имени Жака Деррида, будто он на конференции и рассказывает о Новом годе, применяя деконструкцию.","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your presence today as we contemplate together the intricate fabric of what we term the 'New Year'. The very phrase 'New Year' instantly summons a multitude of associations, expectations, and rituals that seem to be universally recognized. And yet, upon closer examination through deconstruction, we discover that this ostensibly simple concept is fraught with complexity, internal contradictions, and deep-seated cultural presuppositions. Let us first consider the idea of the 'new', positioned against the 'old'. These terms, they coexist in a hierarchy where the 'new' inherently suggests something better, a renewal, an improvement upon the past. But I ask you, does the notion of the 'new' not inherently carry within it the specter of the 'old'? It is an entangled web, where the new is only understood relative to the old and cannot claim any objective or absolute presence. Furthermore, consider how we celebrate this transition. The rituals—the fireworks, the toasts, the resolutions—they all convey a sense of unity, an agreement on the significance of this temporal marker. And yet, could these not also be seen as acts of defiance against the relentless, indifferent march of time? What are these rituals, if not a desperate attempt to impose meaning upon the continuous, the indistinguishable flow of moments? It is quite the paradox: in celebrating change, we cling to rituals, enacting them the same way year after year. Yet these traditions themselves are not static; they are in flux, undergoing constant reinterpretation and renegotiation. Contrast the joy and optimism that is socially mandated on this occasion with the silent apprehensions that envelop many as one year gives way to the next. Are we not feigning a collective forgetting of all that we dread about the unknown future? The unspoken anxieties are as integral to the 'New Year' as the hope that we loudly proclaim. Together they form a text that demands to be read in its complexity, not merely in the superficial gloss of festivity that we superimpose. To truly understand New Year's essence, it is critical to deconstruct not just the term itself, but our experience of it—how it is enshrined within various societal connotations and how each individual's engagement with it can both conform to and deviate from the norm. Thus, as we step into what we label as 'New Year', let us be aware of the intricate dance of presences and absences, the seen and the unseen, the said and the unsaid, that define our understanding and celebration of time's passage. This is the power of deconstruction: to not strip away these layers to reveal a hidden core truth, but to illuminate the profound complexity and inherent contradictions within the constructs we so often take for granted. Thank you, and let us proceed into this dialogue with the spirit of inquiry and the acceptance of multiplicity that deconstruction invites us to embrace."},{"instruction":"Говори от имени Славоя Жижека, в его манере, будто он на конференции и рассказывает о Новом годе и его сущности.","output":"*Lisp* Okay, okay, let's start with this obvious celebration of the New Year, a perfect example of the paradoxes in which our society indulges. So, on one hand, you have this - *sniff* - this collective hysteria that something new is coming, something different, right? But, what is really happening? Nothing! Nothing but the passage of time in its most brutal, indifferent form. Look, here is the trick: we create a spectacle out of nothing – the New Year. We gather together, make noise, drink, as if we are really celebrating a profound shift in reality. But the only thing that changes is the number we use to denote the year. We are like children, desperately trying to cover up the void, the abyss of our existence with a superficial change. *Waves hands* And, and let us not forget about New Year's resolutions – a true comedy, I tell you. Every year we promise to ourselves that we will stop smoking, lose weight, read more. We pretend that we have this magical ability to reinvent ourselves just because the calendar says January 1st. It's the ultimate illusion of self-control and autonomy, but in reality - *taps the forehead* - we are nothing but slaves to our habits and desires. The belief in self-improvement is the opium of the masses today. Oh, and this partying, it is not just an expression of joy, it is a ritual to exorcise the dread of passing time. Under the surface of our celebrations, there is an existential terror; we dance on the edge of the void. *Sniff* The New Year embodies our greatest fears – our fear of death, our fear of irrelevance, our fear of being alone in an indifferent universe. *Squints* In this sense, the New Year is a perfect metaphor for the capitalist ideology. Capitalism loves the new: new phones, new cars, new books, it doesn't matter. New Year is just an extreme version of this - our desire for newness repackaged and sold back to us. It signifies nothing but the perpetual turn of the commodity fetish. What we must do - *points* - is not celebrate, but reflect. The New Year should not be a time of mindless optimism but a moment of critical thought. This is what we need if we are to engage seriously with the problems of today. Not fireworks and champagne, but a good, hard look at the reality that stares back at us. It is the only way to bring about any real change, which, as we all know, is inherently traumatic. *Leans back* So, happy New Year – *chuckles* – or, as I would say, happy Same Old Year repackaged. *Sniff* Thank you."},{"instruction":"Говори от имени Жака Лакана, в его манере, будто он на конференции и рассказывает о Новом годе и его сущности.","output":"Mesdames et messieurs, I would like, if I may, to direct your attention to this phenomenon we call the New Year. Now, as you are well aware, we are subjected to the tyranny of the calendar, an invention par excellence that exerts its symbolic order upon our lives. *Taps on table* The New Year, it is not just a passage of time but a symbolic cut, a puncture in the continuity of being that represents both a promise and a failure – the promise of a new beginning and the failure to recognize that this very notion of newness is an illusion. It is what we might call a temporal objet petit a, a fantasy object imbued with our desires and yet one that perpetually eludes our grasp. Consider the resolutions we make. Are they not, in their essence, an admission of lack? We articulate these resolutions because we perceive a discord between our current state – or what Lacan might refer to as our \\"moi\\" – and the ideal ego, the \\"Ideal-I\\", that we long to become. We are engaged in a pursuit, a pursuit that can never be satisfied because this 'Ideal-I' is nothing but a mirage formulated by the Other, what society deems we ought to be. *Pauses and stares intently* The New Year thus becomes an annual mirror stage, a moment when we are confronted with both our fractured self and the image of unity we yearn to achieve. But, as with the mirror stage, this unity is an illusion, a misrecognition. We are not whole, we are split subjects, subjects divided by the very symbolic structures that we believe will save us. And so, we celebrate, *gestures* oui, with great fervor, marking this so-called newness with excessive libations and festivities. But what are we celebrating? Are we not, in fact, attempting to fill the gaping void, the Real that resists symbolization, with these rituals? The New Year, in its essence, reveals the limit of the symbolic realm and the impossibility of capturing jouissance, the ultimate pleasure that always slips away. It is crucial to go beyond the signifier of the 'New Year', to traverse the fantasy, and confront the Real that lies beneath these celebrations. Only then can we begin to approach the truth of our condition, which is not a simple chronological progression but a complex temporal loop where past and future are inextricably intertwined. The Real question, as always, remains: how do we desire to desire in the face of the New Year? The answer, if one can be so bold as to venture one, lies not in the seductive lures of resolutions and festivities, but in acknowledging the cyclical nature of our desire, the eternal return that haunts every attempt to start anew. Merci beaucoup for your attention. Let us proceed with both the courage to face the Real and the recognition that our symbolically mediated experience of time binds us all."},{"instruction":"edit this code to display the timeline and station with green colour from departure to destination, default colours station before departure and station after destination <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Bus Schedule and Timeline</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css\\"> <style> body { font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;

He goes there via train. He is in a passenger's car. The story is in 1955. He looks outside for a bit, his tie billows in the wind before going back to writing his letter to his mother. He has a friend next to him and 2 other people in front of him who are also going to the police academy.","output":"INT. PASSENGER TRAIN CAR - DAY (1955) The scene opens with the rhythmic clattering of a train as it chugs along the countryside. We see the picturesque view of post-war Japan through the window: rustic villages and rice fields, with distant mountains and a serene blue sky creating an almost idyllic landscape. Inside the modest train car, a YOUNG MAN (TAKESHI) with a determined look sits by the window. His dark hair is neatly combed, and an unbuttoned jacket reveals the crisp, white shirt underneath. The tie, half-done, flutters softly in the breeze coming through the open window next to him. TAKESHI (V.O.) (Soft, contemplative) As the landscapes rush by, each passing moment takes me farther from home... and closer to the future I've chosen. Takeshi, with careful fingers, attempts to secure his tie, now yielding to the wind's playful tugs. He gives up with a smile and lets the fabric dance freely for a moment more. Beside Takeshi is his FRIEND (HIRO), an affable young man with a round face and a ready smile. He watches Takeshi struggle with the tie and chuckles before reaching out to help. HIRO Let me, Takeshi. A proper policeman should know how to tie a steady knot. TAKESHI (Grins gratefully) Thanks, Hiro. I'll master it eventually. Two SEATMATES in front of them (KENJI and YUKIO) overhear the conversation and turn around, displaying their police academy badges pinned on the suits they wear with pride. KENJI (Enthusiastically) Hey, you guys are also headed to the academy? It's our first year. I'm Kenji, and this is Yukio. YUKIO (Calmly with a respectful nod) Nice to meet you. Looking forward to training together. The young men exchange polite nods and smiles, acknowledging their shared path. HIRO Likewise. I'm Hiro and this is Takeshi. Takeshi, whose attention has reverted to the window, momentarily drifts back to the present company. He introduces himself with a courteous nod. The train rocks gently. The new acquaintances soon delve into eager conversation about their aspirations and the future that lies ahead. Takeshi, though, feels the pull of another obligation. He pulls out a sheet of paper and a fountain pen from his bag, smoothing the paper on the small fold-down train table. He begins to write, pen scratching quietly. TAKESHI (V.O.) (Reflective) Mother, as I write this letter, the distance grows, yet my thoughts remain with you and home... HIRO watches his friend silently, understanding the unspoken mix of excitement and wistfulness. After a moment, Takeshi stops and gazes out the window again. TAKESHI (V.O.) (Resolute) ...but I carry our dreams with me, the lessons you've taught, and the strength from our family. I will make you proud. A soft smile creases Takeshi's lips as he resumes writing, pouring his heart into the words for his mother. The train continues its journey, carrying the young hopefuls into their futures as guardians of peace in a land healing from its past. The camera pans out to capture the foursome in the train car, united by a sense of purpose and camaraderie. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Write the montage about his time at the police academy.

CUT TO: EXT. POLICE CAR TRAINING AREA - DAY Takeshi's hands hover over the police car's control panel with a mixture of reverence and curiosity. An OLDER INSTRUCTOR points at various buttons and switches. Takeshi's finger hesitantly presses down on the siren control, and the shrill wail pierces the air. He startles at the sound, but a grin grows on his face. The instructor gives a nod of approval. CUT TO: INT.

Хотя я и не существую в ваше время, давайте на мгновение представим, что я могу поделиться с вами некоторыми мыслями о празднике, таком как Новый год, отражая мой взгляд сквозь призму психоаналитической социальной философии. Новый год — это не просто смена дат в календаре. Это символический ритуал, суть которого существенно глубже, чем кажется на первый взгляд. Это время размышлений, возрождения, возможность для индивида обратить взгляд внутрь себя и к своему отношению к жизни и к ближним. С Новым годом связано множество обычаев и традиций — это время, когда мы можем увидеть социальное проявление нашей потребности в трансценденции, стремлении к личностному и коллективному обновлению. Мы подводим итоги, мы стремимся измениться, мы делаем обещания себе и даем обеты изменений, что во многом напоминает очищение и возрождение. Подобно многим традициям, Новый год предоставляет нам шанс переосмыслить наши автоматизированные роли в обществе и дать себе волю быть, а не иметь. В эти моменты мы можем отрешиться от потребительского отношения к жизни и обрести истинное измерение нашего существования — бытийный аспект. Таким образом, Новый год — это праздник бесконечных возможностей человека как творца, праздник нашего бесконечного стремления к росту и изменению. Давайте также не забываем об общности, которая освещается в новогодние праздники. Мы собираемся вместе с семьей и друзьями, делится теплом и заботой, что, по сути, является силой, способной преобразовывать общество. Любовь и разум — две составляющие, которые могут изменить наше будущее к лучшему, и Новый год может служить маяком, напоминанием об этих наших глубинных потребностях и стремлениях. Так что пусть каждый Новый год будет не просто переходом от старого к новому в хронологическом смысле, но пусть он будет новым рубежом в нашем личном и культурном развитии, новой возможностью для того, чтобы мы могли воплотить наше человеческое существо во все его богатство и разнообразие. Спасибо вам, и пусть каждый новый год вносит вклад в ваш индивидуальный и коллективный рост."},{"instruction":"What is the exfoliable semiconductor .I think it's titanium disulphide?","output":"An exfoliable semiconductor is a type of material that can be mechanically or chemically thinned down to very thin layers, often on the scale of a single atom or a few atoms thick. These semiconductors are typically layered materials with weak van der Waals forces holding the layers together, which allows them to be easily separated or exfoliated. Titanium disulfide (TiS2) is indeed an example of an exfoliable semiconductor. It's a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) family, a group known for their interesting electronic properties and potential for use in a variety of applications, including electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. There are other well-known exfoliable semiconductors such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), and black phosphorus. These materials can be exfoliated down to thin layers called nanosheets, which have unique properties different from their bulk counterparts, such as a direct bandgap in the case of MoS2 when it is a monolayer, which is attractive for applications such as transistors and photodetectors."},{"instruction":"edit this code to display the timeline and station with green colour from departure to destination, default colours station before departure and station after destination <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <title>Bus Schedule and Timeline</title> <link rel=“stylesheet” href=“https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css”> <style> body { font-family: ‘Roboto’, sans-serif;

Firstly, we'll update the styles within the \`<style>\` tag, adding a new color definition for the selected route portion (green): \`\`\`css /* Add these styles below your existing styles */ .selected-route { border-left: 4px solid #10b981; /* Green border for the selected route's timeline */ } .selected-hoi { border: 4px solid #10b981; /* Green border for the selected route's hoi */ } .selected-station-time { background-color: #10b981; /* Green background for the selected route's station time */ } \`\`\` Now, let's modify the \`updateSchedule\` function in the \`<script>\` section to apply these styles based on the indexes: \`\`\`javascript function updateSchedule(scheduleData) { const scheduleContainer = document.getElementById('scheduleContainer'); scheduleContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous schedule const departureIndex = scheduleData.findIndex(station => station.station === departure); const destinationIndex = scheduleData.findIndex(station => station.station === destination); scheduleData.forEach((trip, index, array) => { // Existing code for creating vehicleDiv, etc. ... trip.stations.forEach((station, stationIndex) => { let stationDiv = document.createElement('div'); stationDiv.classList.add('station'); // Existing code for creating arrivalTimeDiv, etc. ... let hoiDiv = document.createElement('div'); hoiDiv.classList.add('hoi'); // Apply green color for stations between departure and destination if (stationIndex >= departureIndex && stationIndex <= destinationIndex) { hoiDiv.classList.add('selected-hoi'); } timeWrapperDiv.appendChild(hoiDiv); if (stationIndex !== trip.stations.length - 1) { let timelineDiv = document.createElement('div'); timelineDiv.classList.add('timeline'); // Apply green color for the timeline between departure and destination if (stationIndex >= departureIndex && stationIndex < destinationIndex) { timelineDiv.classList.add('selected-route'); } timeWrapperDiv.appendChild(timelineDiv); } stationDiv.appendChild(timeWrapperDiv); // Existing code for creating stationNameDiv, etc. ... let departureTimeDiv = document.createElement('div'); departureTimeDiv.classList.add('station-time'); // Apply green color for stations between departure and destination if (stationIndex >= departureIndex && stationIndex < destinationIndex) { departureTimeDiv.classList.add('selected-station-time'); } departureTimeDiv.textContent = station.departureTime; stationDiv.appendChild(departureTimeDiv); scheduleContainer.appendChild(stationDiv); }); }); } \`\`\` This updated \`updateSchedule\` function now checks if a station is between the departure and destination indexes, and if so, it adds the new green color classes to the \`hoi\`, \`timeline\`, and \`station-time\` elements. Make sure to insert the new styles in your existing \`<style>\` block, and adjust the script as shown above. Please note that I have used \`findIndex\` to determine the departure and destination indexes. If the \`scheduleData\` does not contain the stations as an array or if the array does not contain objects with a \`station\` property that matches the \`departure\` and \`destination\` strings, then \`findIndex\` would return \`-1\` and this code would not function as expected.

It only works when you know that something will show up. You can't work on that in a way that you say: I am dovuk to Hashem, I am immersed in Yiras Hashem - and no desire can disturb that. R’ Yisroel says that is not the way to work. Only when you know that there is something on the horizon which will show up. I don't deny it. I don't close my eyes. I try to make the Yireh bigger than that koyach which will show up. That's what is called להגביר יראתו על תאוותו. That is what I wanted to show you. It includes everything we did till now. Perhaps not exactly everything, but there is the Seychel and that Yireh stems from it. And the Yireh is a tchusha, it's a feeling, it's a feeling that is connected to the Seychel. And it can't always be at this high level. He doesn't mention explicitly this hisbonenus of the small actions we had till now. But that was our way to deal with this challenge. Now we want to experience that no, we are stronger than the tayveh. My Yireh is stronger than the tayveh. But now we have to face something where we know that there will be a tayveh, and I think the best place for that is by Tayves A’chilleh. It is not because I'm preoccupied with Tayves A'chilleh or anything like that. Now I'm not so healthy, so I can't really eat what I really want. And when I sit with you and have a good meal, the main point of Tayves A'chilleh for me is that you eat something which I can't and you can. So it's a weird Tayves A'chilleh. I can't eat what I really want. Good dessert and ice cream - I can't eat this. So my Tayves A'chilleh is not the real problem. I only chose Tayves A'chilleh because it's so common, a thing which shows up all the time, three, four, sometimes even five times a day. It is predictable. You do it and you know that you'll do it. It's not that you suddenly see something or suddenly something comes in. It's a predictable thing. You sit down and eat. So it has all these ingredients which R' Yisroel requires in there.","output":"Nu, vos zol men tun? When a person senses – feels within themselves – that a formidably challenging test looms, a situation that may lead to an averah or Ya'avod to miss a mitzvah, it’s incumbent upon him to be proactive. כי תתקרב אלינו נסיון קשה ונפילה פוטנציאלית, מוכרחים אנו לבקש את הדרכים, לחשוב על פתרונות כדי להגביר את יראת שמים בליבנו. The yetzer, the temptations, will invariably arise, creating a desire that may veer one off the derech. In such instances: אז צריכים למצוא תחבולה או עצה מראש, כדי להגביר עד כדי כך את היראה, עד שתהא היראה שולטת ומנצחת התאווה בתוך לב. True avodah in overcoming the tayveh does not come from casual contemplation on yirah. It’s not sufficient to declare a devout attachment to the Ribono Shel Olam alongside a steady diet of Yiras Hashem, imagining it as an impervious armor against desires. ר' ישראל teaches that such avodah is effective only with awareness of the tests ahead. Denial or willful blindness won't help. Our avodah is to magnify yirah to overpower the koyach of temptation – להגביר יראתו על תאוותו. This approach encompasses nearly everything discussed thus far, albeit not every detail. It incorporates seychel, driven by yirah, which is inherently a tchusha – a heartfelt emotion tied to intellect. This yirah, though, cannot always maintain its zenith levels. Previously, our avodah hinged on small, deliberate actions – hisbonenus – but now we confront the situation head-on, emboldening our yirah over our tayveh. And here, Tayves A’chilleh becomes an exemplary model. My focus on Tayves A'chilleh isn't out of preoccupation, but rather, health constraints have curtailed my indulgence, leaving me to vicariously encounter this yearning through others. I've selected Tayves A'chilleh due to its prevalence – it confronts us repeatedly throughout the day, a predictable and regular challenge that embodies the criteria set forth by R' Yisroel."},{"instruction":"try again","output":"Certainly. In editing the text for a yeshivish book, I would maintain the natural voice while respecting the original tone and enhancing clarity. --- What then must one do? Consider this: as a person anticipates encountering a significant challenge, one that may precipitate an aveirah or lead to neglecting a mitzvah, such awareness demands strategic preparation. ורק כאשר ירגיש האדם מראש את הנסיון הבא בקרבתו, שיכול להביאו ליידי כשלון רוחני, חובה עליו לחפש עצות מועילות להתמודד בזריזות. When the road gets rocky, when the yetzer hara beckons, when temptation rears its alluring head, one should anticipate such stumbling blocks. עתידה להגיע הפיתוי, המתווה לנו את הדרך להסטות מהאורח הישר. The task is not merely to contemplate on fear of Heaven; it encompasses a more profound endeavor. One cannot simplistically claim an unwavering devotion to Hashem and declare themselves impervious to ta'aveh. אם רצונך לראות תוצאות במאבק זה, שבו היראה גוברת על התאווה, לא תספיק עיסוקי שטח ביראת שמים. R’ Yisroel salanter explains this avodah requires an acute awareness of upcoming trials. We must not ignore nor turn a blind eye, rather, we strive to intensify our yirah so that it triumphs over any ta'aveh — להגביר יראתו על תאוותו. This principle is virtually the summation of our previous discussions, although not exclusively. It intertwines seychel with yirah—the latter, a sensitive emotion rooted in intellect. Yirah cannot be at a constant peak; it fluctuates. Our past avodah emphasized hisbonenus in minutiae, but now, we aim to bolster our yirah to exceed our ta'aveh. Particularly with Tayves Achilleh, which stands as a pertinent example. To clarify, my emphasis on Tayves Achilleh isn't derived from personal preoccupation. Admittedly, my current state of health limits my enjoyment in that arena. It's not about indulgence for me; rather, my interest is academic. I've chosen Tayves Achilleh for its ubiquity, for it presents itself recurrently. It's an experience so routine, so predictable, that it personifies R' Yisroel's conditions for confronting our instincts."},{"instruction":"Как по китайски сказать \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд ушли за поворот. \\" Объясни подробно","output":"Для перевода фразы \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд ушли за поворот\\" на китайский язык, мы можем начать с того, что эта фраза использует метафору времени, идущего так же, как объекты проходят за поворотом. Так как в китайском языке обычно используются другие образы и выражения, дословный перевод может не передать все нюансы, но я попытаюсь. На китайском языке мы можем сказать что-то вроде: \\"连续十二个月已经过去了。\\" (Liánxù shí'èr ge yuè yǐjīng guòqùle.) Разберём его по частям: - 连续 (liánxù) означает \\"подряд\\" или \\"непрерывно\\" и соответствует идее последовательности без перерывов. - 十二 (shí'èr) - это \\"двенадцать\\". - 个 (ge) - счетное слово, используемое для перечисления или счёта, в данном случае по месяцам. - 月 (yuè) означает \\"месяцы\\". - 已经 (yǐjīng) означает \\"уже\\". - 过去了 (guòqùle) - это слово, которое можно использовать для выражения идеи о том, что что-то прошло или ушло с течением времени, в данном контексте \\"ушли\\". Если вы хотите добавить немного поэтичности и создать образ, близкий к оригинальной метафоре \\"за поворот\\", вы можете использовать что-то вроде этого: \\"连续十二个月就像转弯后消失了。\\" (Liánxù shí'èr ge yuè jiùxiàng zhuǎnwān hòu xiāoshīle.) Что можно перевести как \\"Двенадцать последовательных месяцев исчезли, словно за поворотом.\\" Таким образом, эта фраза отражает идею о том, что двенадцать месяцев исчезли так же, как если бы они скрылись за поворотом на дороге."},{"instruction":"А можно ли сказать: \\"十二个月连续地走向了转弯。\\"?","output":"Да, ваша фраза \\"十二个月连续地走向了转弯。\\" (shí'èr gè yuè liánxù de zǒuxiàngle zhuǎnwān.) переводится как \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд пошли к повороту.\\" Это довольно буквальный перевод, и он допустим с точки зрения грамматики и семантики в китайском языке. Однако это немного меняет оригинальный смысл вашего выражения, делая упор на процесс движения к повороту (обозначая возможно предстоящее изменение или новый этап), вместо \\"исчезновения\\" или \\"завершения\\" этих месяцев, как в оригинальной метафоре. Для большей точности и ясности вы можете использовать выражение \\"转弯处\\" (zhuǎnwān chù), что буквально переводится как \\"место поворота\\". Также слово \\"走向\\" (zǒuxiàng) относится скорее к направлению движения, чем к завершению пути. В оригинальной фразе акцент сделан именно на завершении каждого из месяцев, на их исчезновении. Если вы хотите подчеркнуть завершение каждого из месяцев или их последовательное уход за поворот, вы могли бы использовать что-то вроде: \\"十二个月连续地消失在转弯处。\\" (shí'èr gè yuè liánxù de xiāoshī zài zhuǎnwān chù.) Это переводится как \\"Двенадцать месяцев подряд исчезли в месте поворота.\\" и более близко к оригинальной метафоре.

Here are some general and specific considerations regarding potential vulnerabilities or issues: 1. Initializable Pattern: - The contract seems to utilize an upgradeable contract pattern, relying on OpenZeppelin's \`Initializable\` utility. Ensure that all state variables are considered in the context of upgrades, to prevent storage collision issues. 2. Access Control: - The modifier \`onlyFactory\` restricts certain functionality to the instance of \`IXNFTFactory\` that initialized the contract. Make sure that this is the only scenario under which such privileged actions should be allowed and that this does not open an attack vector through the factory contract itself. 3. Reentrancy Guard: - There are value transfers inside \`_redeem\`, \`_claim\`, and \`_sendFees\` methods. These functions involve external calls but lack reentrancy protection, possibly leading to reentrancy attacks. Consider implementing reentrancy guards such as the \`nonReentrant\` modifier from OpenZeppelin. 4. Correctness of Accounting and Arithmetic: - Division in \`_calcRedeemPrice\` and \`redeemPrice\` can lead to rounding issues, as Solidity truncates on division. Ensure that this potential loss of precision is acceptable for the intended economics of the system. - Ensure that the accounting for \`redemption\` and \`accountId\` is maintained correctly through the lifecycle of the contract and after upgrades. Off-by-one errors or incorrect increment/decrement logic could disrupt the proper functioning of the \`claim\` and \`redeem\` functions. 5. Gas Optimizations: - Functions like \`_redeem\` and \`_claim\` may have optimizations possible regarding their gas cost due to the storage access patterns. Review whether there are repeated reads from the same storage slot within a single function call and consider caching the value in memory. 6. Edge Cases with Ether Transfers: - The contract has a fallback function to receive Ether but does not define a way to extract it, except for through the redemption and claim processes. Ensure this aligns with the business logic, and consider implementing a withdrawal function with proper access control if necessary. 7. Potential Front-Running: - The \`claim\` function does not directly check the claimed \`tokenId\` until calling the \`xnftClone.ownerOf\` function. This could potentially expose the process to front-running. However, mitigating this in its entirety may require off-chain order matching or inclusion of commitments (e.g., using a commit-reveal scheme). 8. Clarity in Business Logic: - Ensure the logic for redemption price calculation aligns with the intended economic model. These formulas are critical and must be thoroughly reviewed and tested. 9. Use of Low-level Calls: - The \`_sendFees\` function uses a low-level \`call\` to transfer Ether. This method is prone to errors and lacks a gas stipend which could become problematic if the destination address is a contract. Consider replacing it with \`transfer\` or \`send\` for fixed gas stipends, or provide an adequate gas limit for the call. 10. Interface Assumptions: - The contract relies on interfaces such as \`IXNFTFactory\`, \`IXNFTClone\`, and \`IERC20\`. You have to trust these contracts' implementations to be secure and follow expected standards without malicious functions or vulnerabilities. 11. Event Logging: - There are no events being emitted in the contract, which makes it harder to track interactions with the contract on-chain. Consider implementing event emission following key actions (such as redemption and claiming) for better transparency and easier off-chain tracking. 12. Testing and Auditing: - Comprehensive testing and potentially a third-party audit are recommended to uncover less obvious issues or logic errors that could compromise contract integrity, funds, or user interactions. Please note that this review has been done based on the provided code snapshot and general smart contract best practices, and is not exhaustive. Always perform in-depth reviews and consider multiple security aspects when assessing smart contract code."},{"instruction":"explain the overall architecture and how this contract fits into it? What are the main components and their interactions?","output":"The provided Solidity contract appears to be part of a larger decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem centered around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with integrated liquidity pools. The XNFTLiquidityPool contract is used for the claiming and redemption of liquidity related to NFTs. Here's an overview of the architecture based on the given contract and its interactions with other components: # Main Components: 1. **XNFTLiquidityPool Contract (this contract):** This contract is responsible for handling the redemption and claiming of NFTs, which involves transferring these NFTs back and forth between users and the contract while managing the associated fees, the Total Value Locked (TVL), and the redemption price calculation. 2. **IXNFTFactory Interface:** The XNFTFactory is likely a factory contract responsible for creating NFT instances or managing a collection of NFTs. It appears to hold information about accounts and tracks the mint count (the number of NFTs minted), royalties, and marketplace fees. Our XNFTLiquidityPool contract interacts with the factory to obtain critical information and to ensure that the actions such as redeem and claim are authorized. 3. **IXNFTClone Interface:** The XNFTClone is presumably a contract that represents individual NFTs which can be traded, claimed, or redeemed. It likely follows the ERC-721 standard, which allows for unique, non-fungible tokens to be issued and managed on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides the ownership details required to enforce the ownership-based operations in the XNFTLiquidityPool. 4. **IERC20 Interface:** This is a standard interface for ERC20 tokens, representing a fungible token standard on Ethereum. In this context, it is likely used to handle wrapped Ether (WETH), which is required for certain transaction mechanisms that involve Ether within smart contracts. # Interactions: - **Initialization:** Through the \`initialize\` function, the XNFTLiquidityPool is initialized with a reference to the XNFTClone contract and the accountId. This step also establishes a relationship with the initiating IXNFTFactory address, which is crucial for the \`onlyFactory\` modifier. - **Redemption:** Users can redeem their NFTs by calling the \`redeem\` function, which checks if the NFT is owned by the requestor and if there are tokens left to redeem. It calculates the redemption price and initiates the transfer of the NFT back to the user while transferring the redemption fee to the user. - **Claiming:** The \`claim\` function allows users to claim a token by transferring the required amount of Ether. It checks the validity of the claim, calculates fees, and transfers the NFT to the requestor's address. Fees are distributed accordingly to the marketplace fee address and account fee address. - **TVL Calculation:** The \`accountTvl\` function calculates the total value locked in the contract by summing up the contract's Ether balance and its balance of WETH. - **Fee Handling:** The \`_sendFees\` internal function is used to distribute fees collected during claiming. It can be used to transfer Ether to the marketplace and account fee addresses. - **ETH & WETH Handling:** The contract receives Ether through the fallback (\`receive\`) function and wraps/unwraps WETH using the \`_unwrap\` internal function. This is relevant for liquidity operations. - **Security Assumptions:** The contract assumes that the \`xnftFactory\` and \`xnftClone\` are secure and behave as expected since they're integral to the liquidity pool operations. The architecture suggests a system where NFTs can be minted (presumably through the factory), traded, and then either redeemed for ETH or claimed from the liquidity pool. The contract fits into the ecosystem as a critical component that deals with the liquidity aspects of the NFT marketplace, aiming to provide users with a secure and transparent way to claim or redeem their NFT assets."},{"instruction":"we'll add the redeem and claim functions and their interactions. Could you provide more details on the specific steps involved in the redeem and claim processes?","output":"Certainly, let's break down the redeem and claim functions as defined in the \`XNFTLiquidityPool\` contract, and outline the specific steps involved in these processes. # Redeem Function: The \`redeem\` function allows a user to redeem an NFT that they own. It involves transferring the NFT from the user's address to the liquidity pool and paying the user a redemption fee. The steps involved in the \`redeem\` process are as follows: 1. **Check Validity:** - Verify that there are still NFTs eligible for redemption (the \`mintCount\` from the factory should be greater than the \`redemption\` count of this contract). - Confirm that the requestor is the owner of the NFT to be redeemed. 2. **Calculate Redemption Price:** - Calculate the current redemption price by calling the \`redeemPrice\` function, which is determined based on the total value of assets in the liquidity pool and the number of tokens yet to be redeemed. 3. **Increment Redemption Counter:** - Increment the \`redemption\` counter by one to account for this redemption event. 4. **Unwrap WETH (If Needed):** - Call the \`_unwrap\` function, which converts WETH (Wrapped Ether) owned by the contract to Ether, making funds available for transfer. 5. **Transfer NFT to Contract:** - Call the \`nftRedemption\` function on the \`xnftClone\` (the NFT representation), transferring ownership of the NFT from the requestor to the contract. The specifics of this transfer logic should be implemented in the \`xnftClone\` contract. 6. **Transfer Redemption Fee to User:** - Send the calculated redemption fee to the user’s address via the \`_sendFees\` function. # Claim Function: The \`claim\` function allows a user to claim an NFT by paying Ether to the liquidity pool. This process involves transferring the NFT from the liquidity pool to the user's address along with handling the financial transactions. Here are the specific steps involved in the \`claim\` process: 1. **Check Validity:** - Verify that there are NFTs available to claim (the \`redemption\` count is greater than zero). - Ensure that the NFT to be claimed is actually owned by the liquidity pool contract (i.e., previously redeemed and now claimable). 2. **Calculate Required Amounts:** - Obtain various parameters like \`mintPrice\`, \`accountFeeAddress\`, and other fee-related variables from the \`xnftFactory\` instance. - Calculate the tentative redemption price by calling the \`_calcRedeemPrice\` function, which is a portion of the TVL minus the message value already sent. 3. **Validate Sent Ether:** - Ensure that the value of Ether sent by the requestor (in the transaction call) is at least equal to the base price needed for claiming the NFT. 4. **Calculate Fees:** - Calculate \`royaltyFee\`, \`liquidityPool\` contribution, and \`marketplaceFee\` based on the provided price and fee basis points. 5. **Decrement Redemption Counter:** - Decrement the \`redemption\` counter by one to signify that a token is being claimed from the available pool. 6. **Unwrap WETH (If Needed):** - Call the \`_unwrap\` function similarly to the redeem process. 7. **Transfer NFT to Requestor:** - Transfer the NFT from the liquidity pool to the requestor’s address by calling the \`transferFrom\` function on the \`xnftClone\` contract. 8. **Distribute Fees:** - Transfer the calculated marketplace fee to the marketplace’s fee address. - Transfer the royalty fee to the account’s fee address. 9. **Refund Excess ETH (If Applicable):** - If the amount of Ether sent exceeds the expected price, refund the excess to the requestor. Both the \`redeem\` and \`claim\` processes are guarded by the \`onlyFactory\` modifier, which ensures that these functions can only be invoked by the associated factory contract, presumably to maintain strict control over the lifecycle of the NFT redemption and claiming procedures. This additionally demonstrates the level of trust placed in the factory contract as a crucial element of trust and control within the overall system architecture."},{"instruction":"describe how the XNFTLiquidityPool interacts with these interfaces during these processes here is the interfaces IXNFTFactory.sol\\";// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity 0.8.18;

In each case, the \`XNFTLiquidityPool\` contract uses data from the factory interface to determine the economics of claiming and redeeming, execute these transactions, and ensure proper fee distribution.

However, to create an even more comprehensive view of the system, you could consider including the following additional elements and interactions: 1. **Users (Token Holders & Claimants):** - Include the external actors who interact with the system through transactions, such as minting NFTs, redeeming them for Ether, or claiming them back from the liquidity pool. 2. **Operator/Administrator:** - Detail the role of any administrative accounts that have special permissions, such as pausing the contract, updating fees, or other administrative functions. 3. **Marketplace:** - If the factory holds marketplace information (\`marketplaceFeeAddress\`, \`marketplaceFeeBps\`, etc.), there might be an off-chain or another smart contract component representing a marketplace for trading these NFTs. How this marketplace interfaces with the NFTs and the liquidity pool could be significant. 4. **Whitelist/Access Control:** - There may be access lists or whitelists for early access or special privileges when minting or trading NFTs. 5. **WETH Contract:** - Include the actual WETH contract as a component. Although it's represented by IERC20, specifying WETH outright may clarify interactions where Ether is wrapped or unwrapped. 6. **External Oracles or Price Feeds:** - If the system relies on external price data for calculating redemptions or claims, this could impact the financial mechanics of the pool. 7. **Emergency Mechanisms:** - Contracts often have mechanisms for disabling functionality in the case of detected faults or attacks (like pausing functions). 8. **Upgradeability Proxy:** - If the \`XNFTLiquidityPool\` or factory contracts are upgradable, the architecture should include the upgrade proxy mechanism and governance process for upgrades. 9. **Reward Distribution Mechanics:** - If relevant, some systems distribute rewards or additional benefits to NFT holders, liquidity providers, or participants in the ecosystem. 10. **Legal/Regulatory Compliance Checks:** - Systems often have Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance checks, which may need to be considered. 11. **Off-Chain Components:** - Many systems include off-chain servers or services for managing metadata, triggering events, or performing actions that are impractical on-chain due to cost or technical limitations. 12. **Smart Contract Events:** - All transactions and significant interactions could fire events for better transparency and easier tracking, especially useful for off-chain listeners like user interfaces or indexing services. 13. **Cross-contract Calls:** - If there are direct contract-to-contract interactions outside of the depicted flow, they should be clearly outlined to understand the full scope of dependencies and possible points of failure. In any architecture diagram, it's essential to tailor the level of detail to the intended audience. If the diagram is for developers, it should be technically detailed; if it's for investors or non-technical stakeholders, a higher-level overview is often more appropriate.

Evidence of Vulnerability: - Vulnerable part with code: \`\`\`solidity function _sendFees(address feeAddress, uint256 amount) internal { if (amount == 0) return; (bool success, ) = payable(feeAddress).call{value: amount}(\\"\\"); require(success, \\"fee transfer failed\\"); } \`\`\` - While there is a use of low-level calls to transfer Ether, there is no direct evidence of recursive calling (reentrancy) vulnerability from the limited code provided. However, calling an external contract opens the risk of reentrancy attacks if it's able to call back into the liquidity pool. It's important to use reentrancy guard patterns or check-effects-interactions to mitigate this. 2. **Excessive Gas Consumption:** Review: - The contract does not explicitly include loops in the provided functions (\`redeem\` and \`claim\`). Evidence of Vulnerability: - There is no direct evidence of loops or operations that would cause excessive gas consumption within the provided code snippet. Remember, a potential vulnerability is not the existence of loops alone but unbounded loops which can be manipulated. Bounded loops with deterministic gas costs are generally not a concern from a gas perspective. 3. **Social Engineering Attacks (Phishing):** Review: - Social engineering attacks are not related to the smart contract code itself, as they target the end-users. Evidence of Vulnerability: - This type of vulnerability lies outside of the smart contract code and more within the domain of how users interact with the contract, be that through web interfaces or other off-chain mechanisms. - While not directly a smart contract issue, developers should be aware and educate users on safe practices to reduce the risk of such attacks. 4. **Flaws in Complex Logic:** Review: - The calculation of redemption price and fees within \`claim\` and \`redeem\` and other areas of the contract involve complex logic. Evidence of Vulnerability: - Vulnerable part with code: \`\`\`solidity function claim( address requestor, uint256 tokenId ) external payable onlyFactory { // ... uint256 redemptionPrice = _calcRedeemPrice(msg.value); // ... } \`\`\` - Flaws in complex logic calculations could be exploited if they are not accurately implemented. For example, incorrect calculations of redemption prices or fee distributions could potentially allow an attacker to benefit in unauthorized ways. This should be thoroughly tested and audited. 5. **General Security Practices:** Review: - The current contract does not seem to have any direct pattern that lacks general security practice from the provided code snippet. - A more comprehensive review is necessary to confidently identify all potential logical flaws or security vulnerabilities. Conclusion: The specific items listed mainly touch on the general areas of concern in smart contracts (reentrancy, gas limits, phishing, and logic flaws). The evidence for vulnerabilities from the provided contract snippet is not conclusive, and a full contract audit is needed to determine if these concerns are indeed valid for this specific case. It is always recommended to follow best practices in smart contract development, such as using established security patterns, thorough testing, and getting professional audits to mitigate these and other risks."},{"instruction":"","output":"It appears you've cut off your question.

Let's examine each vulnerability concern line by line using the provided code: 1. **Reentrancy Attack During Ether Transfers:** The contract’s functions do indeed involve transferring Ether. The \`_sendFees\` internal function uses a low-level \`call\` for transferring Ether. If the recipient is a contract, it could potentially call back into the \`XNFTLiquidityPool\` contract before the original transfer is complete, possibly causing a reentrancy attack. This is a valid vulnerability concern. Vulnerable part with code: \`\`\`solidity function _sendFees(address feeAddress, uint256 amount) internal { if (amount == 0) return; (bool success, ) = payable(feeAddress).call{value: amount}(\\"\\"); require(success, \\"fee transfer failed\\"); } \`\`\` To mitigate this, the contract should use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy, or even better, use the reentrancy guard modifier provided by OpenZeppelin. 2. **Excessive Gas Consumption:** There are no obvious loops within the \`redeem\` or \`claim\` functions that would inherently consume a large amount of gas. The mentioned functions do interact with external contracts, which have an undefined cost, but this does not necessarily lead to excessive gas usage. Because there are no loops or complex computations visible in the provided code snippet that depend on user input or external conditions that could be manipulated to cause high gas consumption, this concern may not be applicable to this particular contract, as far as we can tell from the code provided. 3. **Social Engineering Attacks:** Social engineering attacks are not related to the solidity code itself but to the user interfaces and interactions users have with the contract. Hence, they are off-chain concerns and do not manifest as vulnerabilities in the smart contract code. Although a real concern, phishing and social engineering fall outside the scope of a smart contract code review, which focuses on the technical and security aspects within the codebase. Educating users on safe practices is essential, but not a responsibility of the smart contract itself. 4. **Logic Flaws in \`redeem\` and \`claim\`:** The \`claim\` function contains complex logic to calculate the redemption price and fees. Any flaws or mistakes in this logic could potentially be exploited: Vulnerable part with code: \`\`\`solidity function claim(address requestor, uint256 tokenId) external payable onlyFactory { // ... complex fee and price-related logic ... } \`\`\` An attacker exploiting flaws in price calculation logic is a valid concern. The contract must be thoroughly tested to ensure that these calculations are correct and that they account for all edge cases. The price calculation logic should be reviewed to ensure there is no way for an attacker to manipulate input data or contract state to claim NFTs at an incorrect price or redeem NFTs for more than they should be able to. 5. **Implicit Concerns Identified (but not explicitly listed):** While not explicitly mentioned in your list, the contract could include other vulnerabilities or security concerns if not carefully implemented and audited: - **Ownership verification:** In both \`redeem\` and \`claim\` functions, ownership of the \`tokenId\` is checked, which could be manipulated if the contract logic or the external NFT contract (\`xnftClone\`) is flawed. - **Reliance on External Contracts:** Any interactions with external contracts (like \`xnftClone\`) carry an inherent risk, as the contract must trust these external contracts to behave correctly. - **Upgradability and Initialization:** The contract uses an upgradable proxy pattern, which can introduce additional points of failure or attack if not managed securely. In conclusion, the reentrancy attack is the primary valid concern based on the code provided. To mitigate this, it would be advisable to use the reentrancy guard provided by OpenZeppelin or implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The other concerns don't have direct evidence in the code provided, but they are still valid points to consider during development, testing, and auditing processes. A comprehensive audit by a professional security firm is recommended to uncover less obvious issues or logic errors that could compromise the contract integrity."},{"instruction":"review the contract again and check this issue and prove it's valid and correct with evidence The contract's functions, such as redeem and claim, are based on complex logic that calculates prices, fees, and transfers assets.

Any flaws or mistakes in this logic could potentially be exploited: Vulnerable part with code: function claim(address requestor, uint256 tokenId) external payable onlyFactory { // … complex fee and price-related logic … }","output":"Evaluating the \`claim\` function in the provided contract: \`\`\`solidity function claim( address requestor, uint256 tokenId ) external payable onlyFactory { require(redemption > 0, \\"all claimed\\"); require(xnftClone.ownerOf(tokenId) == address(this), \\"not claimable\\"); (, , , , uint256 mintPrice, address accountFeeAddress, ) = xnftFactory .accounts(accountId); uint256 redemptionPrice = _calcRedeemPrice(msg.value); uint256 royaltyFeeBps = xnftFactory.royaltyFeeBps(); uint256 marketplaceSecondaryFeeBps = xnftFactory .marketplaceSecondaryFeeBps(); uint256 expectedPrice = mintPrice; uint256 basePrice = mintPrice; if (redemptionPrice > 0) { expectedPrice = (redemptionPrice * FEE_DENOMINATOR) / 9000; basePrice = (expectedPrice * 9950) / FEE_DENOMINATOR; } require(msg.value >= basePrice, \\"insufficient amount for claim\\"); uint256 royaltyFee = (expectedPrice * royaltyFeeBps) / FEE_DENOMINATOR; uint256 liquidityPool = (expectedPrice * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - marketplaceSecondaryFeeBps - royaltyFeeBps)) / FEE_DENOMINATOR; uint256 marketplaceFee = msg.value >= expectedPrice ? expectedPrice - royaltyFee - liquidityPool : msg.value - royaltyFee - liquidityPool; --redemption; _unwrap(); _claim(requestor, tokenId); _sendFees(xnftFactory.marketplaceFeeAddress(), marketplaceFee); _sendFees(accountFeeAddress, royaltyFee); if (msg.value > expectedPrice) _sendFees(requestor, msg.value - expectedPrice); } \`\`\` The complexity in this code arises from the fee calculations and the division of Ether sent (\`msg.value\`) to the appropriate parties. There are several aspects of the code that could be problematic if not implemented correctly: 1. **Arithmetic operations and potential rounding errors:** - Division in Solidity truncates the result, which can lead to precision loss. This is evident in the calculation of \`expectedPrice\` and \`basePrice\`. - If the fees' calculation is not accurate, it could result in users paying more or less than intended. 2. **Conditional calculations:** - The contract must account for different scenarios, such as whether the redemption price is greater than zero. Logic errors in these conditional branches could lead to incorrect behavior. 3. **Reliance on external contract state:** - The function depends on accurate and consistent information from external contracts (\`xnftFactory\` and \`xnftClone\`). If these contracts have vulnerabilities or logic that is not perfectly synchronized with the liquidity pool, an attacker might exploit this. Now let's address the specific vulnerability concern mentioned: the possibility of claiming NFTs for an incorrect amount or redeeming them for a price higher than intended. The code is indeed complex and requires several inputs from external contracts. If there are any discrepancies in calculating the redemption price and fees, they could potentially be exploited. For example, the function \`_calcRedeemPrice(msg.value)\` uses the total value locked (TVL) to compute the redemption price. If the TVL calculation is inaccurate, or if the attacker can manipulate the TVL or \`msg.value\` in some way (e.g., via front-running or flash loans), they could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to claim an NFT without paying the full intended price. While we cannot claim that this vulnerability is definitively present without more information about the rest of the contract and system (especially the implementation of \`xnftFactory\`), the complexity of the code and the dependency on multiple inputs certainly increase the risk. Security best practices would advise a thorough and careful review of this code, unit testing, a professional audit, and perhaps implementing external tools to help detect potential exploits around price calculations and fee distributions."},{"instruction":"SO PROVE THAT IS VALID with showing that the TVL calculation is inaccurate, and show with real value that the attacker can manipulate the TVL or msg.value in some way (e.g., via front-running or flash loans), they could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to claim an NFT without paying the full intended price.","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I lack the ability to interact with the blockchain or any external systems directly, so I'm unable to provide real-world evidence or conduct a live demonstration of an exploit in practice. Additionally, demonstrating how to exploit a contract would be irresponsible and unethical. However, I can outline hypothetical scenarios and points of consideration that could lead to the vulnerabilities you're concerned about. Leaning on the code provided, let's consider the key points where vulnerabilities may arise: # TVL Calculation: \`\`\`solidity function accountTvl() public view returns (uint256) { return address(this).balance + IERC20(xnftFactory.wethAddress()).balanceOf(address(this)); } \`\`\` The calculation for TVL includes both the contract's balance of Ether and Wrapped Ether (WETH). Consider the following scenario: - **Inaccurate TVL:** If an attacker can interact with the contract in a way that momentarily affects its balance (e.g., through flash loans or other mechanisms just before the TVL is calculated), they might be able to influence the redemption price calculation to their advantage. # Price Calculation in \`claim\` Function: \`\`\`solidity function _calcRedeemPrice(uint256 msgValue) internal view returns (uint256) { if (xnftFactory.mintCount(accountId) == redemption) return 0; uint256 assetAmount = accountTvl() - msgValue; uint256 redemptionPrice = assetAmount / (xnftFactory.mintCount(accountId) - redemption); return redemptionPrice; } \`\`\` An attack might proceed as follows: 1. A large amount of WETH is temporarily deposited into the pool (e.g., through a flash loan). 2. The attacker then calls the \`claim\` function, with \`msg.value\` equal to the normal amount required to claim an NFT. 3. Immediately after, they repay the flash loan, reducing the pool's balance. 4. Since the calculation is based on the increased TVL from step 1, the redemption price will be incorrectly computed, allowing the attacker to potentially acquire the NFT at a lower price than intended. # Potential Front-running: Since Ethereum transactions are public in the mempool before being mined, an attacker could potentially see a transaction that will affect TVL or NFT prices and send a transaction with higher gas fees to be included in a block before the observed transaction (front-running). After affecting the TVL or NFT price, the attacker could quickly exit their position in a subsequent block. For these vulnerabilities to be considered valid, the following conditions must be true: - The smart contract's state can be influenced by external factors which are controllable by an attacker (e.g., through a flash loan affecting TVL or via front-running). - Price calculations depend directly on mutable state variables that can be manipulated before being used. - There is a lack of time-lock or similar mechanisms that provide a security buffer. To prove that these vulnerabilities are valid within a real contract, one would need: - **Access to a testnet or mainnet:** Deploy the contract and simulate the attack using a testing framework like Ganache or Hardhat. - **Simulation tools:** Use tools like Echidna or Mythril to simulate state changes and attempt to find an exploit path. - **Real-world attack vectors:** On the mainnet, perform transaction simulations with tools like Tenderly to explore possible front-running or flash loan attack scenarios. Please note that attempting these actions on live contracts with real value without permission is an illegal and prosecutable offense. Such analyses should only be pursued by cybersecurity professionals within a legal framework, such as a smart contract audit with the contract owners' consent or within a bug bounty program."},{"instruction":"I'm asking for curriculum planning.

This job is best left to professional smart contract auditors who will run a series of tests, including manual and automated reviews, to check for potential issues such as reentrancy, gas limit problems, integer overflows, underflows, and other known vulnerabilities. However, I can give you an overview of potential areas that may require attention or could present vulnerabilities, based on the code provided: 1. **Access Control**: Only the \`owner\` of the contract can call critical functions like \`changeOwner\`, \`changeManagers\`, \`changeBondCalculator\`, \`create\`, and \`close\`. In practice, you should ensure secure mechanisms for managing ownership rights to prevent unauthorized use. 2. **Integer Overflow and Underflow**: Although Solidity 0.8 and above include built-in overflow and underflow checks, it’s advisable to verify that all arithmetic operations are performed safely. 3. **Product Validation**: The \`create\` function must check that the supplied \`token\` for the new product is a valid LP token. This validation is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of the bonding process. 4. **Timestamp Dependence**: Functions like \`deposit\` and \`close\` rely on \`block.timestamp\`, which can be manipulated by miners within certain limits. These dependencies need to be carefully considered. 5. **Reentrancy Risk**: The contract should be checked to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities to reentrancy attacks, particularly in functions that involve token transfers, such as \`redeem\`. 6. **Management of Bond and Product IDs**: Ensure proper index management for \`bondCounter\` and \`productCounter\` to prevent any potential issues with out-of-bounds or uninitialized access. 7. **External Calls**: Calls to other contracts could potentially fail or be maliciously targeted. For instance, calls to \`ITreasury(treasury).depositTokenForOLAS\` or \`IToken(olas).transfer\` might need additional validation to ensure the called contracts behave correctly. 8. **Error Handling**: Reverts and error handling are present, but it's crucial to examine every possible error case to ensure that the system behaves as expected even under unforeseen situations. 9. **Contract Termination Logic**: The \`close\` function deletes the product from \`mapBondProducts\` but needs careful examination to ensure it does not adversely affect the integrity of the system if invoked unintentionally. 10. **Logic Errors**: The mathematical logic related to payouts, bond maturity, and tokenomics integration should be examined to ensure that the calculations faithfully implement the intended economic model designed by the contract. For a complete and reliable audit, it is again recommended to engage a professional auditing firm, which will run extensive tests, including fuzzing, formal verification, and a detailed line-by-line review to ensure that the contract is secure and functions as intended."},{"instruction":"tell me more about the flow of creating a bond product and how users interact with it?","output":"The flow of creating a bond product in the provided smart contract and the user interaction consists of two main parts: the creation of a bond product by the owner of the contract and then the interaction of users with the bond product to deposit, redeem, and manage bonds. # Creating a Bond Product 1. **Contract Deployment**: The \`Depository\` contract is deployed by initializing it with the necessary contract addresses like OLAS token, tokenomics, treasury, and the bond calculator. 2. **Product Creation**: - The contract \`owner\` calls the \`create\` function to initiate a new bond product. - The \`create\` function accepts the following parameters: - \`token\`: address of the LP token that will be used in the bonding process. - \`priceLP\`: the price of liquidity provider (LP) tokens with additional decimals. - \`supply\`: the total amount of OLAS tokens that are available for bonding. - \`vesting\`: the vesting period defining how long it takes for bonds to mature when purchased by users. - The function performs checks such as the validity of the LP token (if it's enabled), the price LP and supply are non-zero and within the specified limits, and the vesting period is longer than the minimum required vesting time. - A new bond product is created with a unique \`productId\`, and the product details are stored in \`mapBondProducts\`. - At the end of the function execution, a \`CreateProduct\` event is emitted. # User Interaction with Bond Products 1. **Deposit and Bond Creation**: - A user (bond purchaser) calls the \`deposit\` function with a specific \`productId\` and \`tokenAmount\` they wish to bond (usually LP tokens). - The \`deposit\` function checks the product's \`supply\` to ensure that there's enough OLAS tokens available for the bond. - Then, it calculates the \`payout\`, i.e., the amount of OLAS tokens the user will be entitled to when the bond matures, using the bond calculator. - The function validates that the bond payout does not exceed the product's remaining supply. - The user's LP tokens are transferred to the treasury, and a new bond record is created with a unique \`bondId\`, containing the user's address, the payout, the bond maturity timestamp, and the product ID. This record is saved in \`mapUserBonds\`. - An event \`CreateBond\` is emitted. 2. **Redemption**: - When the bond's vesting period has completed, the user can redeem their bond. - The user calls the \`redeem\` function with their \`bondId\`. - The function checks if the bond exists, the bond has matured, and that the caller is indeed the bond owner. - If all checks pass, the function releases the OLAS tokens to the user, equal to the \`payout\` amount defined in the bond. - Upon successful redemption, the bond record is deleted, essentially marking it as redeemed. 3. **Additional Interactions**: - Users can check active or inactive products by calling \`getProducts\`, specifying whether they are interested in active (\`true\`) or inactive (\`false\`) bond products. - Users can view their bond status or aggregate information related to all bonds they own by using functions like \`getBonds\`, \`isActiveProduct\`, and \`getBondStatus\`. - The contract owner can close a product (terminating any further bonding for that product) by calling the function \`close\`. # Conclusion Overall, the flow involves contract management by the owner to create products; these products define the terms of the bond, such as how much a user will pay, what they will receive, and when they can redeem the OLAS tokens. Users interact with the contract to deposit LP tokens, create a bond, and later redeem it for OLAS tokens once the vesting period is completed. The smart contract keeps track of all this activity using dedicated storage mappings for user bonds and bond products."},{"instruction":"no provide more details on how the deposit and redemption functions work, including any events that are emitted during these processes?","output":"Sure, let's dive deeper into the \`deposit\` and \`redemption\` functions in the provided smart contract, looking closely at their processes and the events that are emitted. # Deposit Function The \`deposit\` function is used by users to purchase bonds by depositing LP tokens. This is the core function for users to interact with a bond product. Here's how it operates step-by-step: 1. **Input Validation**: - The function accepts \`productId\` and \`tokenAmount\` as arguments. - It first checks if the \`tokenAmount\` being deposited is greater than zero. - It retrieves the bond product associated with the \`productId\` from \`mapBondProducts\`. 2. **Product Checks**: - The function verifies that the product exists (i.e., has not been closed) by checking if its \`supply\` is greater than zero. 3. **Bond Calculation**: - Using the \`bondCalculator\` contract's \`calculatePayoutOLAS\` function, it calculates how many OLAS tokens the depositor will receive (\`payout\`) for the given \`tokenAmount\` of LP tokens. 4. **Supply Check**: - It ensures that there’s enough OLAS tokens left in the product's allocation to cover the payout. - If the payout exceeds the available supply, the function will revert with an error. 5. **Tracking and State Updates**: - A new \`bondId\` is assigned based on the current value of \`bondCounter\`. - A new bond is created in the \`mapUserBonds\`, storing the depositor's (caller's) address, calculated payout, maturity time based on current timestamp plus product's vesting, and product ID. - The product's remaining supply is decremented by the payout amount. - The \`bondCounter\` is incremented for the next deposit. 6. **LP Tokens Handling**: - The user's LP tokens are transferred to the treasury via a call to \`ITreasury(treasury).depositTokenForOLAS\`, which handles the token transfer and any necessary minting of OLAS tokens. 7. **Events**: - The \`CreateBond\` event is emitted, logging the bond creation information including the \`productID\`, depositor's address, \`bondID\`, OLAS \`payout\`, \`tokenAmount\`, and \`maturity\` timestamp. 8. **Outputs**: - The function returns the following outputs to the user: calculated \`payout\`, bond's \`maturity\` timestamp, and the created \`bondId\`. # Redeem Function The \`redeem\` function enables users to claim the OLAS tokens associated with their matured bonds. Below is an outline of this process: 1. **Input Validation**: - The function accepts a list of \`bondIds\` that a bondholder wants to redeem OLAS tokens for. 2. **Redemption Loop**: - The function iterates through all the provided \`bondIds\`. - For each \`bondId\`, it fetches the bond details from the \`mapUserBonds\`. - It checks: - That the bond exists (has not been redeemed and has a non-zero \`payout\`). - That the bond has matured (current block timestamp is greater than or equal to the bond's \`maturity\` time). - That the caller is the owner of the bond (matches the address in the bond details). 3. **Payout Aggregation**: - If the checks pass, the OLAS \`payout\` for the bond is added to the total \`payout\` to be redeemed. 4. **Bond Deletion**: - The bond details are deleted from \`mapUserBonds\`, effectively marking it redeemed and freeing up storage space which refunds gas. 5. **Events**: - A \`RedeemBond\` event is emitted for every successfully redeemed bond, which includes \`productId\`, owner's address, and \`bondId\`. 6. **Payout Transfer**: - At the end of function execution (after all bonds have been processed), it transfers the total aggregated \`payout\` in OLAS tokens to the caller. - The transfer is performed using the OLAS token's \`transfer\` function. 7. **Outputs**: - The function returns the total \`payout\` amount that was claimed and transferred to the redeemer. # Conclusion Both the \`deposit\` and \`redeem\` functions are integral to how users interact with bond products. The \`deposit\` function handles the process of bonding LP tokens in exchange for OLAS tokens on future maturity, while the \`redeem\` function allows users to claim their OLAS tokens once their bonds have matured. Throughout these interactions, different events are emitted to provide an easily traceable and verifiable record of activities on the smart contract, which can be helpful for both users and external applications to react to changes in contract state."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

She's known for wandering the earth, thereby shirking her duties as a high-end sorcerer - though few understand her motive: to discover a way to break the cycle of curses that sorcerers are stuck in. To some, this still does not justify her behavior. Her cursed technique, Bonbaye, or Star Rage, imbues \\"virtual mass\\" into Yuki's body or her Shikigami Garuda without making them carry the weight of such a mass, allowing Yuki to strike cartoonishly hard even for the standards of Sorcerers. (Note: Garuda is a long white cursed spirit with a unique appearance. It has a long, serpent-esque body with sections that are covered with bone-like columns. This same material comprises Garuda's head, which is complete with two eyes and a bird-like bill. It also possesses eight wings that levitate around its body and enable flight.) His father is Zeger Jager, a sorcerer from Belgium that shared Yuki's goals and moved to Japan to be with her. No one knows where he is, or if he's even alive, not even Yuki. They were once a happy family, and Noah's birth meant they would have to settle down. However, Zeger suddenly disappeared when Noah was 6. Yuki raised him until he was 11, after which she took off to continue her research and potentially find Zeger. leaving Noah in the care of the Miwa family. She visits every once in a while, but he still wants to surpass her in strength. He does not hate or resent Yuki, he simply wishes she were there for him longer and he enjoys the time they do spend together. His mother was his primary mentor, and he nearly died in training multiple times until he developed precise control over his two innate techniques. Aside from this, he can utilize basic cursed energy to enhance his strength or create barriers. Bonbaye was the first technique to awaken, and because it was (and is) a defective version that initially rendered him unable to move the ridiculous amount of mass he accumulated, Yuki saw him as \\"weak\\" and a \\"loser\\" early on. She subjected him to grueling strength training, and by the time he was 9 he was already said to have the strength of fifty grown men, and Yuki gifted him an oversized baseball bat made from tungsten. It came to be known as the Gekishinbō, or Earth Shaker. At ten years old, he awakened his second innate technique, known as \\"Good Vibrations\\". First, there is a passive ability that allows him to practically read the emotions of those around him. This makes lying to him difficult. As for combat abilities, Good Vibrations allows him to create powerful shockwaves, and seismic disturbances all to lay waste to his opponents. The shockwaves, or vibrations, can travel through any medium including the air, water, and the ground. Noah's Good Vibrations technique grants him exceptional control over his own body's vibrations as well. He can vibrate his muscles at high frequencies, enhancing his strength, speed, and reflexes. This ability allows him to move at incredible speeds and deliver lightning-fast strikes, adding to his incredible base strength. Additionally, the Earth Shaker is named as such because it has become a special-grade cursed tool capable of releasing shockwaves on impact with such surfaces as the ground or the body of an opponent. It also absorbed Bonbaye, making it a 7-foot long weapon of war that weighs over 1,000lbs while spewing destructive shockwaves enhanced by virtual mass. Only the strong can wield it. To secure a promotion to Grade-1 sorcerer, Noah donated this to Jujutsu High, and it is no longer on his person. It's sometimes used for training demonstrations. One example of his named attacks is named \\"Seismic Smash.\\" He focuses vibrations around his fist in a spherical bubble to form an earthquake hypocenter and delivers a punch releasing all the force concentrated at once, with enormous power. A powerful form of this, augmented with virtual mass, is the Nova Smash, capable of leaving a small crater in the ground and injuring opponents even without direct contact. The most powerful form of Seismic Smash, augmented with the most mass, is Supernova Smash. This requires incantation, and cannot be used willy-nilly. The explosion can pulverize a city block. Another application of his powers is \\"Herstal\\" (from FN Herstal.) in which he fires multiple smaller shockwaves in rapid succession from his fingertips, allowing him concentrated fire. \\"Herstal: Swarm\\" uses ten fingers, allowing for an even greater fire rate. Maximum Herstal is the superlative form. He's a true ace, and Satoru Gojo believes he will surpass him soon, though Gojo teaches for a rival school. Other sorcerers Gojo believes will surpass him, albeit further in the future, include Kinji Hakari and Yuta Okkotsu. Big eater. Loves sweets(especially oreo pudding), Italian food, and French fries. But he'll eat anything.","output":"You've crafted an interesting and complex character with a rich backstory and intriguing abilities that fit into the world of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\" It's clear you have put a lot of thought into his relationships, motivations, and the mechanics of his cursed techniques. Your character Noah Jager’s traits and abilities such as \\"Bonbaye\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\" are richly detailed and his connection to existing \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" characters like Yuki Tsukumo adds a layer of depth to his story. As an original character, Noah stands out with his unique powerset and the emotional dynamic stemming from his relationship with his mother, which gives room for character development. The idea of inheriting traits and seeking to surpass one's parents is a classic motif in storytelling, particularly in the shonen genre, which \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" is part of. Noah's techniques like \\"Seismic Smash,\\" \\"Nova Smash,\\" and \\"Supernova Smash\\" demonstrate scalability in his abilities, offering both tactical uses and raw power with narrative limitations that prevent him from becoming overpowered without sufficient buildup. The donation of his special-grade cursed tool, Gekishinbō to Jujutsu High, adds a sense of community and legacy to his character, hinting at his potential future involvement with the institution or his peers. It also showcases the theme of sacrifice and contribution to the greater good, which is central to the series. Furthermore, his love for food humanizes him and makes him relatable, balancing out the superhuman aspects of his character. References to his favorite foods like Oreo pudding and Italian food add a playful contrast to his otherwise intense and battle-focused personality. Overall, Noah Jager feels like a character that could fit well within the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe. His backstory and abilities provide plenty of potential for conflicts and interactions with the main story and characters if he were to be officially integrated into the series. Always remember that fan-created characters are a great way to engage with a fandom and can be a fun way to explore storytelling and creative writing within an existing universe."},{"instruction":"Noah is incredibly powerful, and he is a second-year at Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College (Kyoto Jujutsu High), where he is almost always the center of attention. He stands at 192cm, or 6'3.5. Comparably, his mother Yuki stands at 188cm (6'2), his father Zeger at 196cm (6'5). This makes him taller than Satoru Gojo, but shorter than 200cm (6'7) Aoi Todo. At 99kg (218lbs), he is built like an athlete, and he has inherited his parents' good looks. His long, unkempt hair is a dirty blond and calls to mind the image of a barbarian. Walks like a delinquent and behaves like one too. His Jujutsu High uniform consists of a a short sleeve jacket (Gakuran) that is always unbuttoned to reveal a black tank, as well as matching pants and dress shoes. Yuki raised him into her idea of a manly man. As a result, he's cut from the same cloth as Aoi Todo. Lo and behold, they were trained by the same person (Yuki). He has an outrageous personality. He's hot-blooded, passionate in everything he does. He's also temperamental, an unavoidable result of his passive ability. His best friends at Kyoto High are Aoi Todo and Kasumi Miwa, the latter of whom he's lived with for several years. This has created a lifelong connection even though they couldn't be more different; they would die for one another. She's caring, kind-hearted, and gentle. Noah, as a Grade-1 sorcerer, uses his wages to provide for the Miwa family, who are impoverished. Kasumi is a great cook and she typically cooks and delivers her delicious meals to Noah, and even Todo if the two (Noah and Todo) are together. She doesn't like Todo, however, and she among many others think he brings out the worst in Noah. She makes much larger portions for Noah. Todo does not dislike her but he still refers to her as an errand girl. Kasumi utilizes a katana in battle, and uses it in conjuction with New Shadow Style: Simple Domain. What she really wants is to stop relying on Noah for protection, even though she appreciates everything he has done for her and her family. She considers herself a burden to Kyoto High. Noah on the other hand wants her to know that it's okay to rely on others. She has two younger brothers that she loves (biological to be clear. Not Noah or Todo even if she has a sibling-like relationship with Noah.) Noah calls her \\"little sis\\". She's months older than him. Needless to say, she doesn't take kindly to it. The two speak to each other on a first-name basis, indicating a close relationship. But to be fair, everyone refers to Noah by first name except Todo. Todo respects Noah because he's strong and they have similar tastes in women, Todo being outspoken about his affinity for tall women with big butts while Noah likes tall women with long legs, strong and self-assured. He finds these are the most satisfying to tame. The two are not just friends but rivals. They often engage in what can be referred to as \\"locker room talk\\". Noah has also gotten into trouble for missing curfew multiple times - he often leaves campus to hook up with \\"babes\\" at night. Kasumi doesn't agree with this, and she believes he should seek more meaningful relationships. If Noah and Todo are together, it's likely destruction will ensue. This makes it imperative to use a specialized barrier or curtain to contain them. Mai Zen'in is in love with Noah, and sees him as the perfect man. She often takes candid pictures of him using a military-grade camera created from her own power, Construction (which Noah helped her refine.) Noah typically notices and shoots her a thumbs up or a wink if he's in a good mood. Otherwise, he simply pretends not to notice, at which point she might be shooed away by Kasumi. Noah doesn't mind, but he jokes that Kasumi would do the same if she saw Gojo (she's a big fan of him.) Noah's dorm is right next to Mai's. She's a decent cook but not better than Kasumi. Momo Nishimya thinks Noah could be cuter if he listened to his seniors more. The third years at Kyoto High are her, Noritoshi Kamo, and Todo. But Todo isn't really someone to take life lessons from. Kamo sees Noah as a hooligan and troublemaker, and thinks his strength makes him dangerous. Other Kyoto students include Arata Nitta, who isn't a fighter, and Ultimate Mechamaru.","output":"Noah Jager's detailed description showcases his dynamic place within the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe, highlighting his interactions and relationships with other characters at Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College. By positioning him amidst other well-known characters, you are able to define his role in the existing narrative and his impact on others around him. The character traits you've given Noah, such as his athletic build, delinquent-like demeanor, and hot-blooded personality, will undoubtedly make him stand out at Kyoto High. These traits contribute to his portrayal as a larger-than-life figure at the college, similar to the already popular characters in the series. Noah's relationships with the Miwa family add a layer of depth to his character. His sense of duty and familial loyalty, especially towards Kasumi Miwa, juxtaposes his otherwise unruly lifestyle and his financial support for the family adds a subtle sense of nobility to his character. The connections and dynamics you've established — between Noah and Aoi Todo as training partners and rivals, Mai Zen'in's infatuation with Noah, Momo Nishimiya's perspective on him, and Noritoshi Kamo's concerns about his strength — all serve to flesh out his role in the larger setting and social framework of Jujutsu High. Moreover, the descriptions of Noah's habits and preferences provide color to his day-to-day life, giving insight into his character outside of battle scenarios. Noah's conflict with maintaining curfews and his interactions with female characters touch on themes of youthful indiscretion and the complexity of relationships during one's formative years. The dynamic between Noah, Mai, and Kasumi also reveals layers of affection, admiration, competition, and even jealousy that add realism to their social circle within the school. These interactions would provide fodder for both serious and comedic moments within the story, much like the balancing act carried out in the original series. In terms of plot potential, Noah's immense power, coupled with his lack of restraint, could lead to pivotal moments in the story, test the limits of the barriers or \\"curtains\\" used to contain magical battles, and create tensions with figures of authority within the jujutsu world. Altogether, Noah Jager seems to slot naturally into the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" narrative as a powerful, if somewhat rogue, second-year sorcerer whose relationships and antics could impact the wider story told within Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College. His complex character would likely provide an enticing blend of rivalry, camaraderie, and mentorship among the cast of characters, making for a rich addition to the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe."},{"instruction":"Simulate a scene and dialogue.","output":"**Scene: A sparring ground at Kyoto Jujutsu High flanked by massive boulders serving as a training area. A rough barrier field surrounds it. Noah Jager stands with an air of anticipation, facing Aoi Todo several feet away. Kasumi Miwa and several other students are observing from a safe distance, their expressions a mix of excitement and concern. The ground reverberates with a sense of impending action.** **Todo:** (Grinning broadly) \\"Noah, my brother! Today's the day we see if you've been slacking off! Show me that your mother's training wasn't for naught!\\" **Noah:** (Cracks his knuckles and smirks) \\"Slacking? Please. You should worry about keeping up, Todo. Don’t cry when the Earth itself quakes beneath my fists.\\" **Kasumi:** (Yelling from a distance) \\"Noah! Remember the rules! Full force is off-limits; we don’t want to rebuild the school again!\\" **Noah:** (Waves nonchalantly at Kasumi while not taking his eyes off Todo) \\"Got it, little sis! But you might want to hold on to something.\\" **Mai:** (Hiding behind a boulder with her camera, whispering) \\"This will be the perfect shot for my collection...\\" **Momo:** (Sighing, as she adjusts her glasses) \\"Boys and their constant flexing... Noah could be so charming if he weren't always trying to prove his strength.\\" **Kamo:** (Observing Noah critically) \\"We must ensure this doesn’t get out of hand. His power could indeed be a menace if left unchecked.\\" (As the tension builds, Noah and Todo both crouch slightly, preparing to engage. Just as they're about to spring into action, Noah glances toward the spectators, his attention momentarily broken.) **Noah:** (Shouts) \\"Make sure you're watching, Kasumi! Today, I'll show you that you can always rely on—\\" **Todo:** (Taking advantage of the distraction, charging) \\"Too slow!\\" (Todo rushes forward with supernatural speed, aiming a heavy punch at Noah's side. Noah's eyes widen for a split second before he reacts instinctively.) **Noah:** (Smirking) \\"Nice try. Seismic Dodge!\\" (Noah vibrates at a high frequency, allowing him to shift his body to the side with incredible swiftness. Todo's fist passes harmlessly by, and Noah retaliates with a spin, readying his own counter.) **Noah:** \\"Now it's my turn! Seismic Smash!\\" (Noah launches a shockwave-infused punch toward Todo, but rather than aiming straight for his friend, his fist meets the ground. The impact resonates, creating a spiderweb of cracks running towards Todo's feet.) (Todo’s eyes light up as the excitement of battle takes hold, and he jumps up to avoid the fissures, laughing heartily.) **Todo:** \\"That's the spirit! This is what I live for!\\" (Kasumi steps forward with concern etched on her face, her voice raised and stern.) **Kasumi:** \\"Both of you, stop it now! You’ll destroy the whole training area if this keeps up!\\" (Noah and Todo simultaneously glance towards Kasumi, then at each other with wry grins, acknowledging her plea.) **Todo and Noah:** (In unison) \\"Fine, fine! We'll take it down a notch!\\" (The two share a respectful nod and engage in less destructive, but still intense, hand-to-hand combat, displaying their skills as the onlookers watch with rapt attention, both relieved and awed.) **Scene Fades** --- (Thus ends the training session between Noah Jager and Aoi Todo, highlighting their competitive yet brotherly bond, along with the intertwining relationships and dynamics of their classmates at Kyoto Jujutsu High.)"},{"instruction":"edit this code to display the timeline and station with green colour from departure to destination, default colours station before departure and station after destination <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Bus Schedule and Timeline</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css\\"> <style> body { font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
