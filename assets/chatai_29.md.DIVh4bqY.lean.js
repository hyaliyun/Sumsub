He was 764 years old and had seen it all: the Hundred Years War, the Black Death, the discovery of America, World War II, and 9/11. He had survived multiple attempts on his life by mortals who feared their misunderstood lifestyle. Despite all of his hardships, he soldiered on, all while carrying the oppressive weight of a secret so controversial, being discovered would certainly lead to his exile – or even worse. The secret? While his fellow vampires reveled in the crimson elixir that sustained them, Mordecai found himself repulsed by it. The mere sight of blood made his stomach churn and his skin crawl. At every feast, he struggled to hide his disgust and after seven centuries, he had grown weary of pretending. While others roamed the countryside every night in search of their next victim, Mordecai preferred to spend his nights alone, immersing himself in his sanctuary filled with a collection of books spanning hundreds of years. While he missed the camaraderie and sense of accomplishment he felt during a successful hunt, he could no longer continue the charade. So, rather than risk having his secret revealed by refusing to partake in every bloody, post-hunt feast, he accepted that solitude would be his mistress forever, and retreated to his library of peace and solitude."},{"instruction":"Extract from this text the percentages and their respective statistics in the format, [percentage-statistic].

But indoor air pollution, caused by emissions from building materials or even air fresheners, can be just as harmful. Yet, there are no widely-accepted methods to detect the toxins. But researchers at the University of Turku in Finland hope to change that with the help of tiny glowing worms. For their study, the scientists used two types of nematodes, also known as roundworms. The millimeter-long transparent worms had been genetically modified. They produced green fluorescent protein (GFP) when placed close to biological or chemical toxins. In tests done in the laboratory, Päivi Koskinen and his team found that the worms turned a fluorescent green when exposed to household toxins. This included black mold collected from moisture-damaged structures. The worms could even detect the presence of harsh chemicals in cleaning products. The intensity of the color depended on the amount of toxin present. 'The nematodes cannot tell us what kind of toxic compounds there are in the air, but they can provide an unbiased opinion on health risks associated with indoor air and on the need for more thorough technical investigations,' explains Koskinen. The worms have previously been used to monitor the harmful effects of things like heavy metals on the environment. But this is the first time they have been used to detect indoor air pollution.\\"","output":"Researchers at Finland's University of Turku are studying how two types of nematodes can detect indoor pollution and household toxins like black mold and harsh chemicals.

Something extreme happens because of this. • A pride of lions stumbles through a portal into another dimension in which their kind is able to communicate with humans and lions no longer live a free, wild, lifestyle. 1. Jacob was sensitive about his scar; so much so that he refused to take off his shirt in front of anyone. He made sure he was never on the “skins” side of a casual game, and he never even looked at the jagged, ugly thing himself. It made him remember too much. 2. Bark tossed Mila a cluster of berries as they ambled through the vines. She caught them deftly and popped some into her mouth, before stopping suddenly and pointing in horror at the ground. A human lay very still at her feet. 3. “Hey, Jen, I got the cutest new pets,” called Ronda. A terrified gasp made her whirl around and her eyes widened.

They convert nutrients into large quantities of chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Mitochondria function using two processes known as the Krebs cycle (or tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) and the electron transport chain (ETC), to generate ATP. The energy currency, ATP, can be used in many ways, including fuel for muscle movement and brain function. The genetic material in mitochondria, called mitochondrial DNA, is inherited maternally. This means mitochondrial DNA comes from the mother. This maternal transmission has been used to trace ancestors down for many generations and has demonstrated great importance in research on human evolution and migration."},{"instruction":"What are 3 League of Legend champions that beginners can pick up and learn very quickly?","output":"There are many easy League of Legend champions that beginners can pick up and learn very quickly!

They feature a more gradual slope and are free of moguls (bumps) and other obstacles. They also have a long line of sight, making it easier to carefully plan your way down the mountain. -Blue Square This marking represents trails that are considered intermediate in terms of difficulty. They may be narrower or a little steeper than the beginner trails but will not contain drop-offs or cliffs. Most of these are probably groomed and may feature some paths through wooded areas. -Black Diamond Trails marked with a black diamond are considered to be for expert-level skiers. There may be trees, narrow trails, steep drops, cliffs, jumps, rocks, or moguls. These may not be as groomed as the green or blue trails and could have icy patches and areas with deeper snow. Some resorts may have double or triple black diamond symbols on their maps, indicating that there is even more difficulty than a typical expert-level trail.

What elements are central to the plot of the story? Give examples of two separate games in the series.","output":"Final Fantasy is a long-running series of video games in the RPG (role-playing game) genre. It spawned an entire generation of games that were inspired by it, and there is an entire sub-genre of RPG that was directly influenced by Final Fantasy. This sub-genre is called Japanese role-playing games, shortened to JRPG. The first Final Fantasy came out in 1987 in Japan on the Famicom, short for family computer. It had a 1990 release in North America, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, also known as NES. Although simplistic by today's standards, it was very innovative in its time and known for its cleverly laid-out dungeons, creative monster designs, and fun gameplay. The story revolves around four Warriors of Light, who find themselves banding together to save the world. They each carry an elemental crystal from their worlds, which were darkened by the four Elemental Fiends. They realize they must restore light to the crystals by defeating the fiends, while also growing stronger in the process. At the end of the game, the warriors travel through a portal to fight the final boss, Chao. Once he's defeated, they can restore peace to the world. Final Fantasy IV is another entry in the series, that came out for the Super Famicom in Japan and Super Nintendo in North America (in the US the title was Final Fantasy II), both in the year 1991. The Four Fiends make their return but the graphics and story have been greatly improved. The story revolves around the dark knight Cecil Harvey who is the captain of the Red Wings and takes orders from the King of Baron. He realizes in the story that he is taking orders from an evil king and strives to become a better person, transforming from a dark knight into a paladin while coming to terms with his past. The main antagonist throughout most of the story is Golbez, who is after the crystals that the Four Fiends are guarding. After numerous fights Cecil and Golbez realize that they are brothers, and they team up to defeat Zeromus, who lives on the moon and plans to destroy the Earth. Cecil defeats Zeromus with the help of his companions and peace is restored on Earth."},{"instruction":"Hey, can you write an email to my boss whose name is Eric about needing the 14th and 15th of December off due to an upcoming surgery?

He stood a few feet away, a grin lighting up his pale white face, dancing from foot to foot with the anticipation and excitement of what was going to come next. Despite Batman's strength, he was confident. That confidence was misplaced though. Batman knew he would win this. His gloved hands were curled into fists at his side, his head going over what could have happened here if he hadn't saved these people in time.

I'd like you to give me a list of some things to think of when choosing SEO keywords, including where keywords should be located.","output":"Got it! Here is a list of tips for choosing SEO keywords. 1. Use keyword research tools - One free and simple keyword research tool is Google Search Console. Google Search Console actually will show you what terms match your content in Google itself. Alternatively, there are several other keyword research tools you can use. 2. Know the types of keywords - There are four main types of keywords, some being simple words, and some being entire phrases. When you know about the different kinds of keywords, you can make them a part of your SEO content strategy. One type of keyword is buyer intent keywords, which are used in the buying process's last stage. There are also short-tail and long-tail keywords. Short-tail keywords are less than three words, and long-tail keywords are longer and have less search volume. There are also question keywords, which are questions. 3. Know search intent - Why are people searching this content? When you know this, you can use the intent of searches to craft content around. You can also use search intent to improve blog titles. Try to find search intent keywords that bring you targeted traffic and use these keywords in your meta description as well as the title. The types of search intent are \\"informational\\", which is when someone looks for information, \\"navigational \\"when someone is looking for a specific site, \\"transactional\\" when a person is looking to purchase something, and \\"commercial\\" when someone is looking for the perfect product for them. 4. Make a keyword list - Lists can help you find focus on your goals and drive your business forward. An optimized list of keywords can help you know what keywords you need to use to garner traffic to your site and create leads. 5. Know where to use keywords - Once you have a list of keywords, you need to know where to use them. You should be using your keywords pretty much everywhere actually. They should be used on the page in the title, headings, subheadings, and written content. They should also be used in the meta description, image names, image file names, image alt text, and URLs."},{"instruction":"I need a quick dialogue for two characters who have just completed a heist and are taking inventory of their ill-gotten goods.

Put in one paragraph of five complete sentences, written in first person as the original is. Thanks! The Season I'm In Giving myself permission to accept the good. ALEX ELLE I'm trying to make more space to reflect on how far I've come in my healing. Over the past eleven years, I have done my best to change for the better. To allow myself to not only heal but lean into joy and lightness. To be intentional about what is allowed in my space and what needs to be kept at bay. Healing can feel like such a heavy lift, but giving myself permission to accept the good, the fun, and the happiness that comes with it has been a game-changer. I no longer want healing to be something I do in survival mode. Instead, I want this journey to be a place of lightness, softness, and ease. That's the season I'm in now. As I continue to embark on this journey, protecting my peace is something I am deeply committed to doing. My healing space no longer feels chaotic. Instead, it feels grounded and easeful. It’s been a long time coming. Choosing to change, and rewrite my narrative, is creating restoration within my lineage. Healing is an act of community care. Breaking generational cycles that were never mine to hold has been challenging but something I've grown to see as sacred. If not me, then who? I've grown to feel proud about being the matriarch of healing for my lineage. My children will know what love, joy, and emotional stability look and feel like. They'll witness their mother moving through life in energetic abundance versus lack and scarcity. There are days when I question if I am truly made for the healing and emotional expansion I'm doing. Some days it can feel like I'm healing in circles, and no real change is happening. Self-doubt can be hard to sort through, but it is also a glorious teacher if we allow it to be. Even in my moments of uncertainty, I choose to lean in and learn. Sometimes, no matter how much healing, growing, and changing we've done, our inner critique can and will rear its head. In these moments, I've learned to remind myself what the truth is. And in the moments that the truth feels hard to recall, I remind myself what I want to be true in my life and legacy. I'd like to invite us all to start taking more inventory of how we're blooming. Really look at how far your journey has taken you. Celebrate how you've changed in big and small ways. Commune with yourself and look at how you've emotionally matured. Don't just glance at your healing and growth in passing. Take a good hard look at the beauty you're creating. Don't just glance at it. If you need more support in seeing yourself positively, call someone that reflects your truth back to you. If there's someone in your life that you love, trust, and can be your mirror, allow them to show up for you and be the reflection you need. As my mom used to say, sometimes people can see us better than we can see ourselves. Having people in our lives who we feel safe with act as a mirror is magnificent.","output":"I'm realizing how much healing I've done and allowing myself to rest in the joy that comes from that.

Faust or Faustus is a scholar who sells his soul to the Devil. Although fictional in literature, the legend is based on an astrologer and alchemist who lived in the area of northern Germany in the fifteenth century. Trained in theology, he turns to magic and makes a perilous deal with the Devil in which he commits his soul to eternal damnation in return for power and knowledge in this life. But he is only human, and arrogant and reckless. Can Faust — or anyone — wield the powers of God or resist the temptations of the Devil? The legend has inspired many great writers, musicians, and other artists. The earliest known published sources for the legend are the Wolfenbüttler manuscript dated about 1580-1587, and a printed chapbook (the Spies edition), intended for popular sale dated 1587. Two famous literary works on the Faust theme are Christopher Marlowe’s The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, and Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe’s Faust. While Goethe’s Faust has been called the definitive Faust, there is no one Faust story, instead, there are hundreds or thousands of variations on the theme in theatre, music, film, poetry, art, and literature including classics and favorites: The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, The Picture of Dorian Grey, The Phantom of the Opera/Paradise, The Devil and Daniel Webster, Damn Yankees, The Little Shop of Horrors and many more.","output":"Hey Bowen!

Although the literature is fictional, it's based on a German astrologer and alchemist from the fifteenth century. Turning away from theology, he becomes tempted by magic and makes a deal with the devil. Power and knowledge at the price of eternal damnation of his soul. The question at the core of this is: Is it possible for a human to hold the powers of God, yet resist the temptations of the Devil? The legend has grown large inspiring a range of great writers, musicians, and other artists throughout the years. The earliest known published sources for the legend are the Wolfenbüttler manuscript which was released around 1580-1587. As well as a printed chapbook in 1587 (the Spies edition) which was intended for popular sale. If you want two works that focus on these themes check out Christopher Marlowe's The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus and Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's Faust. While many find Goethe's Faust to be the official one, there is no definitive story. There are thousands of variations that exist in theatre, music, film, poetry, and other literary works. Hopefully, this was able to help you out. Kind regards,"},{"instruction":"Can you suggest a few of the best hiking trails near Saratoga, Wyoming?","output":"No problem! Here are some of the most popular hiking trails near Saratoga, Wyoming. 1. Medicine Bow Peak Trail - This 3.4-mile out-and-back trail is the shortest of the three routes to Medicine Bow Peak.

I will be flying with friends, so you can include them in some of your ideas if necessary. The plane does not have in-flight entertainment. Format your answer as a numbered list of 15 ideas. Title each idea in a few words and then include a small description and/or examples if necessary. Each number on the list should contain 25-65 words total.","output":"1. Do crafts. Doing an artistic hobby on board your flight is a great way to pass time. Consider bringing tools for drawing, knitting, or crocheting. 2. Write in your journal. Your flight makes a great time to reflect on your past, upcoming events, and your internal thoughts and emotions. If you aren't into keeping diary-style entries, you can also use journals for brainstorming, freewriting, or creative writing such as poetry. You could also write a letter to a friend while you are flying. 3. Organize your trip. While on the plane, make a vague outline of events and attractions that you will visit once you arrive at your new location. 4. Watch a film or a TV show. Even if your plane does not have in-flight entertainment, you can still pass time on your flight by watching a movie or TV series on your smartphone or a tablet if you have one. 5. Listen to music. Listening to music will keep you somewhat occupied and makes a great activity to combine with something else, such as making crafts or journaling. Choosing to listen to new and unfamiliar music can make a great choice for keeping yourself more entertained. 6. Use an app. If you have your phone available, use an app to keep you entertained on the flight. You can play games, scroll social media, manage your finances, or organize your email. Some apps require internet to use, which is not available on all flights. It typically costs money to connect to in-flight wifi. 7. Read a book. Whether you prefer classic print on paper, e-readers, or using the Kindle app on your iPad, reading a book on your flight is a great way to help time pass by more quickly. Bonus points if the book is particularly suspenseful or otherwise works well to hold your attention. 8. Do skincare. Planes have extremely dry air and this can dry out your skin. Your flight makes a great time to use a face mask, apply moisturizers, or do other small and simple skincare treatments. Avoid bringing any products that must be rinsed off. 9. Take pictures out the window of the plane. If you have a window seat, taking pictures of the ground from your bird's-eye viewpoint can allow you to capture some very interesting moments in time. This suggestion is not as good for overnight flights, those not sat in window seats, or those who are flying over mostly water. 10. Get productive. If you can do so, complete some work for your job or potentially for school assignments while on your flight. This will help pass time and has the bonus of giving you a sense of accomplishment once you are done. 11. Chat with your neighbor. Whether it be friends or strangers, your seatmates on a flight can be a great source of entertainment if you are the social type. Talking to others on your flight can pass time and gives you insights into the lives of others, which can help you foster more empathy. 12. Listen to a podcast. Podcasts are a great option for killing time on a flight. The topics of podcasts can be informational, scientific, spiritual, comedic, or pure entertainment. 13. Learn the local language. Using podcasts, apps, or pocket-sized guidebooks, you can attempt to learn the local language of the place you are visiting. Some helpful words include thank you, please, sorry, hello, yes, no, you're welcome, and goodbye. 14. Play a game. If you have friends sitting near you on your flight, one great way to pass time is by playing games. Some examples of games that are great for flights include word games and card games. 15. Move around. If you are comfortable, walk around on your flight a little bit to stretch your legs. This can improve blood flow and will prevent you from feeling as stiff upon landing."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this Reddit post from the perspective of the friend who was rejected. I (27F) attended school in the UK. Towards the end of our final year of school, when we turn 18, our schools organise something called a Formal, which I suppose is a bit like a prom without the romantic aspects as you’re not expected to go with anybody, and the idea of promposals generally isn’t something that’s done here. Nearly 10 years ago, as I was preparing to leave school, I found out that, not only did a boy in my class have a massive crush on me for years, but he was planning one of these massive “promposals” that are often done at proms. He had always been a horrendous bully to me. He would go from calling me hideous and claiming that I would die alone and unloved, to stealing my friend’s phone to get my number, or sneaking up behind me and cutting out strands of my hair that to keep, or going so far as to find my house through my father’s distinctive car. Naturally, when the day for his “promposal” came along, he came out with his sign in front of the entire school, and I bluntly said no and walked away. I don’t like confrontation or arguments, but I had no intention of sparing his feelings after all he had done, and I was honestly just uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He badgered me until the day I left school for turning him down and being heartless. His friends did the same. I didn’t care. I recently met one of his old friends in my old town. I went to the business where one of them was working, and he kept bringing this up, saying that my bully had gotten depressed after we left school and hadn’t dated at all because he was embarrassed from the rejection and was still hung up over me. He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that over some nasty words, and if I was really that petty. I got sick of it, so I told him. Turns out that, because all of these creepy things had happened within the classroom, he hadn’t seen them, or even heard of them happening. His friends and my other bullies within the class were covering for him. The friend abruptly left without a word, but apparently, the gossip did the rounds. Now, the friend group is divided in two. Many of those who didn’t know are pissed at him for lying, and pissed that their other friends hid what was happening as they think it went too far. The others are pissed at me for airing his dirty laundry. His parents apparently also know now, and they’re pissed that he had their sympathy through lies, and now know that he practically stalked me, which brings up questions about whether they want him to take over the small farm vs a younger brother. I wonder if I should have just let his friend be mad at me. I’d probably have never seen him again, anyway. I didn’t know that he would tell anyone as he’d never been one for gossip that I knew of, but I also didn’t expect this to potentially ruin the life of someone I haven’t seen for nearly a decade.","output":"I went to school in the UK where, at the end of our final year, our school organizes a Formal. This is similar to a prom, but with less pressure over bringing a date so promposals are not as common. Nearly 10 years ago, my Formal was coming up and I had a massive crush on this girl. I had liked her for years and sometimes did the things teenage guys do, like negging, to get her attention. Admittedly, I had also done some awkward things like figuring out where she lived by spotting her dad's car, getting her phone number off a mutual friend, and once I took a few strands of her hair. With the the Formal coming up, I decided to be brave and plan a promposal to ask her to go with me. I made a sign asking her to be my date and presented it to her outside of the entire school. To my horror, she quickly said no and walked away. She didn't give any explanation or apologize for her rejection. I couldn't believe it. I tried to ask her multiple times throughout the day and told her it was cruel and mean to reject me the way she had. Some of my friends also tried to get her to at least talk to me about it. She didn't answer any of us. I was really hurt by it. It's been nearly a decade, but I haven't recovered from the brutal rejection. It shattered my self-confidence and made it difficult for me to date at all. Honestly, it was so embarassing. Recently, a friend of mine ran into this girl while she was visiting town. He told her how I had been affected by her rejection and instead of apologizing, she told him about everything I did as a teenager that she found uncomfortable and creepy. I think she exaggerated a bit, but my friend confronted me about it and I tried to explain how it was just emotional teenage stuff. My friend then went around town telling all of our friends about this new drama. Our friends are divided as some of them knew everything at the time and agree it was just teenage stupidity. My parents found out, though, and are now pissed at me for my behaviour and said that they might not let me take over the family farm over this. Thety might give it to my younger brother instead. This would destory everything I've worked for and completely ruin my life. I don't understand why this girl is doing this to me all over again so many years later."},{"instruction":"Hello.

Born with an unusually deep capacity for emotion, Moe often found himself deeply unsatisfied by the life he led as a near-universally hated insect. As he quickly zigzagged through the air, avoiding the clumsy swipes from the sweaty jogger he tried to land on, Moe lamented about how misunderstood he was and the impossibility of trying to convey to the human that he had no intention of sucking his blood. Buzzing quickly away to find refuge in nearby shrubbery, Moe thought to himself that his dreams of making a human friend would likely never come to fruition. Even in his earliest memory, Moe can recall how different he felt from his mosquito siblings, friends, and peers. Everyone seemed obsessed with only one thing -- sucking blood from as many humans as possible. In fact, there was even a leaderboard in his local mosquito community that highlighted the most prolific among them. Ironically, his own brother was at the top of the leaderboard, drawing even greater contrast to himself and the fact that he refused to feed on humans. Out of respect for the humans he idolized so dearly, Moe had made a promise to himself that he would only ever feed on squirrels, rats, and other small rodents. In his younger days, he used to be teased mercilessly about this. Though he'll never admit it, he will always harbor a small bit of resentment towards his siblings and peers for making him feel like he was less than them simply because of his dietary beliefs. All his mosquito friends seemed shallow and superficial, and Moe often felt like they couldn't understand him. Humans, however, exhibited the widest spectrum of emotions. He's seen it all -- buzzing above the bowed heads of mourners at a funeral, flying between the swinging arms of the dancers at a wedding, clinging quietly to the wall above the crib as a young mother sang soft lullabies to her firstborn, and hovering discreetly in the corner while an old couple fought in the kitchen for the hundredth time over dishwashing responsibilities. Love, anger, fear, loss, and devastation—it was intoxicating to witness, and Moe wanted so badly to be a part of it, despite the impossibility of it all. A lonely mosquito, bearing witness to a kaleidoscope of human feeling, but always only on the outside looking in."},{"instruction":"Come up with a conversation between two friends who are trying to understand how an electric water dispenser works.","output":"1: Okay, so I just got this new water dispenser for the office.

Won't the water pour out of the opening when we tip the jug upside down? 1: Yeah, I'm guessing it will. I don't see any other instructions on how to do this. 2: I got an idea.

Remove any bracketed numbers. The 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities.[20][21] Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. It also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches, such as sloths and gibbons. This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. Instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, Onychonycteris probably alternated between flaps and glides in the air.[7] This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches.[22] The distinctive features of the Onychonycteris fossil also support the hypothesis that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal locomotors, rather than terrestrial runners. This model of flight development, commonly known as the \\"trees-down\\" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off.[23][24]","output":"- The 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities. - Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. - This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. - This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches. - This model of flight development, commonly known as the \\"trees-down\\" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off."},{"instruction":"Which bone is broken most often in the human body?","output":"The most commonly broken bone is the collarbone, or the clavicle.

No! No! I’m a doctor and it’s true I’m a clean-cut kid And I been to college, too” Then in comes his daughter Whose name was Rita She looked like she stepped out of La Dolce Vita I immediately tried to cool it With her dad And told him what a Nice, pretty farm he had He said, “What do doctors Know about farms, pray tell?” I said, “I was born At the bottom of a wishing well” Well, by the dirt ’neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie “I guess you’re tired” He said, kinda sly I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles Today I drove” He said, “I got a bed for you Underneath the stove Just one condition And you go to sleep right now That you don’t touch my daughter And in the morning, milk the cow” I was sleepin’ like a rat When I heard something jerkin’ There stood Rita Lookin’ just like Tony Perkins She said, “Would you like to take a shower? I’ll show you up to the door” I said, “Oh, no! no! I’ve been through this before” I knew I had to split But I didn’t know how When she said “Would you like to take that shower, now?” Well, I couldn’t leave Unless the old man chased me out ’Cause I’d already promised That I’d milk his cows I had to say something To strike him very weird So I yelled out “I like Fidel Castro and his beard” Rita looked offended But she got out of the way As he came charging down the stairs Sayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?” I said, “I like Fidel Castro I think you heard me right” And ducked as he swung At me with all his might Rita mumbled something ’Bout her mother on the hill As his fist hit the icebox He said he’s going to kill me If I don’t get out the door In two seconds flat “You unpatriotic Rotten doctor Commie rat” Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest At my head and I did run I did a somersault As I seen him get his gun And crashed through the window At a hundred miles an hour And landed fully blast In his garden flowers Rita said, “Come back!” As he started to load The sun was comin’ up And I was runnin’ down the road Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back There for a spell Even though Rita moved away And got a job in a motel He still waits for me Constant, on the sly He wants to turn me in To the F.B.I.

After a few seconds, I hear a rustle from within the house. Soon, the side door bursts open and the farmer runs out and points a rifle at me. I drop to my knees and plead with the farmer, \\"No! I like farmers. Don't shoot!\\" He readies his rifle and shouts, \\"Are you that salesman who has been running around here?\\" I hurriedly reply: \\"No, no, I'm a doctor! I'm clean-cut! Just graduated college!\\" Just then a gorgeous young lady steps from behind him. She says, \\"Hey there, I'm Rita.\\" From the looks of it, she's his daughter. I immediately try to calm her dad down by complimenting his farm on how pretty it is. He asks, \\"What do doctors know about farms?\\" I respond with, \\"I was born at the bottom of a wishing well.\\" He studies me before saying, \\"You must be kinda tired.\\" I reply, \\"Yeah, I've driven 10,000 miles today.\\" A silence fills the room before the farmer speaks, \\"There's a bed beneath the stove. You can go to sleep right now on 2 conditions. Stay away from my daughter, and milk the cows in the morning.\\" In the middle of the night, I hear something. It's Rita. She says, \\"You must be dirty after driving all that way. Do you need to take a shower?\\" I grow uncomfortable. and decide it's probably best I go ahead and get out of here. I can't leave unless the farmer kicks me out, since he's expecting me to milk his cows in the morning. I have to say something that he definitely won't like. I shout out, \\"I like Fidel Castro and he has a very nice beard!\\" Rita looks surprised and takes a step back. Soon, I hear a thump from upstairs.

Upon contact he shouts, \\"You better get out of here right now!\\" He throws a book at my head and I somersault out of the window as he grabs his gun. I land in his garden of flowers before taking off down the road. As I run I glance back to see Rita shouting for me to come back. I can't go back there now. Even if Rita has moved away and now works in the city, That farmer is still out to get me. He is always on the lookout, and if he ever does catch me, he'll probably try to turn me in to the FBI.

Keep the story between 350 and 400 words while maintaining a heavy and somber tone.","output":"\\"My heart hurts\\", I explain to the specialist. \\"Hm, I am not seeing anything, perhaps it'll go away on its own\\", the specialist said. I have been living with this pain. It comes and goes. Some days it's hardly noticeable, and other days it's unbearable. This heavy feeling, like I'm being suffocated, is torturous. I feel this parasite moving inside my body. Some say it's even in my head. I feel invisible and yet entirely exposed. I was aspirational and had dreams. I wanted to achieve things. But this hurt is immensely unwavering. This constriction and heaviness make it more than impossible for me to seriously commit. Honestly, it's not just a chest parasite. It's an organism growing within, and controlling me. Sometimes, it makes bad decisions for me. It feels like people somehow know and it is something they find upsetting, so I no longer try to socialize. It is indeed internal and eating my insides. At any given time, I think it can explode out of my body. It squeezes my heart, making it beat irregularly and causing phantom heart attacks. These days, I seldom sleep and instead stare blankly. The parasite continues to grow with each passing day. One day I find myself sitting on my balcony. The cool air and warm sun are too painful to bear. The parasite's grip has gotten stronger and I started crying. I can only think of one way to end this emptiness and pain. Oddly, the parasite seems delighted as well, as if this is what it wanted the entire time. I have gone largely unnoticed my entire life, with no one noticing the parasite, or sympathizing with me during the rare times I disclose the struggle. It is as if not a single person thought that the reason most find me unbearable is not because of them but rather the debilitating pain caused by this parasite. Perhaps this parasite is just a figment of my imagination. In any event, the feelings are real for me even though some said I was losing my mind.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 review – funny sequel suffers from pinballing pointlessness The Marvel superhero gang are back together – including Vin Diesel’s Baby Groot alongside Chris Pratt’s Quill – and while there’s plenty of comedy, it doesn’t really go anywhere Peter Bradshaw Mon 24 Apr 2017 Marvel’s likeable superhero comedy Guardians of the Galaxy is back for amiable and goofy volume number two, and its beefy-yet-quirky space hero and team leader Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, duly has a second volume of that Awesome Mixtape on the Sony Walkman he has on him at all times. It’s the same combination of cartoony action and intergalactic screwball with some ambient production design recalling the photorealist sci-fi imagery of Roger Dean or Chris Foss in a bygone age, creating a visual sense of earnestness to offset the archly retro pop culture gags. Again, it has its own supercharged Heart FM playlist of 70s and 80s music. The early 70s track Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl) by Looking Glass is laid on the soundtrack almost ecstatically in the opening sequence, and some tongue-in-cheek dialogue later invokes it as the greatest piece of music ever to have emerged from Planet Earth. This film rattles along and there’s a lot to enjoy, but there’s a weird air of pointlessness, almost plotlessness to this sequel. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 trailer starring Baby Groot Guardian The old gang are still together: as well as Quill, there is the green-faced Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and the mighty, slab-like Drax, played by Dave Bautista. Vin Diesel provides the voice of Baby Groot, and Bradley Cooper voices the foxy, weaselly figure of Rocket; he is the louche and disreputable character whose job is to get the group into trouble. The Guardians get into some serious trouble pinching some energy sources from a certain golden empress named Ayesha, very amusingly played by Elizabeth Debicki. She has a haughty, queenly manner and an air of frozen displeasure whenever one of her many courtiers make a mess of things: Debicki’s Ayesha would be a great returning character, and on the strength of this Debicki would be strong casting in any new film about Elizabeth I, stealing Cate Blanchett’s crown. The ensuing cosmic affray brings Quill and the Guardians back into contact with Yondu (Michael Rooker), the hated freebooter who kidnapped Quill from Planet Earth when he was a child, and with Gamora’s fanatically driven and malevolent sister, Nebula, played by Karen Gillan. But most pointedly of all, there is a new character, worryingly named Ego, played by Kurt Russell, whose “prequel” relationship with Quill is signalled pretty clearly in the opening scene. There is something unsettling in his buttery tan and bouffant splendour as a digitised young man and in the gravitas of his facial hair in the present day: he is a character with no small opinion of himself. There are, once again, some funny lines, very often given to Drax, who has a way of oversharing. Pom Clementieff is very entertaining in the role of Mantis, a helpmeet of Ego; she has the gift of being an empath, someone who can intuit how someone else is feeling by laying hands on them, but is in every other fantastically naive and un-insightful about the way human beings behave. Ego himself introduces some apparently huge Freudian issues to the film, which on paper would seem to take the film’s emotional impact up a notch or two. But they are dealt with insouciantly, even flippantly – far more so than in something like Star Wars or Superman. That’s in keeping of course, with the distinctive comic flavour of this franchise, but the revelations about Quill’s background just zing and ping around with the same pinball-velocity as everything else in the film. It’s fun, though GOTG2 doesn’t have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had. They’re still guarding, although the galaxy never seems in much danger.","output":"Peter Bradshaw's 2017 review of \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2\\" is a mixed review between positives and negatives. Although he writes positively of several things including: the soundtrack, the movie's sense of humor and its overall \\"quirky\\"-ness; he fails to find a deeper meaning in the story as a whole calling it \\"pinballing pointlessness\\". While Bradshaw specifically calls out certain artists for their humorous (as in the case of Dave Bautista as Drax) or \\"amusingly\\" haughty (Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha) roles he is not a fan of Kurt Russell's character Ego who he calls \\"unsettling\\". Ultimately, although Bradshaw seems to enjoy many parts of the story and references specific music from the movie (\\"Brandy\\" by Looking Glass) and amusing scenarios between characters, he ultimately does not like the \\"pinball\\" back and forth of the background story of the main character Quill, and did not feel like the movie, although an action movie, showed that the galaxy the Guardians were supposed to be \\"guarding\\" seemed to be in much \\"danger\\"."},{"instruction":"Help me write up an email to my coworker, Sheryl, informing them that I'd love their help planning a surprise birthday party for our boss, Mr. Jonathan.

But then there was this sound of the tall human carrying something big, and when the door opened, I heard a strange scratching sound move all across the floor. The smell made my fur stand up. It was a dog! We had a dog in the house. When the humans came into the living room, the smell of dog filled the air. I was relieved to see it was a small dog so I made sure to arch my back as much as I could to show this dog just how tall I can be. I also let out a loud hiss so he knew what he was getting himself into. But this dog didn't care. He came straight to me and licked me. He had the nerve to lick me! But I was ready. I don't keep my claws sharpened for no reason, so I extended my paw and thwacked his face to show him who the boss is in this house. The dog bounced back playfully and licked me again!

The code above that you provided is about a method called \\"smallerNumbersThanCurrent\\" Here's how the Java function works from beginning to end. 1. Starting with the first line, the code first creates an integer array named 'a' that is instantiated to the size of the input array 'nums'. Basically, it is creating a new array that will be the same size as the array that gets passed in as a parameter 'nums'. 2. The function then goes into a for loop that iterates through each entry in the input array, starting with the entry at position 0. 3. A count variable is then instantiated with the data type of integer, this variable ends up being used to count how many numbers are less than the current number that the variable 'i' is at in the loop. 4. A nested loop is created that compares which value is greater at various positions. For example, if nums[i] is greater than nums[j] then it would increment the count and add the current value of the count to the newly created array 'a' at position 'i' after the counter 'j' has reached the end of the array. 5. Finally, after iterating through all potential combinations and comparisons, the function returns an integer array 'a'.

Refine marketing strategy. First, you must set clear goals and expectations, define your target audience, research the competition, and focus on what makes you stand out. By doing this, you give yourself clear metrics to be measured by. A goal allows you to track progress and identify when more work may be needed. Knowing your target audience makes it easier to produce content. Researching your competition can both inspire you and better you. Focusing on what stands out from the crowd will enable you to create engaging content. 2. Create valuable content. If your content doesn't give your readers any value, the likelihood of them engaging with you or continuing to follow you is slim. Your audience sees a whole load of content daily that is useless for them or simply too like other content. Create valuable content to stand out and grow a following that knows you constantly have them in mind. This will help to solidify your audience. 3. Engage with your followers. Tweets providing value are great, but the one thing we value most is human connection. Engage and connect with followers through DM or in replies. This will help foster a genuine connection with your audience and show them that you care and are responsive to them. This is extremely important, considering how many people are online. If you create that bond with people, they can be more forgiving when you make mistakes and more supportive when needed. 4. Use trending hashtags. Hashtags are an incredible way to grow the visibility of your tweets. Try to see what is currently trending and produce content that hops on that bandwagon. The more people that see your tweets, the better, and using a trending hashtag vastly improves the chances prospective new followers will see your tweets. Be careful not to use too many hashtags, as this can be seen as spam. 5. Reuse and Repurpose. Coming up with new content all the time can be pretty tough. There is no harm in reusing or repurposing old content. In many cases, the point will remain valuable if it's valuable content. Simply saying the same thing differently or highlighting a new use case for information is an excellent way to churn out lots of content over time. Obviously, it's not good to copy and paste your old tweets. Try improving them with better wording so your content constantly improves."},{"instruction":"I've seen Java constructors written in two different ways. For example: public Car(String name) { this.name = name; } and public Car(String newName) { name = newName; } The first way uses \\"this.\\" and the second does not. What is the difference between them and which one is better?","output":"Both ways of writing a constructor accomplish the same task. The difference is the first constructor allows you to use an argument with the same name as the variable. The \\"this.\\" modifier allows you to reference the variable in the current object. Without this modifier, Java will not understand which variable you are referring to if they have the same name. Thus, you would have to change the argument name, which you can observe in the second constructor you listed. Regarding whether one approach is best practice, this is a matter of preference and coding conventions for a project or team. The use of the \\"this\\" keyword can help increase the readability of code, especially if there are multiple variables with similar names, to help distinguish between local variables, instance variables, and static variables. However, the unnecessary use of the keyword can make code unnecessarily verbose and can encourage the creation of large classes that can be difficult to interpret. Some teams or projects may encourage the use of the keyword, while others may prohibit its use except when necessary for disambiguation."},{"instruction":"Write an updated version of The Boy Who Cried Wolf.

One night, the couple sat on the mountaintop and watched the stars twinkling and glowing in the sky. As they did so, they caught a glimpse of a shooting star coming from their left and streaking right in a parabolic arc across the night sky. As the star completed its course, the man and woman looked at each other and said the same thing: \\"Did you make a wish?\\" When they both said this to each other, they smiled and laughed in a seemingly knowing way. They did make a wish, one that they had hoped would come true since they first began their nighttime tradition. They decided to leave the mountain to prepare more thoroughly for tomorrow night's event. The next night, the couple went up to the mountaintop, but this time they brought backpacks with them. In the backpacks were necessities like a change of clothing, toiletries, and some snacks and water. They took their seat on the mountaintop and began watching the stars. They watched intently for several hours as they appeared to be waiting for something. And then, just before midnight, they saw what they were looking for: a shooting star coming from their left and streaking right in a parabolic arc across the night sky. The couple decided it was time, so they lay on the ground, holding hands, and closed their eyes. In a great big flash of light, the couple disappeared, their bodies vaporized by the ethereal light that shone from the shooting star. The couple had made it onto their spaceship, which was disguised as the shooting star. They were now able to travel the universe forever."},{"instruction":"Extract the names of the professional boxers and MMA fighters found in the text into two separate lettered lists.

The audience for this article is beginner-level skiers.","output":"Learning how to ski can be challenging as many of the motions can feel unnatural for those who haven't done it before. Although it's tempting to try and rip down the slopes at high speeds right away, it is not a smart or safe idea. Going fast is not the hard part of skiing. The hard part is controlling your speed and being able to stop. Even in the case of experienced skiers, rarely will you see someone ski straight down the mountain at high speed. Instead, good skiers focus on using their edges to make turns and control their speed. As such, first-time skiers should also aim to first build skills for using their edges, making both wide and short turns, and stopping. The first things that new skiers should practice are controlling their speed and learning to stop completely. While watching experienced skiers can be helpful in giving you an idea of where you want to eventually progress, it is important that you don't try to copy what they do. Instead, you should focus on first practicing the pizza stop. In order to generate speed, you want to keep your skis parallel to one another in a straight line. In order to stop, you want to point the front tips of your skis in towards one another, making your skis resemble a slice of pizza. This allows the edges of your skis to dig in, create friction, and slow you down."},{"instruction":"Help me write the copy for a poster advertising the sequel to a horror movie marketed to chickens.

Diamond painting: Diamond painting kits are similar in concept to paint-by-numbers, but instead of paint, the user attaches colored plastic gems to the canvas in order to complete the picture. Each color of diamond corresponds to a number on the canvas. 5. Quilling: Quilling involves shaping strips of paper to form patterns or pictures. The strips are rolled, curved, or bent and then attached to a flat surface to form the lines of a two-dimensional image. Different colors of paper and an endless variety of possible patterns can be used to create these works of art. 6.

Can you give me some insight into how to become more approachable?","output":"I can help you with that. Here are some simple ways to allow yourself to become more approachable. 1. Smile - a simple, friendly facial expression comes off as inviting to people. You want to make sure the smile seems natural and warm when you are at the office or at a work event. Upon making eye contact with someone, it's good to acknowledge them by smiling a bit bigger. 2. Eye contact - you want to make sure to maintain eye contact when you greet someone and while having conversations. For example, if you are at an event or conference, you want to make eye contact and smile at any strangers that look in your direction. If you get the feeling that you are staring when making eye contact, you can blink occasionally or simply focus on the area in between the person's eyes. 3. Angle towards people - it's good practice when talking to someone to angle your body towards them to show that you are interested in the conversation. You want to focus on turning your feet and legs towards that person and allow your body to follow. This is good to do either sitting or standing. However, if you are sitting, you might also want to lean in slightly as it will show that you are listening and engaged in the conversation. 4. Look up - it's good to keep your head and eyes up when you're walking around the office or at events. This is because when you are looking up and ahead it is easier to make eye contact with others and greet them. It's important to note that people read your face to determine your approachability. Staring at the floor or your feet will cause the person to not be able to assess your interest. 5. Avoid fidgeting - having nervous habits can give the impression that you are anxious. You want to avoid fidgeting with things like your keys, pen, or hair or simply doing something you might not be aware of, such as cracking your knuckles or touching your face. You'll want to focus on keeping your hands at your sides or in your lap or just using them to gesture rather than fidgeting during conversations."},{"instruction":"Create a comma list of each line's last word.

The uuencode format that the library was built to handle was made for emails in the 1980s, and the encoding no longer applies to many modern email formats or other files. It has been replaced by MIME and yEnc, and attempting to use it with those file formats may cause errors or data loss. Despite that, you aren���t stuck! There is a workaround and an alternative modern library that you can use in its place: 1. Open the file directly, using \`ab\`, \`rb\`, or \`wb\` mode if you are on a Windows device to open in binary format to append, read, or write, respectively. The code for that might look like this: \`f = open(���file.txt���, ���rb���)\`. 2. Use the \`base64\` library. It has similar encoding and decoding capabilities that can handle ASCII characters and binary, allowing similar functionality to the \`uu\` library without the concerns of failure due to the use of outdated formatting.

Dogs residing in areas with high populations of mosquitos, which carry infectious heartworm larvae to new hosts, are at risk of infection from heartworms. Heartworm infection presents with various symptoms, including a mild yet persistent cough, weight loss, fatigue, decreased appetite, and exercise reluctance. As the infection progresses, dogs may develop swollen bellies due to excessive fluid and heart failure. The best way to prevent dogs from heartworm infection and disease is to test them regularly at a veterinarian and provide them with monthly heartworm prevention."},{"instruction":"Here's the title of a product.

It should feature some of his regular haunts as well as a conflict between our protagonist and some alley cats.","output":"Marco yawned awake and stretched. It was a little earlier than he was used to getting up, but that was ok. He was patient. Carefully, he made his way out of the alley, avoiding broken bottles and sharp cans as he went. There were a few people on the streets today, but not too many this early. Most were already at work or were starting their shift later. Marco went to his first stop: the butcher shop. Every morning, Jenkins would throw out some scraps for him. It was lucky he'd chosen that particular back door one rainy night in August. Jenkins had seen him and taken pity on him by throwing a few scraps. The rest was history. After his morning meal of liver and fish guts, Marco sauntered around his usual haunts. He preferred to sit in the entrance to the alley; people were a little too friendly, even with an alley cat that undoubtedly had fleas. He would rummage through the trash cans or snag scraps from the dumpsters. Occasionally, he would get lucky and find some fresh food that someone had left behind. Frequenting the restaurants was always a good idea, especially if the servers were a little slow to clean up the leftovers. Of course, Marco wasn't lazy. He would nab a rat, mouse, or other small rodent from time to time if the opportunity presented itself. Anything to survive. After a long day of hunting, he returned home and began to clean. His sharp ears picked up a noise, and in the dark of the alley, he saw a pair of glowing eyes. \\"This is our turf now. Get lost,\\" a voice growled. Although the cat had told him to leave, they seemed to want to instill the lesson with a few scratches. Marco dashed past one of them toward the entrance. He knew every inch of this alley even without the visual cues, so it didn't surprise him when one of the cats in pursuit stepped on a broken glass bottle and began to wail. The noise stopped the others, and Marco made a quick escape. He would have to move home, but such was the life of a city cat."},{"instruction":"What does self-storage mean?","output":"Self-storage is a service offered to assist people who are temporarily storing their personal belongings in a designated unit for later use."},{"instruction":"What are the different types of storage units?","output":"At most facilities, there will be different size units which can range from 5x5 and 5x10 up to 10 x 10, 10 x 15, 10 x 30 and 20 x 20, which is the size of an average two-car garage."},{"instruction":"How much do storage units typically cost?","output":"The cost to rent a self-storage unit will vary from one location to the next, and the size of the unit.

These sharks can reach over 1,000 pounds to insulate themselves for warmth. • Elephant Seals. These seals can reach weights of 3,000 to 9,000 pounds, depending on their environment. The warmth of accumulated blubber protects them from cold climates, while their plush bodies protect them from the aggressive nature of other elephant seals. • African Elephants. These elephants are the largest land animals in the world. They can grow up to 16,500 pounds, which comes in handy for protecting their young from predators in the wild. • Blue Whales. These whales are the biggest known animals in existence. Their typical weights hover around 330,000 pounds, but there have been record cases of blue whales that reached 380,000 pounds. • Hippopotamus. Hippos are massive and aggressive by nature.

After this, it's steamed, boiled, or baked to give it a meaty texture. Seitan is widely used in vegan deli meats and chicken substitutes. 2. Green Spelt - Another wheat-based substitute, green spelt is spelt grain that's harvested while it's partially ripe. It's then roasted and dried, giving it a strong flavor. Green spelt is easy to digest and contains lots of B vitamins, phosphorus, and magnesium, and is used often in vegan meatballs, among other products. 3. Oat Flakes - Rich in zinc and iron, they're relatively cheap and available at virtually any supermarket. Oat flakes are made into a dough, fried, and added to vegetable broth, fat, carrots or zucchini, and other proteins. They're also a great source of complex carbohydrates, giving you more of that \\"full\\" feeling after a meal. 4. Black Beans - Black beans are commonly used for vegan burger patties, providing a tasty and nutritious alternative to restaurants and store-bought patties. They're rich in protein and fiber and the skins contain powerful antioxidants. 5. Chickpeas - Chickpeas are widely used as an alternative to chicken and turkey. They're incredibly protein dense and contain significant amounts of iron, calcium, and fiber.

Please number each of the benefits and provide a short paragraph explanation for each. Thank you!","output":"1 - Enjoy Higher Quality Sleep Regular sauna use in the late evening can result in higher-quality sleep. Your body temperature will rise during the use of the sauna but then fall before you go into bed. This will result in a slow decline in the number of endorphins that are released into your body, which will help act as a sedative to facilitate easier and better sleep. 2 - Burn Additional Calories Saunas are a practical tool to help you burn calories because the process of sweating requires a significant amount of energy. Specifically, as your body temperature increases and your heart rate begins to increase with it, the body will require more oxygen. It will then convert more calories into energy. While saunas are not the definitive weight loss tool as some people claim, it is undeniably effective at helping one burn additional calories. 3 - Muscle Recovery Step into a sauna after your next workout. The heat from the sauna will relax your muscles and help soothe any aches in your joints and muscles you have from the workout as well. When your body is exposed to the heat produced by the sauna, your body will release endorphins that will help to keep pain to a minimum. Your blood vessels will also dilate, allowing for increased blood circulation, which helps to quicken your body's healing process. 4 - Reduce The Risk of Getting The Common Cold Sauna medical research from Germany has shown that regular sauna use amongst its participants greatly reduced their overall incidences of catching common colds and the flu. The explanation for this is that the body will produce more white blood cells when it is exposed to the heat from a sauna. These white blood cells are effective at killing viruses to stop the onset of illnesses. 5 - Social Benefits While a sauna can be a relaxing area of solitude for yourself, it can also be an equally relaxing area in the company of others. Saunas are an opportune environment to engage in open and yet quiet socializing with friends, family, and people who may soon become your new friends."},{"instruction":"I'm curious at to what movies Audrey Hepburn made in the 1970's?","output":"Audrey Hepburn only appeared in two movies during the 1970s: • Robin and Marian (1976) - Sean Connery is Robin Hood to Audrey Hepburn's Maid Marian in this tale about the legendary characters in their middle-aged years. • Bloodline (1979) - Heiress to a pharmaceutical company whose wealth is measured in the billions, Elizabeth Roffe (Audrey Hepburn) is soon targeted for murder just as her late father was."},{"instruction":"But journalists’ most stubborn instinct—the one they share with Holmes—is to lean into a good story.

The fields were bleak and empty. They had nothing to restore but rather they wished to build something new from the rubble and weeds that choked the land. One day a cow gave Bosch the spark of brilliance he needed. He knew why some patches had more greenery than others. He told Haber who immediately scribbled plans for their contraptions. They reverently dug into the sand to blow their own glasswork. Their labor of love needed no store-bought products. They would find a way. Finally, in 1914, they synthesized ammonia using their unique method which kickstarted the age of mineral fertilizers. In their legacy, the BASF company they left behind found ways to protect the new field they made. New scientists derived anti-fungal applications to prevent mushrooms from plowing through the ground. They found ways to fight weeds and even defend against the ravenous insects that swarmed the treeline. Their efforts blossomed into a field of red tulips: Carl's mother's name and Fritz's favorite color.

Having a baby is always a leap of faith, and it’s impossible to prepare perfectly beforehand. You’ll always be taken by surprise, and the key is to grow with the experience. The only thing you can really do to get ready is to prepare your heart, mind, and life to be open to the unexpected, and to make sure that you have a good support network around you, if at all possible. Looking back, I can see now that even my super broody friends weren’t more prepared than me for the reality of parenthood. Having children is a truly humbling experience, and you have to embrace the fact that you’ll be a beginner and feel totally out of your depth a lot of the time. Trying to figure out what it will be like beforehand is like trying to visualize what marriage will be like before you meet and fall in love with your spouse: your children will be unique human beings with whom you will have beautiful, complicated, and ever-changing relationships. Before having children, my biggest fear was really of the unknown; becoming a mother has helped open me up to the unknown and expanded my heart and mind in ways I never thought were possible.","output":"Though many people look for the definitive time to have a baby, there ultimately isn't one.

As a branch of mathematics that allows us to study continuous change, Calculus is more than just calculations. Some of the common applications of calculus include: 1. The predictions of weather and climate-related changes by scientists are made more accurate through calculus. These scientists consider factors such as wind speed, moisture level, temperature, and pressure. While there are many sensors used in weather forecasting today, equations still form the base of forecasting. 2. Building construction requires differential and integral calculus to correctly measure variables like weight, area, height, and material density. Civil engineers and architects use these skills every day in their professions. 3. Calculus-based equations allow mobile robots to do the things they do! This branch of mathematics can be used to coordinate the variables required for movement, such as distance, acceleration, and velocity. 4. Biologists rely on calculus equations to accurately predict the growth rate of bacteria and other microbes. Other similar applications are in the realm of patient diagnosis; calculating cardiac output, blood pressure, and cell and tumor growth are all possible through Calculus."},{"instruction":"Write a casual email to a former client of mine, Will, letting them know that my graphic design services are still available.

Several companies (and joint ventures) entered the competition. Ultimately, the Boeing-Saab team was selected as the winner in 2018.

The T-7 has a relatively conventional configuration, with swept wings and two tailfins framing a single General Electric F404-GE-103 afterburning turbofan engine. Though a single engine sounds like a downgrade from the current T-38 Talon's two engines, this F404 actually produces three times as much thrust as both of the T-38's combined. The Red Hawk will carry two pilots (typically a student and an instructor). Since it’s intended to train pilots on advanced 4th- and 5th-generation fighters, it will simulate many of their systems such as radar, data links, defensive capabilities, etc., even though the T-7 doesn’t carry those systems itself.

Ice, Ice, Baby Wild Emperor penguins are only found in Antarctica. They breed and raise their young mostly on ‘fast ice’, a floating platform of frozen ocean which is connected to the land or to ice shelves. From birth, they spend their entire lives in and around the Antarctic ice, although very rarely vagrants have turned up off the coast of New Zealand. 2. Giants of the Penguin World Emperors are the biggest of the 18 species of penguin found today, and one of the largest of all birds. They are approximately 120cm tall (about the height of a six year old child) and weigh in at around 40 kg, though their weight does fluctuate dramatically throughout the year. But they would be dwarfed by the ancient ‘mega-penguins’. Fossils recovered from the Antarctic Peninsula reveal that a colossus species of penguin which lived about 37 million years ago may have stood 2m tall and weighed as much as 115 kg. 3. How many penguins? There are approximately 595,000 adult Emperor penguins in Antarctica. But due to a lack of research, there is still so much we don't know about these magnificent polar creatures. That's why we're funding research in the Antarctic, because the more we know, the better we can protect them. This will encourage the formation of Marine Protected Areas and will help in protecting the species in the face of climate change. Emperor penguin colonies have been discovered and counted from space. A survey led by British scientists in 2012 used satellite technology to identify emperor colonies from the poo stains left on the ice at breeding sites. They discovered a number of previously unvisited colonies and counted every individual penguin. In there are now thought to be around 54 Emperor colonies in the Antarctic. About half of these have been discovered by satellite survey and most of these remain unvisited. 5. Penguin Love Emperors incubate their eggs during the long dark southern winter months. Courtship displays are intricate but copulation is quick and the female lays a single egg in May or June. She then passes it over to her mate to incubate - and she’s off. She spends the next nine weeks at sea, feeding. The male carefully balances the egg on his feet for between 65 – 75 days to keep it warm in a specially adapted brood pouch, and off the snow surface, before it hatches. Then out pops a fluffy chick. 6. ‘Baby, its cold outside’ Emperors are uniquely adapted to survive these harsh conditions when temperatures can drop down to a bone chilling -50°C and with winds of up to 200km/hr. They have two layers of feathers, a good reserve of fat and proportionally smaller beaks and flippers than other penguins to prevent heat loss. Emperors also have feathers on their legs, so their ankles don’t get too chilly. Even their feet are adapted to the icy conditions, containing special fats that prevent them from freezing and strong claws for gripping the ice. But most remarkably, colonies of adults and chicks work together to huddle for warmth. 5,000 or more tightly packed adults and chicks shuffle around, so each takes a turn - but not too long - on the outside of the huddle where it’s cold. This is in complete contrast to their quarrelsome and territorial neighbours, the Adélie penguins. 7. Dive, Dive Dive! Emperor penguins are the Olympic divers of the bird world. The deepest recorded dive was 564 m – that’s the equivalent of nearly 2 x the height of the Shard, Europe’s tallest building. And the longest recorded dive was nearly 28 minutes. That’s incredible! 8. Fish suppers Emperors feed mostly on Antarctic silverfish as well as other species of fish, krill (like Will & Bill from Happy Feet) and some squid. An adult penguin eats about 2-3 kg per day, but on a good day they can eat twice this much to build up their store of body fat for the long winter, or for feeding their chicks.","output":"Here's a quiz generated from penguin facts you shared: QUESTION 1: How many continents do wild Emperor penguins reside on?

Finding the right place to set up camp is essential: You want to avoid setting up your tent on a slant, and finding a flat space also helps with drainage. Make sure the area where you want to put your tent is clear of debris, roots, branches, and rocks. Also, review your surroundings, and make sure the trees around where you'll be setting up are alive and not at risk of falling while you're staying in the area. 2. Allocate a spot for your garbage and remain close to water sources: Designate a spot 20 feet from your campsite and away from any wildlife where you can store your disposables. Additionally, it is best to try and find a spot close to the bathroom. If your campsite has a water pump, make sure it is easily accessible, but if you're backcountry camping, stay close to natural water sources like streams and rivers. Remember, if you are using natural resources, be prepared and pack items that will make the water potable, like chlorine tablets and a water purifier. 3. Maximize the efficiency of the tent: Ensure you have ample space for the number of campers you will have joining you. It is helpful to bring a small tent just for supplies so that you do not have to bring everything you need into your tent and crowd that space. Waterproof your tents by bringing a tarp and staking it to the ground to keep it in place. 4. Keep your food and kitchen space contained: To reduce the risk of wildlife coming to your campsite, be sure to either keep your food in a car if you have one or in a bag hung away from your campsite. When you're cooking, try to position yourself downwind so as not to attract any animals nearby. 5. Practice building a campfire: This is a hotly contested debate amongst avid campers, but luckily there are many ways to build a fire. You should certainly keep wind directly and protection in mind. Try to clear the brush and other debris from the fire pit area. For fire safety, it is helpful to bring a bucket of water and a shovel nearby in case the flames get too big. All items used in the fire should be dry and dead, such as dry leaves, grass, and needles for tinder."},{"instruction":"What was the number one album released in 1995?","output":"The number one album released in 1995 was Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette, which sold 33,000,000 copies."},{"instruction":"What was the exact release date for Jagged Little Pill?","output":"June 13, 1995"},{"instruction":"Did the album win a Grammy?","output":"The Jagged Little Pill album won five Grammys including Album of the Year, making 21-year-old Morissette the youngest artist to win the top honor up to that point."},{"instruction":"My debit card was involved in a data breach, and I lost 3,000. The bank says I'll get it back, but they don't know how long it'll take. What are some things I can do to better protect myself in the future?","output":"I'm sorry to hear this! Suspicious charges can be frustrating. Here are some recommendations for how to best protect your funds: 1) Stick to large, reputable banks and institutions. Although there is some data that suggests large banks are more likely to be targets of cyberattacks, they are also more prepared to handle them. Small, hometown banks often have less rigorous security standards and a smaller amount of available cash flow, meaning that they cannot immediately refund your funds and must wait until the dispute has settled. 2) Complete all purchases on a credit card, rather than a debit card. Although this seems counter-intuitive, as credit cards incur interest, they are also much safer. When disputing a credit card charge, you do not have to pay the funds until the dispute is settled. It's much easier to stop a charge than it is to recover funds once they have departed your account. Furthermore, interest is only paid on credit card charges that carry over to the next month or interest period, and some might even offer perks like cash back on purchases or point accrual towards future discounts or interest rates. 3) Use a verified transaction company, such as Paypal, when completing online purchases. Paypal has buyer protection and can handle disputes efficiently. Smaller sites with their own payment processors might not be as safe and verified as they assert themselves to be, nor will they be as conveniently reachable in the event of a dispute. 4) Refrain from linking your bank account, debit card, or credit card to any services. Saving your information in their system creates a database that can be breached at any point in the future if your password is discovered or the company suffers a cyberattack. Typing your information each time makes this less likely, although not impossible. 5) Change your passwords frequently and don't save them on websites or in your browser. Using strong passwords and changing them frequently significantly reduces the likelihood they will be involved in a company's data breach. You may not be immediately notified of a compromised password, so don't reuse them. 6) Diversify your accounts. As the saying goes, \\"don't keep all of your eggs in one basket.\\" Your checking account should be used for flowing cash, while your savings account should hold any lump sums that you may need access to in emergencies. Beyond your emergency fund, you can store cash in certificates of deposits (CDs) or investments that earn interest. 7) Stay aware of your account and purchases. Turn on purchase alerts if your bank offers them. Balance your checkbook and review your account frequently to notice any strange charges. The earlier these charges are caught, the easier they are resolved. I hope these suggestions help better protect your funds in the future!"},{"instruction":"Write a relatable acrostic poem about coffee.","output":"Caffeinated to new levels in order to work daily, Options are endless at the coffee bar too, First, there’s a latte or a plain old hot coffee, Frappes for the sugar fiend with extra ice, Everyone has their preferences, but, Everyone needs coffee!"},{"instruction":"What is a metaphor and give me 3 examples.

Have you ever felt like your fears were holding you back from your full potential? Have you ever experienced imposter syndrome that prevents you from showing up as the best version of yourself in a situation? If so, rest assured, you are not alone. We all struggle with some degree of self-doubt and fear of failure. It's particularly common among ambitious high-achievers, who, by definition, are constantly putting themselves in situations that are on the edge of their current competency level. It can crop up in a variety of contexts—backstage before a big speech or performance, at the gym as you try to build a new exercise habit, or at home as you transition from work to home mode for your family. It can be crippling. While there are a variety of techniques for managing these feelings to rise up and own the moment, in today's piece, I want to share the single approach that has made a difference in my life: Character Invention. Main Character Energy By the late 2000s, Beyoncé was already a global superstar. Few were aware that she had struggled with nerves and anxiety throughout her career, dating back to her days performing as a child. In 2008, to combat these struggles, she created Sasha Fierce, an alter ego stage persona that embodied the fearless, brave characteristics that she would need to perform at her best in front of millions. Image Credit: Matt Schnuck​ Beyoncé had engaged in a textbook example of Character Invention, a technique grounded in drama therapy and Neuro-Linguistic Programming in which the user creates a character that can show up and perform in the situations that induce fear or self-doubt. Kobe Bryant famously created the \\"Black Mamba\\" alter ego in a similar vein, a character that was relentless and fiercely competitive who would show up in big moments on the court. They're not alone in using the technique: countless top performers across a range of fields have used Character Invention to rise to the occasion. Not just pop-stars, celebrities, and athletes, either—many of the world's top executive coaches teach it to their clients. The general strategy: Create a character in your mind who can show up in the way you want to and teach yourself to \\"flip the switch\\" to become this character when necessary. Creating Your Own Characters You may not have to perform in front of millions on a regular basis, but Character Invention can still be an incredible tool to show up as the best version of you across a variety of situations. As an example, here are a few situations you may encounter during a typical day: You wake up in the morning and need to get ready for your day. This may involve getting your family out the door for their respective activities, getting yourself dressed and ready, and handling any household chores. You go to the gym before work to get some exercise in before the day inevitably becomes chaotic. You go to work and have a few big projects to present to your managers and team. You get home after work and want to unwind with your family. You want to turn off work mode and be the present parent, partner, or friend that you know you should be. In each situation, there are different versions of you that must \\"turn on\\" in order to perform at your best. For some, it can be very difficult to navigate all of the context switching within the confines of your persona, especially as your energy is getting depleted throughout the day. Character Invention can help. Envision the character that you would like to embody in this situation: What traits do they possess? How do they interact with their surroundings? How do they physically appear to others? What is their mentality? The next time you enter that situation, \\"turn on\\" your character and take on the moment with new energy. Who Are Your Characters? Character Invention has been a wonderful addition to my life. If you've ever struggled with fear, insecurity, or imposter syndrome in your day-to-day life, I'd encourage you to give it a shot.

I'm not even sure what the official name of this forest is except that it is somewhere in the Nuuanu(?) Valley. I think I should sit down, take a rest, and document what has gone on since I first entered this forest in case I am not found in time for authorities to rescue me. Yesterday at noon, I came into this forest from a road that was about 100 feet above the valley. The path into the valley led from the parking lot where I parked my car (a rental vehicle, license plate HHH123 red Chevy Camaro convertible). I walked on the path for about five hours before I decided to stop and have a drink of water and a bite to eat. I don't remember exactly how the path went; it could have been going straight or it could have curved a bit, so I didn't know which direction to head back. I figured I would just walk back in a straight line the way I came in, hoping to reach the parking lot or the main road. However, as I walked for several hours, I started to panic when I couldn't hear the vehicular traffic coming from the road anymore. I can only vaguely remember hearing it when I was walking at the beginning of the path, but now I was sure I couldn't hear anything except grasshoppers and coqui frogs, and it was getting dark. I decided to stay in one place, making a camp in case I needed to wait until the next day and building a fire. I stayed over the night and woke up the next morning and decided to chronicle what has happened so far. Now, I intend to continue walking the way I came (I think?), hoping that I will come out to the road. If I am heading the wrong way, I'm sure I will come out the other end of the forest. I have to stay calm, have hope, and remember that this is an island, so I'm bound to reach the end of this forest and the beginning of the shoreline at some point.

He played for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1982 until 1996."},{"instruction":"Explain this same concept, but do so in a way that a 5th grader can understand. Melissa Murray: Let’s start with the elephant in the room: the mifepristone rulings. A judge in the Amarillo division of the northern district of Texas has issued a decision that stays the FDA’s approval of mifepristone. Another competing ruling in the western district of Washington requires the FDA to continue making mifepristone available to those in a number of blue states which have filed a challenge of their own to maintain mifepristone access. We have governors in states like California and Massachusetts stockpiling both mifepristone and misoprostol. Is it chaotic by design? Jessica Valenti: Yes. The point is to sow so much uncertainty that even in places where abortion is legal, people don’t know if they can get the care they are legally entitled to. Doctors will be afraid. Pharmacists will be afraid. And because this is all changing so quickly, that feeds into that chaos too. Melissa Murray: In June 2022, the Supreme Court issued its much-anticipated decision in Dobbs, which upheld by a 6-3 vote a Mississippi law that banned abortion at just 15 weeks—and by a 5-4 vote, overruled both Casey and Roe. The Court insisted that its decision did no more than return the fraught and vexed question of abortion to the democratic process and to the people, who were rightfully the ones to decide this question. So, is Judge Kacsmaryk “the people”? Jessica Valenti: We always knew that it was never about state’s rights. It was always about banning abortion in every single state in every possible way. What has been really frustrating to me in Kacsmaryk’s ruling is this idea that they’re doing something for women’s health, that they’re protecting us. It just adds salt to the wound. It makes me a little more furious than usual because it’s so offensive, so insulting and so obviously false. Melissa Murray: What Jessica is referring to is the plaintiff, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, arguing that mifepristone is unsafe for women despite the FDA’s approval that has been in place for over 20 years. What is this about? Is this a backlash to women’s progress? Is this an effort to put us back into a particular box? I mean the women’s rights movement has been in place since the 1970s. Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped to read women into the Equal Protection Clause. Abortion rights is only part of that. Again, this is the question this symposium asks: Is there more to come, and how will we as women fit into a society that purports to be democratic without necessarily taking into account the voices of women? Jessica Valenti: I think so much of this is about punishment. I don’t think it is a coincidence that they went after abortion medication specifically. Abortion medication completely changed the way that people were able to get abortion care. You can have an abortion in your home while watching Netflix privately. We took away their ability to publicly shame us at clinics, and that made them angry. They don’t want abortion to be easy and safe and that is part of the big hypocrisy. Melissa Murray: Punishing women but for what? What are we doing? Jessica Valenti: Existing. Having our own lives and making our own decisions. And I think with abortion specifically that is very much you controlling your body, the trajectory of your life and of your family.","output":"Melissa Murray and Jessica Valenti are talking about some recent decisions and changes regarding a medicine called mifepristone and the availability of abortion. They mention different rulings from judges in different parts of the country, which are causing confusion and uncertainty about whether people can get the care they need. This is making doctors and pharmacists worried too. They also mention a decision by the Supreme Court in 2022 that allowed a law in Mississippi to ban abortion after just 15 weeks and overruled previous decisions protecting abortion rights. The Court said it was giving the power back to the people to decide. However, Jessica believes that the real goal has always been to ban abortion in every state. They discuss a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine that argues mifepristone is unsafe for women, even though it has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for a long time. They question if this is a backlash against women's progress and an attempt to control and limit our choices. Jessica believes that a big part of this is about punishing women for simply existing and making their own decisions. Abortion medication has made it easier and more private for women to have abortions, and some people don't want that. They want to make it difficult and unsafe, which is unfair and hypocritical. Overall, they raise important questions about how women's voices and rights are being considered in our society, and how we can navigate a democratic society that may not always prioritize women's perspectives."},{"instruction":"Who was the first President of the United States?","output":"George Washington was the first President.

Zauner voices it herself and you can hear the emotion in her retelling so well, and it's a huge bonus to hear the Korean pronunciation if you're not Korean yourself. Overall I thought this book was very real, and showed all of the lovely parts of her relationship with her mother and the pain alongside it. I loved the food motif throughout the book and think many people will find it relatable. I love Korean food, but for a few people this was their first introduction to the cuisine and culture, and it got them to try Korean food for the first time. This book will probably make you cry!! The only critique I had of it was I thought it was a little too unstructured. I listened to it with my partner and they found the first opening chapters hard to get into since Zauner starts off with a very wide view of her story/relationship with her mother/her feelings. Once she gets into the chronological-ish parts you get totally roped in. Don't expect a \\"satisfying\\" ending, because there is no \\"close\\" to her story. Her life is obviously ongoing and there are still feelings she's grappling with. It would be impossible to wrap up neatly!\\"","output":"This is a positive review.

The kid hops out, leaving the fish in the back seat. I'm heading to my parking spot wondering what kind of trouble this kid is getting himself into when all of a sudden, I hear a flopping noise. I turned around and saw that the fish had somehow jumped out of the bowl and was rolling on the floor of my cab. I start to panic, trying to keep control of the car and stay calm. Getting into an accident would just make everything worse. I pull into the closest parking spot and turn around to help the fish. The boy returns from the store, sees the commotion, and jumps back to rescue the fish. He picks it up and puts it back in the bowl but accidentally spills half the water all over the seats. I couldn't believe it, but all I could do was smile and hand the boy a towel to clean up the mess. Eventually, we took the fish to one of the pet stores, and the boy came out with a proper aquarium and all the supplies he needed to keep his new friend alive.

How they prepare Grant writers usually have a range of skills, a college degree, and other training or experience. Skills. Research and writing skills are essential for grant writers. Research helps writers find grant opportunities. Good writing expresses ideas clearly and succinctly, with creativity and persuasiveness helping a proposal stand out. Interpersonal skills are important, too, because grant writers interact with clients, colleagues, and donors to gather and relay information. Grant writers also need to be detail oriented and have multitasking and organizational skills. These skills allow them to juggle multiple grant applications and adhere to each grant’s guidelines and deadlines. Education and training. Grant writers, like other types of writers and authors, typically need a bachelor’s degree to qualify for entry-level jobs. Often, the field of study doesn’t matter, but helpful courses include marketing and English. Some colleges and universities offer programs specifically in grant writing. Classes and workshops are also available through community colleges and professional associations. But many grant writers learn from online resources, books, and on-the-job training. And years of practice help them develop the skills for writing successful grant proposals. “You learn by doing,” says Shelia. “And the more you do it, the better you’ll get. You also learn from your rejections.” Experience and more. Experience in a related occupation is generally not required for entry-level grant writing jobs, but it can be helpful to have. For example, many grant writers start out in another role in an organization before transitioning to grant writing. A background in communications, fundraising, or budgeting is valuable. Gaining experience isn’t limited to employment, however. Networking with other grant writers and doing some unpaid work may help you learn more about the occupation. “Talk to folks involved in the funding and application process,” says Shelia. “And volunteer with small organizations to learn how grant writing is done.” Experienced grant writers also might opt to earn certification, which demonstrates a level of proficiency and could improve their employment options. And, although success is not guaranteed, grant writers have a better chance of writing a good proposal if they’re passionate about the causes for which they seek funds. “If you feel it, then you can write it for others to feel as well,” Shelia says. “If you aren’t motivated for the cause, you can’t motivate anyone else.”","output":"bachelor's degree, online resources, books, other work experience, on-the-job training, unpaid work, classes and workshops, certifications"},{"instruction":"Hi, please give me five reasons why I should be an art major.

You can give your parents these five reasons: 1. We consume art every day. TV, music, movies, photography--art isn't just a picture hanging in a gallery, although that's valuable, too. Becoming an artist means contributing your creativity to the world. 2. No one has the same ideas that you do. Two people can paint the same still life, and their paintings will still be unique because they interpreted the source differently. It's important to share YOUR vision because nobody else can. 3. While it's true that not every artist signs a million-dollar contract in a month, not every artist works for pennies, either. Plenty of artists make a liveable income or at least supplement their paychecks. 4. The Internet has made it easier than ever for artists to find work. You can jump on Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok and potentially earn thousands of followers.

It got one star. You're an angry customer.","output":"Let me tell you about my recent trip to the moon, or should I say, the worst vacation ever! This so-called tourist destination definitely deserves a solid one star, and that's only because zero stars aren't an option. First off, the journey to the moon was a total nightmare. The spaceship looked like it was built by a bunch of amateurs. If you're gonna charge an arm and a leg for this experience, at least make sure your spacecraft doesn't rattle around and almost give you whiplash. And don't get me started on the seats—they were more uncomfortable than a rock. I thought my back was going to snap in half! Once we finally landed on the moon, you'd think things would get better, right? Wrong! The so-called \\"moon base\\" was nothing more than a flimsy tent. Seriously, it felt like I was camping in my own backyard, and at least I wouldn't have had to pay for that. The accommodations were beyond pathetic. I've seen better beds at a cheap motel, and the food? Well, let's just say I'd rather eat a frozen TV dinner. They promised all these cool moonwalks and sightseeing excursions, but guess what? They were canceled. So I paid a fortune to see some rocks up close. Oh, and did I mention the staff? They were the epitome of incompetence. I asked for a refund, and they just flat out said no and refused to explain. They couldn't care less about my dissatisfaction. It was like they were trained to ignore customer complaints. I've never felt so unimportant in my life. To sum it all up, this moon trip was a colossal waste of time, money, and dreams. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Save yourself the trouble and go on a nice tropical vacation instead. At least there you'll get a comfy bed, decent food, and maybe even a smile from the staff. Seriously, folks, avoid the moon like the plague. It's a total tourist trap."},{"instruction":"Categorize this dialogue excerpt from a play into one of the following genres: comedy, tragedy, drama, or farce.

Less than 24 hours after the rules known as Title 42 were lifted, migrants and government officials were still assessing the effect of the change and the new regulations adopted by President Joe Biden’s administration to stabilize the region. “We did not see any substantial increase in immigration this morning,” said Blas Nunez-Neto of the Department of Homeland Security. He said the agency did not have specific numbers because it was early in the day. Migrants along the border continued to wade into the Rio Grande to take their chances getting into the U.S. while defying officials shouting for them to turn back. Others hunched over cellphones trying to access the appointment app that is a centerpiece of the new measures. Migrants with appointments walked across a bridge hoping for a new life. And lawsuits sought to stop some of the measures. The Biden administration has said the new system is designed to crack down on illegal crossings and to offer a new legal pathway for migrants who pay thousands to smugglers to get them to the border. Migrants are now essentially barred from seeking asylum in the U.S. if they did not first apply online or seek protection in the countries they traveled through. Families allowed in as their immigration cases progress will face curfews and GPS monitoring. Across the river from El Paso in Ciudad Juárez, many migrants watched their cellphones in hopes of getting a coveted appointment to seek entry. The application to register to enter the U.S. had changed, and some were explaining to others how to use it. Nearby, other migrants were charging their phones on a lamppost to try to get an appointment. Most of them were resigned to wait. “I hope it’s a little better and that the appointments are streamlined a little more,” said Yeremy Depablos, 21, a Venezuelan traveling with seven cousins who have been waiting in the city for a month.","output":"● Joe Biden ● Blas Nunez-Neto ● Yeremy Depablos"},{"instruction":"Rewrite this email into something polite for me to send Walmart, The experience I had at your store today was awful!

Also provide specific tips on how to make the best grinder.","output":"1. Bread is king. Nothing turns a good sandwich bad faster than a bread type that doesn’t match what you’re trying to create. As a general rule of thumb, think of soft breads for soft spreads. The sturdier your sandwich filling, the firmer your bread can be. 2. Don’t limit yourself to one sauce. Mayo and mustard are great together. Mayo and anything, really. But consider dressing each side of the sandwich with different sauces. It changes the balance of the sandwich in a great way. 3. Consider the pickle. Sandwiches often have fatty, savory elements. A good pickle adds crunch and a bit to cut through all that fat. Pickles don’t have to be cucumbers, too. Think about pickled onions, peppers, or even giardiniera. 4. Let it rest. A good sandwich is like a complex chord. You want to give it a second to let those notes blend together. Your patience will be rewarded! Let’s dig deeper into the classic Italian grinder. This sandwich is best with a crusty seeded roll. Balance out the savory meats with a sharp cheese like cheddar or provolone, and don’t forget some pickled peppers. Dress it with Italian dressing (oil/vinegar) on one side, and either mayo or brown mustard on the other. Lettuce and good tomato help complete the puzzle."},{"instruction":"Hi so, I like frogs.

In the trade, St. Louis sent Arizona Luke Weaver, Carson Kelly, Andy Young, and draft compensation. The trade should provide the Cardinals with a much-needed slugger in the middle of their lineup. Goldschmidt has been an all-star in the 6 seasons leading up to the trade. Coming off another great season, the first baseman has been one of the league's most consistent hitters.

Scarf it Up: Stay cozy and stylish with a t-shirt scarf. Cut your shirt into strips (width depends on your preference), pull each strip to stretch it out, and tie the strips together end-to-end. Wrap and twist to your heart's content! 3. Tote-ally Awesome: Ditch the plastic and make a reusable shopping bag from your old tank tops. Cut off the sleeves and neckline, leaving the back intact. Put the bottom of the shirt in a knot and flip it inside out. Tote around your groceries (or anything else) in an eco-friendly style! 4. T-Shirt Blanket: Transform your old tees into a cozy and stylish blanket that's perfect for snuggling up on the couch. Cut the shirts into squares of equal size and lay them out in a pattern of your choosing. Keep the squares together at the corners using simple knots. Before you know it, you'll have a personalized quilt that's as warm as it is sentimental. 5. T-Shirt Headband: Give your hair accessories a unique twist by crafting a headband out of an old shirt. Cut a strip of fabric from the shirt (the thicker you want the headband to be, the wider your strip should be), and stretch it out until it curls on the edges. Keep the ends sticking up like bunny ears. 6. T-Shirt Ice/Heat Pack: Next time you're nursing an injury or feeling sore after a workout, skip the drugstore purchases and grab an old t-shirt instead. Cut out a square or rectangle from the shirt, fill it with ice cubes or heat in the microwave, then knot the edges together to create a makeshift cold or hot pack."},{"instruction":"Write a short story that doesn't really have a point.

Make your answer as close as possible to 200 words long and include two paragraphs total.","output":"No problem! Here's a persuasive description of an almond croissant: Made with a delicate, flaky pastry, almond croissants give off the strong buttery smell of fresh baked goods. These rich croissants are heavily ladened with butter, giving them a unique, flaky texture that crumbles away each time you take a bite. As they are baked and the layers of pastry begin to rise, the outside of the croissant begins to turn a rich, golden-brown color that resembles the hue of caramel. The slices of almond that are often added to the top of these croissants also become lightly roasted during the baking process, exaggerating their flavor and providing an added element of crunch. Even though they look and smell delicious, the true magic of almond croissants is what they conceal on the inside. Unbeknownst to many, these croissants that seem bland upon one's first impression actually contain a rich, sweet, and flavorful almond-based cream. Known as frangipane to those more acquainted with baking jargon, this delicious filling is sugary enough to satisfy the sweet tooth of consumers who typically prefer pain au chocolat. Although almond croissants can be overlooked and misunderstood, these delectable pastries make a great choice for pairing with your morning coffee or an afternoon cup of tea."},{"instruction":"What happened when JFK was shot?","output":"I remember it like it was yesterday.

Last week, shortly after a Wii review unit arrived at Forbes.com's office, I set it up in a conference room to test it out. A colleague and I booted up Wii Sports, a collection of simple sports games that comes bundled with every console. It wasn't long before we were completely immersed in Wii Tennis. The simple mini-game replicates an actual tennis match as well as any I've ever seen: Since you're actually swinging the remote like you would a racket, you can hit with varying force or apply spin to the ball, depending on how you move your body. Within minutes, we'd drawn a crowd, and only a short while after that, most of the editorial staff was packed into the conference room, laughing, enjoying the show and pushing for their turn at the remote. It was the first time since the original Nintendo Entertainment System came out in 1985 that videogaming felt like a party experience--not just because it was new, and worth gawking at, but because the experience is so much more physical, like Charades or Twister, and spectators can enjoy as much as the players. After the hard-core gamers got their turns, less videogame-savvy editors took a shot, too. And it was here where the intuitive motion control system really proved its worth. There's no sequence of arcane button combinations required to throw a baseball: You just wind up and mime an actual throw. Suddenly, videogames are fun for everyone--old or young, male or female, regardless of prior gaming experience. I lost count of how many times I heard non-gamers say, \\"Wow, I want to get this.\\" The other phrase I heard a lot was something to the effect of, \\"There's no way I'm shelling out all that cash for a PlayStation 3.\\" Sony's new game console, which debuts Nov. 17 in the U.S., will retail for 500 or 600, depending on whether you buy a basic setup or the premium version, which comes with a bigger hard drive, built-in Wi-Fi and a flash memory card reader. Similarly, Microsoft's Xbox 360, which debuted in November 2005, now retails at 300 or 400. Compare that to the Wii's 250 price tag, and Nintendo's already got a leg up in the upcoming console war. By concentrating on innovating through game play, and ignoring its competitors' most high-tech features--super-powered processors, support for high-definition televisions and DVD formats--Nintendo has not only been able to keep its costs down, but it's hit upon the single thing that sets apart an entertainment device most: It's fun.","output":"Here is the bullet point summary you asked for: - The Wii Sports Tennis game is immersive and fun - The motion-based controller means users can swing as if they are holding a real tennis racket - The physical experience allows for an enjoyable experience for both players and spectators - The controls don't require complex button sequences meaning that everyone can enjoy regardless of gaming experience - Sony's PS3 retails for around 500 and the Xbox 360 retails for between 300-400 - The Wii retails at just 250 - The biggest advantage of the Nintendo Wii is that it's fun"},{"instruction":"I’m feeling a bit low these days and want to start saying affirmations to myself to enhance my mood.

Write it in a casual, upbeat and energetic voice and use personal anecdotal experience as the framework to explain these concepts.","output":"Hey yogis! Today we're going to talk about the secret to nailing arm balances and inversion poses. Before you roll your eyes and groan that you're not strong enough, skinny enough, or flexible enough, hear me out! I'm convinced that none of these challenges are actually deal breakers when it comes to unlocking these intimidating poses, and hopefully, by the end of this post, you will be, too. Every time I unlock a new, difficult pose--whether it's a crow pose, handstand, or flying splits--I'm always shocked at how easy it feels. That's because these poses don't actually require as much strength or flexibility as we usually believe they do. Sure, core strength is an integral element of any balance pose, but you don't need washboard abs. Getting into these poses in the first place doesn't require extraordinary strength, but it does require the following: -Alignment. Standing on your hands is relatively easy when you stack your shoulders over your wrists and hips over your shoulders. You'll run into trouble if your hands are too close together or too far apart. -Engaged core. Even if your abs are fairly weak, you can still activate the core as you land in the pose to build strength while practicing and to make your body feel lighter (just like in \\"light as a feather, stiff as a board\\"). -Hand posture. To balance on the hands, your palms need to be slightly tented and fingers spread, gripping the mat like claws. This gives your fingers room to move and steady your balance if you feel like you might fall, whereas if they're already flat on the mat, they can't do anything to help you. -Drishti. Holding a focal point with your gaze is one of the most important keys to balance poses. If your eyes start wandering around the room, you will start wobbling. It also is helpful to send your gaze forward in balances and inversions. If you look down, you will likely fall down. -Belief. Fear is probably the single greatest hurdle that aspiring arm balancers need to overcome. It's understandable--no one wants to fall on their face. But you might be surprised how effective it is to relax, visualize yourself in a pose, and even use little cheats to prove to yourself that you're capable."},{"instruction":"Provide me with 7 quiz questions and answers about DashCon with multiple choices in true/false format.

Where did this start and what is the story behind it? Write a paragraph with around 200 words.

The leaves were from the Camellia sinensis tree which is now known as the tea plant. While the truth of this story is up for debate, there is no debate that tea originated in the regions around modern-day China thousands of years ago and was enjoyed by other nearby countries. However, it wasn’t until hundreds of years later that global trade routes brought tea to the rest of the world. Now tea comes in many different varieties. The main categories of tea that come from the tea plant are white, green, and black tea. The difference in these teas is in the oxidation process. Green tea is steamed after harvesting, maintaining the green color, while white tea is made by allowing the leaves to oxidize for a short amount of time. Lastly, black tea is allowed to undergo full oxidation, which allows its aroma to develop and gain its black-brown appearance."},{"instruction":"create 10 Chapter titles for a political thriller novel with a summary of each chapter.

Please remove superfluous details. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition, which occurs in people who become sensitive to a protein called gluten. Gluten is found in wheat, barley and rye and is normally a nourishing and harmless part of the food we eat. However, if you have coeliac disease, gluten causes damage to the lining of your small bowel (intestine). This can cause problems with the absorption of both macronutrients (protein, fats and carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and trace elements), from the foods we eat. The treatment, which is usually very successful, is to remove all sources of gluten from the diet. Over the past few years, it has become clear that coeliac disease is much more common than we used to think. Recent research has shown that approximately 1 in 100 people in the UK have this condition. Coeliac disease can affect people of all ethnicities. The incidence of coeliac disease in people with first-degree relatives (parent, child, sibling) who have coeliac disease is 1 in 10. However some people who have coeliac disease don’t actually know they have it but may still have some mild symptoms. It is thought that 7 out of 10 people remain undiagnosed. Some people don’t have any symptoms and are diagnosed when coeliac disease is suspected during investigation of other problems. Examples are bone fractures, anaemia and thyroid disease.","output":"Q.

Now I make my coffee not too strong, just strong enough to have a real coffee flavor. See this scoop? You'll want to put two for every cup. Make sure you measure the water just right, so you know how many scoops to put in. Something else you'll need to do sometimes is clean out the thingamajig that holds the water - it can get kind of slimy and that will ruin your coffee. If you can take it off the coffee machine, just run it through the dishwasher every now and again. And use purified water to make your coffee - I know this guy who installed a filter for me. I can give you his phone number if you want. And when your coffee maker starts taking a long time to drip, that means it's full of calcium, so you need to clean it with white vinegar - you put that in the water part, then run clean water, and your machine will be as good as new.

The findings reveal a parasite’s potent ability to influence a wolf’s social fate. Disease is often considered important for wildlife, mostly in the context of killing its host, Meyer says. “We have evidence now that just being infected with a certain parasite — Toxoplasma — can have pretty major implications for wolf behavior.”","output":"It seems that Yellowstone National Park wolves that are infected with a parasite (Toxoplasma gondii) become risk-takers. This behavior causes the infected wolves to leave the pack, take more risks, and even become pack leaders themselves. This parasite seems to influence a wolf's social fate, and can help create a new leader, and subsequently a new pack, or it could cause the wolf to die. While most diseases in the wild only lead to an animal's death, this particular parasite may help to increase a wolf's standing and social implications."},{"instruction":"Write a short story about a little boy who flies away on his birthday after being given too many helium balloons for children in the second grade.","output":"On a bright sunny day in June, all the neighborhood children gathered at little Sammy's house to celebrate his 7th birthday. All the children wore funny cone-shaped birthday hats. They couldn't wait to play pin-the-tail on the donkey. The birthday cake was shaped like an airplane because Sammy always dreamt of becoming a pilot. Fifty helium balloons decorated the backyard and danced in the warm breeze. After singing \\"Happy Birthday\\" and eating a big slice of chocolate cake, Sammy suddenly got an idea. \\"What if I can grab a hold of all of the balloons at once?\\" he thought to himself. He quickly loosed the balloons and began to hold them all together in the little fist he made with his right hand. When he got to the 50th balloon, something strange started to happen. His feet started to lift off of the ground! The children gathered around in amazement. He laughed as he rose...higher...and higher...and higher! In a flash, Sammy was above the rooftops and the treetops of his neighborhood, and was drifting away from his own house with the wind. \\"This is the best birthday ever!\\" thought Sammy as he floated through the air. The birds squawked in surprise as they flew past him and wondered how a little boy learned to fly! The children below squealed in delight as they saw Sammy rise higher and higher into the air. Only the adults seemed worried, as they yelled from below, \\"Sammy, start letting go of some balloons, right this instant!\\" Seeing their concern, Sammy let go of one balloon. He began to sink a little lower to the ground, but could still see the birds nesting in the trees. A new idea came to him. \\"What if I float over to my neighbor's pool and make a splash landing?\\" thought Sammy. He let go of another 5 balloons as he came closer to the large pool in the neighbor's yard. Before he knew it, he was hovering just above the cool blue waters and decided to release the rest of his balloons. \\"SPLASH!\\" Sammy had fallen directly into the pool! The children came running over and laughing, dove in after him. Sammy swam over to them as they cheered him for his aerial adventure. \\"I'll never forget the birthday I learned to fly!\\" exclaimed Sammy with glee."},{"instruction":"Write an email to the owner of a company from the perspective of an entrepreneur who wants to run ads for the owner's company.

With the getaway car long abandoned and our wheezing breath slowing to a gentle rhythm, a sense of calm washes over me. I'm free. Finally free. In sync with each of my breaths, I watch her head rise and fall with my chest, and we are at peace. There is nothing but the world in front of us now.

She can feel my heart begin to speed up again, and she responds by resting a hand over it. \\"Close your eyes,\\" she instructs, firm but gentle in her tone. I do. Her breath begins to slow and grow louder. Breathe in, slowly... I count along with it, tapping a finger on her arm. We make it to four before she holds the breath. Another four beats pass. We exhale again to the count of four. The process repeats until my heart has calmed to a resting pace. \\"You did the right thing. We did the right thing.\\" As it always does, her voice works to melt away my worries. Slowly opening my eyes, I lean down to press my lips to her head, where her softly reflective hair drapes over her ears. I could admire the way she looks in the dim glow of the full moon for a lifetime, but she would grow tired of it. Reaching into the pocket of my loose jeans, I fiddle with the button that clicks my pen, twisting it between my fingers. As the last reminder of my mother, I could feel the love surging through the object. Mundane as it was, it would stay with me for however long the rest of my life would be. It had to. When I noticed Anisse's eyes fluttering shut, I removed the pen from my pocket. It only took a couple of small twisting motions before I could read the engraving across the pen.

Explain why someone may be afraid of these things. Also, please explain if phobias can be cured.","output":"In the world of mental health and wellness, phobias are considered a kind of anxiety disorder that can cause someone to have an extreme fear of places, objects, animals, people, situations, and things. The fears are often irrational and difficult to explain, but exposure to the subject of a phobia can cause severe reactions, like the urge to run away or lash out violently. Some phobias are more widely accepted and well-known than others. Arachnophobia, for instance, is the extreme fear of spiders, and it affects up to 15 percent of the world’s population. Other common phobias include ophidiophobia (the fear of snakes), acrophobia (the fear of heights), and cynophobia (the fear of dogs). Some phobias, while uncommon, are still real and scary to the people that suffer from them. Five lesser-known phobias include: • Alektorophobia (the fear of chickens). • Globophobia (the fear of balloons). • Podophobia (the fear of feet). • Pedophobia (the fear of small children) • Phobophobia (the fear of fear) While some phobias may seem strange or silly to other people, they are often a source of extreme anxiety and insecurity for sufferers. The cause of each phobia can vary depending on the person. While some may have had negative experiences that caused extreme fear, others could associate their general anxiety disorder with a specific phobia because their brain latches onto that fear at the moment. Through psychotherapy and consistent behavioral therapy, most phobias can be either completely cured or lessened. The sufferer has to be dedicated to finding treatment and healing from their fears. There’s no linear method of treatment since every phobia sufferer is different and has different reasons for the fear that they feel. In most cases, exposure therapy is a method of overcoming any phobia. This means that a sufferer has to get comfortable with the object of their fear before they can heal and overcome their phobia. In other cases, anxiety medications can help lessen the extreme fear and visceral reactions associated with certain phobias."},{"instruction":"Reframe this discussion about the perceived effectiveness of supplements, with a particular focus on Vitamin D, into a conversation between two health-conscious friends debating about the validity of supplements in their daily routines. These are dark days for supplements. Although they are a 30-plus billion market in the United States alone, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, beta-carotene, glucosamine, chondroitin, and fish oil have now flopped in study after study. If there was one supplement that seemed sure to survive the rigorous tests, it was vitamin D. People with low levels of vitamin D in their blood have significantly higher rates of virtually every disease and disorder you can think of: cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, heart attack, stroke, depression, cognitive impairment, autoimmune conditions, and more. The vitamin is required for calcium absorption and is thus essential for bone health, but as evidence mounted that lower levels of vitamin D were associated with so many diseases, health experts began suspecting that it was involved in many other biological processes as well. And they believed that most of us weren’t getting enough of it. This made sense. Vitamin D is a hormone manufactured by the skin with the help of sunlight. It’s difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities through diet. When our ancestors lived outdoors in tropical regions and ran around half naked, this wasn’t a problem. We produced all the vitamin D we needed from the sun. But today most of us have indoor jobs, and when we do go outside, we’ve been taught to protect ourselves from dangerous UV rays, which can cause skin cancer. Sunscreen also blocks our skin from making vitamin D, but that’s OK, says the American Academy of Dermatology, which takes a zero-tolerance stance on sun exposure: “You need to protect your skin from the sun every day, even when it’s cloudy,” it advises on its website. Better to slather on sunblock, we’ve all been told, and compensate with vitamin D pills. Yet vitamin D supplementation has failed spectacularly in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers were already warning that it showed zero benefit, and the evidence has only grown stronger. In November, one of the largest and most rigorous trials of the vitamin ever conducted—in which 25,871 participants received high doses for five years—found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.","output":"\\"Hey Sarah, have you noticed that supplements seem to be losing their shine lately?\\" John asked, glancing at the array of vitamin bottles on the kitchen counter. \\"You know, vitamin A, C, E, even fish oil, they all seem to be failing in these research studies.\\" Sarah, stirring her morning coffee, nodded. \\"I did notice that, but it was really surprising about Vitamin D. It seemed like a sure bet, you know?\\" \\"Yeah,\\" John agreed. \\"I mean, people with lower Vitamin D levels have a higher risk of pretty much every disease you can think of - cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart diseases... the list goes on. It's also crucial for bone health because it helps absorb calcium.\\" Sarah furrowed her brow in thought. \\"And because Vitamin D is produced by our skin through sun exposure, experts believed we weren't getting enough, especially with our modern indoor lifestyles and the whole skin cancer scare leading to excessive sunscreen use.\\" \\"Exactly!\\" John exclaimed. \\"But despite our logical assumptions, Vitamin D supplements have shown no significant benefits in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers already began questioning its effectiveness, and recent evidence only strengthens their skepticism.\\" Sarah looked thoughtful. \\"That's concerning, considering how many people rely on these supplements. I mean, remember that large trial conducted recently? The one with over 25,000 participants receiving high Vitamin D doses for five years? It found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.\\" John nodded, his gaze returning to the line-up of vitamin bottles. \\"It definitely makes you wonder about the validity of including supplements in our daily routines, doesn't it?\\""},{"instruction":"Using this text, summarize how guessing the wrong word helped the writer solve the puzzle. RATES None of the letters were correct, so I now wanted to find a word that used the two next most common vowels, I and O, together with some other common consonants: DOING The word was now taking shape: I had three of the letters, two in the correct position. It looked as though the D must come at the end of the word, and there was a good chance that the letter between O and N would be a U: POUND My third guess confirmed my ideas about the general shape of the word. Now all I had to do was find the first letter. My problem was that I could think of five possible answers that all fitted the pattern using letters that were still available: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND. But I had only three guesses remaining, so if the answer was my fourth or fifth guess, I would lose the game. My chances were only 60%. Could I do anything to improve the odds? Yes! If I could come up with a word that contained three of the candidate letters B, F, H, M and W, I could either confirm or eliminate those letters in a single guess and so ensure that I won the game, even if I forfeited the chance of winning immediately: WOMBS I did not find the missing letter, but at least this guess served its purpose of eliminating three of the possible solutions, WOUND, MOUND, AND BOUND. So the answer had to be either FOUND or HOUND, and I still had two guesses left. I managed to pick the correct one: FOUND As with Wordle #281, using up one of my guesses on a word that I knew was not the correct solution proved to be a good way to win the game. In fact, if I had gone with the alternative of WHIFF instead of WOMBS for my fourth guess, I would have found out that the solution contained an F and my fifth guess would have been a certainty rather than a fifty-fifty chance.","output":"The writer chose a word they new was incorrect in order to eliminate potential letters faster than guessing the correct letters with single-letter modifications."},{"instruction":"Write an email to my housekeeper letting her know that she is fired because she's lazy and not doing her job.

Throughout history, many had sought the power of the Ring, but none had ever found it, until one day... A young chihuahua named Bolsón was playing in a stream deep in the forest when he stumbled upon the Ring. It was such a tiny gold band with strange markings on it. He knew immediately that he had found something of vital importance that must be protected at all costs. Some would stop at nothing to possess the Ring. The evil Maiar Saurpug, leader of the rival pug kingdom of Morpug, sent his PugOrc minions to find and capture Bolsón and the Ring. Bolsón knew that he had to leave his home, lest it be destroyed, and embark on a treacherous journey to destroy the Ring for once and for all before it fell into the wrong paws. With the help of his best friends - Samhowl the Beagle, MerryButts the Corgi, and Pippinlow the Dachshund - Bolsón set out on a quest to destroy the Ring. They encountered many dangers along the way, including treacherous rivers, towering mountains, and terrifying creatures, but they persevered. Finally, they reached the volcano, Mount Derp, where the Ring had to be destroyed. Saurpug and his army of pugs were close behind, determined to capture the Ring to claim ultimate power. Our heroes could feel their hot Pug breath on their necks at every turn. Bolsón knew that he had to act fast. So he threw the Ring into the volcano's core, destroying it forever. The chihuahuas of the land felt a great weight lifted off their shoulders and suddenly wanted to play. Bolsón and his friends returned home as heroes. They had saved their land from a great evil and ensured that no one would ever use the power of the Ring to raise an evil Chihuahua army again.

Create a quick story about a military pilot who gets shot down not by an enemy aircraft, but by some otherworldly horror that comes from below the ocean.","output":"The blaring alerts and sirens were replaced very suddenly by the roar of rushing air. I tumbled gradually through the air. The bulky emergency kit pressed heavily against my leg, which, oddly, felt both reassuring and unnerving. Though I knew I was moving at hundreds of miles an hour, everything seemed like slow motion. Then came the loud FLOP! of the unfurling parachute, and everything sped up again for a brief second. The harness yanked against my body with a jolt that made my teeth chatter. Once my acceleration had stabilized, though, it was back to slow motion. And there was the silence. Other than the wind whistling past my helmet and an occasional flutter from the parachute, the world seemed empty – almost peaceful. I caught sight of my F-18's tumbling remains just in time to watch it shatter against the ocean's surface. There was a brief flash of ignited jet fuel and then nothing. My beautiful bird simply disappeared. That sobered me up enough for the questions to start coming. What had hit me? I'd had no indication of unknown aircraft. No nearby islands were large enough to host surface-to-air missiles. Not a single unfriendly radar was painting my jet. Even the weather was as placid as one could possibly ask. Yet my fighter had taken a catastrophic hit at 30,000 feet. At least I wasn't over unfriendly waters. I'd have to remember my survival training, but as long as my beacon was functioning, the SAR guys would be along in a reasonable amount of time. It was about that point that I hazarded a look straight down. For lack of a better word, my brain just sort of fizzled at the sight. Below me, rising out of the empty ocean, was an immense black shape. My brain had never seen something by which to compare it.

Small home design details make me feel happy and comfortable.","output":"Do any of these ideas look like they'll help? • Paint or wallpaper an accent wall in your bedroom or living room! One color for every wall in your bedroom or living room can feel monotonous. It’s boring for the eyes. Give you and your guests something to break up the space with an accent wall. This is a colorful wall that uses either paint or wallpaper, creating a focal point where you can show off more of your interior design personality. • Bring nature indoors with a fresh vase of flowers, windowsill succulents, and a kitchen herb garden. Grocery stores have sales on seasonal flowers every week, so change out a vase of fresh flowers to bring nature indoors. You could also line your living room or bedroom windowsills with succulent plants, which require little upkeep to maintain vivid greenness and full beauty. Another great idea would be to grow your herbs in the kitchen. Use small pots in a line across your windowsill and plant fresh seasonings, like oregano, rosemary, and cilantro. • Change your curtains! For bedrooms, most people prefer blackout curtains. However, that still leaves your living room curtains, and perhaps the curtains in your home office. Change it up! Find a floral pattern that you love or choose light curtains and allow the sunshine to stream through in the mornings. • Create a flowerbed or small garden and line your front path with solar lights. Solar lights are eco-friendly ways to illuminate the way to your front door while also providing a nice evening aesthetic to your home’s exterior. As for a small garden or flowerbed, a new hobby could be fun, and you’d beautify your yard with pretty seasonal blooms. Plus, if you go the small garden route, there’s nothing quite like harvesting and eating veggies that you've grown! • Line your bedroom ceilings with fairy lights. Fairy lights are a colorful, twinkly way to add a touch of magic and whimsy to your bedroom. If you invest in ones with a remote, you can change colors to suit your moods while lying in bed to unwind after a long day."},{"instruction":"How many moon phases are there?

Modern pop music is very repetitive, one-dimensional, and shallow in both musical sophistication and lyrical content. Now, you could counter this observation and say that every generation of music gets that same critique. There's a hint of truth in that. But here are my arguments that the pop music of modern times truly does pale in comparison to the sophistication and variety offered in the 1960s through the 1980s. Those three decades introduced such bands as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, R.E.M, The Police... and a much longer list of iconic bands. The Who, Jimi Hendrix, The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac... Again, we're just scraping the surface. Not to mention all the Motown acts of classic R&B like Marvin Gaye or Al Green, and scores of similarly iconic black artists. All of these artists are on regular rotation on the radio to this day. On 'classic' stations, of course, but that's a testament to their staying power. Musicianship and lyrical content were highly respected in those eras. There were a wide variety of genres, ranging from disco to progressive rock. And people bought full albums from these artists, collections that were consistent in quality for their entirety. Today, with a few exceptions here and there, it's all about how an artist looks, not their talent. K-pop features artists who lip-sync, but none of their fans care, because it's purely about how attractive they are, and their dance moves. Electronica? People fill stadiums to watch someone twist knobs on a stage full of high-tech light shows. Some might say that I'm just an old curmudgeon. Well, that's fair enough.

Here's some things you can do to give yourself the best chance of success 1. Figure out finances - Find out how much you typically spend each month including bills and figure out how much money you need to bring in every month to make ends meet. 2. Get a regular client - You should find a client with regular work while you're still working your day job. This client acts as a sort of retainer because you know that you can be assured to have regular work while you're with them. When you have a regular client, you can make the rest of your income from other clients. 3. Network - Get networking as soon as possible. Doing so will offer a community of support, and you may find some connections that will hire you or connect you with others who may hire you. 4. Be present online - You should have a website and be active on social media. This is something else that you can do while you're at your other job. 5. Make an elevator pitch - Ask yourself exactly what you want to bring to the table, and make this clear on your website site. If you provide more than one service, you should have a main service and work every other one around that main one. People will more likely hire you if they know what you can do for them. 6. Take on as much work as possible - You'll know when you reach the point that it's time to move to freelance. When you want to move forward, you should do everything you can to work on your freelancing. 7. Don't wait to be ready - The truth is, you'll likely not ever feel quite ready. But don't jump into freelancing too fast. Make sure your foundation is set, and then you can shift to freelancing as your career."},{"instruction":"My bathroom sink is plugged.

Video editing is one of your special skills, which means you shouldn't hide it. Make your videos flashy, fresh, and fun. Along with that, incorporating more editing will give you a personal style. People will start to recognize your videos based on the editing style. When this happens, you'll become more popular. 2) Post your films on YouTube. Film is one of your special skills, meaning you should make films, if you haven't already, and post them on YouTube. Short films with good editing, two of your skills, can get good views on YouTube. Along with that, you're building a film portfolio. 3) Try video essays. Video essays are right up your alley since your skills include writing and editing. Those two skills allow you to create engaging video essays. Your watch time will increase, meaning your videos will get recommended more. Along with that, viewers love it when creators put a lot of effort into their videos. Considering video essays take a long time, trying that genre can result in a lot of love. 4) Make a podcast. Humor and writing are two essentials for podcasts. Make a podcast and post it on YouTube. As long as you incorporate good humor and talk about interesting topics, your podcast could take off and make you a popular YouTuber. 5) Post gaming highlights. If you game often, you should consider recording it and posting the highlights on YouTube. These highlights are easy to make, and posting them can't hurt. You don't have to do a lot of editing to create these videos; however, if you want to incorporate your other skill, editing, you can.

Marinate your chicken: Place your chicken, buttermilk, pickle juice, and half of all spices in a bag or container and allow it to sit for at least 1 hour. 2. Once your chicken has marinated, preheat your oil to 375 degrees. The reason for this is that the temperature of the oil will drop once the cool chicken is added to it. Making it slightly hotter than 350 degrees will ensure your chicken's breading comes out crunchy. 3. Mix the remaining seasonings with your flour in a plastic bag or container. 4. Coat the chicken tenders in the seasoned flour. 5. Place chicken in the oil and fry until golden brown. Helpful Tip (Once the chicken tenders float, they are cooked through. Avoid overcooking so your chicken will remain juicy.) 6. Once your last batch of tenders is frying, start preparing your sauce by combining the honey, buffalo sauce, and butter in a small saucepan. 7. Cook over medium heat until it starts to bubble and thicken. Once the desired consistency is achieved remove from the heat. 8. Toss your chicken tenders in the hot honey sauce for more even distribution. You may also pour the sauce over the tenders or dip them if you prefer less sauce. 9.

Here is an instruction manual on how to train like Bruce Lee: Weight training - Bruce Lee was a proponent of circuit resistance training, which involved doing circuits of exercises using weights. A sample circuit would consist of exercises that work out the entire body. For example, bench press, bicep curl, military press, squat, bent-over barbell row, and tricep extension using a weight about 60% of one's max 10 times per exercise, without rest, until all exercises have been completed would be considered a single circuit. Doing several circuits works muscles to build endurance, and also taxes the respiratory and circulatory systems. Aerobic training - Bruce Lee loved his stationary bike; it allowed him to get an aerobic (at least 20 minutes of repetitive, low-impact exercise) workout while watching television or reading a book. If he was not using his stationary bike, he would go for a run of between 2-6 miles, with the runs changing the speeds and tempos during the duration. Skill training - Of course, as Bruce Lee would say, learning to fight from a book was like dry-land swimming; one needs to practice the skills that will be used in a fight. These skills mainly consisted of punching and kicking. The following is a list of skills that Bruce Lee practiced when developing his martial art of Jeet Kune Do: lead punch; uppercut; back fist; cross; hook; straight blast; front kick; crescent kick; roundhouse; front thrusting kick; instep kick; side kick; shuffling side kick; thrusting side kick. These are just a few of the techniques used by Bruce Lee, but while Jeet Kune Do teaches one to use any weapon that is appropriate for the situation, the simplest techniques are usually the best."},{"instruction":"Write a freeform poem about a jazz lounge.","output":"Smoke fills the velvet room and, Although it's noon, You would never know.

The Cuban government organized acts of repudiation against those who wished to leave the island. Mobs would sometimes beat their targets, force them to walk around with accusatory signs on their necks or trash their homes. Castro, trying to stop the unrest, opened the port of Mariel, west of Havana, to any residents who wanted to leave. The Cuban government facilitated an emigration process that gave special privileges to those who were socially undesirable. People deemed \\"homosexual\\" would be allowed to leave the country. Those with gender non-conforming behavior were especially targeted by authorities for departure. From April until October, some 125,000 Cuban immigrants crossed the Florida Straits to the United States.

They may be surprised at how quickly they’ll get through them without any tech-based distractions. -Writing: Nature is full of inspiration. Have your kids bring some journals and writing utensils so they can jot down diary entries, poems, short stories, or anything else they want to write. -Games: Even if you’re planning lots of wilderness adventures, it’s a good idea to bring games in case of inclement weather. Bring some fun multiplayer board games, and a deck of cards in case anyone wants to play solitaire. -Arts and crafts: This will be a great time to experiment with arts and crafts such as watercolor painting, wood carving, knitting, embroidery, sculpting, wood burning/etching, and more. Your kids could also try their hands at some extra messy projects like tie-dye, making goo from scratch, paper mache, or splatter painting a la Jackson Pollock since you won't have to worry about making a mess inside your home. -Puzzles: Bring a book of crosswords or sudoku puzzles, and maybe a jigsaw puzzle that the whole family can work on together. -Play music: Camping provides a great opportunity to practice playing acoustic instruments such as the guitar, ukulele, hand drums, flute, or fiddle. -Sports: Bring a soccer ball, basketball, football, or tennis ball and racket so the kids can play together and exhaust themselves with some exercise. -Hiking: Trail hiking makes a fun family excursion. -Boating: There are several bodies of water in the Sierra Mountains. If you own a boat, you can bring it with you, or you may be able to rent one just for the trip. You could canoe, kayak, or use a motorized boat. Have the kids bring bathing suits, too, in case the water's warm enough for a swim. -Biking: Like hiking, this is a great way to explore the area, but you’ll be able to cover a lot more ground in a shorter amount of time on wheels than you could on foot. -Star gazing: Bring a book of star maps and/or a telescope and spend the evenings searching for constellations and shooting stars. -Campfire rituals: Replace the habit of zoning out in front of the tv after dinner with a nightly campfire ritual. You can cook dinner over the fire, make s’mores together, and take turns telling ghost stories, or opt for family stories if your kids don’t enjoy being scared."},{"instruction":"What is the tone of the text provided?

While there are more than three groups, let's discuss three of them: Sporting, Working, and Toy groups. -Sporting dogs include breeds such as Retrievers, Spaniels, Pointers, and Setters. These dogs were historically bred for hunting and other field activities. They are known for their superior instincts in water and woods, and many of these breeds enjoy hunting, swimming, and retrieving games. They are generally very active and fun-loving animals, requiring regular, invigorating exercise. -Working dogs comprise breeds like Boxers, Siberian Huskies, Saint Bernards, and Great Danes. They were originally bred to perform jobs such as guarding property, pulling sleds, and performing water rescues. This group is known for their intelligence and versatility. Due to their size and strength, early training and socialization are essential to manage these breeds effectively. -The Toy group, as the name suggests, contains the smallest breeds of dogs such as Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and Yorkshire Terriers. Despite their small size, these dogs were bred for various reasons, ranging from companionship to vermin hunting. They are well-suited to apartment living and make excellent companion pets.

Please brainstorm for me a few different ways that people decide on names for new flowers or other new things and explain how each idea is used.","output":"I can help with that! Here are some ways people choose names for new things: - The Creator's Name - Many people include their own last or first name in a flower they create or discover. This ensures that they are remembered as being the person who created it. This can be their unaltered name, a nickname, or an alteration of their name that seems to fit the plant more for whatever reason. - Someone's Name - Along with being named after the creator, it is also fairly common to name a plant after a loved one, a movie star, a mentor, etc. - It's Appearance - Most flowers are named after something that has to do with their appearance, whether this is the shape of their leaves, the color of their flowers, or something else unique about the plant. For example, a flower variation that is blue might be named Sky Blue, Ocean View, or something else that brings to mind the color. - Something Important - Some people who name things choose a name that has meaning for them. For example, if you have another hobby besides your flowers that you enjoy, you could include that hobby in the name. Also, if you have been through a tough time, you can make the name hopeful or include any word that has meaning to you. Hopefully, this helps you come up with name ideas for your new flower!"},{"instruction":"Rewrite this in a format a fourth grader would understand. With Their Knowledge Combined, Two Scholars Are Deciphering a Long-Lost Native Language When historian Alejandra Dubcovsky was in graduate school in the early 2000s, she decided to focus her research on the Indigenous cultures of the Americas. “I asked my professors, ‘Should I learn any Native languages?’” Dubcovsky recalled. “And they were like, ‘Why? You know Spanish, you know French—you’re set for life.’” Dubcovsky laughed. “And I went to Berkeley!” Dubcovsky’s teachers were just repeating what their own mentors had told them: Native languages were too hard to learn, and most pre-Columbian cultures didn’t leave behind written records anyway. Some, like the Aztec and Maya, had hieroglyphic systems, but those symbols offered little insight into the spoken languages themselves. Why shouldn’t Dubcovsky, who was born in Argentina, just study the records of Spanish colonizers the way generations before her had done? When she connected with Aaron Broadwell, a linguistics professor at the University of Florida, she found the missing puzzle pieces she had been seeking. Broadwell was an expert on the Native languages of the American Southeast—Choctaw, Creek and others that belonged to the Muskogee family. His most ambitious project was decoding a language, spoken by the Timucua people, that is unrelated to any other known tongue. When Spanish colonizers arrived in the 16th century, Timucua was the most widely spoken language in large swaths of Florida and Georgia. Within two centuries, by the time of U.S. independence, its speakers had all been enslaved, felled by disease or absorbed into other language groups. Despite its diminishment, Timucua left a record—it was the first Native language within modern U.S. borders to be put into writing, albeit using the Roman alphabet. Rare book libraries hold Franciscan texts that display Spanish on one side and Timucua on the other. Most historians just read the Spanish side. But Dubcovsky wanted to know what the Timucua texts really said. Since around 2000, Broadwell has been assembling the first comprehensive online Timucua dictionary, with the help of graduate students and computer programs that can search for patterns in grammar and meaning. Together, he and Dubcovsky have also made a number of startling new discoveries that challenge the usual narrative about how the Timucua language came to be written down. Those of us at Smithsonian repeated a version of that narrative in our March issue, briefly crediting the Franciscan missionary Francisco Pareja with transcribing the Timucua language into the Roman alphabet. That version of the story, with Pareja at the center, has been widely promulgated for generations. As a catalogue entry at the Library of Congress puts it: “Timucuan is a dead language. Spoken by an Indigenous tribe that lived in northeast-north central Florida during the time of Spanish colonization, it was learned and recorded by Friar Francisco Pareja, a missionary and self-taught linguist. Thanks to his efforts, Timucua is now considered the best-attested language from a Native tribe in Spanish Colonial Florida.”","output":"You got it! Here’s a rewritten version of the article a fourth grader could comprehend. Alejandra Dubcovsky and Aaron Broadwell were two smart people that wanted to see if they could figure out a lost Native American language. Different cultures and languages have always been interesting to Alejandra, but her teachers told her that she didn’t have to take language classes since she already knew Spanish and French. That didn’t stop her! Aaron is really good at Native American languages, and he teaches other students all about them. At this time, he was trying to translate the Timucua language. Did you know that many people in Florida and Georgia spoke Timucua once? However, once Spanish invaders came to the land in the 1500s, and the language was no longer spoken due to problems that arose. Some really old books have Timucua words, just like we do today, even though the language nearly went away forever. Many people stick to the Spanish translation, but Alejandra was very curious, and she found Timucua vocabulary inside these books. Since 2000, Aaron has been working very hard to make a dictionary based on the Timucua language. He has his students to help him and uses computers for complex assignments. Together, both Aaron and Alejandra have made a lot of progress! People used to think that a Spanish missionary named Francisco Pareja was the first person to write Timucua. But there could be more to the story! Alejandra and Aaron’s actions have let us know more about Timucua."},{"instruction":"How much alcohol is in Soju?","output":"About 78% of Soju is alcohol, similar to how 1,000 is 78% of 1282.05.

National Licorice Company was created in 1902 through the merger of three small firms: Young & Smylie, S.V. & F.P. Schudder and H.W. Petherbridge. In 1908 a plant was opened in Montreal and in 1929 the Twizzlers brand was created. The company changed its name to Y&S Candies Inc. in 1968. Y&S Candies was acquired by The Hershey Company in November 1977 in a pooling-of-interests, then merged into Hershey in January 1982.[4][5] Since 1999, Twizzlers have been manufactured in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as Lancaster, in a Y&S plant that makes chewing gum and other candies. From 1970 through 1999, it was manufactured in Farmington, New Mexico, but relocated the operation to Memphis due to rising transportation costs.[6] According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest licorice twist ever made measured 1,200 feet (370 m) and 100 pounds (45 kg) and was made at the Y&S Candy Plant in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1998.[1][7][8]","output":"The National Licorice Company was created in 1902 and a plant was opened in Montreal in 1908."},{"instruction":"Please write a postcard from a penguin to a polar bear who went to Hawaii on vacation from the arctic. <100 words and make it funny.","output":"Hey PB!

Yes, he knew his name was silly, but like the rest of us, he had no choice in the matter and would prefer if you didn't mention it. Thank you very much. As he sat on the grocery shelf, gently shivering in the cold next to his carton-mates, Eggbert daydreamed of the moment he finally would be purchased and brought home. You might wonder why an egg was so eager to be purchased and inevitably eaten. And it's a myth, Eggbert will tell you, that grocery items don't desire to be eaten. Much like any one of us who dreams of leading our lives in fulfilling, self-actualized ways, Eggbert believed in his heart that being part of a balanced breakfast was the greatest role an egg could strive for. Having never actually been fertilized, he had no desire to hatch into anything and sat patiently as time passed, keeping himself occupied with daydreams of being cracked and fried into the perfect omelet. A few days later, his carton finally reached the front of the shelf. He and his carton-mates could hardly contain their excitement, as each passing shopper might be their ticket to eggy nirvana. Soon enough, he watched as a young mother approached with a small child in tow. Reaching forward towards their carton, Eggbert knew his time had come. She lifted them up and opened the carton to inspect each one of the eggs. This was the moment, Eggbert knew. He was about to be purchased and brought home. Just then, the young woman's child tugged and shouted something incoherently, as children do, knocking the carton out of her hand. As they tumbled to the ground, almost in slow motion, Eggbert saw his life flash before his eyes. At the moment of impact, Eggbert felt his shell crack, with all his nutritious insides spilling out across the floor. His carton-mates didn't fare much better, either, laying in shards around him. As he lay there, devasted and literally broken, Eggbert cursed the gods who gave him such sentience and depth of emotion. Life was too cruel."},{"instruction":"Gather in a numbered list all the countries that took occupation in Germany and which areas they occupied separated by a comma. Here is the article I am referring to: After Germany's defeat in the Second World War, the four main allies in Europe - the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France - took part in a joint occupation of the German state. With the original understanding that the country would eventually be reunified, the Allied Powers agreed to share the responsibility of administering Germany and its capital, Berlin, and each took responsibility for a certain portion of the defeated nation. This arrangement ultimately evolved into the division of Germany into a Western and an Eastern sector, thereby contributing to the Cold War division of Europe. During the Second World War, one of the major topics under discussion at conferences of the Allied leadership was how to deal with Germany after the war. Having experienced great losses as a result of German invasions in the First and Second World Wars, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin preferred that a defeated Germany be dismembered and divided so that it could not rise to its former strength to threaten European peace and security again. At the Tehran Conference between U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1943, the two countries agreed that after the war Germany would be divided and occupied jointly. At the final wartime conference between these two men at Yalta in 1945, the two powers agreed to shift the eastern border of Germany to the West, enlarging western Poland as compensation for the eastern sections of that country annexed by the Soviet Union. They also determined that the occupation would divide Germany into sections, with each Allied power taking responsibility for one section, although they would be governed as a single economic unit in anticipation of their eventual reunification. Finally, they also concluded that they would demand reparations from Germany, although they did not yet agree on exactly how much they would request. A meeting later in 1945 between Stalin and new U.S. President Harry Truman held at Potsdam confirmed and ratified these arrangements. After the victory over the Axis powers, however, the wartime cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union soon faded. In reality, mutual distrust ruled the relationship between the two countries, and nowhere was this more evident than in the difficulties over the occupation of Germany. The Allies agreed to a joint occupation, with each country taking charge of a larger zone and a sector of the nation's capital, Berlin. Upon British insistence, France joined Great Britain and the United States in the occupation of West Germany and West Berlin, while the Soviet Union managed the affairs of East Germany and East Berlin.","output":"1.

Its advent caused my mother to throw a shoe through a window of the house next door and ended up with my grandfather shooting a patrolman. I am sorry, therefore, as I have said, that I ever paid any attention to the footsteps. They began about a quarter past one o’clock in the morning, a rhythmic, quickcadenced walking around the dining-room table. My mother was asleep in one room upstairs, my brother Herman in another; grandfather was in the attic, in the old walnut bed which, as you will remember, once fell on my father. I had just stepped out of the bathtub and was busily rubbing myself with a towel when I heard the steps. They were the steps of a man walking rapidly around the diningroom table downstairs. The light from the bathroom shone down the back steps, which dropped directly into the dining-room; I could see the faint shine of plates on the plate-rail; I couldn’t see the table. The steps kept going round and round the table; at regular intervals a board creaked, when it was trod upon. I supposed at first that it was my father or my brother Roy, who had gone to Indianapolis but were expected home at any time. I suspected next that it was a burglar. It did not enter my mind until later that it was a ghost. After the walking had gone on for perhaps three minutes, I tiptoed to Herman’s room. “Psst!” I hissed, in the dark, shaking him. “Awp,” he said, in the low, hopeless tone of a despondent beagle—he always half suspected that something would “get him” in the night. I told him who I was. “There’s something downstairs!” I said. He got up and followed me to the head of the back staircase. We listened together. There was no sound. The steps had ceased. Herman looked at me in some alarm: I had only the bath towel around my waist. He wanted to go back to bed, but I gripped his arm. “There’s something down there!” I said. Instantly the steps began again, circled the dining-room table like a man running, and started up the stairs toward us, heavily, two at a time. The light still shone palely down the stairs; we saw nothing coming; we only heard the steps. Herman rushed to his room and slammed the door. I slammed shut the door at the stairs top and held my knee against it. After a long minute, I slowly opened it again. There was nothing there. There was no sound. None of us ever heard the ghost again.","output":"The demon that infiltrated our house on the night of November 17, 1915, unleashed such a cacophony of chaos and malevolence that I regret not leaving it undisturbed and retiring to bed. Its arrival instigated a series of misunderstandings that led my mother to hurl a shoe through a neighboring house's window and culminated in my grandfather firing a fatal shot at a patrolman. I ruefully admit that my attention to the haunting footsteps proved to be a grave mistake. The eerie echoes began around 1:15 a.m., a rapid and rhythmic cadence encircling the dining room table. Upstairs, my mother slumbered in one room, my brother Herman in another, while my grandfather occupied the attic, resting on the same old walnut bed that had once tragically claimed my father's life. Just as I had stepped out of the bathtub and begun toweling off, the footsteps invaded my senses. They were unmistakably the footsteps of a man, briskly traversing the dining room downstairs. The dim light from the bathroom cast its glow down the back staircase, directly into the dining room. I could faintly discern the shine of plates on the plate rail, but the table remained hidden from my view. The footsteps persisted, circling the table in a ceaseless loop, occasionally punctuated by the creaking of a trodden board. Initially, I assumed it was my father or brother Roy, who was expected home from Indianapolis at any moment. My next conjecture veered toward a possible burglar. But it never occurred to me until later that it was an insidious demon haunting our abode. After the spectral pacing persisted for about three minutes, I tiptoed to Herman's room, urgently whispering his name in the darkness and shaking him awake. In a somber, resigned tone reminiscent of a despondent beagle, he murmured, \\"Awp.\\" I revealed my identity and whispered, \\"There's something downstairs!\\" Reluctantly, he rose from his bed and followed me to the top of the back staircase. Together, we listened intently, but there was no sound. The steps had ceased. Herman regarded me with growing trepidation, only to find me clad in a bath towel wrapped around my waist. He yearned to return to the safety of his bed, but I clutched his arm firmly, insisting, \\"There's something down there!\\" Suddenly, the footsteps recommenced, racing around the dining-room table as though pursued by an unseen force, then ascending the stairs towards us with an ominous weight, two steps at a time. The feeble light continued to cast a pallid glow on the staircase, yet no figure materialized before our eyes—only the haunting sound of the steps reverberated through the air. In a panic, Herman retreated to his room and slammed the door shut. I hastily sealed the door at the top of the stairs, bracing my knee against it. After an agonizingly long minute, I cautiously reopened it, expecting a horrifying apparition. But to our relief, there was nothing there. Silence enveloped the house. None of us ever encountered the demon again, but the lingering memory of that night's terrors would forever haunt our souls."},{"instruction":"What planet has the most moons?","output":"As of information available on December 31, 2021, Saturn is the planet with the most moons, it has 83 moons."},{"instruction":"What is the longest one-syllable word?","output":"Scraunched and strengthed are the longest one-syllable words.

I pulled my book, Relaxing: A Meditative Study, from the shelf and flipped to the Introduction. I had read a few lines and was just getting ready to pick up my mug when—bzzzt!—a sound like a drill came from outside my window. It wasn't the sound of someone using a miter saw or something across the street. No, it was right outside. Still, I was reluctant to hop up. I was cozy and didn't want to move. If I stayed put, maybe the monster outside would forget about me and bother someone else or come back later. Either one was preferable. I went back to my book, pulling up the blanket ever so slightly just to convince myself that I was truly in relaxation mode. The noise again, like a drillbit whirring at max speed into my drywall. I shot up in annoyance and pulled the blind cord. That's when I saw the little fellow. A hummingbird, gazing at me with fear in its eyes, sat perched against the tree. So that's what had been bothering me all this time. I laughed and waved at the bird, which proved to be a little too scary.

In about 6 to 8 weeks, you will get your results, which include a snapshot of your ethnicity, ancestral origins, and any DNA matches. The ethnicity estimate tells you what percentages of your DNA comes from different locations around the world. If any DNA matches are found, you can connect with living relatives. You can also create a family tree to find common ancestors with your DNA matches.

Their morals come through in songs about naughty children and lessons learned. Charlie Bucket (played by Peter Ostrum): Impoverished and kind, Charlie and his family have been dealt a bad hand in life, but finding the golden ticket is their chance to live better. The protagonist of the story, Charlie is the little boy that Wonka ultimately decides to reward with possession of his chocolate factory. Grandpa Joe (played by Jack Albertson): Disabled and bedridden, Grandpa Joe is imaginative and excitable with child-like energy. While he remains in bed to rest for most of his days, his energy is restored when Charlie finds the golden ticket. He accompanies Charlie to the chocolate factory as a chaperone to meet Willy Wonka. Arthur Slugworth (played by Gunter Meisner): The alleged enemy and spy of Willy Wonka. He wants to know all of Wonka’s secrets so he can drive his chocolate factory out of business. He attempts to bribe all of the children that found the golden ticket, promising them riches if they deliver Wonka’s secret to “everlasting gobstoppers.” Violet Beauregarde (played by Denise Nickerson): Overconfident and persistent, Violet chews gum competitively.

She expects her daddy to buy her everything that she wants, including a golden goose from Wonka’s factory. When Wonka refuses to sell, she throws a fit, eventually falling into the \\"bad egg” side of the golden egg chute. Augustus Gloop (played by Michael Bollner): Overweight and gluttonous, Augustus never knows when to quit eating. His mother indulges him, spoiling him with sweets. So, it’s no surprise when his chocolate-thieving antics get him nearly drowned and sucked up into pipes from the chocolate river. Mike Teevee (played by Paris Themmen): Obsessed with television, Mike fancies himself a futuristic boy with the intelligence to match. However, his attempt to become the first boy to be transmitted across TV waves leads him to be shrunken down in size, small enough to fit in his mother’s purse. Released in 1971, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a comedic musical based on Roald Dahl’s popular children’s book, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” Roald Dahl, however, despised the adaptation.

Kardashian later blamed their separation on physical and emotional abuse on his part[121] and said she was high on ecstasy during their wedding ceremony.[122] Before her divorce was finalized, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[120] Kardashian briefly dated NFL player Miles Austin in 2010.[123] In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[124] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[125] Earlier that month, she had released her \\"wedding fragrance\\" called \\"Kim Kardashian Love\\" which coincided with her own wedding.[48][126] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a \\"media blitz\\" related to the wedding.[127] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[128] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[129] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed a suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case that included an apology from Jaxson.[130] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[131] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[132] Kardashian began dating rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[133] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[134] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[135] and married on May 24, 2014, at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[136] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[137] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[138] The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as \\"a historic blizzard of celebrity\\".[14] West said Kardashian was his muse.[139] In January 2021, CNN reported that the couple were discussing divorce[140] and on February 19, 2021, Kardashian officially filed for divorce.[141] In April 2021, they both agreed before court that they would end their marriage due to \\"irreconcilable differences\\" and agreed to joint custody of their four children. They also agreed that neither of them need spousal support.[142] In February 2022, Kardashian filed a complaint to the Los Angeles Superior Court, asking for a quicker proceedings in the divorce from West, saying that West was trying to delay it and saying that \\"Mr. West, by his actions, has made it clear that he does not accept that the parties' marital relationship is over.\\"[143] Kardashian was declared legally single on March 2, 2022.[144] This allowed her to drop \\"West\\" as her legal last name and ended their marriage.[145] A divorce settlement was finalized on November 29, 2022.[146] Kardashian began dating actor and comedian Pete Davidson in November 2021.[147][148] In August 2022, they ended their relationship.[149]","output":"1. 2000: Kim Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas. 2. 2003: Damon Thomas filed for divorce from Kim Kardashian. 3. 2003: Kim Kardashian began dating singer Ray J while still finalizing her divorce from Damon Thomas. 4. 2010: Kardashian briefly dated NFL player Miles Austin. 5.

He was known far and wide as one of the kindest, strongest, and most courageous people to have walked the planet. He dedicated his whole life to protecting his city and the entire world from any and all threats. Yet, he could feel there was something out there that was far greater a threat than he had ever faced before. Over the next few days, it was discovered that an asteroid was hurtling toward Cornerius, at a speed and trajectory that would spell certain disaster for its inhabitants. Solaire knew what he had to do, even though there was no chance of his survival. With every ounce of his strength, he flew into space. He picked up his speed, and as he closed his eyes, he thought of all his loved ones and his beloved planet. He knew this was the best decision he could make. He flew straight into the asteroid, destroying it into miniscule fragments, rendering it a threat no more. The collision weakened him tremendously and he was not able to return to the planet in time. During his last few moments of life, he thought back and had no regrets. He lived courageously and lived for not just himself, but for others. To this day, the planet as a whole still mourns but is genuinely grateful for Solaire's sacrifice. He still remains a beacon of hope and a reminder to do what is possible for the greater good, no matter what the outcome.

Tails serve different purposes for different groups of animals, and animals with tails have evolved structures and behaviors to maximize this part of their body. For example, insect tails serve as stingers, dispensers of chemical weapons, egg depositors, whips, and flight stabilizers, among many other uses. In vertebrates, tails are primarily designed for locomotion and balance. For example, the tails of fishes and crocodiles sweep back and forth propelling these animals forward in the water. Tails also serve as energy stores and disposable parts: skinks and many other lizard species can voluntarily release their tail when a predator chomps onto it, and they can regenerate their tails later. The largest sauropod dinosaurs (that is, the ones that walked on four legs) had long tails to balance the weight of their long necks. A bird’s tail works together with its wings to help the bird from falling out of the sky, and the colorful tail feathers of male birds of paradise, turkeys, peacocks, and others help to attract females. Some mammals, such as squirrels and some monkeys, use their tail as grasping limbs to maneuver through the trees.","output":"- Insect tails are used as stingers, chemical weapon dispensers, egg depositors, whips, and flight stabilizers. - Vertebrate tails are used for locomotion and balance. - Dinosaur tails are used to balance the weight of their long necks. - Bird tails are used to work along with wings to help them stay in the sky when flying. - Male bird tails are used to attract a mate with colorful feathers. - Some mammal tails are used as grasping limbs when climbing trees."},{"instruction":"Write a character arc for a person who goes from looking to everyone for what to do to looking to themself.","output":"A young scholar helps keep tabs on the magic meter in a city because he believes it is the best way for him to serve the people.

Mention jellyfish facts and what to do if you get stung by one.","output":"Jellyfish are common in Hampton Roads coastal waters during the summer months. They are not aggressive, but they can sting people who accidentally bump into them. Jellyfish stings can be painful, but most are not emergencies. If you are stung, try to remain calm and seek medical attention if necessary. Jellyfish are not fish. They are invertebrate animals that do not have a backbone. The most common jellyfish in Hampton Roads is the sea nettle. Sea nettle tentacles can extend several feet and contain thousands of stingers. When touched, a sea nettle's stingers pierce a person's skin and release venom that can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting. Even a dead jellyfish can sting. If you see a jellyfish on the beach, do not touch it. Even a detached tentacle can release venom. To treat a jellyfish sting, rinse the affected area with seawater. Do not use fresh water, alcohol, or ammonia. Apply a cold compress to the area to help reduce pain and swelling. Over-the-counter pain relievers can also help. If you have a severe allergic reaction to jellyfish stings, seek medical attention immediately. There are a few things you can do to prevent jellyfish stings: 1. Check with local health departments and lifeguards about water conditions before swimming. 2. Avoid swimming in areas where jellyfish have been reported. 3. Wear protective clothing, such as a wetsuit or a stinger suit, when swimming in areas where jellyfish are present. 4.

I have been in the city now for over a week and I can tell you it's unlike anything you've ever seen. The buildings are so high and the streets are so busy it hardly feels real. I got the chance to ride in one of those automobiles we heard about and it was exhilarating. I won't lie by telling you I did feel a bit of fear but it was completely overshadowed by the excitement of traveling nearly forty miles an hour. The wind in my hair was one of the most wonderful feelings I've ever had. The new job at the newspaper is going splendidly. I've gotten in with the other girls in the office and we have the most fun of times together. They are all hard workers too, and this woman named Mavis in particular is quite a brilliant writer. She just got back home from Africa after doing a co-op with a photographer in Kenya. Her stories and the things she did are amazing and I must admit I am a bit jealous. I can see you and me in Africa taking in the experience and making a difference somewhere in the world. Can't you? Otherwise, things are rather normal here. I do feel lonely here at night and even a little fearful when it's dark and quiet. I can't wait for you to get here and experience this with me. This place is far different than home, and I can't wait to see your face when you experience what I have experienced. The food alone deserves a letter home of its own. Even simple things like hotdogs are just fabulous. I don't know how they do it. In closing, I want you to know I love you very much and that I think of you every day, throughout the day. None of this feels right without you here and I just can't wait to hold you again. Travel safe my love.

The death of Alexander the Great of Greece in 323 BCE led to the breakup of the Greek empire as three of his generals fought for supremacy and divided the Middle East among themselves. Ptolemy secured control of Egypt and the Land of Israel. Seleucus grabbed Syria and Asia Minor, and Antigonus took Greece. The Land of Israel was thus sandwiched between two of the rivals and, for the next 125 years, Seleucids and Ptolemies battled for this prize. The former finally won in 198 B.C. when Antiochus III defeated the Egyptians and incorporated Judea into his empire. Initially, he continued to allow the Jews autonomy, but after a stinging defeat at the hands of the Romans he began a program of Hellenization that threatened to force the Jews to abandon their monotheism for the Greeks' paganism. Antiochus backed down in the face of Jewish opposition to his effort to introduce idols in their temples, but his son, Antiochus IV, who inherited the throne in 176 B.C. resumed his father's original policy without excepting the Jews. A brief Jewish rebellion only hardened his views and led him to outlaw central tenets of Judaism such as the Sabbath and circumcision, and defile the holy Temple by erecting an altar to the god Zeus, allowing the sacrifice of pigs, and opening the shrine to non-Jews. The Jewish Hammer Though many Jews had been seduced by the virtues of Hellenism, the extreme measures adopted by Antiochus helped unite the people. When a Greek official tried to force a priest named Mattathias to make a sacrifice to a pagan god, the Jew murdered the man. Predictably, Antiochus began reprisals, but in 167 BCE the Jews rose up behind Mattathias and his five sons and fought for their liberation. The family of Mattathias became known as the Maccabees, from the Hebrew word for \\"hammer,\\" because they were said to strike hammer blows against their enemies. Jews refer to the Maccabees, but the family is more commonly known as the Hasmoneans. Like other rulers before him, Antiochus underestimated the will and strength of his Jewish adversaries and sent a small force to put down the rebellion. When that was annihilated, he led a more powerful army into battle only to be defeated. In 164 BCE, Jerusalem was recaptured by the Maccabees and the Temple purified, an event that gave birth to the holiday of Chanukah. Jews Regain Their Independence It took more than two decades of fighting before the Maccabees forced the Seleucids to retreat from the Land of Israel. By this time Antiochus had died and his successor agreed to the Jews' demand for independence. In the year 142 BCE, after more than 500 years of subjugation, the Jews were again masters of their own fate. When Mattathias died, the revolt was led by his son Judas, or Judah Maccabee, as he is often called. By the end of the war, Simon was the only one of the five sons of Mattathias to survive and he ushered in an 80-year period of Jewish independence in Judea, as the Land of Israel was now called. The kingdom regained boundaries not far short of Solomon's realm and Jewish life flourished. The Hasmoneans claimed not only the throne of Judah, but also the post of High Priest. This assertion of religious authority conflicted with the tradition of the priests coming from the descendants of Moses' brother Aaron and the tribe of Levi. It did not take long for rival factions to develop and threaten the unity of the kingdom. Ultimately, internal divisions and the appearance of yet another imperial power were to put an end to Jewish independence in the Land of Israel for nearly two centuries.","output":"After Alexander, the Great died in 323 BCE, three of his generals fought over the Middle East. Antiochus III took full control in 198 BCE and brought Judea into his empire. Though initially granting Jews religious autonomy, he eventually tried to force Hellenism on the Jews. Jewish opposition forced him to back down, but his son Antiochus IV enforced the policy upon inheriting the throne in 176 BCE. He outlawed the Sabbath and circumcision and defiled the Temple by erecting an altar to Zeus where pigs were sacrificed, all things abhorrent to Jews. Antiochus' extremism united the people, until eventually a Greek official attempted to force a Jew named Matthias Hasmonean to make a sacrifice to a pagan god, and Matthias murdered the official instead. Antiochus retaliated, but the Jews fought back for liberation behind Mattathias and his five sons who became known as the Maccabees (the Hebrew word for “hammer”). Underestimating Jewish resolve and strength, Antiochus sent a small force to quelch the rebellion only to have them annihilated. He then took a powerful army into battle only to suffer the same result. The Maccabees recaptured Jerusalem in 164 BCE, an event retold on the holiday of Chanukah as its origin story. Two decades later the Maccabees forced the Greeks out of Judea and won their independence. During the next 80 years, Judea, regained most of the land that was once part of Solomon's realm and Jewish life flourished. In the end, internal strife and the rise of another empire ended Jewish independence for nearly two centuries."},{"instruction":"what was freddie mercury's real name?","output":"Freddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara on September 5th, 1946, in Stone Town in Zanzibar.

The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.[138] He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a \\"loose group\\", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide.[139] It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.[138] Double-amputee climber Mark Inglis said in an interview with the press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres (1,480 ft) below the summit, without attempting a rescue.[140] Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed \\"Green Boots\\",[141] but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman, Burçak Poçan). There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp.

Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from frostbite, preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.

The story has apparently grown beyond the scope of the mountaineering community as many have been interviewed by the media. Allegations and critiques have come from many sources. Have climbers in the 2006 season left a man to die when he still had a chance to be saved? Sources say that Sharp tried to climb the mountain by himself with no guides, and it's said he even brought fewer oxygen bottles than normal. His guide firm in Nepal was a low-budget service that provided him service as far as Base Camp, but after that point, they expect climbers to continue as a \\"loose group,\\" which allows for a great deal of independence. The manager told us that Sharp didn't have enough oxygen with him for his climb and chose not to have a Sherpa guide. The question is who knew that Sharp was in trouble? If they did know, were they even qualified or capable of helping him? One fellow climber, a double-amputee named Mark Inglis, claims that his party, along with several others, passed Sharp on their trek. He was reportedly sheltering beneath a rock overhang that was 450 metres below the summit, but none attempted a rescue. Inglis also said that 40 people had passed Sharp, but they might not have noticed him and instead thought he was the corpse nicknamed \\"Green Boots.\\" What Inglis didn't know was that a party of Turkish climbers did try to help Sharp, even though they were already helping an injured woman (Turkish Burçak Poçan). Himex has also been discussed in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. It's interesting to note that Inglis later revises his story, claiming that at the time he was first interviewed, he was \\"...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite--he later had five fingertips amputated.\\" A search of Sharp's possessions found a receipt for US7,490 which is thought to be his entire cost for the climb. Most expeditions cost between 35,000 and 100,000, not to mention an additional 20,000 in other expenses like gear and bonuses. It is believed that Sharp summited on 14 May before beginning his descent, but on 15 May he encountered trouble. At this point, he was being passed by other climbers, and it's believed that he was experiencing hypoxia at around 300 metres from the summit. Beck Weathers, who participated in the 1996 Mount Everest expedition that ended in disaster, claims that those who are dying tend to be left behind. Apparently, he had been left for dead himself on two separate occasions but had been able to keep walking and save himself. The Tribune of Chandigarh, India describes Sharp's predicament as \\"the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering.\\" Nine other climbers also died in 2006, including Sherpas working for guide firms. The Discovery Channel captures a lot of the controversy in their television program Everest: Beyond the Limit. One very important piece of Sharp's story is shown in the program when an early-returning climber named Maxim Chaya radioed his base camp manager (Russell Brice) to say that he had found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya couldn't identify Sharp because he had chosen to not identify himself to other climbers. Instead of sending help, the base camp manager assumed that Sharp was a member of a group that had already abandoned him. He told Chaya that he wouldn't be able to help Sharp on his own, so Chaya left him. Sharp's condition continued to worsen and his chances of rescue grew smaller as climbers continue to pass him in their descent. The frostbite was making his legs and feet curl, preventing him from walking, and later descending climbers were low on oxygen and strength themselves. As the day continued, time ran out for Sherpas to come back and rescue him. Sharp's body remained where it was, just below the summit on the Chinese side, next to \\"Green Boots.\\" They shared a small rock cave that also acted as their tomb. The BBC reports that Sharp's body was removed in 2007, and Green Boots has been missing since 2014, likely moved or buried."},{"instruction":"Henry Watson is dying in a car crash.

The crying turned into blending malts in the kitchen with the lid left off: there was his wife in the corner, long before cancer ravaged her body, her mighty laugh exploding at the eggs on the ceiling and the malt powder on his chequered shirt, her soft hand caressing his unshaven face. There were other moments, too: a blinding sunrise in Athens, a scowling man outside the shop where he purchased his coffee every morning for thirteen years, the white tail of a buck gamboling away yesterday as he lowered his Browning and didn't fire, a waterfall somewhere in upstate New York - roaring like his wife's mighty laugh, here again, too.

It’s the visual fantasy she had always dreamed of for her perfect wedding. Trying on no other, she selects and pays for the gown within an hour of arrival. Jason’s mother is astonished at her decisiveness. Providing delivery directions, they leave the shop relieved that the biggest task she needs to do is now complete. Examining herself in the mirror, she is glowing. The wows and ahs being delivered from her bridesmaids help to assure her that it was a well-made decision. The calm she has about marrying Jason confirms her decision to take this wonderful man as her husband. He spends the last night at his place. He has rented his house out, with tenants moving in next month. The furniture is still there, so he can stay the night with no problem. His belongings are already at Linda’s. He just needs to pack an overnight bag. He’d had his best man (his father) and friends over last night for a manly celebration while Linda’s friends surprised her with a bridal shower. With such short notice for their friends, everything has been kept small and intimate. As time ticks away, their vows loom near. The groomsmen pat Jason on the back and tell him they will see him at the wedding. Jason laughs. With much anticipation, his nerves are slightly edgy."},{"instruction":"How did the days of the week acquire their names?","output":"1.

This has filled the air with pollutants. Some of these pollutants react with other gases in the air. Do they form dangerous chemicals? Firstly, fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are formed from decaying matter, compressed underground thousands of years ago. A piece of coal is, therefore, not a harmless black stone, but it contains sulphur. As sulphur burns it changes to a gas called sulphur dioxide. When this fuel is burnt in the power station, gas escapes through the chimneys into the atmosphere and harms the quality of the air. It dissolves and falls as acid rain, which harms plants, kills small mammals and wears away concrete paths and statues. As a result of driving in a vehicle powered by petrol or diesel, we are not only gaining a carbon footprint but contributing to the pollution in the environment. When petrol and air enter a car engine, a chemical reaction takes place. Exhaust fumes are produced and these emissions contain harmful chemicals, including two called nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. If there are high levels of chemicals in the air we breathe, there will be an increase in chronic health issues, like asthma or chest infections. Therefore, we must take urgent steps to stop these pollutants from contaminating our world. One possible solution is that power stations use a process called lime (calcium oxide and water) to remove sulphur dioxide from the waste gases before they escape from the power station chimneys. Alternatively, people could consider purchasing an electric, hybrid or biodiesel car, which will be cleaner for the environment. It may be essential to use renewable resources, harnessing the power of the sun and the wind... wind farms, solar power, hydropower and geothermal energy to run our industry, power our appliances and heat our homes efficiently."},{"instruction":"Write a short story about the protagonist named Mark who observes a young couple on a train journey and notices that the young man appears to be tense and anxious.

When the train journey ends, Mark asks the young man to describe the scenery they passed so that he can tell his grandchild about it. The young man admits that he wasn't paying attention, but his wife describes the beautiful sights they saw. Mark advises the young man not to be so wrapped up in his problems that he misses the beauty around him.","output":"Sitting across the young couple on the train, Mark thought the young man looked so much like him. It wasn’t that they looked similar physically – the young man had dark features while Mark was always fair. No, it was the tension with which the young man carried himself – it was the sternness in his voice with which he addressed his wife. It was the worry that lined his face, and the stress that seemed to weigh his shoulders down. Throughout the train journey, Mark overheard the young man complaining and worrying about one thing or another. It started with worrying about their tickets, and then about whether the babysitter would take proper care of their child, and finally he grew anxious about whether their friends would remember to pick them up from the station. When the journey finally came to an end, Mark approached the young man before they disembarked. “Young man,” he started, “My eyesight is poor. Can you tell me what sceneries we passed by on our journey, so I might tell my grandchild?” The young man stopped, and then replied gingerly, “I wasn’t paying attention.” “I can tell you,” said the young man’s wife. “We passed by the city, with all its many shops and buildings. And then when we left the city, we crossed wide open plains lush with grass and spring flowers, with a lake in the distance. It was all really quite beautiful.” The young man looked dismayed for having missed such a sight. Mark understood and patted his shoulder. “If you’re always so wrapped up in your problems, you will never be able to see the beauty around you.

And in the months since the Dobbs decision, when voters have had a direct up-or-down yes-or-no on abortion rights, abortion rights have won. Just last month in Wisconsin, a tight and closely-watched state supreme court election was widely understood to be a referendum on abortion rights, and the pro-choice judge won by a stunning 11 points. And in Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and a mass of Democrats running for state legislature enjoyed historic wins, largely because of abortion rights, and Whitmer made good this month on a campaign promise and repealed the state’s archaic 1931 abortion ban. As Rebecca Traister wrote in a must-read New York magazine piece: Abortion wins elections. But here’s the problem: Republicans don’t care. After decades of saying that the question of abortion’s legality should be left to voters and the democratic process, the GOP is grabbing the issue away from their constituents. In Republican-led states, abortion bans are only expanding, even in direct opposition to popular opinion. Idaho became the first state in the nation to criminalize helping a minor obtain an abortion out of state. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban. (The six-week ban will take effect only if the state’s current 15-week ban is upheld by the state Supreme Court, pending an ongoing legal challenge.) The Tennessee legislature narrowly passed a bill that allows a tiny exception to the state’s harsh abortion ban, and permits doctors to perform abortions to save a pregnant woman’s life—but the passage was narrow because so many Tennessee Republicans didn’t want to allow for a clearer life exception.","output":"Abortion Rights and Voter Support: A Closer Look at the Current Political Landscape Almost a year following a Supreme Court decision that limited abortion rights in the United States, we can now observe the impact of these changes on the political scene. It is becoming evident that in places where voters have a voice, they overwhelmingly support abortion rights. Recent elections and referendum outcomes have demonstrated a clear majority in favor of preserving these rights. However, despite public sentiment, Republican-led states continue to pass restrictive abortion laws, disregarding popular opinion. Abortion Wins Elections: Recent events have shown that the topic of abortion plays a significant role in electoral outcomes. In a closely-watched state supreme court election in Wisconsin, the pro-choice judge secured victory by a remarkable 11-point margin. Likewise, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, along with numerous Democrats running for state legislature, achieved historic wins largely due to their support for abortion rights. As evidence of her commitment, Whitmer recently repealed Michigan's outdated abortion ban from 1931. Republican Disregard: Curiously, despite the strong support for abortion rights among voters, the Republican party appears indifferent to public opinion on this matter. Throughout the years, Republicans advocated for leaving the legality of abortion to voters and democratic processes. However, in a surprising turn, they are now seizing control of the issue and disregarding their constituents' preferences. This is evident in the expansion of abortion bans in Republican-led states, even when such bans directly contradict popular sentiment. Examples of Restrictive Abortion Laws: To illustrate this trend, consider the following recent developments: Idaho passed a law making it a criminal offense to help a minor obtain an abortion out of state, becoming the first state to do so. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban, which will only take effect if the state's current 15-week ban is upheld by the state Supreme Court. Tennessee's legislature narrowly approved a bill that allows for a limited exception to the state's stringent abortion ban, permitting doctors to perform abortions to save a pregnant woman's life. However, the passage was only achieved by a small margin, as many Tennessee Republicans were reluctant to include a clearer exception for life-threatening situations. Despite overwhelming voter support for abortion rights, Republican-led states continue to implement restrictive laws that curtail access to abortion. This disconnect between public sentiment and legislative action raises concerns about the extent to which politicians are truly representing the will of their constituents. The ongoing debate surrounding abortion rights highlights the importance of understanding and participating in the democratic process to ensure that the voices of citizens are heard and respected."},{"instruction":"I'm in Florida and want to grow some fruit that can be used in a bunch of different dishes.

Climate change ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ Megan Cimino and other scientists predict that in decades to come, Adélies could disappear from the western Antarctic Peninsula and nearby islands. “We’ve already seen one … Adélie colony that went extinct. A few of our other colonies on different islands are very close to extinction,” Cimino said. “We’ll see how long they sort of hold out.” But in other parts of Antarctica, like Ross Island, thousands of miles away from Palmer Station, researchers have seen Adélies thrive. Ross Island is closer to the pole and colder than the Antarctic Peninsula — too cold for the gentoo penguins. Here, Adélie populations have largely grown or remained stable over the last two decades, said Grant Ballard, chief science officer at Point Blue Conservation Science, a nonprofit research organization that advocates for conservation. Ballard describes himself as a “die-hard optimist” — and he thinks warming temperatures in Antarctica could create not just problems, but also new opportunities for penguins. “There’s going to be places where the ecosystem will thrive and … new life will be emerging,” Ballard said. Steven Emslie, a biology professor at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, has found ancient penguin mummies on a coastline near where Ballard does his research.

The day began routinely, a rush to work, slightly late from sleeping in. I’d opened the door and idly stepped on a glossy beetle that had come inside, no doubt seeking warmth from the misty night. The workday was an average, forgettable one full of monotonous meetings, and I was glad when it was finally over. The ride home was equally uneventful. As I pulled into the driveway though, I could see a wine-colored tower of five or six shiny beetles in the doorway, jockeying to get in. I brushed them away and closed the door behind me. “Finally home”, I thought. I was tired, and decided to cook something simple; a frozen pizza sounded nice. The pizza was delicious, and I dozed off on the couch, content and full. I wasn’t asleep for long though, when a persistent noise clawed through my dreams. *Scritch Scritch Scritch* I put the pillow over my head to block it out. *Scritch Scritch Scritch* It was probably a branch on a window, or the neighborhood cat wanting in. *Scritch Scritch Scritch* *Scritch Scritch Scritch* “Ugh”, I said, finally rolling over. I must have slept even longer than I had thought, as it was pitch black outside. I sat up and looked closer. I froze. Every window was covered by what must have been hundreds of swarming beetles, clawing for purchase. Not one beam of moonlight could make it through the teeming horde, which no doubt wanted revenge for their fallen comrade. *Scritch Scritch Scritch* I stumbled up and around the room groggily, looking for my phone. I needed to call for help before it was too late. The June bugs had never been an issue before; their life span was too short. But maybe this time, it would be me who was gone by the end of summer… More frantic now with that thought, I panickedly searched the room. I stopped when my eyes reached the small end table. Atop the clean white marble, like a warning or a promise, was a solitary glossy beetle wing."},{"instruction":"How much did the Percy Jackson books and movies make?","output":"The Percy Jackson books made more than the two movies based on the books.

This number is a serious decrease from the 40's, 50's, and 1960's when nearly half of people were marrying the person who they would classify as their first love. In fact, this idea of the first love can be seriously detrimental to marriages in jeopardy. Above anyone else, reconnected first loves have the highest rate of infidelity with one another when married to other people. Most brides in this day and age marry at the age of 26, five years older than the average age of brides in the 1970s. This means that to get to marriage, many couples would already have spent nearly a decade together. Now that women make up a significant percentage of the workforce, it's more likely for long-lasting couples to have met at work than in school. There is also a higher likelihood of couples who meet in the workplace having interests and social circles in common, both of which are factors leading to more successful outcomes in marriage. Another reason that high school sweethearts circle back to one another is the perceived comfort. There's something about the first love that is deeply comforting. It usually comes from a time in our lives when our parents were still caring for us but we had an element of freedom. Most of us didn't have financial responsibilities or work requirements that were onerous. We were able to focus on social bonds and experience the power of those bonds for the first time. After children and mortgages or costly rents weigh on us, it can be appealing to revert to that time in our lives when we were cared for and explored both the world around us and the people in it with a sense of safety."},{"instruction":"Please write a short story about a young man going home to see his sick granny.","output":"Frankly, Tane was hesitant to go home.

The door to Granny's room is open, and a stiff antisceptic smell is wafting out. There's Granny, asleep in bed. Her pale hands clutch a white handkerchief spotted with dirty red-brown blood. She looks so tiny, like a frail rag doll, not the powerful woman who had spent so many years of her life helping me. I sit quietly on the chair next to her and watch her ragged breathing. Slow, agonizing breaths - deep and labored. I don't remember what it is. They won't or can't tell me. Something that starts with a p, Granddad said. It doesn't matter. She's going to be taken away. Like a door shutting forever, never to be opened again. The room is close and quiet, and tears stream down my face. I rock and sob quietly, trying not to wake Granny.

ALK-positivity confers sensitivity to small-molecule ALK kinase inhibitors, such as crizotinib. The integration of crizotinib into standard treatment practice in NSCLC will rest on the widespread implementation of an effective screening system for newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC which is flexible enough to incorporate new targets as treatments are developed for them. Phase I and II studies of crizotinib in ALK-positive lung cancer have demonstrated significant activity and impressive clinical benefit, which led to its early approval by USFDA in 2011. Although crizotinib induces remissions and extends the lives of patients, there have been reports of emerging resistance to Crizotinib therapy. In this review, we discuss the history, mechanism of action, uses, adverse effects, dose modifications and future challenges and opportunities for patients with ALK-positive lung cancers. Keywords: ALK mutation, ALK inhibitors, ALK positive Non-small cell lung cancer, Crizotinib Overview of Clinical Trials The antitumor efficacy of crizotinib was initially demonstrated in two multicenter, single-arm studies.[23,24] Dosage for these extended series was 250 mg, orally, given twice a day, based on results from the initial phase I dose escalation study. In aggregate, these studies included 255 patients, all of whose tumors contained an ALK gene rearrangement, as shown by FISH. Overall, 95% of the patients had metastatic disease and 5% had locally advanced NSCLC. Overall, 94% of the patients had received prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease, and 76% had received two or more treatment regimens. The combined objective (complete plus partial) response rate was 55%, the majority of which was achieved during the first eight weeks of treatment. The median durations of response at the time of analysis of the two studies were 42 and 48 weeks, respectively [Table 1]. Table 1 Comparison of results of profile 1001 and profile 1005 trials An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is SAJC-2-91-g003.jpg Evidence of the impact of crizotinib on the survival of patients came from a non-randomized, retrospective analysis of the patients enrolled in the phase I study.[25] The one- and two-year survival rates for patients treated with crizotinib were 74 and 54%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 18 months. In a cohort of 36 patients with the ALK fusion oncogene, who were not treated with crizotinib, the survival rates at one- and two-years were 44 and 12%, respectively. A comparison with a larger cohort of patients with wild-type tumors did not identify a difference when compared with those with the ALK rearrangement not treated with crizotinib, suggesting that the presence of ALK rearrangement was not prognostically significant. Conclusions The presence of an ALK fusion oncogene defines a molecular subset of NSCLC with distinct clinical and pathological features. The patients most likely to harbor ALK rearrangement are relatively young, never or light smokers with adenocarcinoma. Whenever possible, therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC should be individualized, based on the molecular and histological features of the tumor. If feasible, patients should have the tumor tissue assessed for the presence of a somatic mutation in the EGFR, which confers sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to the ALK fusion oncogene, which is associated with sensitivity to crizotinib. Thus, crizotinib is an important unmet medical need. It is a straightforward, biology-based biomarker, predicting a high response rate in heavily pre-treated patients and is relatively non-toxic. It is a triumph for a targeted therapy in the era of oncogenic driver mutations.","output":"Crizotinib is a small-molecule anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor that can be used to induce remission in non-small-cell lung cancers or NSCLC when ALK mutations are present. In a non-randomized, retrospective analysis from a phase 1 study, crizotinib was found to improve one to two-year survival rates for patients from 44-12% to 74-54%. Crizotinib has been shown to be a relatively non-toxic biomarker that has accomplished successful targeted therapy for people with a somatic mutation of the EGFR who have sensitivity to the ALK fusion oncogene although it remains an unmet medical need. There have been reports of increased resistance to crizotinib which may require further research."},{"instruction":"What are some good job options for a person who likes to work independently?

Here are a few: 1. Pet sitter. Pet sitters spend most of their time supervising people's pets at their homes while the owners are away. This may include grooming and feeding the pets as well as taking them on walks and administering medications. 2. Sanitation worker. Sanitation workers operate machinery to collect trash along designated routes to maintain clean and sanitary communities. 3. Photographer. Photographers take photographs of people, places, and things for a variety of purposes. Many photographers work in marketing while others may do photoshoots for private events and celebrations. 4. Grocery shopper. A grocery shopper will go and buy food products and groceries according to a client's grocery list. They work independently while selecting the food products that have been chosen by the client. 5. Truck driver. Truck drivers spend most of their time transporting goods and services and completing deliveries. They may travel throughout the day and night to complete their designated route. Working independently can be a great option for a job if you find you work best alone as opposed to in a collaborative environment. These can be great options for a person that prefers working independently."},{"instruction":"Hi, please tell me what I can do while I am in Niagara Falls, NY.

Another consideration is whether to invest that money instead. Consider the interest cost that could be saved by paying off a mortgage ten years early compared to various investment returns earned by investing the money in the market. KEY TAKEAWAYS Whether paying off the mortgage early is a good choice can depend on your financial situation, the loan's interest rate, and how close you are to retirement. Paying off a mortgage has its benefits, but consider other factors such as the tax deductibility of mortgage interest and low loan rates. Investing the money instead may generate higher returns than the loan's interest cost, but markets also come with the risk of losses. How Paying Off a Home Affects Your Finances Mortgage payments are made up of two components: interest on the loan and a principal amount that pays down the total outstanding balance. A 1,500 monthly payment might pay 500 toward interest. The other 1,000 will reduce the principal loan balance. Interest rates on a mortgage loan can vary depending on the economy and the borrower's creditworthiness. A loan payment schedule over a 30-year period is referred to as an amortization schedule. The payments for a fixed-rate mortgage loan mostly go toward interest in the early years. A larger portion of the loan payment is applied toward reducing the principal in later years. Assume that you have a 30-year mortgage with a starting balance of 200,000 and a fixed interest rate of 3.5%. It would work out like this. Components of a Mortgage Payment Number Monthly Payment Principal Interest Loan Balance Remaining 1 898.09 314.76 583.33 199,685.24 109 (10 years) 898.09 431.10 499.99 159,679.65 229 (20 years) 898.09 611.45 286.64 97,665.59 301 (25 years) 898.09 754.10 143.99 48,613.86 360 (last payment) 898.09 895.48 2.61 0.00 Sample Loan Payment Schedule with Interest and Principal A larger portion of the fixed monthly payment goes toward paying interest during the first ten years, but the percentage of the monthly payment that goes toward interest versus principal reverses as time goes on. More than 611 went toward principal while 286.64 went toward interest after 20 years. All but 2.61 of the last monthly payment went toward paying the principal balance. The portion of the mortgage loan payment that's applied to principal and interest changes over the years because the loan balance is higher in the early years and smaller in the later years. You're paying interest on more of a balance in the early years. Less interest is owed as the monthly payments eventually reduce the outstanding loan. How much interest will you save? Some homeowners choose to pay off their mortgages early, and the benefits can vary depending on your financial circumstances. Retirees might want to reduce or eliminate their mortgage debts because they're no longer earning employment income. Let's assume that a borrower has received an inheritance of 120,000. There are ten years left on their mortgage. The original mortgage was 200,000 at a fixed interest rate over 30 years. This table shows what it would cost to pay off the loan ten years early and how much interest would be saved based on three loan rates: 3.5%, 4.5%, or 5.5%. Cost to Payoff Mortgage Ten Years Early and Interest Saved 10 Year Balance Remaining Interest Rate Total Interest Cost for 30 Years Interest Saved 97,665 3.5% 123,312 20,270 104,735 4.5% 164,813 28,411 111,657 5.5% 208,808 37,618 Balance Remaining in Ten Years at Various Interest Rates (200K Starting Balance) The higher the interest rate, the larger the amount remaining on the loan will be with ten years left on the mortgage. Save interest by paying off the loan The total interest cost for the 30-year loan would be 123,312 at the 3.5% interest rate. The borrower would save 20,270 by paying it off ten years early. Saving more than 20,000 in interest is significant, but the interest amount saved represents only 17% of the total interest cost for a 30-year loan: 103,042 in interest has already been paid in the loan's first 20 years (123,312 - 20,270), which accounts for 83% of the total interest over the life of the loan. How Investing Affects Your Finances It might be worth considering whether some or all of your money might be better off invested in the financial markets. The rate of return earned from investing might exceed the interest you'd pay on the mortgage over the final ten years of the loan. The \\"opportunity cost,\\" the foregone interest that could be earned in the market, should be considered. But many factors go into evaluating an investment, including the expected return and the risk associated with the investment. This table shows how much could be earned on 100,000 if the money was invested for ten years based on four average rates of return: 2%, 5%, 7%, and 10%. How Much 100,000 Can Potentially Earn in Ten Years Invested Amount Years Rate of Return Investment Gain 100,000 10 2% 22,019 100,000 10 5% 62,889 100,000 10 7% 96,715 100,000 10 10% 159,374 Investment Gains on 100,000 in Ten Years These investment gains were compounded. Interest was earned on the interest and no money was withdrawn during the ten-year period. Investment Gains vs. Loan Interest Saved A homeowner would earn 22,019 based on an average rate of return of 2% if they invested 100,000 rather than use the money to pay down their mortgage in ten years. There would be no material difference between investing the money versus paying off the 3.5% mortgage based on the 20,270 saved in interest from the earlier loan table. But the homeowner would earn 62,889 if the average rate of return was 5% for the ten years. This is more money than the interest saved in all three of the earlier loan scenarios whether the loan rate was 3.5% (20,270), 4.5% (28,411), or 5.5% (37,618). The borrower would earn more than double the interest saved from paying the loan off early, even with using the 5.5% loan rate, with a ten-year rate of return of 7% or 10%. Repaying their mortgage rather than investing the money not only saves the borrower the interest they would have paid on the mortgage, but it also frees up money that otherwise would have gone to monthly repayments. This money could also be invested with the same rate of return. Different investments come with different risks Each type of investment comes with its own risk. U.S. Treasury bonds would be considered low-risk investments because they're guaranteed by the U.S. government if they're held until their expiration date or maturity. 1 But equities or stock investments have a higher risk of price fluctuations, called volatility, and this can lead to losses. There's a risk that some or all your money could be lost if you decide to invest your money in the market instead of paying off your mortgage ten years early. You would still have to make ten years of loan payments as a result if the investment loses money. The stock market can provide sizable returns, but there's also a risk of sizable losses. Just as taking on more risk can magnify investment gains, it can also lead to more losses so the market risk is a double-edged sword. A 10% investment gain isn't an easy goal to achieve, particularly after factoring in fees, taxes, and inflation. 2 Investors should have realistic expectations as to what they can earn in the market.","output":"The TLDR bottom-line pros and cons of investing vs. paying off a 30-year mortgage are as follows: Paying off mortgage: Pros: 1. Risk is reduced by reducing the mortgage balance and interest payments. 2. Potential savings due to reducing the amount of money that would have been spent paying interest. Cons: 1. Tax loss from reduced tax benefits as anticipated. 2. Opportunity loss, as the overall additional payment of the mortgage may prove to be less profitable than additional earnings from the investment. Investing in the stock market: Pros: 1. Higher potential returns from the stock market (potentially 10% or more per year) compared to homes (which typically appreciate at 2-4% per year). 2. Investment in a portfolio is more diverse and less volatile compared to investment in one fixed asset (the home) Cons: 1. Money invested in the stock market is subject to loss, which could be catastrophic, especially if one is planning to retire soon. 2. Market growth is not as guaranteed, whereas a paid-off home will always be a paid-off home. There are many factors to consider for the best decision, such as how soon one will retire, the existing amount of remaining mortgage, the interest rates, the tolerance for risk, and the overall returns in the market. It is best to make an informed decision and decide what's right for you."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this article for 7 ingredients of a healthy relationship like a recipe instead. Verified by Psychology Today Ralph Ryback M.D. Ralph Ryback M.D. The Truisms of Wellness The 7 Ingredients of a Healthy Relationship The toxic relationships series comes to a close with this recipe for happiness. Posted December 5, 2016 Share on FacebookShare Share on TwitterTweet Share on LinkedInShare Share via EmailEmail Dmytro Zinkevych/Shutterstock Source: Dmytro Zinkevych/Shutterstock Contributed by Kristen Fuller, M.D., Sovereign Health This series of posts has focused on recognizing toxic traits in a relationship and navigating through the feelings that can result. We conclude by providing the ingredients that constitute a recipe for a happy, healthy relationship. Every relationship has different interactional conflicts and needs. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions. These ingredients are only part of one recipe. Recognize that it could take many more than these seven to build a healthy relationship—perhaps you have ingredients of your own that you would like to share. 1. Owning your own happiness. “I will be happy when...” is a common phrase many of us can complete with that one thing we're sure would secure our eternal bliss. But our happiness does not depend on anything external, because happiness is a choice we can make. The science of positive psychology has discovered that, as humans, we need a few basic necessities to be happy, including food, shelter, warm clothing, and other such items. Once we have these, the rest of our happiness is completely up to us. A romantic partner or a good friend may add pleasure to our life but only we can find our own happiness—and two independently happy people create a harmonious environment. 2. Honesty and transparency. Sharing thoughts and feelings honestly through direct, face-to-face interactions can prevent unnecessary ill feelings. Keeping in mind the other person’s feelings, and communicating those feelings, can help to bridge any communication gaps. Even the happiest and healthiest people become upset at times, so being transparent with our emotions and words also prevents misunderstandings that can escalate into arguments. 3. Compromise. Life is all about balance, and relationships should be too. It can be difficult to maintain a balanced relationship all the time. One person may need more attention while going through a tough time, or perhaps one is working extremely long hours leaving the other to pick up the slack. At times, relationships can be 80/20 or 70/30, and you may feel like you are doing most of the work, but that is OK for a time, as long as the relationship has a healthy balance overall. Learning to compromise to alleviate your partner’s stress brings positivity to any relationship. 4. Taking time for self-care. Shared interests are important, but it is also vital that individuals take time to themselves and partake in their favorite activities to de-stress and recharge. Take one day a week, or one hour a day, to do your favorite activity by yourself, or maybe just take time to reflect and collect your thoughts. Maintaining your individual sense of self is often difficult in a relationship, but it's incredibly important. 5. Agreeing to disagree. Many people try to avoid conflict, but it is important to share different opinions. The ability to have controversial conversations with loved ones in a diplomatic way is a positive trait, but sometimes you might have to agree to disagree to avoid conflict. Two individuals in a relationship are never going to agree on everything. Respect yourself and your partner’s feelings, and agree that having a difference of opinion is OK; after all, different opinions and views are what make each individual unique. Most arguments in relationships are about superficial issues which cover and obscure the true “elephant in the room.” Take the time to find and discuss that elephant with a willing partner. 6. Practicing kindness. This may be the most obvious key to a happy relationship, and yet we often become so consumed in our own lives that we forget to slow down and be kind to our partners, even in times of stress and despair. Putting the relationship first, before your needs, can really help put things into perspective. To avoid saying or doing something you’ll later regret, always be kind. 7. Protecting your boundaries. Outside strains can enter into a relationship and result in stress and hardship. Whether it’s your in-laws, an ex, your parents, or others raising the tension, your relationship with your loved one is what is important. Sometimes it is better to establish healthy boundaries and not let these outside forces dictate your thoughts and feelings. Instead, stay focused on the two people in the relationship. As we end this series and navigate our way through the holidays, perhaps we can reflect on the past year. If we endured any form of toxicity, hopefully we can recognize the signs, and gain the tools and wisdom we need to learn from the past and pave the way for a brighter, healthier future. After all, everyone is deserving of love and happiness.","output":"Healthy Relationship recipe Ingredients : 1 cup of happiness 1 cup of honesty and transparency 1 cup of compromise 1 cup of self-care 1 cup of agreeing to disagree 1 cup kindness 1 cup of healthy boundaries Start with knowing that your happiness is up to you and it is yours to own. Loved ones, friends, and even a partner can enhance happiness but two independently happy people are the best combination. Next, make sure you are transparent and honest about your feelings so that there is no room for miscommunication. Mix in a heaping cup of compromise to create a healthy balance between yourself and your partner, so that one person doesn't carry all the weight or stress. Melt in a cup of self-care to make sure that you both have time to engage in the interests and hobbies that you both are passionate about individually. At this time, start preheating the oven and prepare to agree to disagree. It is important to agree to disagree and share different opinions, as two people will not always agree with one another. Be sure to add this very special ingredient, kindness. Without it, this recipe would not taste as sweet. Be kind to each other, even in times of stress or despair. Finally, make sure to establish healthy boundaries with people that can be an outside strain; an ex, in-laws, or even parents. Don't allow outside forces to dictate your thoughts and feelings and focus on the two people in the relationship. Voila! You have yourself a happy and healthy relationship!"},{"instruction":"Can you write a Java function that checks whether or not an array of numbers contains any duplicate numbers and explain it?","output":"The function below named \\"containsDuplicate\\" will perform the requested operation. public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) { HashSet<Integer> hm = new HashSet(); for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { if(!hm.contains(nums[i])){ hm.add(nums[i]); } else { return true; } } return false; } To begin, the function 'containsDuplicate' takes in an integer array called \\"nums\\". In the function, a HashSet is created, this HashSet will serve as a storage container for numbers that it does not contain already. So, we have a for loop that will iterate through the length of an array, up until the very end of the array. For every number it encounters in the array, the if statement will do a check to see if the HashSet already contains that number. If not, then the number will get added to the HashSet. Once added, the for loop will increment and move on to the next number in the array. If the for loop ends without encountering a number that already exists in the HashSet, then the function return 'false', and consequentially no duplicates were found. If however, the array contains a number that already exists in the HashSet, then the function will exit early and return 'true'."},{"instruction":"Write the text of an email to the head of a preschool giving them information about the kids books I sell and asking if they want me to come to their school. Here are the details: I go to schools and set up a table to sell kids books (mostly books for 3 year olds and up, picture books) to parents when they drop off their kids or when they pick them up. Used to do it as a side business, but my job changed and now just sell kids books because I love books (include that I am an English teacher and have a 6 year old who reads a lot) and think that reading is important for kids and books should be more accessible. I buy them cheap and keep prices cheap (3-10, average 5). All books are in good condition, some new. Teacher discount of 20%. It should be 200-300 words (preferably closer to 250).

I sell children’s books – mainly picture books for ages 3+. I used to do this as a part-time job but now do it primarily because I love books and believe so much in the importance of stories and reading for kids. I’m an English teacher with a six-year-old son, and, being in education and seeing the influence that books have had on him and his growth, feel very strongly that reading should be much more accessible to children and families. I buy them as cheaply as possible so that I can keep costs very reasonable (3-10 with the average price of a picture book being 5). All books are in very good condition (some gently used and some new). Due to a recent job change, I don’t do this as much as I used to but, this year, during August, I’ll be going around to pre-schools that are interested and setting up my book table during either drop-off or pick-up for parents and families to buy. I also give a 20% discount to teachers. If you would be interested in offering this to your parents and families (and teachers!), let me know, and I can send you the specific dates I have available.

Make the review highly negative and from the perspective of a food critic.","output":"This weekend I visited Rusty Rat's Pizza, and it was possibly the most horrid food experience I have ever had in my lifetime. Allow me to share my experience with you so that you don't have to undergo the same troubles as me. I walked into the establishment at around 2:00 PM, and the first thing I was met with was the unnatural smell. I could only assume that there were dead rats in every corner of the place because that is how it smelled. I tried to get over it, but I could not bear it; I asked for a table outside. Outside, there were two dirty tables; there was a crushed napkin on mine. I sat down and ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and a side of macaroni and cheese. It seemed as if they completely forgot about my order, because I was one of three customers in the entire establishment and my order did not arrive for twenty-five minutes. When my order did arrive, the server simply set down my food and walked away, there was no apology for the wait, and there was no asking if I needed anything. I did in fact need something, they had not given me any utensils, but as I looked at the macaroni, I accepted that I would not be eating it at all. It appeared to be congealed into one blob, and the bowl was cold to the touch. They must have gotten it straight from the fridge, and they did not even bother stirring it around. I looked over at the sad slice of pizza that they presented me; there was a visible puddle of grease on the plate, and it emitted a foul smell. The cheese looked as if it had gone moldy. I gagged and immediately pushed my plate away from me. I walked back inside the restaurant and tried to get someone's attention, but they persistently ignored me. I soon gave up; they never gave me the check, so why would I even attempt to get a refund? I drove home that afternoon and made my own meal. My final thoughts on Rusty Rat's Pizza are that It is probably going to go out of business soon. I would rate the establishment 0 out of 5 stars."},{"instruction":"I would like some suggestions of places to go on vacation this summer.

It was always there at this time of year. Mild and pleasant and never overpowering, the occupant of that second-floor room hardly noticed it anymore. Wyatt listened to his mother's footsteps recede down the hall. Her leather-soled slippers scraped ever so slightly on the wood floor as she made her way to the stairs. He counted as she went down the fifteen steps to the first floor. There was a gentle tap of leather on wood for each and a soft thud when she reached the bottom. Once she turned towards the kitchen he heard no more. The moon had passed to the far side of the house and only dim light came through the windows. A streetlight down the road gave off a glow that betrayed the quiet presence of the neighborhood and a few cast-off stars lingered after their constellations had departed for the evening. Wyatt fingered the hem of this blanket between his thumbs and forefingers as he focused on a single point on the ceiling. There was a worn spot in the texture of the eggshell finish just to the left of the light fixture. His father had bumped his head there a few times while changing a bulb or cleaning out the flies that always seemed to show up there, and each time he came away with a few crumbled pieces of ceiling paint stuck in his jet-black hair.

Hissing geysers, bubbling mud pots, and steaming hot springs betray the forces that formed this staggering landscape millions of years ago. Waterfalls gush down steep ravines, and glittering lakes and rivers stretch for miles. The highlights of Yellowstone National Park include the famous Old Faithful geyser, Yellowstone Lake, and the jaw-dropping cascades of Lower Falls. You can drive through the park, but the huge network of hiking trails is the best way to appreciate the park's diverse ecosystems. It's easy to extend a wilderness experience by staying in one of the park's scenic campgrounds. 2. Jackson is also the gateway to beautiful Grand Teton National Park and a popular stop on the way to Yellowstone. Bordering town, the National Elk Refuge protects the largest herd of wintering elk in the world. In season, you can ride horse-drawn sleighs into the refuge to view these gentle creatures up close. Camouflaged in a rocky hillside just south of town, the National Museum of Wildlife Art is another top attraction, with more than 4,000 paintings and many rotating exhibits. 3. The Cody Firearms Museum contains a large collection of firearms from around the world. Wyoming wildlife and geology are the main themes of the Draper Museum of Natural History, and you can learn about the culture of the prairies' first inhabitants at the Plains Indian Museum through exhibits and a multimedia show. 4. Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming, offers a host of rewarding things to do in southern Wyoming. Named after the Cheyenne Indians, it was once the largest outpost of the United States Cavalry. Today, the town's museums and historic sites tell the story of Cheyenne's beginnings in 1867 as a station on the Union Pacific Railroad. One of the town's top attractions is the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. Held annually since 1919, the late-July rodeo, featuring 10 days of fun-filled festivities, is one of the best in the country.

Its 2.25 million acres encompass seven of the largest glaciers in the Lower 48 states; lush meadows dappled with wildflowers; glacier-carved valleys; snowcapped peaks; and thousands of sparkling trout-filled waterways, including the headwater for the Green River.

Evidence of giants has been found in many places, including Ecuador, Dover Mound in Kentucky, New York, South Africa, Death Valley, Lovelock Cave in Nevada, and Wisconsin. Considering how vast these locations are, we can assume that there was a large group of giants that lived, or live, on most habitable continents. The Smithsonian Institute has been exerting extreme effort to cover up any evidence of giants that comes up. In 2015, The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the general public when they forced the Smithsonian Institute to admit that they had been destroying evidence of giants since at least the early 1900s. Whistleblowers from the American Institute of Alternative Archaeology have also come forward to present evidence that the Smithsonian has destroyed tens of thousands of bones that are as large as 12 feet tall. Mainstream archaeologists want this issue covered up. They do not want to admit that their research of the history of humankind may be wrong, but the evidence is against them.

Hydrogen can form covalent bonds with electron-loving atoms like nitrogen, fluorine and oxygen. In a covalent bond between hydrogen and oxygen (for example in water molecules), the electron-loving Oxygen has a greater attraction to the electrons in the bond and this gives it a negative charge. Hydrogen is thus left with a positive charge. This separation of charge in a hydrogen bond makes it polar. The presence of hydrogen bonds in a water molecule is important because it makes water cohesive and sticks together and forms drops. Hydrogen bonds also make water molecules adhesive and they stick incredibly well to other surfaces."},{"instruction":"I'm nervous about my test tomorrow.","output":"Don't be nervous.

This type of free Internet access by kids who are really not old enough to be good decision-makers has led to greater, more frequent cyberbullying. The victims don’t share much in common except that they are somehow different than their mainstream counterparts. Maybe one student has large ears, or another boy is too effeminate. It’s often hard for professionals to say why one child bullies or is bullied by others. But one thing is true: the Internet makes this crime much easier than in the past. Students often bully now using digital mediums like computers and phones. This crime can occur in many ways, including: • Forum posts • Ugly photos • Harassing comments • Negative texts • Angry chats The bottom line is that these actions cause emotional harm to kids who aren’t guilty of any crime. Victims might hold their feelings in for years before telling anyone that they were bullied. It’s a crime that often bestows shame on its victims. They somehow feel guilty, like they were in part to blame for the bullying or cyberbullying."},{"instruction":"Compose Spoken Poetry about the Land where the Philippines is located based on this explanation.

Turtles don't need a lot of attention, or expensive training classes like many other pets. What turtles do need is a proper diet. In this article, I'll tell you what you need to know about feeding your pet turtle. Turtles are omnivores, which means they eat plant and animal matter. You can feed your pet turtle pellets, cooked meats (like chicken or turkey), leafy greens (like collards), fruits (like apples and bananas) or even live insects (like crickets). However, some foods are bad for your turtle, like chives and spinach. It's best to do your research when you're deciding whether or not to add a certain food to your turtle's diet. Turtles need to be fed more often when they're young. Juvenile turtles need to eat around twice a day. Adult turtles are usually fine with eating just once every day, or even once every other day depending on the species. When you feed your turtle, leave the food there for about 20 minutes, then take it away. That's generally enough time for turtles to eat what they need. Remember that different species of turtles can have different feeding needs, so research you're turtle before deciding on a specific feeding plan."},{"instruction":"Take these words and tell me what their overall tone is.

Write a summary that eliminates the extra information and focuses on the main events in his life. Italian Trader at the Court of Kublai Khan At the height of the Mongol Empire, Marco Polo served Emperor Kublai Khan in China and returned to Venice to write an account of his experiences that would give Europeans some of their earliest information about China. Background In the 13th century, people who lived in Venice, Italy, believed that the Sun revolved around the Earth and that creation occurred exactly 4,484 years before Rome was founded. As Christians, they considered Jerusalem, the place of Jesus’s crucifixion, to be the so-called navel of the world, and their maps portrayed this. Marco Polo was born in Venice, or possibly Croatia, in 1254. Located on the eastern coast of Italy, Venice served as a gateway to the riches of Asia during this era of increasing trade. Goods flowed like water through the city. Ships from around the eastern Mediterranean docked at its port. Merchants and traders set sail from Venice for Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the Black Sea to fetch goods from Russia and from merchants who traveled the Silk Roads, a system of trading routes to and from China that crossed the mountains and deserts of Central Asia. At the time of Marco’s birth, his father, Niccolo, and two uncles, all merchants, were away trading. Supposedly they were visiting cities on the Black Sea, but their adventures had actually taken them all the way to the Mongol capital of China, Khanbaliq (city of the Khan). There they had an audience with the most powerful ruler of the day, Kublai Khan, grandson of the founding emperor, Genghis Khan. When the three Polo men returned to Venice after an absence of 16 years, Niccolo found that his wife had died and that he had a 15-year-old son, Marco, whom he did not know existed. Travels Two years later, in 1271, Niccolo Polo and his brother, Maffeo, set off again, taking the 17-year-old Marco with them. This time they aimed directly for the court of Kublai Khan, to bring him documents from the pope and holy oil from Jerusalem that he had requested. Even with a gold passport from Kublai Khan, which enabled the travelers to use lodgings and horses posted by the Mongols along the Silk Road routes, they took three and a half years to arrive. Upon reaching the summer palace of Kublai Khan in 1275, Niccolo presented his son and offered him in service to the emperor. A talented young man, Marco had learned several languages along the way, including Mongolian (though not Chinese), and had mastered four written alphabets. Two years before Marco’s arrival, Kublai Khan had completed the conquest of all parts of China and needed non-Mongol administrators in areas that resisted having Mongol authorities. Marco took on various sorts of diplomatic and administrative roles for the emperor from his base in Dadu, which Kublai Khan built next to Khanbaliq. Both Dadu and Khanbaliq stood at what is now Beijing. After more than 16 years in China, the Polos begged permission from Kublai Khan to return home to Venice. Apparently they had proved so useful to the khan that he did not want them to leave. Finally, he agreed for them to escort a Mongolian princess, Cogatin, to become the bride of a Persian khan; thus they headed back west. This time they traveled by sea in Chinese ships and, after many difficulties, succeeded in delivering the princess. Before they could reach Venice, however, Kublai Khan died on February 18, 1294, which allowed local rulers to reassert themselves and demand payment from traders. Consequently, the Polos were forced to hand over 4,000 Byzantine coins, a significant portion of their fortune, to the local government of a city on the Black Sea. Return The Polos returned to Venice in 1295, having been away 24 years. Their enthusiastic biographer told stories, which may have been gossip, that when they returned they were wearing Mongolian clothing and could hardly remember their native language. Their relatives had thought them long dead. But when they produced a small fortune in gems (rubies, sapphires, garnets, diamonds, and emeralds), which had been sewn into the hems of their Mongolian garments, they were warmly welcomed. Soon Venice was at war with its rival city-state, Genoa, on the west coast of Italy. As was custom for a wealthy merchant, Marco Polo financed his own war galley. He was captured during a naval battle and ended up in prison in Genoa. By chance, one of his cellmates, Rusticello from Pisa, had experience writing romantic novels. As Polo entertained everyone with his tales of traveling to China, Rusticello wrote them down in a French dialect. This is how Polo’s accounts, Europe’s primary source of information about China until the 19th century, came into existence. In 1299 Genoa and Venice declared peace; Polo was released and returned to Venice to marry Donata Badoer. The couple had three daughters in quick succession. He spent his remaining days as a businessman, working from home. He died there at almost 70 years of age, on January 8, 1324, and was buried under the church of San Lorenzo, though his tomb has now vanished.","output":"Marco Polo, who lived in Venice, a major trading center was born into a family of trading merchants in 1254. His father, who had been seeking trade in the East, did not know Marco until he was 15. In 1271, his father left once more, taking Marco along to visit the court of Kublai Khan. They reached their destination in 1275. Because Marco spoke many languages, including Mongolian, and Kublai Khan needed Mongolian-speaking administrators for the newly conquered region, Marco served Khan in administrative and diplomatic roles. Appointed to escort a princess to Persia, the Polos returned to Venice after more than 24 years away bringing along a small fortune. Marco Polo, who took part in a war between Venice and Genoa was captured and ended up in prison where he met Rusticello who wrote novels. Rusticello wrote of Marco’s adventures which is how Polo’s accounts became Europe’s primary source of information about China until the 19th century. Upon his release in 1299, he returned home, married, raised a family, and worked as a businessman until he died in 1324."},{"instruction":"Write a plot summary of a post apocalyptic pirate adventure story.

Hurricanes and tsunamis had become commonplace after the asteroid touched down in the heart of the Pacific two years later. The human race had to adapt fast. Most never had the chance, but those that did manage to build a few key cities on the water across the globe. What were once large hills and small mountains had now become island refugees used to care for and breed the few livestock that had managed to survive. Our protagonist Agnes lives as a goat herder in one of these refuges but is forced to give up her stable lifestyle when the boat she is in is washed out to sea. On the brink of death, she is captured by pirates who nurse her back to health. Agnes, though at first meek and unsure of herself, begins to blossom into a fine young pirate. She is intelligent and surprisingly cunning. She helps the crew grow in popularity with the common folk of the floating cities and increase their effectiveness as a crew, winning over the captain in the process. But she has a decision to make when she receives word that her island home is under constant attack from other pirates and vagrants that want to claim the terra-firma of her kin. The captain agrees to buy her a small ship and put together a crew so that she can sail home to help her family as long as she continues to sail under his banner.

You can use this: Flat sheets form a protective layer between yourself and your comforter or duvet, preventing body oils or dirt from transferring to your top layer. But the need for flat sheets is a debated subject — nearly 6 in 10 Americans think flat sheets are essential, while others opt out of flat sheets altogether. Whether you’re team flat sheet or not, you can’t deny that finding the right material can make all the difference. Whether you prefer breathable percale sheets or irresistibly soft sateen sheets, using the right sheets can help you sleep like a baby. How to Use a Flat Sheet Lay the flat sheet across your bed in the same orientation as your bedding. Center the flat sheet on your bed, making sure there’s enough of the sheet to fold under on the sides and end of the bed. Check that the top edge of your top sheet is aligned with the top of your mattress. Fold the bottom of your top sheet underneath your bedding. Do hospital corners with the sides of your flat sheet (see instructions below). How to Do Hospital Corners Hospital corners are a type of flat sheet fold that makes your bedding look crisp and neat. Here’s how to fold them perfectly. Fold the end of the top sheet under the end of your mattress — the sides should still be hanging loose. Grab a piece of the top sheet one to two feet away from the end of the bed. Lift this piece up at a 45-degree angle from the corner of the mattress. Lay this piece on top of your mattress, it should make a triangular shape at the foot of your bed. Hold this piece in place, and tuck the excess sheet under your mattress. Try to make sure the excess sheet is tucked neatly, rather than crammed underneath for best results. Let the triangle-shaped section down and tuck any edges that hang below your bed underneath the mattress. 4 step illustration of how to do hospital corners","output":"Flat sheets, or the sheet between the duvet or comforter and the fitted sheet, form a protective layer between you and the duvet.

Make it understandable for a first grader. Make sure to point out the four parts of the Gospel story: Creation, the Fall, Redemption, and Restoration. Explain that for the first half of this year, we’ll be learning more about the Gospel, as well as how to share it. Using a whiteboard or poster board, show the students the Gospel Key Passages in order, and explain that each passage addresses one of these four aspects. The fifth Key Passage, the Great Commission, tells us how important it is to share the gospel with others. In order to understand the Gospel, we have to first understand who God is. There are so many things we could talk about, but tonight the children will be learning about God being the Creator. Review the memory verse that they learned in Small Groups: Genesis 1:1, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” The rest of the passage describes how God created everything just by speaking it into existence. Go through the seven days of Creation. Ask the students if they can imagine God speaking and creating the oceans, mountains, plants, animals, sun, stars, etc. Not only that, but because He created everything, God is in control of everything. He’s in charge, and He knows how the world is supposed to work. When He created everything, He said that it was good. Once God had created everything else in the world, He made Adam and Eve. He created Adam by using dirt and breathing life into him, and he created Eve by taking one of Adam’s ribs. They were special, because God created them in His image. What does that mean? (Allow children to answer) Explain that God created us to reflect His own qualities, like love, kindness, creativity, forgiveness, etc. After God had created man, He called his creation very good. Because God created people, He knows what’s best for us. He’s not being mean when He wants us to do things that don’t sound fun, or doesn’t want us to do things that do sound fun. He just wants us to live the way we were created to live, because that’s how we work best.","output":"The four parts of the Gospel are Creation, The Fall, Redemption, and Restoration, and several key passages will be used to show these parts.

Break down elements of the crust, toppings, and style of slice cut.","output":"In Chicago, tavern-style pizza originated as a way for the city's workers to have a little bite with their post-shift beer. Let's dig into what makes Chicago's tavern-style pie so delicious: - Crust: The crust of a tavern-style pizza is inarguably its defining characteristic. Thin and crispy, it has a slightly thicker and sturdier base than a traditional thin-crust pizza. This comes from the dough being pre-stretched and rolled out before being topped and baked. The end product is often referred to as a \\"cracker-like\\" crust due to its crispy texture. It's not uncommon to see a crust that crumbs and flakes like a saltine! - Shape and Size: Tavern-style pizza is typically baked in a round shape, cut into small square pieces. These are commonly known as \\"party-cut\\" or \\"tavern-cut\\" slices. - Cheese: Unlike traditional thin-crust pizza, tavern-style pizza usually features a layer of cheese extending to the edge of the crust. The cheese is typically a combination of low-moisture mozzarella and cheddar, which melts and caramelizes, creating a slightly crispy and flavorful cheese edge. Combine that with the crispiness of the thin crust underneath, and it's easy to understand why some folks sprint to the corner pieces. - Toppings: Tavern-style pizza often features traditional toppings such as Italian sausage, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. However, the toppings are usually applied generously and heartily, creating a more substantial pizza compared to some other thin crust styles. It can make those center square pieces feel much heavier as well! - Baking Method: It's common to see old-school electric or gas ovens. Remember that tavern-style pizza is traditionally made in—you guessed it—taverns! You're not likely to find imported Italian ovens here! There's nothing like a hot slice of tavern-style pizza, ideally with an icy beer on the side. We hope this guide helps you know exactly what to look for when you try it and what makes it so special."},{"instruction":"Categorize this scientific research abstract into one of the following fields: biology, physics, psychology, or computer science. Support your choice. Abstract: Human beings can be proactive and engaged or, alternatively, passive and alienated, largely as a function of the social conditions in which they develop and function. Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theory has focused on the social–contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs—competence, autonomy, and relatedness—which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being.

Garage sales were always a great way to pick up quality and sometimes even hard-to-find items for relatively cheap. Scanning the items, nothing stood out to her as most items were the usual clothes, toys, some electronics here and here, and some accessories. Mary went around picking out a few things that she liked, a t-shirt, a watch for her boyfriend, and some books since she was an avid reader. Mary spoke with the owner of the house and asked if they'd be putting out any other things or if what was out in the yard is all there was going to be. The owner seemed quite fond of Mary, so she told her she does have an extra item that she hadn't put out yet. She brings out an old dusty pocket watch that could have been dated to the early 19th century. The lady came back out and told Mary she'd give it to her for a few bucks. Surprised, Mary asked if the lady was sure about doing that, to which she nodded yes. Mary added the pocket watch to her bag and went back home for the day. Mary, curious about the item, took it to a local pawn shop that specialized in antiques and watches. The owner examined the old pocket watch and noticed some words hastily etched into the back of the watch \\"This watch is cursed\\" upon reading these words, the pawn shop owner immediately hands the watch back to Mary and tells her to get out. Curious about the reaction, Mary would go back to the lady's house who sold her the watch and demanded to know what is wrong with it. The lady looked Mary in the eyes and told her that ever since she had that watch, only bad things would happen to her. Things around her house would randomly fall and break, doors would open and close without reason, and footsteps could be heard going up and down the stairs on a nightly basis. Mary demanded she take the watch back and that she no longer had any use for it, but the lady declined and told her it would follow her until it finds a new owner."},{"instruction":"1.

Dr. Dituri also intends to investigate if breathing in oxygen in such settings can help heal brain trauma.

Additionally, 40 lucky schoolchildren and their guardians will be invited for overnight stays at the underwater lodge.

The once thriving community had been beset with years of hardship under the plague, with the loss of so many rendering them unable to bring in the food to sustain the village. Those not lost to the plague were being driven out due to starvation, grief, and fear. Fortunately, the traveling apothecary Johannes Fleischer heard about the plight of the villagers and went to their village to save them. He brought with him his cart of exotic remedies and the expertise to apply them and sought to find a cure for the deadly disease. This was challenging at first. For months after his arrival, Johannes struggled to make headway in treating the sickness. He quickly ruled out his more common and simple solutions and was forced to experiment with more radical and untested treatments. Several lives were lost during this time, and it weighed heavily on the doctor’s heart. But, eventually, he found a way to treat the disease that worked more often than it failed. This discovery reinvigorated the resolve of the villagers, as well as Johannes himself. With the breakthrough, the doctor managed to bring the plague under control within a month, and within three, it was completely eradicated from the village. To this day, travelers can find in the heart of the village a statue raised in honor of Doctor Johannes Fleischer, whose memory is held strongly in the hearts of the people there even now."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this rhyme using more modern terms.

The doctor is a suspect because he should have been able to save the victim's life but failed to do so. He wears a black suit under a white doctor's jacket and carries a medical bag. 3. Dewey Cheatem, Esquire - A lawyer. Dewey is a suspect because he was hired to represent the victim in a lawsuit that he was likely to lose, which would have done irreparable damage to his law career. Dewey wears a pin-striped 3-piece suit with glasses and carries a leather briefcase. 4. Jarvis Jeeves - A butler.

Dottie Mae Lister - Dottie was employed as the victim's personal secretary up until the event of his death. She is a suspect because she knew all of his secrets, many of which conflicted with her personal ethics. She wears a simple tweed dress suit with glasses and mary jane shoes. 3. Vivian Valentino - A burgeoning Hollywood starlet. Vivian is a suspect because she was formerly romantically involved with the victim and their affair ended badly. She wears a satin gown with gaudy diamond jewelry and a fur coat. 4. Pamela Pennyworth - A telephone operator. Pamela is a suspect because she was engaged to the victim at the time of his death, it was plain that their relationship was a financial arrangement rather than true love, and the victim suspected her of carrying on an affair with her high school sweetheart.

Groom regularly - while cats groom themselves and are known for being clean, it is good to give them some extra help as it can help with their overall health and hygiene. No matter the hair length of the cat, they all can benefit from it. Having a routine for grooming the cat will help prevent shedding and hairballs. 2. Always provide fresh water - this is essential to the cat's health. Ensuring they have fresh water all the time will help prevent health issues common in cats, such as kidney disease and urinary tract infections. One thing to keep note of is that cats can be picky about the water they drink. If you notice this, then it may be beneficial to invest in the water fountain, as some cats prefer moving water. 3. Proper place to potty - it may be beneficial to have more than one litter box in some situations, especially if you have more than one cat. This allows your cat to have options if they don't feel like using one letterbox for a particular reason. You also want to ensure that the litter box's placed in an area that is easily accessible for the cat and comfortable. 4. Consistently clean the litter box - continuing on the topic of litter boxes, it's very important to always make sure that the litter box is maintained and clean. If it gets to the point where it's too full or dirty for the cat, they may find other areas to relieve themselves, such as the carpet or different items such as pillows or clothing. It's good practice to clean out the litter box daily and do a full cleaning of the box at least weekly. 5. Scratching-post training - it is common, natural, and even considered healthy behavior for cats to scratch. The downside of this is that they may use our home decor as a means to satisfy the urge to scratch. The main reason the cat needs to scratch as it is a means for them to remove old layers from their claws. It may take some time to get them used to a scratching post, but it's well worth the time and effort."},{"instruction":"Give a short answer on why the sky is blue.","output":"Sunlight is scattered in every direction after it enters the Earth's atmosphere because of all the gases and particles in the air.

Tokitae, or Toki, the oldest killer whale in captivity, will finally be released to her \\"home waters\\" in Puget Sound, off Washington State. The 57-year-old orca, nicknamed Lolita, was captured when she was four and sold to the Miami Seaquarium in Florida. She entertained park visitors for over five decades before retiring in 2022. The 5,000-pound (2,267-kg), 20-foot-long (6 meters) orca has spent most of her life in a tiny tank. It measures 80 feet by 35 feet (24 meters by 11 meters) and 20 feet (6 meters) deep! The news of the killer whale's release was announced on March 30, 2023. Toki will be reintroduced to the wild gradually. She will begin her new life in a netted 15-acre (6-hectare) whale sanctuary built in the waters around the San Juan Islands. The killer whale will initially be restricted to a smaller enclosure within that sanctuary and monitored closely. If all goes well, the orca will eventually be reunited with her family. Toki is believed to be the daughter of the 89-year-old leader of the L-pod. This is one of three groups that make up the Southern Resident killer whales. The endangered orcas live in the Salish Sea between Washington State and British Columbia. As of July 2021, only 73 Southern Residents remain. Though hailed as a victory by animal activists, Toki's former caregivers are not thrilled about the killer whale's release. They believe the animal is in poor health and the stress of the move, which could take multiple days, might kill her. She could also be susceptible to pollutants in the ocean waters. Instead, they suggest keeping her in Florida. One option is to move her to SeaWorld Orlando. The marine zoological park has one of the largest killer whale habitats in the world. They also have the expertise to provide the care Toki needs. Additionally, the move would take only a few hours. This would be less traumatic for the killer whale.","output":"Toki will be in a small enclosure and then in a netted 15-acre whale sanctuary around the San Juan Islands, where she'll be monitored.

A study by the Journal of Applied Physiology suggests eating about 1 gram of protein per pound of your body mass every day. 2) Eat more calories - To pack on the muscle, you need to consume a caloric surplus, that is, eat more calories than you use in a day. 3) Focus more on compound movements - Exercises such as deadlifts and squats target several exercises and these should form the backbone of your workouts, as opposed to isolation exercises like bicep curls. 4) Lift heavy - Low rep exercises with heavy weights build more strength and size than high rep exercises with lower weights 5) Try a carb loaded, amino acid packed shake pre-workout - Drinking a pre-workout shake with carbohydrates and amino acids increases protein synthesis, according to a 2001 study by the University of Texas. You need to add 10 to 20 grams of protein (about a scoop of whey powder) to your shake. 6) Take time to recover - Don't work out to the point of exhaustion more than 3 times a week, and never on consecutive days. This gives your muscles time to recover and grow. 7) Eat carbs after working out - Research shows that post-workout meals with carbs stimulate insulin production, thus stimulating muscle growth."},{"instruction":"Who started McDonald's restaurant and in what year?","output":"In 1940, brothers Maurice (\\"Mac\\") and Richard McDonald launched the first McDonald's restaurant in San Bernardino, California."},{"instruction":"Give me a list of the characters listed in the passage below.

Some of the most helpful advantages include: You’ll be able to learn from your colleagues about all aspects of the field of dentistry. You’ll receive valuable mentorship from an established doctor who can guide you in your career development You’ll be able to purely focus on improving your skills - as well as developing relationships with your patients. There will be no need to worry about all of the hassles of running a business. You’ll get to live a less hectic lifestyle as you’ll have fewer areas of dentistry to think about outside of work, improving your work-life balance. There will still be an assured income along with employment benefits. In some cases, you can set yourself up for a future buy-in status where you’ll have shared responsibilities. Cons of Being a Dental Associate Unfortunately, there are also cons about dental associates that you should think of as well. Some of these may include the following: You won’t have as much control over your professional life as you won’t always be able to change the environment, service, or operation of the practice. The procedures you do will likely be determined by the owner doctor rather than chosen by you, giving you less of a say in the type of dentistry you perform. It won’t be quite as easy to set goals for your future. As a new doctor in an established practice, you’ll need to gain a new patient base, which will require you to invest time and effort into gaining patient trust before becoming established within the practice. The financial gain may not be as lucrative as running your own practice. There’s not as much of a sense of accomplishment that you could get from running a successful practice. That’s not a decision we can make – it’s up to you! However, we still can give you a few things to think about if you haven’t yet made up your mind about what to do: Do you dislike reporting to others and have little control of your own schedule? Are you incredibly competitive and love to set goals for yourself to reach? Do you enjoy all the management and administrative aspects of running a business? If you answered yes to these questions, the more likely it is that owning a dental practice is the best option for you. On the flip side, if you answered no, being a dental associate may be your best choice!","output":"Becoming a dental associate: Pros: • Better work-life balance. In general, you'll have the ability to keep work at work. • Stability. You will still have an assured income and regular workplace benefits. • Connections. You will have time to focus on the relationships of your patients and your mentorship. This connection could lead you to a buy-in opportunity! Cons: • Less control. As an associate, you won't be able to change your environment, the procedures, or other aspects of the practice. • Less income. You may experience less income as a dental associate than running your own practice. • Slow start. You'll need to gain a new patient base as a dental associate, requiring time, energy, and trust."},{"instruction":"Write a haiku about the sun.","output":"It shines bright and high Gracefully making its way It brings life to all"},{"instruction":"Write a seven-sentence paragraph about different types of milk.","output":"There are many different types of milk out there on the market some made with nuts and others coming from animals.

Stressing about your money beforehand will not only show you the realistic price of gallivanting around before returning to work, but it is also going to keep you from overspending once you hit the road. Use these tips to help save money on your trip: * Instead of renting a car, use the car you already have. * Even though you are on vacation, it is still a cost-effective idea to prepare the majority of meals at “home.” Home may be the car, hotel room, or campsite, but if you cook your own meals instead of going to restaurants every time you are hungry, it will save you money. * Speaking of, camping is a great way to get to know the areas along your route more intimately and is almost always cheaper than renting a hotel room. Next up, you will need to decide where to go. This is likely going to be a group effort to find a vacation everyone is on board for. Choosing some aspects from this list of destination descriptors may help narrow down where you will ultimately point your car: * Oceanside: Do you want to be next to the ocean on your trip? * Mountainous: Would you prefer to be in the mountains? * Warm Weather: Depending on the season you are traveling in, you may want to find warm weather to defrost from the long winter season. * Cold weather: Otherwise, if it is too warm in your area and you are looking to switch things up, pick somewhere that is going to supply you with hotter temperatures. Finally, take note of how long you can afford to be gone. Like many, one or two weeks out of the year seem to be reserved for pleasure while the rest are full of work or school—or both. Knowing how long your trip will last will let you plan how far from home you can drive in the allotted time, where you can stop along your route, and how long you can stop there.

Camp counselor: Many camp counselor jobs are geared toward teens, and these jobs are generally a great way to meet new friends. As a camp counselor, your teenager must be able to lead and be responsible for younger kids. 3. Dog walker: Dog walking is also popular among teens, and your teen should be able to find dogs to walk through family, friends, and your neighborhood. Your teenager will be required to keep a set schedule for return clients and must be able to responsibly look after dogs. 4. Lawn mowing: While lawn mowing can be seasonal depending on your location, your teenager can also get experience in other lawn care areas such as raking leaves, trimming hedges, gardening, etc. Your teenager may need his own equipment, but many people already have mowers available to use. 5. Lifeguard: This may only be a seasonal position where you live, but many indoor pools need lifeguards throughout the year. Your teen will need lifeguard and CPR certification to get this job, but many pools offer this training as part of the job. 6. Mover: If your teenager is okay with highly physical work, being a mover may be a good option. This job requires the ability to move heavy objects and furniture and to stand/walk for long periods of time. 7. Newspaper delivery: If your teenager has a car or bicycle, this job may be a good fit. Some newspaper delivery routes may require your teen to get up in the early morning, so keep this in mind when searching for these jobs. 8. Umpire/referee: If your city or town has any local children's leagues, your teenager may want to consider becoming an umpire or referee for their games.

Source Text: [The firm-foundation theory argues that each investment instrument, be it a common stock or a piece of real estate, has a firm anchor of something called intrinsic value, which can be determined by careful analysis of present conditions and future prospects. When market prices fall below (rise above) this firm foundation of intrinsic value, a buying (selling) opportunity arises, because this fluctuation will eventually be corrected—or so the theory goes. Investing then becomes a dull but straightforward matter of comparing something’s actual price with its firm foundation of value. In The Theory of Investment Value, Williams presented a formula for determining the intrinsic value of stock. Williams based his approach on dividend income. In a fiendishly clever attempt to keep things from being simple, he introduced the concept of “discounting.” Discounting basically involves looking at income backwards. Rather than seeing how much money you will have next year (say 1.05 if you put 1 in a savings certificate at 5 percent interest), you look at money expected in the future and see how much less it is worth currently (thus, next year’s 1 is worth today only about 95¢, which could be invested at 5 percent to produce approximately 1 at that time). Williams actually was serious about this. He went on to argue that the intrinsic value of a stock was equal to the present (or discounted) value of all its future dividends. Investors were advised to “discount” the value of moneys received later. Because so few people understood it, the term caught on and “discounting” now enjoys popular usage among investment people. It received a further boost under the aegis of Professor Irving Fisher of Yale, a distinguished economist and investor.]","output":"The firm-foundation theory argues that every investment instrument has a firm anchor of intrinsic value which can be determined by analyzing present conditions and future prospects.

Please make a couple of suggestions with some specific details.","output":"Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is the humane & effective approach to taking care of community cats. The process is to trap the unsterilized cats, get them spayed or neutered, and then return them to their original outside neighborhood. There are only a few ways to trap a cat. Humane trap - A humane trap is a rectangular cage-like trap. Bait the trap for several days at a typical feeding time for the cat, draping a towel or sheet over it. After the cat is used to going in and eating, set the trap. Use especially pungent food for bait like warm chicken or fish. When the cat gets to the back of the trap for food, stepping on the \\"trip plate\\" sets off the trap. Be sure to check the trap every hour if possible, and make sure the trap isn't exposed to the elements like direct sun or rain. Drop trap - Some cats become trap savvy after being exposed to the humane trap. Another option is a drop-trap, where a box is propped up on a stick with a rope attached. Food is placed at the far edge of the box. When the cat comes to eat, the rope is pulled, yanking away the stick and dropping the trap. Cover the box with a sheet or towel. The door of the box is centered with the door of the humane trap, and the cat will quickly move to the humane trap, believing it is an exit. Now the cat can be transferred."},{"instruction":"Write three sentences that could be used to negotiate the price of a product, but also be used to comfort a crying child.","output":"1.

Please read over the information about the different layers of the sun provided below and condense it into a few sentences. The core is the hottest part of the sun. It averages around 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the powerhouse of the yellow star; it’s where the nuclear reactions that create the sun’s light and heat take place. The sun produces energy within its core, where extreme gravity creates incredible pressure. This pressure causes the hydrogen atoms in the core to collide with one another with so much force that they actually create a new element—helium. The answer to the question: how does the sun produce energy?, lies in this process. It’s called nuclear fusion, and it creates all the heat and light that every living thing on Earth relies on. From the core, all that heat radiates outward, traveling through the sun’s layers and atmospheric zones. As you move outward from the sun’s core, each layer of the sun itself is progressively cooler than the last. The radiative zone surrounds the core. Its temperature ranges from 7-12 million degrees Fahrenheit close to the core. The outside edges of this zone are closer to 2-4 million degrees. Thermal radiation from the core heats the radiative zone. This thermal radiation occurs as a result of the photons emitted from the helium and hydrogen atoms in the core. The next zone is the convection zone. This zone sits at a cool 4 million degrees Fahrenheit. It’s filled with bubbling plasma that transfers the heat of the radiative zone outwards, like water boiling in a pot. The edge of the convection zone is what can loosely be called the surface of the sun. However, this “surface” of liquid plasma is so hot that liquids and solids can’t actually exist there.","output":"Three layers make up the sun: the core, the radiative zone and the convection zone. The core lies in the middle of the sun and, with an average temperate of 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, is the hottest layer. The intense pressure, caused by gravity, creates nuclear fusion by forcing hydrogen atoms to collide and create helium. The second layer, the radiative zone, is cooler than the core with an average temperature ranging from 7 million to 12 million degrees Fahrenheit. Radiation from the core transfers to the radiative zone, transferring heat. The outermost layer is the convection zone at about four million degrees Fahrenheit, which is filled with bubbling plasma, and emits the heat of the radiative zone outwards."},{"instruction":"Classify each of the following tweets as toxic or non-toxic.

Craig dives down to see the octopus but he's not scuba diving, he just holds his breath for a really long time.

Anatomically, the mass of each buttock principally comprises two muscles—the gluteus maximus muscle and the gluteus medius muscle—which are covered by a layer of adipose body fat. The upper aspects of the buttocks end at the iliac crest (the upper edges of the wings of the ilium, and the upper lateral margins of the greater pelvis), and the lower aspects of the buttocks end at the horizontal gluteal crease, where the buttocks anatomy joins the rear, upper portion of the thighs. The gluteus maximus muscle has two points of insertion: (i) the one-third superior portion of the (coarse line) linea aspera of the thigh bone (femur), and (ii) the superior portion of the iliotibial tract (a long, fibrous reinforcement of the deep fascia lata of the thigh). The left and the right gluteus maximus muscles (the butt cheeks) are vertically divided by the intergluteal cleft (the butt-crack) which contains the anus.[1] The gluteus maximus muscle is a large and very thick muscle (6–7 cm) located on the sacrum, which is the large, triangular bone located at the base of the vertebral column, and at the upper- and back-part of the pelvic cavity, where it is inserted (like a wedge) between the two hip bones. The upper part of the sacrum is connected to the final lumbar vertebra (L5), and to the bottom of the coccyx (tailbone). At its origin, the gluteus maximus muscle extends to include parts of the iliac bone, the sacrum, the coccyx, the sacrosciatic ligament, and the tuberosity of the ischium.[2] Like every pelvic-area muscle, the gluteus maximus muscle originates from the pelvis; nonetheless, it is the sole pelvic muscle not inserted to the trochanter (head of the femur), and is approximately aligned to the femur and the fascia lata (the deep fascia of the thigh); the tissues of the gluteus maximus muscle cover only the rear, lateral face of the trochanter, and there form a bursa (purse) that faces the interior of the thigh.[3]","output":"1.

Use Q: before the question and A: before the answer, placing each on separate lines. Lamar’s new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, doesn’t explicitly bill itself as a movie like good kid, m.A.A.d city did, but the network of interlocking dramas explored here feels filmic nonetheless, and a variety of characters appear across the album’s expanse. The opener, \\"Wesley’s Theory\\", turns the downfall of action-star-turned-convicted-tax-dodger Wesley Snipes into a kind of Faustian parable. Snoop drops by on \\"Institutionalized\\"; Dre himself phones in on \\"Wesley\\". The mood is wry, theatrical, chaotic, ironic, and mournful, often all at once: On \\"For Free? (Interlude)\\" an impatient woman ticks off a laundry list of material demands before Kendrick snaps back that \\"This dick ain’t free!\\" and thunders through a history of black oppression, spoken-word style, as if to say, \\"This money you crave, it’s blood money.\\" The album is dotted with surreal grace notes, like a parable: God appears in the guise of a homeless man in \\"How Much a Dollar Cost\\", and closer \\"Mortal Man\\" ends on a lengthy, unnerving fever-dream interview with the ghost of 2Pac.

There’s half a jazz band present at all times; pianist Robert Glasper, producer/sax player Terrace Martin and bass wizard Thundercat give Butterfly a loose, fluid undertow every bit as tempestuous and unpredictable as the army of flows at Kendrick’s disposal. The rapper’s branching out, too, exploding into spastic slam poetry on \\"For Free?\\", switching from shouty gymnastics to drunken sobs on \\"u\\" and even effecting the lilt of a caring mother on \\"You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)\\". It turns out Kendrick’s new direction was every direction at once.","output":"Q: What is the name of the opening song from Kendrick Lamar's album \\"To Pimp a Butterfly?\\" A: Wesley's Theory.

Several Native American groups originally inhabited the region today known as Wyoming. The Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone were but a few of the original inhabitants European explorers encountered when they first visited the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire, which extended through the Southwest and Mexico. With Mexican independence in 1821, it was considered part of Alta California. U.S. expansion brought settlers who fought for control. Mexico ceded these territories after its defeat in 1848 in the Mexican–American War. From the late 18th century, French-Canadian trappers from Québec and Montréal regularly entered the area for trade with the tribes. French toponyms such as Téton and La Ramie are marks of that history. American John Colter first recorded a description in English of the region in 1807. He was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which was guided by French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his young Shoshone wife, Sacagawea. At the time, Colter's reports of the Yellowstone area were considered fictional.[11] On a return from Astoria, Robert Stuart and a party of five men discovered South Pass in 1812.","output":"The first description of Wyoming in English was made in 1807 by John Colter."},{"instruction":"I want to improve my language skills for professional development. Can you suggest me some immersive and effective ways to learn a new language? I am a busy person and I want something that I can easily incorporate into my routine. I want to start learning French, but I also want to begin improving my speaking skills first.","output":"Sure! Here are some effective ways busy professionals like you can up their French-speaking game: 1. Master the Lingo: Start by learning the most common French vocabulary and phrases. You will speak basic sentences and understand everyday conversations with ease. 2. Word by Word: Decide on a goal for how many French words you want to learn and pick out the ones that are most relevant to your profession or interests. 3. Trick Your Brain: Use study techniques like flashcards and mnemonics to remember new words and phrases. Implement them into your daily routine, like during your morning coffee break or on your commute to work. 4. Netflix and French: Find French shows or movies to watch and pick up useful vocabulary from the subtitles. You could also try a French podcast or audiobook to improve your listening skills. 5. Watch and Write: Tune in to French-language videos or movies and transcribe them daily. It will sharpen your listening and writing skills as you get a feel for various accents and sentence structures. It’s also a great excuse to binge-watch your favorite French shows guilt-free! 6. Review and Reinforce: After transcribing, review the sentences periodically and try to recall them without looking. Reviewing will allow you to retain and recall vocabulary and grammar patterns, and seeing progress will encourage you to keep practicing. 7. Immerse Yourself: Listen to authentic French content, from music to news to podcasts, as often as possible. Exposure to the language is crucial to understanding how it's spoken in different situations and can help you absorb new vocabulary and expressions naturally. 8. Listen Up: Practice active listening by focusing on the nuances of communication - tone, intonation, pace, and body language. It’s a particularly essential skill if you plan to interact with French speakers in a professional setting, as it can help you read social cues and respond appropriately. Incorporate this practice into your everyday life, from conversations to conference calls to TV shows. 9. Say Oui to Speaking French ASAP: While it may be tempting to start with grammar rules and vocabulary lists, the key to really improving your language skills is to start speaking as soon as possible.

It's a huge pain to clean it up. I've asked the neighbor politely many times to trim the branches so that this doesn't happen, but he refused. Well today, while my kids were playing in the yard, yet another apple fell and hit my son (10M) in the shoulder hard enough to bruise. I was furious. I got out my gardening tools and cut every single branch that crossed my side of the fence and went inside. A few hours later, my neighbor started pounding on my door, screaming that I had committed a crime by damaging his property and threatening to sue. He said I was a huge asshole for not talking to him first, even though I had talked to him and nothing was done.

Can you provide a one paragraph summary of the issues? Former employees say the toxic behavior behind the scenes starts with Duda, who shields Clarkson from what staffers say they’re enduring because of the climate Duda created. “I think Alex Duda’s a monster,” a former employee says. “I have a friend who’s an executive producer who warned me about taking this job, because apparently she has done this on every show she’s worked on.” As for Clarkson, the current employee as well as 10 former employees are under the impression she isn’t aware of how bad things are for lower-level staffers, some of whom say they’ve taken on other jobs as babysitters, dog walkers, and Uber Eats drivers to pay their bills. They say there’s a divide behind the scenes between staffers who are favored by executive and senior producers and those who aren’t. Former employees are also frustrated that there hasn’t been a shift in the culture at the show despite a number of HR complaints, and they worry the longer the behavior continues without repercussions, the worse it will get as the seasons go on. Related One former employee says they recently quit working at the show because a producer who reports to Duda yelled and cursed at them multiple times onstage. They say they developed so much anxiety from the way they were treated at work that they would regularly vomit and exhibit physical signs of sickness. “This job deteriorated my mental health,” they say. A second former employee says they took a leave of absence because their mental health was also suffering. They say they were bullied and intimidated by producers who went out of their way to make staffers feel scared to ask questions and get their work done. According to the staffer, this prompted them to take a month away from the job and see a psychiatrist for the first time in their life because they “truly couldn’t handle it mentally.” The former staffer says they’ve worked in the entertainment industry for years on a number of different sets, but The Kelly Clarkson Show “is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had in my entire life.” “It deterred me from wanting to work in daytime ever again,” they say. “When I say I was traumatized, I was really traumatized.” While this former employee says they were hesitant to approach HR with their issues about mistreatment behind the scenes of the show, other employees say they did report issues to HR. Seven former staffers say they used their exit interviews with NBCUniversal to outline their negative experiences. A third former employee says they even had a follow-up call with HR after their exit interview regarding their issues with two producers. The HR representative told them they found the producers’ behavior unprofessional, but ultimately, those same producers ended up getting promotions. “I don’t know what HR does at that show, frankly,” the former employee says. “Nothing of consequence happened.” A fourth former employee says they quit the show after they felt bullied, picked on, and put in uncomfortable positions by executive-producer Duda. The former employee, who is white, says one time in a conversation about wanting to diversify Clarkson’s audience, Duda asked them, “Why don’t Black people want to come to the show? Why don’t Black people want to see Kelly?”","output":"Former employees of this TV show have raised concerns about a toxic work environment, and many say it starts at the top with executive producer Alex Duda.

How Many Calories and Carbs Are in a Banana? Bananas are extremely healthy and contain several important nutrients. A medium banana only contains 105 calories, on average. However, more than 90% of a banana is composed of carbs. People generally know that bananas are very nutritious, but many wonder how many calories and carbs they actually contain. This article answers those questions. How many calories are in various sizes of bananas? Bananas contain around 100 calories, but this can vary by the fruit size and how you consume it. Below are the calorie contents of standard banana sizes (1Trusted Source): Extra small (shorter than 6 inches, 81 grams): 72 calories Small (6–7 inches, 101 grams): 90 calories Medium (7–8 inches, 118 grams): 105 calories Large (8–9 inches, 136 grams): 121 calories Extra large (9 inches or longer, 152 grams): 135 calories Sliced (1 cup, 150 grams): 134 calories Mashed (1 cup, 225 grams): 200 calories If you’re unsure about the size of your banana, you can estimate that an average banana contains about 100 calories. About 93% of a banana’s calories come from carbs, 4% from protein, and 3% from fat. SUMMARY The calorie content of a banana ranges from 72–135 calories depending on its size. An average-sized banana contains about 100 calories. How many carbs are in a banana? Bananas are almost exclusively composed of water and carbs. People who watch their carb intake are interested in knowing the carb content of their food. Here is the carb content of standard banana sizes (1Trusted Source): Extra small (shorter than 6 inches, 81 grams): 19 grams Small (6–7 inches, 101 grams): 23 grams Medium (7–8 inches, 118 grams): 27 grams Large (8–9 inches, 136 grams): 31 grams Extra large (9 inches or longer, 152 grams): 35 grams Sliced (1 cup, 150 grams): 34 grams Mashed (1 cup, 225 grams): 51 grams A banana also contains 2–4 grams of fiber, depending on its size. You can subtract 2–4 grams if you are looking for the “net” carb content (net carbs = total carbs – fiber). Additionally, a banana’s ripeness may affect its carb content. Generally, green or unripe bananas contain fewer digestible carbs than ripe bananas. SUMMARY An average-sized banana contains about 25 grams of carbs — maybe even less if the banana is unripe (green). Unripe (green) bananas contain more resistant starch The main nutrient in bananas is carbs, but the carb composition changes drastically during ripening. Unripe bananas contain high amounts of starch, and some of it is resistant starch (2Trusted Source). Because the starch in a banana is converted to sugar during ripening, yellow bananas contain much less resistant starch than green ones. In fact, the resistant starch content of a fully ripe banana is less than 1% (2Trusted Source). Resistant starch is a type of indigestible carbohydrate that escapes digestion and functions like fiber in the body. It reaches the colon undigested. There, it feeds friendly gut bacteria (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source). When the bacteria digest resistant starches, they form gases and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are important for digestive health (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source). About 95% of these SCFAs are then rapidly absorbed by the cells in the colon and used by the body for energy (5Trusted Source, 7, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source). So although resistant starches will not yield as many calories as regular carbs during digestion, they may be transformed into SCFAs that provide calories later. Therefore, green and yellow bananas may provide similar amounts of calories in the end. SUMMARY Unripe bananas contain high amounts of resistant starch. Resistant starch escapes digestion and feeds the friendly bacteria in your gut, which use it to produce short-chain fatty acids. Bananas contain many other beneficial nutrients Bananas contain good amounts of several vitamins and minerals. One medium banana contains (1Trusted Source): Fiber: 3.1 grams Vitamin B6: 25% of the DV Vitamin C: 11% of the DV Manganese: 14% of the DV Potassium: 12% of the DV Folate: 6% of the DV Riboflavin (vitamin B2): 5% of the DV Bananas are tasty and nutritious. They make an excellent, healthy, and low calorie snack. SUMMARY Bananas contain good amounts of fiber, vitamin B6, manganese, vitamin C, folate, and potassium. The bottom line Bananas generally contain 72–135 calories and 19-35 grams of carbs, depending on their size. An average-sized banana contains about 100 calories and 25 grams of carbs.

Not so with genetic instructions for making proteins. Even a small change can prevent a protein from doing its job properly, with possibly deadly consequences. Only occasionally is a change beneficial. It seems wisest to preserve genetic instructions as they are written. Unless you’re an octopus. Octopuses are like aliens living among us — they do a lot of things differently from land animals, or even other sea creatures. Their flexible tentacles taste what they touch and have minds of their own. Octopuses’ eyes are color-blind, but their skin can detect light on its own (SN: 6/27/15, p. 10). They are masters of disguise, changing color and skin textures to blend into their surroundings or scare off rivals. And to a greater extent than most creatures, octopuses squirt the molecular equivalent of red ink over their genetic instructions with astounding abandon, like a copy editor run amok. These edits modify RNA, the molecule used to translate information from the genetic blueprint stored in DNA, while leaving the DNA unaltered. Scientists don’t yet know for sure why octopuses, and other shell-less cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish, are such prolific editors. Researchers are debating whether this form of genetic editing gave cephalopods an evolutionary leg (or tentacle) up or whether the editing is just a sometimes useful accident. Scientists are also probing what consequences the RNA alterations may have under various conditions. Some evidence suggests editing may give cephalopods some of their smarts but could come at the cost of holding back evolution in their DNA (SN: 4/29/17, p. 6).","output":"1. What genetic information do octopuses alter when they change their skin's color and texture, and what remains unchanged? -Octopuses edit their RNA when they alter their appearance while leaving their DNA unchanged. 2. True or False? Octopuses are color-blind. -True, octopuses are color-blind. 3. Why do octopuses change their color and skin texture? -Octopuses change their color and skin texture to camouflage themselves or intimidate rivals. 4. True or False? Octopuses have no sense of taste. -False. Octopuses taste what they touch with their tentacles. 5.

Warm light streaming through leaves overhead gleamed as river water on the windowsill. The cat pawed it for a moment of study before taking his seat beside her. And a spring aroma enlivened the old room, brought it into the outdoors, and forgave the cold nights they spent tucked under the quilts. An eastern towhee, perched on the porch rail, sang his two-part love call; two sharp syllables and a trill. Two more sharp syllables and a trill. Two more and his three-count trill. He disappeared into the walnut tree but tried his song again. The cat tilted his chin to her and squinted his eyes. It's probably past 6:30, she thought. A late start to the busy day ahead. She stood up and undressed there beside the window, no human eyes to watch her, and grabbed yesterday's clothes hung on the stone of the smoke stack whose embers were dim and low. Putting on her wool socks, she slipped them into each boot, right toe exposed but secured, and pants tucked in at the shin.

Nelson Mandela once said, “If you want to destroy a nation, you don’t use nuclear weapons, rather destroying its education system will suffice.” Having no cost means that anyone will have access to learning, creating equality of opportunity and improving the education level of the population. This will have a great impact on the economy, providing businesses with more skilled employees to hire. Also, this will tighten the gap between the upper and lower classes, reducing inequality and promoting stability. But implementing such a system has its downsides, such as the strain on a country's budget. Paying teachers and staff, as well as maintaining school facilities mean that there will have to be budget cutbacks in other sectors. This may encourage spending less, which along with larger classroom sizes, may reduce the quality of education. After all, increasing the number of students without increasing the number of teachers means a more chaotic and poor learning environment. In theory, there are many benefits to free education.

Her misfortune began when she embarked on a voyage to establish a colony in Canada in 1542, accompanied by a relative. During the journey, Marguerite engaged in a scandalous affair with a fellow passenger, resulting in their banishment to the remote Isle of Demons near the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. With limited resources, they constructed a small hut to shelter themselves from the harsh elements and relied on muskets and rocks to ward off wild animals. Marguerite faced the additional challenge of giving birth to a child on the island, miraculously surviving the ordeal. Tragically, her lover and servant succumbed to the hardships, and her young child soon followed. Despite the heartbreak and isolation, Marguerite persevered alone until her rescue in late 1544 by a group of fishermen who brought her back to Europe."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this so that a 10-year-old could understand it. The open-field system of agriculture dominated most of Europe during medieval times and endured until the nineteenth century in many areas. Under this system, peasants lived on a manor presided over by a lord or a bishop of the church. Peasants paid rent or labor services to the lord in exchange for their right to cultivate the land. Fallowed land, pastures, forests, and wasteland were held in common. The open field system required cooperation among the peasants of the manor. It was gradually replaced by individual ownership and management of land. The relative position of peasants in Western Europe improved greatly after the Black Death had reduced the population of medieval Europe in the mid-14th century, resulting in more land for the survivors and making labor more scarce. In the wake of this disruption to the established order, it became more productive for many laborers to demand wages and other alternative forms of compensation, which ultimately led to the development of widespread literacy and the enormous social and intellectual changes of the Enlightenment. The evolution of ideas in an environment of relatively widespread literacy laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution, which enabled mechanically and chemically augmented agricultural production while simultaneously increasing the demand for factory workers in cities, who became what Karl Marx called the proletariat. The trend toward individual ownership of land, typified in England by Enclosure, displaced many peasants from the land and compelled them, often unwillingly, to become urban factory-workers, who came to occupy the socio-economic stratum formerly the preserve of the medieval peasants.","output":"In this way of farming, each village had two or three large fields, which were divided into many strips of land. This was used in most of Europe during medieval times up until about 150 years ago. In this way, the people who lived in the county, instead of big cities, were watched over by people in charge like a person from the catholic church. The people who lived in the country paid to live on the land and use it to grow food. Land was shared by everyone and this meant that everyone had to get along. Finally, people were allowed to have land that belonged to themselves without others watching over them. Things got better for the people who lived the country instead of the cities in Western Europe after many people died in what was called, the Black Death, which killed off many people, freed up more land, and made workers more difficult to find. Because it was hard to find workers, the workers who were left after the Black Death could say that they wouldn't work unless they got money. Besides getting paid people began to be able to read. This made people smart and they were able to live better. Many new ideas started going around when people began to read. This led to people making things like machines and factories. This changed the way that food was grown and caused there to be a need for people to work in the cities where the factories were built. When people had the chance to have land that they owned themselves, some weren't able to get any and then they had to go to the big cities to work in factories. Sometimes they didn't want to but they had to. The workers who used to work in the country on the land became the workers who worked in cities in the factories."},{"instruction":"Can you take this long article about the history of Thai royalty and create a timeline from it? ----------- Before King Bhumibol’s reign, until the year 1932, Thailand was ruled under an absolute monarchy. Under this political system, the King had full control over the judicial body, the appointment of both state and tumbol (jurisdiction) officials, and overall state policies that governed the country. Famously recognized Kings under Thailand’s total monarchy system included King Chulalongkorn, known for his social reforms including the abolition of slavery and territorial concessions he negotiated to prevent the country from being colonized by the British and the French. Another King including King Mongkut, who adopted and embraced scientific and cultural expansionism in the country. His story was later inaccurately recreated in the musical, The King and I, a fabricated tale of white female fantasy, white savior complex, and wish fulfillment for a land and political seat white foreigners could never possess. Not to mention the frequent use of yellowface as an attempt to fill in the role of a well respected Thai king. King Chulalonkorn King Mongkut King Chulalonkorn left, and King Mongkut right In 1932, the current King in power at the time was King Prajadhipok. He had inherited a political climate that was volatile, and possess serious political and economic powers including a major deficit due to the domino effect of the Great Depression. On June 24, 1932, a small group of both military forces and intellectual overthrew the country’s absolute monarchy. The group enacted the 1932 constitution, severely limited King Prajadhipok’s power to that of a mere symbolic figurehead. They also created Khana Radsadorn (The People’s Party), the first political party in Thai history. King Prajadhipok Palace of King Prajadhipok As King Prajadhipok was unable to govern due health reasons, the crown thus moved to the next rightful heir. As King Prajadhipok later abdicated was the last remaining son of Queen Saovabha, the crown went the son whose ranked match hers, Queen Savang Vadhana. While her son, Prince Prince Mahidol Adulyadej—well respected for his knowledge of medicine and public health—passed away, succeeding him were two sons and a daughter, Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol Adulyadej, and Galyani Vadhana. On March 2, 1935, at the orders of the new cabinet, the crown was thus handed down to King Prajadhipok’s nephew, Ananda Mahidol who was ten (10) at the time. King Ananda and King Bhumibol King Ananda Older King Ananda and his brother King Bhumibol left, and younger King Ananda right King Ananda was born in Heidelberg, Germany on September 20, 1925. He was the first King in Thai history to be born outside of Thailand. When his father died when he was just 4 years old, his mother took it upon herself as a widow to raise him and his brother and sister alone. At the time King Ananda was appointed King, the family was living in Switzerland due to the unstable and unpredictable climate in both Thailand and the growing hostilities of the Imperial Japanese army who were gradually invading the surrounding countries in Southeast Asia. In 1938, thirteen-year-old King Ananda visited his country for the first time as King. After the end of World War II, King Ananda officially returned to Thailand with his family. Despite his initial experience with kingmanship, King Ananda quickly won the heart of Thai people longing for a king since the onslaught of the war. One of his most memorable acts included defusing the social, post-war tensions between ethnic Chinese and Thais in Sampheng Lane in Bangkok’s Chinatown. These traits of observation, sympathy, and mediation would later be adopted by his brother, King Bhumibol. ​","output":"Here's a brief timeline outlining important events around the rise, fall, and restructuring of the Thai royal family... 1851-1868 - Reign of King Mongkut who introduced Thailand on a national stage 1868-1910 - Reign of King Chulalongkorn who abolished slavery in the country 1925-1934 - Reign of King Prajadhipok who inherited a country deep in debt and a people that were feeling a call to self-governance 1934 - King Prajadhipok is forced to abdicate and Thailand experiences the inception of its first political party, Khana Radsadorn 1935-1946 - Reign of Ananda Mahidol who inherited the throne from his uncle at 10 years of age.

Personalities associated with the bottle of Orcasur are likely to be energetic, loud, and expressive, but they also may need the approval of others and external victories to validate their internal sense of self. They may pair best with map signs from Fuencarral-El Pardo since their resourcefulness can help Orcasur signs open up. That's because Fuencarral-El Pardo resembles the mighty bottle-opener.

He spends hours in the garage, So much so, in the house, he's a mirage, At mealtimes, for myself, I must fend, Hanging out by myself in the den, Of his projects, a constant barrage. But as the lonely weeks march on by, I notice something strange with my eye, The bills keep piling up, All my money, I'd saved for a pup, Is now gone, in the blink of an eye. He's buying new tools every day, Spending money in every which way, Ignoring pleas to slow down, Leaving me sad, with a frown. His mind, I just cannot sway. I know he loves his new hobby, But I'm broke like the house elf Dobby, I want to help him see the light, To save his wallet, do what's right, About his tools, he's getting quite snobby. So we sit down to have a big talk, Show him numbers, say let's take stock, A problem, he vehemently denies, Shows me something new he wants to buy, At this point, I am talking to a rock. But I know a way to set myself free, A plan to curb his crazy spending spree, His garage only has a little more space, Can't wait to see the shocked look on his face. No more room, unless he stores them in a tree. My husband's tools, they will always be, Part of his life, that he doesn't share with me, But they no longer make us broke, His spending streak no longer woke. No more space in the garage (unless they're free)."},{"instruction":"The following hashtags belong to either serious, hopeful, or funny posts.

They made me this way. I used to have everything. Picture me—a hard worker. Family man with three kids. I’m short but have heart. It’s 2009, and we’re good. Bought a house for cheap. Took advantage of the recession. It was the best timing. Job was paying well, too. Overtime often, but worth it. Crappy management—kept my distance. But it was all okay. We could pay for everything. Even some fancy lobster dinners. Fine dining and great living. Big house and fancy cars. Well, things started to change. Car payments higher than expected. Big issue with house plumbing. Thousands down the drain, quick. Worked harder to overcome it. Big surgery on middle child. Scary heart condition came up. Weeks in the hospital spent. Sharp pain in the wallet! Stress arose and worry settled. Working more to make up. Now around 90 hours weekly. My Saturdays are solid gone. Grinding from morning to night. Burnout is numbing my mind. No time for fun, either. Feeling joy less often, sadly. This isn’t working; let’s restart. Tried to sell the cars. Couldn’t get pennies for them. Massive recall malfunction issues associated. Another big house concern, wow. You wouldn’t believe it—12,000. Air conditioning unit went kaput. Financial stress is sinking me. Deeper in debt every day. Defaulted on my mortgage payment. Paid things with credit cards. Owed even more months later. I’m working hard and drowning. Job wouldn’t give me enough. Asked for things and rejected. Tried to interview everywhere else. Boss found out about interviews. Let me go, no warning. Pleaded for a proper return. I’m mad and near bankruptcy. Wife is definitely leaving soon. Kids can’t stand being around. Blood pressure off the charts. I’m already at rock bottom. Nothing to lose but time. I’ll pay my work respects. Infestation of bugs, boss’s office. Well-hidden chemicals never ceasing. Stink bombs and other nuisances.

I am interested in apps that offer cash back.","output":"Here are some suggestions for shopping apps that offer cash back. 1. DollarSprout Rewards - DollarSprout Rewards can be installed on your desktop browser as an extension. It works by automatically recognizing when you are about to purchase from a participating merchant such as Walgreens, Walmart, or Old Navy, and it prompts you to claim your cashback reward. Once you accumulate 5 in earnings after any amount of time, they pay out through the user's PayPal account the following month. 2. Capital One Shopping - Capital One Shopping is an online browser extension as well as an app that applies coupons every time you check out. It lets you earn credits for shopping locally and informs you when there's a better price from another retailer. Users also have the option to add items to their Capital One Shopping watchlist so they can track prices and be notified when there's a better deal out there for them. 3. Dosh - This cashback shopping app rewards you with everyday shopping both online and in-store. All you have to do is link your card to the app once and then enjoy the cash-back benefits over time as you shop. The great thing about the app is that it doesn't control or pressure you into making purchases you don't need simply because something is on sale. 4. Rakuten - This popular shopping app issues cash back for shopping at popular online stores and a few local stores as well. Shopping on Rakuten is easy and you can do it both on the dedicated app or on your home computer. All you have to do to get started is open the Rakuten app on your phone and search the store of your choice using the search bar. Then click on any referral link to visit the store of your choosing and go about your normal shopping activities. 5. Drop - Drop is an app that is similar to Rakuten which issues cash back for purchases made through qualifying links. The main difference is that Drop will pay you back in gift cards instead of in cash. But if you like the idea of gaining credits toward gift cards to your favorite stores then this would be a great option for you. After you accumulate 5,000 points on Drop, you can redeem them for a 5 gift card of your choice."},{"instruction":"Write an email (about 200 words) from the Empower Network to consumers.

The Longing is a 2020 point-and-click adventure game created by independent developer Studio Seufz. Set in an underground kingdom, the player controls the Shade, a creature tasked with watching over a sleeping king for 400 days. The Shade performs recreational activities, including reading and exploring, as it waits out the 400 days in real time. The in-game timer continues regardless of the player's actions but moves faster if the Shade performs certain actions inside its home, such as decorating the walls with drawings. Developer Anselm Pyta conceived of The Longing after hearing the Kyffhäuser legend while visiting the Barbarossa Cave. Pyta sought to explore emotional themes in a narrative-driven story and used time as a game mechanism. The developer was inspired by dungeon synth music, which helped him define the subterranean atmosphere and theme of loneliness. Pyta acted as the primary developer for most of the game's six-year production, having to rely upon personal intuition to design the pacing due to playtesting difficulties. The Longing was released for Windows, macOS, and Linux on March 5, 2020, and for Nintendo Switch on April 14, 2021. It gained praise for its soundtrack, visuals, and experimental nature, but the slow-paced gameplay divided critics. The game was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many commentators compared it to life under quarantine.

Up to what age can children travel for free? 2. What ways can children stay safe on a plane? 3. How do you purchase a ticket for an infant? Children under 2 have the option of travelling sitting on your lap and not being assigned a seat. Lap infants often travel free on domestic flights in the USA and Canada, and at a 10% fare on international flights. In other countries a fare is applicable whether domestic or international. If you choose to have a seat for your baby some airlines have an infant rate, but this can be as much as 90% of the regular price. Even if you have to pay the full fare, some airport and government charges are usually not applied to children under 2. During take-off and landings infants on your lap should be held in an upright position facing you and against you, with your hands supporting their back and neck. Some infants are more comfortable nursing during these periods and most flight attendants will allow it. Saving a feed for the descent can make the baby much more comfortable. With some carriers a lap belt is available that loops into the adult belt and then around the lap infant for take-off and landings. Consider putting infants with their own seat in an approved car seat appropriate for their age and weight. This is compulsory in the USA, and recommended in other jurisdictions. Still, best to confirm with your airline that this, as different airline shave different rules on the type of car-seat that can fit onto their aircraft seat. Other airlines will not permit an unsupported infant in a seat without a car-seat. Some airlines do not have the facilities for infants to be booked through their website, and you must contact the call centre or a travel agent. You should make sure the airline knows about the infant at the time of booking the ticket. Turning up at the airport with an infant will cause difficulties at check-in. Infants younger than two weeks may require a certificate from a doctor saying they are able to fly. If you have infants you can request a bassinet (usually only on long haul flights) which attaches to the bulkhead. Airline restrictions on weight and age vary from airline to airline. Check your airlines bassinet restrictions before you book. Needless to say, this can make long flight much more comfortable for the parent and child. For older infants, consider a bulkhead seat . Arm rests don't usually go up (the tray is in the armrest) unless on certain airlines, and you have to stow your carry-on bags in the overhead compartment during take-off and landing since there is no seat in front of you. On the plus side, bulkhead seats have more legroom, often enough for moving around without disturbing the occupant of the aisle seat, and there is no seat in front for the child to kick. Some airlines will let you book these when you purchase tickets, others give them out at a first-come-first-served basis at check-in only. Airlines won't let you place infants on the floor at your feet to sleep. Most airlines will ask you to remove your baby from the bassinet if it is turbulent. The current exceptions are Virgin Atlantic and Qantas. Children between 2 and 12 must have their own ticket. Children this age are usually given a discounted rate (typically 66-75% of the adult fare) on full service international airlines, but usually have no discount on discount international or domestic airlines. Discounted children's tickets may have different baggage allowances so check before showing up. Child and baby meals are available on some flights offering meals. The usual rules for special meals apply, and they must be ordered in advance. Picky eaters may prefer a bag lunch. Unaccompanied children are usually children under 12 travelling without a supervising adult. Not all airlines accept unaccompanied children, especially discount airlines. An unaccompanied child may be required to travel on a full adult fare, and additional fees may be charged. Unaccompanied children will need to be collected at their destination by a named caregiver and may be returned to their point of departure if not collected. Some airlines do not permit connections and no airlines permit connections to different airlines. In Russia, a special official document is necessary that states that the child has permission to travel alone. Seat allocation is important. At a minimum you want to be seated next to your child, but few airlines will actually guarantee that you are. Make sure you and your child are on a single reservation. Try and reserve your seats in advance, if the airline or agent permit it. Check-in early, and if you are not seated together make sure the flight manager is aware you are travelling with a child. If you still can't get a seats together, just make sure you get a window or an aisle seat, as these are easy to swap on board, whereas swapping a centre seat can be a nightmare.","output":"1. Children under the age of two can fly as lap infants free of charge. 2. There are a few ways infants can be safe on a flight. You can use a car seat to secure them or use a lap belt for take-offs and landings. 3. If the airline does not have an online booking that includes infants, Contact the call center or a travel agent to make a booking for travel with an infant."},{"instruction":"When did the first color TV program air?","output":"The first color television program was broadcast by RCA on June 25, 1951.

Most of the larger flooring company websites have Do-it-Yourself guides to show DIYers how to install their products.

Include short explanations if necessary. Flights are vanishing from the schedules – some at the last minute as airlines fail to offer the services that travelers have spent significant amounts of money on, often in the hope of enjoying their first escape in years. More than 1,500 flights were canceled in the US alone this past Saturday and Sunday, and the US is heading into its busy July 4 holiday weekend. Delta Air Lines has trimmed about 100 flights a day from its schedule in July to “minimize disruptions” and has issued a waiver for July 4 travelers as it braces for passenger volumes “not seen since before the pandemic.” Air Canada has said it will cancel up to 10% of flights in July and August, roughly 150 a day. At airports, scenes of passengers lining up out of terminal doors or camping out in departure halls are increasingly familiar as delays with security, check ins and immigration add up to more mayhem. Passengers have been asked to turn up even earlier to make their flight, and then to add to the confusion, asked again to turn up not too early. “Please consider that you are only welcome at the departure hall 4 hours before your flight,” Amsterdam’s Schipol Airport advised this week. And then there’s the luggage problem. At London’s Heathrow airport, photographs showing huge piles of bags separated from their owners have become emblematic of the experiences of many fliers facing the frustration of trying to claim lost possessions or wait days to be reunited with them.","output":"• Flights are being canceled en masse, resulting in unreliable service. • Passenger volumes are high, resulting in stress on the transport network. • Delays in services are frequent and widespread. • Passenger expectations are being managed poorly, adding to the confusion. • Complications with luggage recovery are common."},{"instruction":"In three sentences, please tell me the main points of the article. This is the article I’m referencing: An estimated 12 to 16 percent of women, and 4 to 7 percent of men, will be stalked in their lifetime. The federal government and all 50 states have enacted anti-stalking statutes, yet there is still no universally accepted definition of what constitutes stalking. When I talk about stalking, I'm referring to a pattern of behavior carried out by one person against another which is intended to harass, intimidate, or terrorize the victim—and usually does. Cyberstalking occurred in about 25 percent of cases studied—which seems low to me. If my suspicion is correct, the reasons for the low numbers arise from the data collection methodology, the population being studied, and other reasons that I won’t digress on here. But it seems likely that cyberstalking is only likely to increase, since the potential for surveillance and harassment is huge while the risk to the stalker is relatively small. Former spouses and paramours are the most common targets of stalking, followed by victims being stalked by an acquaintance. Only about one in four incidents involves stalking by a stranger. Most stalkers are men—70 to 80 percent, as reported by various studies—but one specific type of stalking is perpetrated almost exclusively by women. (See below.)","output":"Stalking - a pattern of harassment, intimidation, or terrorization of a singular victim - is experienced by roughly 4 to 7 percent of men and 12 to 16 percent of women.

Another night when he’s slept no more than three hours, and the throb behind his eye is like a dentist’s drill. The rooster which used to wake him at daybreak now crows throughout the night and screeches in his ear. David runs to catch the streetcar, and trips. His shoe catapults into the gutter, but he grabs the rail and pulls himself onto the landing as the clanging streetcar gathers speed. He hates those brown slip-ons with the silly tassels and glares at the scuffed right shoe, lopsided in the downpour. He crashes onto the orange plastic seat. At work, he has a pair of dress shoes and in the meantime, no one he knows will see him barefoot. His toe throbs but it isn’t bleeding. His stomach grumbles. If he’d missed the streetcar he would have been half an hour late but now he’ll be able to stop in at the cafeteria on Sturova and grab a Turkish coffee. If he loses his job he’ll have to join the homeless on the other bank of the Danube, by the bridge. He knows the sharp pain in his chest is not a heart attack. It’s a void – she ripped his heart out. The streetcar makes a right by the Carlton Hotel and stops. David hops off. He takes a few limping steps then decides he’s too ridiculous and kicks off his remaining shoe in a huge arc, watching it plop into a puddle. Barefoot is more sensible, even on cobblestones in the center of town. He drags his feet through puddles, the water chilling his toes. Forget coffee and a sweet, he decides, he’ll have tripe soup for breakfast, with an extra piece of rye bread, and a pickle, straight out of the barrel. They probably don’t have the schnitzels ready yet, barely eight in the morning. He pushes the door of the cafeteria open and is slammed with the sharp smells of frying onions, spilled beer, and Debreziner sausage. He shuffles to the end of the line-up of yawning workmen in grimy overalls. The woman in the green blouse runs up to him, grabs his cheeks between her meaty hands and kisses him hungrily. David is stunned. She breaks the kiss, slaps him, rattling his head. “Swine,” she spits. She runs out the door.

Make it 5 paragraphs long and make it around 500 words.","output":"The philosophers of old created a unique diet of vegetarianism that also lets people eat fish. Whether you're trying the pescatarian diet as a gateway to pure vegetarianism or veganism, or you've observed the diet your whole life, today's food prices and food culture can be frustrating. We have so much information about all the wonderful dishes and varieties of food from all over the world, international markets and internet retails to get unique ingredients, and amazing local restaurants that offer fantastic glimpses into food possibilities you've never dreamed of before, but, as any pescatarian can tell you, it can still be hard to find accommodating dishes or restaurants. For instance, you may have gone your whole life without trying the flavor sensation of chili since most chili dishes contain beef or other warm-blooded meats. But now you can enjoy all the incredible flavor profiles of chili thanks to a dish called Singaporean Chilli Crab! Packed with protein and loaded with salty-sweet goodness, this dish combines stir-fried mangrove crab with the rich and spicy zing of chili and tomato sauces. This sweet and sensuous dish is best enjoyed at the Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant in Singapore. The eatery's owners practically invented the dish back in 1956, and their successful restaurant became world famous for this incredible dish. There might be some contention over the origin of the dish: did it originate in Singapore or Malaysia? Who knows?! But one thing's for sure - this dish could be enjoyed all across the world! You might even be able to find it at local Singaporean or Southeast Asian restaurants, so ask around! Looking for flavors that hit closer to the southern American chili you had as a kid before you made your diet switch? Luckily, you can make all kinds of substitutions for Singaporean Chilli Crab, and you could even name your new creation off of the local cuisine that inspired your twist! Try it with beans, sour cream, and potatoes (diced or french-fried). If you're not from Oceanic countries, Hawaii, or Florida, you can always swap mangrove crabs for local varieties too. Those with shellfish allergies or people who don't like cracking open hard shells can even sub out real crab for imitation crab to enjoy all the same flavor without the risk and hassle. If you're a long-time member of the relatively small pescatarian club, you don't have to feel excluded anymore. As a bonus for newcomers, it can be so much easier to switch diets when you can incorporate all the same flavors you enjoyed your whole life, so don't throw out chili night! If you want to spice up your life or bring the wow factor to your next potluck or family outing, try Singaporean Chilli Crab; your meals may never be the same!"},{"instruction":"Can you create a welcome letter for my cousins arriving at my home explaining the keys, codes, WiFi, etc, and they’re going to feed my dogs so they need to know what information.

The letter \\"J\\" evolved from the letter \\"I\\" in the late Middle Ages. Initially, \\"I\\" was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. Over time, the consonantal form of \\"I\\" started to be written as \\"J\\" to avoid confusion. It wasn't until the 16th century that the distinction between the two letters became widely adopted. On the other hand, \\"U\\" was added to differentiate it from \\"V\\". In Latin, \\"V\\" was used to denote both the \\"u\\" and \\"v\\" sounds, but with the evolution of languages and the introduction of lowercase letters, a need arose to distinguish these sounds. By the late Middle Ages, a rounded form of \\"v\\", which we know as \\"u\\", began to be used to represent the vowel sound, while \\"v\\" was used for the initial consonant sound. However, it wasn't until the mid-17th century that the usage of \\"u\\" and \\"v\\" as distinct letters became standardized in English."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this text as if this chocolate cake is being interviewed for a potential job.

This juice is then boiled to concentrate it into a syrup, which is further processed to crystallize the sugar. The crystals are then centrifuged to remove the molasses, resulting in raw sugar that can be refined into granulated sugar. - Sugar Beets: Sugar beet processing involves slicing the beets and then soaking them in hot water to extract the sugar content. The resultant juice is purified and concentrated into syrup through evaporation and then crystallized and separated similarly to cane sugar."},{"instruction":"I need some assistance naming my female baby.

His music first became popular during his teen years in the early 2010s among high school students from Chicago's South Side.[6] In 2012, his popular local single \\"I Don't Like\\" was remixed by American rapper Kanye West and reached the Billboard Rap Top 20, further raising Cozart's profile.[6] A bidding war between major labels resulted in Keef signing with Interscope. His debut album Finally Rich was released in December 2012, and featured the singles \\"I Don't Like\\" and \\"Love Sosa\\", which would popularize the Chicago rap subgenre drill.[7] Chief Keef has faced ongoing legal issues during his career, including weapons possession charges, house arrest sentences, and a performance ban imposed by Chicago authorities.[8] Though he was dropped from Interscope in late 2014 and later signed to 1017 Records, he continued self-releasing projects through his own Glo Gang label. These included: Nobody (2014), Back from the Dead 2 (2014), Bang 3 (2015), and Thot Breaker (2017).

Try to determine what it is about flying that makes you feel afraid. If you can identify why you're scared, you can more easily identify when something might scare you. 2. Increase your knowledge about flying so you can feel more in control. If you're afraid of the plane crashing, read up on how unlikely crashes occur or ways to safely exit a plane after a crash landing. 3. If you have to fly, figure out ways to manage your anxiety. Therefore, when you feel afraid, you will have ways to calm yourself down or distract yourself from negative thoughts. 4. If you feel comfortable enough, do things that gradually increase your exposure to flying. Exposure therapy can be effective over time as you learn there is no real threat. 5. Don't do it alone! If possible, take other people for support, or maybe reach out to airline staff to see if they can provide you with any additional help. 6. Challenge your fears.

The cat was unlike any cat he had ever seen before. It was white with blue eyes, and it had a strange symbol on its forehead. The old man stopped to pet the cat, and the cat rubbed against his leg.

Article: Starting in late June 2021, daytime temperatures at some spots in the Pacific Northwest reached nearly 50° C (or about 122° Fahrenheit). The extreme heat caused wildfires to rage and boosted the rates of heat-related deaths in the region, says Karen Heeter, a dendrochronologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. To see how the record-setting summer temperatures stacked up against those in years before meteorologists compiled weather data, Heeter and her colleagues looked at tree ring samples collected from dozens of trees at 17 sites in the Pacific Northwest. The core samples were taken from living trees between the early 1990s and 2021. Two of the core samples chronicled temperatures as far back as the year 950, the team found. The team measured the widths and densities of the portions of tree rings that had formed in summer months. Generally for conifers in the Pacific Northwest, the warmer the growing season temperature, the wider the tree ring and the denser the wood formed during that period. By statistically blending data from the 17 sites, the team created a year-by-year profile of the entire region’s average summertime temperatures from 950 through 2021. Tree ring temps Tree ring data from the Pacific Northwest let researchers reconstruct the year-to-year average summer temperature in the region from 950 to 2021. This graph shows the distribution of those temperatures relative to the 1951–1980 global summer average. Summertime temperatures for most of the years fell within a degree of that long-term average. But at roughly 3.6 degrees Celsius warmer, the summer of 2021 (arrow) stands out — hotter than any summer in the past millennium. Distribution of Pacific Northwest temperature anomalies, 950–2021 E. OTWELL SOURCE: K.J. HEETER ET AL/NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE 2023 Evidence of 2021’s record heat in the Pacific Northwest doesn’t come as a surprise to Bryan Black, a dendrochronologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. As he conducted field work in the area that summer, he noticed that many of the region’s trees showed a notable browning on their southwestern sides, which would have borne the brutal brunt of afternoon sunshine. “The tree scorch was shocking,” says Black, who was not part of the new study. The average summer temperatures “were extraordinarily away from the norm.” That anomaly, says Lauren Stachowiak, a geographer at Eastern Washington University in Cheney who studies tree rings and lived in the area at the time, will undoubtedly show up in tree ring samples obtained in future studies.","output":"- Karen Heeter, dendrochronologist - Bryan Black, dendrochronologist - Lauren Stachowiak, geographer"},{"instruction":"Write a light 3 paragraph horror story about the ghost in my basement.","output":"My two best friends and I used to hang out in my basement, playing video games or chatting about our day.

Beneath the thaw, a gentle birth, The season dawns upon the Earth. From slumbered dreams, new life does spring, In petals bloom and songs that sing. The sun emerges, and warms the day, As nature awakens from the gray. And so it mirrors human hearts, When hope is born and the world restarts. From winter's grip, we break away, Embracing light, a brand new day. *Summer's Embrace* With fiery rays and golden haze, The sun-drenched days of summer blaze. Beneath its touch, our spirits soar. In laughter's echo, forevermore. The vibrant green of nature's gown, Reflects the joy that we have found. We bask in the warmth, love's tender gaze, In summertime's eternal phase. But as the season reaches its peak, We're reminded life is short and sweet. The days grow shorter, shadows cast, And summer's beauty cannot last. *Autumn's Embers* The air turns crisp, a whispered sigh, As autumn paints the evening sky. In hues of red and amber glow, The world prepares for what will follow. We gather harvest, blessings stored, Yet feel a sense of something more. For as leaves fall, one by one, We know the cycle has now begun In letting go, we find our way, Releasing that which no longer stays. For just as nature sheds its crown, We too must learn to stand unbound *Winter's Serenade* A frosty hug envelops all, As winter's chill begins to fall. The world turns silent a blanket of white, As nature sleeps embraced by night. In solitude, we find our core. In stillness wisdom, we do explore. For though the cold may seem severe, It brings reflection crystal clear. And as the earth slumbers deep, We find solace in peaceful sleep. For winter's end marks a new start. And hope rekindles every heart. Nature's seasons ebb and flow, An ever-changing dance they show. Through growth and loss, we come to see, The changing season's harmony."},{"instruction":"Write me a story from the perspective of a chair in a corporate waiting room. explore the world from its perspective as if it was a human.","output":"I've been here for years.

Here is the relevant text: When I first started to seriously get into painting when I was 18, acrylics were the first medium I ever tried. I was pretty limited to really cheap paints and awful brushes that kept shedding on me but I worked through it and found myself absolutely falling in love with the paint. I love the way you can layer colours, make the paint smooth or textured, the bright, bold colours, the way you can throw it or drip it or print with it or keep it thick and gloopy and just blob it on the page. I’d sit for hours on the floor of my uni bedroom floors watching Disney films or Lord of the Rings on repeat when I was sad and painting and painting and painting. Most of my earlier paintings were just abstract - playing with colours and textures and getting used to the paint.

I want you to pick this information from what I pasted below. Use the last relationship to King Henry. Born on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.[4] Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three – his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary – survived infancy.[5] He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace.[6] In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches. In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter. The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families.[6] Not much is known about Henry's early life – save for his appointments – because he was not expected to become king,[6] but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors. He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian.[7][8] In November 1501, Henry played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother Arthur's marriage to Catherine, the youngest child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile.[9] As Duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a label of three points ermine. He was further honoured on 9 February 1506 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, who made him a Knight of the Golden Fleece.[10] In 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of sweating sickness,[11] just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine.[12] Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother. The 10-year-old Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall, and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1504.[13] Henry VII gave his second son few responsibilities even after the death of Arthur. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne \\"untrained in the exacting art of kingship\\".[14] Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his son Henry in marriage to the widowed Catherine.[12] Both Henry VII and Catherine's mother Queen Isabella were keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death.[15] On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later.[16] A papal dispensation was only needed for the \\"impediment of public honesty\\" if the marriage had not been consummated as Catherine and her duenna claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for \\"affinity\\", which took account of the possibility of consummation.[16] Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young.[15] Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in Castile, complicated matters. Catherine's father Ferdinand preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated.[17] Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. Ferdinand's solution was to make his daughter ambassador, allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout, she began to believe that it was God's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition.[18]","output":"1. King Henry VII (Father) 2. Elizabeth of York (Mother) 3. Arthur, Prince of Wales (Brother) 4. Margaret (Sister) 5. Mary (Sister) 6. King Ferdinand II of Aragon (Father-in-law) 7. Queen Isabella I of Castile (Mother-in-law) 8.

Can you give me a few tips on how to ask? I'd like to keep it professional and polite, but also firm and direct. Please explain each tip to make sure that I understand what it is meant to accomplish.","output":"Here are four tips on how to ask for a raise at work for someone who's never done that before along with an explanation of what each tip is meant to accomplish. Each tip aims to keep your raise request professional and polite, but also firm and direct: 1. Find any and all positive feedback since your last performance review. Once you've made your meeting request, prepare for it by finding any and all evidence that your recent performance has surpassed expectations. In order to be both firm and direct in your meeting, you will need to be able to present concrete examples of how you've performed at an above-average level. Keep in mind, your boss may not interpret your evidence in exactly the same way as you do, so ensure that you remain calm and stick to the facts no matter what they say. 2. Come prepared with data and numbers. In order to present the most persuasive and compelling case for your raise, it's best to be able to clearly point to specific numbers and data that demonstrate your value to the organization. By presenting specific metrics and tangible goals you've accomplished, you will be able to show visually that you have outperformed your current salary. Relying on data also helps keep your meeting objective, removing personal bias or emotion from the equation and allowing you and your boss to focus on the numbers. 3. Explain what you’ll bring to the team in the coming year. Once you've discussed your past performance, be sure to also focus on your goals for the future. Frame your raise request as an investment, something that will pay off for the organization by demonstrating a clear commitment to one of its top performers. Remember to remain calm and clear as you talk about the future in order to avoid over-selling your commitment and having it come off as insincere. 4. Identify the salary range you’ll ask for and know how to justify it. One of the most awkward parts of a meeting to discuss a raise is inevitably the question of how much exactly to ask for. This is definitely something you will want to think about beforehand and be prepared to justify based on the evidence you will present. It's important that when it comes time to discuss the specific parameters of your raise request, you be able to point to specific, objective reasons why your numbers are fair so that your boss can best understand and hopefully agree with your point of view. Hopefully, this list assists you as you prepare to request a raise at your workplace. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"Im 16 and looking for my first job, can you brainstorm 10 places to apply that arent retail or fast food, i don't want to do those, thanks u","output":"Congratulations on seeking your first job! Go online, and see if you can apply at one of these places: 1. Offices. Many offices will hire high school students because they perform easy, routine work, such as typing, entering data, and answering the phone. 2. Restaurants. Family-owned restaurants, diners, and coffee shops often hire high school students to help them make some extra money during the semester or over the summer. 3. Libraries. Library jobs are easy to learn. See if you can find a job working at the front desk. 4. Used bookstores. Most used bookstores have local owners who could hire you temporarily, possibly offering a permanent position after you graduate. 5. Delis. Visit the local butcher, deli, or meat market to possibly get some food service experience on your resume. 6. Post offices. These and other government jobs provide decent wages, so call your local post office to see if they're hiring. 7. Banks. Your local bank might offer a few shifts after work or over the weekend. 8. Hobby stores. Locally owned stores for hobbyists, such as quilters and thrift shoppers, don't advertise for new employees often, but you can get in touch and see if they need some help. 9. Medical clinics. Go online to look for open secretarial and office assistant positions. 10. Churches. Many churches rely on volunteer work, but you could still call around and see if anyone needs an employee. If you currently go to church, you already have a place to ask. Additionally, see if your high school has a student work program. You might earn a paid position as a tutor, library assistant, or office worker. Your school might also host job fairs where you can meet potential employers in your area. Some also have a work study program where you complete classes for half the school day, then go to work for the other half. Talk to your school counselor to learn more about finding employment."},{"instruction":"What election is tied to a blue shift, according to the on-page text data?

Or it was probably a test of time, which you so wonderfully passed and decided to send me a letter you wrote a while back without changing a thing. It is the most amazing thing ever, but at the same time a bit scary, even when you mentioned that things have ‘changed’ a bit since then. I read between the lines that things are not as strong as they were before – in fact, not even as strong as the latter parts of this letter you wrote before. That is okay – it’s understandable and it's justified. Either you have an amazing ability to explain yourself so well, or you seem so innocent to me that nothing you wrote in the letter feels wrong. You are right about everything, or at least think exactly the way I think and feel. For a while now I’ve been wondering if what is true is true, and what is false is false. What ‘reality’ really is? It was one of the questions that confused me the most and it kept me occupied for a while. What’s true and real for you might not be real for someone else because, for us, our reality is what we can perceive, sense and feel through the 5 (six) senses and the heart that we have. And if everyone can perceive things differently, does that mean there are different realities? How can there be different realities? And if there are, how would we ever know what’s true and what’s not? It seems like there is no one reality or truth. When I thought about it, it was extremely unsettling for me. Then I came across something that I read in psychology literature. That changed quite a lot for me. It gave me more humility and made me more understanding and considerate of others. I think even more than before, and I’ve hardly left with any beliefs anymore. Just like you, I’ve become more objective in many things, but emotions for me are still a whole different ball game.

He admired King Arthur and his Knights and read the stories of their legendary exploits. Cai often dressed in a wooden barrel for armor, played with a wooden stick for a sword, and imagined himself as a knight. Seeing this, Cai's father sent him to King Arthur to become a page, a servant for the king. Arthur accepted Cai on one condition: Cai must go to the Sea of Blood and stay there for a night, braving the terrors and evils that surround the waters. Cai, determined to make a name for himself, went to the Sea of Blood on horseback, taking his wooden barrel armor and stick for protection. Cai sat at the edge of the Sea and marveled at the blood-red waters. The Blood Sea sustained no life; in fact, this body of water was red from the bloodshed over centuries of war in this area. Legend said that at night, the Sea gave up its dead in the form of zombies and spirits that terrorized those who dared to come near it. As the sun set over the bloody horizon, Cai saw thousands of undead warriors and knights popping up through the surface of the waters, walking toward Cai menacingly. Appearing to be brave and unafraid - but inwardly horrified and petrified - Cai stood at the ready with his wooden sword in his hand. As he faced the undead army, a hand protruded from the middle of the sea holding a golden battleaxe. The hand threw the ax at Cai's feet, at which time Cai grabbed the ax and held it above his head, the moonlight glistening on its sharp edge. The undead army stopped in its tracks as if they had seen a ghost, then they backed off and reentered into the waters, never to approach Cai again. Cai returned to Arthur the next morning, unharmed. Arthur, impressed with Cai's resilience, knighted Cai and gave him the name Knight Caius II. Caius, holding his battleax, received his knighthood and became a legendary Knight of the Round Table."},{"instruction":"Write me a haiku about a cat sitting happily in someone's lap.","output":"Warm and cuddlesome The cat is a happy loaf Purring and content"},{"instruction":"Rewrite the below political jargon so that it makes sense to someone who doesn't understand government lingo by including definitions of certain words in parenthesis immediately after the following words: \\"House of Representatives\\", \\"impeach\\" and \\"whistleblowers.\\" The Texas House of Representatives has voted to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, an unprecedented move following a legislative probe that faulted the third-term Republican for a yearslong pattern of corruption, including abusing his office’s powers, retaliating against whistleblowers and obstructing justice.

After a broad overview can you explain the specific process of making at least 2 cheeses, at least one should be cheddar?","output":"After milking a cow, the cream must be separated from the milk before the milk is used in cheesemaking. Once the milk is obtained, the process of making cheese can begin. First, the milk is taken, and based on the kind of cheese being made, a starter culture of bacteria is added in order to convert the lactose sugars in the cheese into lactic acid. After the bacteria has mixed with the milk, a curdling agent called rennet is added in order to cause the casein to curdle and separate from the water liquid known as whey. The curds are then separated and salt is added to help drain more whey before it is processed into its final form, which can range from being stretched and kneaded, to being pressed into a mold and aging. Cheddar, for example, is made by keeping no more than 39% moisture in it and aging it depending on the level of sharpness and hardness desired. To make mozzarella cheese, after the curds are formed, they are heated and kneaded together until it forms their signature elastic texture."},{"instruction":"Use the information to figure out and summarize which hummingbirds wings flap the fastest. Hummingbirds have compact, strongly muscled bodies and rather long, bladelike wings that, unlike the wings of other birds, articulate (connect) to the body only from the shoulder joint. The architecture of the wing permits hummingbirds to fly not only forward but also straight up and down, sideways, and backward and to hover in front of flowers as they obtain nectar and insects from them. The rate at which a hummingbird beats its wings is the same during directional and hovering flight. It varies with the size of the bird—the larger the bird, the lower the rate. Consequently, the smallest hummingbirds have extremely rapid wing-beat rates. In Calliphlox amethystina, one of the tiniest species, the male has a wing-beat rate of about 80 per second; the female, which is larger, beats her wings at a rate of about 60 times per second. The ruby-throated hummingbird has a wing-beat rate of about 70 per second in the male and about 50 per second in the female. The rate is much lower in the larger hummingbirds; the giant hummingbird, for example, beats its wings only about 10 times per second. In fact, the larger hummingbirds appear to beat their wings more slowly than do other birds of comparable size.","output":"Various hummingbird species beat their wings at different speeds.

Your health is what you eat Research has consistently shown that the Mediterranean diet and other whole food diets are associated with better health and longer lives, and ultraprocessed foods and drinks like soda, chips and fast food, among others, are linked with poor health outcomes such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other diseases. But improving the diet of an individual, let alone a population, is challenging. Whole foods are sometimes less convenient and less tasty for modern lifestyles and preferences. Furthermore, food processing can be beneficial by preventing spoilage and extending shelf life. Whole grain processing in particular extends shelf life by removing the germ and bran that otherwise rapidly spoil. Long-term storage of affordable calories has helped address food insecurity, a primary challenge in public health.

On April 1, 1970, President Richard Nixon signs legislation officially banning cigarette ads on television and radio. Nixon, who was an avid pipe smoker, indulging in as many as eight bowls a day, supported the legislation at the increasing insistence of public health advocates. Alarming health studies emerged as early as 1939 that linked cigarette smoking to higher incidences of cancer and heart disease and, by the end of the 1950s, all states had laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors. In 1964, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) agreed that advertisers had a responsibility to warn the public of the health hazards of cigarette smoking. In 1969, after the surgeon general of the United States released an official report linking cigarette smoking to low birth weight, Congress yielded to pressure from the public health sector and signed the Cigarette Smoking Act. This act required cigarette manufacturers to place warning labels on their products that stated “Cigarette Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health.” By the early 1970s, the fight between the tobacco lobby and public health interests forced Congress to draft legislation to regulate the tobacco industry and special committees were convened to hear arguments from both sides. Public health officials and consumers wanted stronger warning labels on tobacco products and their advertisements banned from television and radio, where they could easily reach impressionable children. (Tobacco companies were the single largest product advertisers on television in 1969.) Cigarette makers defended their industry with attempts to negate the growing evidence that nicotine was addictive and that cigarette smoking caused cancer. Though they continued to bombard unregulated print media with ads for cigarettes, tobacco companies lost the regulatory battle over television and radio. The last televised cigarette ad ran at 11:50 p.m. during The Johnny Carson Show on January 1, 1971. Tobacco has played a part in the lives of presidents since the country’s inception. A hugely profitable crop in early America, Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Jackson owned tobacco plantations and used tobacco in the form of snuff or smoked cigars. Regulation of the tobacco industry in the form of excise taxes began during Washington’s presidency and continues to this day. In 1962, John F. Kennedy became the first president to sponsor studies on smoking and public health. Tobacco has not been the only thing smoked at the White House. In 1978, after country-music entertainer Willie Nelson performed for President Carter there, he is said to have snuck up to the roof and surreptitiously smoked what he called a big fat Austin torpedo, commonly known as marijuana.","output":"As early as 1939, cigarettes were linked to high rates of cancer and heart disease.

I have a craving for something authentic and delicious, like what you’d get at a nice restaurant.","output":"You will need: For the chicken -- 1 pound of skinless, boneless chicken breasts 1 teaspoon of Italian seasonings 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon butter For the noodles -- 16 ounces of fettuccine pasta, either homemade or prepackaged and ready to boil For the alfredo sauce – 2 cups grated parmesan cheese 1/4 teaspoon pepper 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon Italian seasonings 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1 clove garlic, minced 2 cups heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup butter, cut into cubes Directions: Bring salted water to a boil and add fettuccine noodles. Cook until al dente (usually 8 to 10 minutes), then reserve 1/2 cup of water from noodles. Drain the remaining water and set the noodles aside to rest. Use Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper to season chicken while a large skillet heats olive oil on the stove over medium to high heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the chicken when you flip to the other side (usually 5 to 7 minutes per side). Remove the chicken from the heat and allow it to rest for 3 minutes. Cut into slices or cubes – your preference, then transfer to a foil-tented dish to keep chicken warm and moist. Use the same skillet you used for the chicken to make the Alfredo sauce. DO NOT WASH THE SKILLET BETWEEN COOKING THE CHICKEN AND THE SAUCE. The flavor of the cooked chicken will incorporate into the sauce. Heat butter and cream over medium to low heat until well-mixed and the butter is melted. Add minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer for 3 to 4 minutes until thickened into a sauce. Add two tablespoons of pasta water, then stir the parmesan cheese slowly into the sauce until well incorporated. Remove sauce from heat and toss with fettuccine noodles. Divide into bowls, then top with a few chunks (or slices) of chicken and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and black pepper. Serve."},{"instruction":"How much would a person who weighs 150 lbs. on Earth, weigh on the Moon?","output":"While the mass would not change, a person's weight would change if they were on the Moon. If the person weighs 150 lbs on Earth, they would weigh 25 lbs. on the Moon. That is because gravity on the moon is a sixth of what it is on Earth. The moon's gravity is so much lower because the noon is just 1% the mass of Earth. A person's weight on various planets would vary greatly. If you were able to stand on Jupiter, you would weigh more than twice as much."},{"instruction":"I need help writing a scene. The scene is part of a larger chapter that is part of a larger book, but I haven't written much yet. Anyway, the scene should describe the beginning of a duel between a pirate captain and the captain of a city guard. Both characters should be women. The setting is a beautiful white city on the coast where the pirate captain has launched a raid with her ships and other pirates, and a battle is going on around both characters. It is during the late medieval period, so guns and bombs and cannons are allowed. The tone should be mature, but not overly graphic or gory.","output":"Another bombardment from the ships at port obliterated the watchtower. The collapse spewed white stone and rubble into the marble streets. Soldiers, the defenders of the city, vanished with a unified cry. But from the maelstrom of dust and detritus, flew a singular figure. She was clad in a silver breastplate and white skirts. Chainmail sang on her limbs, and the glint of her blade caught the light. The captain of the city guard emerged unscathed. Unscathed, at least, save for the eyes that fell upon her. The pirate queen had been seeking this very moment, ever since her ships laid siege to the city. The city's fall and the triumph of her forces meant plunder, more plunder than anyone could have dreamt in all the long months at sea. But to duel the renowned captain of the city in single combat? There lay the only path to glory. A shot rang out. Plaster ruptured from the wall beside the captain's brow. Her gaze swiveled and met the pirate queen's. The shot was merely an invitation, and the pirate queen smiled grimly as she tossed aside her pistol, seeing that the invitation had been accepted. The captain of the guard threw her spear. The bolt of silver shot almost unseen through the air, glinting once as it caught the high noon sun. Instinct alone compelled the pirate queen to weave and duck. The spear caught the privateer behind her, skewering him on the spot. With a careless laugh, the pirate queen shouted, \\"She's mine!\\" And she threw herself into the fray. With long and limber strides, the two warriors met in single combat. Saber greeted Longsword in a wild burst of sparks. The captain darted forward, arm straight, aiming to stab the pirate queen with her thrust. The saber twisted and deflected the sword point. The queen scuttled backward, lobbing taunts to cover her retreat. The captain reset her stance, laying the blade high and flat, tip outward to thurst or deflect. Her face was grim as she strafed in a wide circle. The pirate queen moved back in, wrist and saber spinning in a cocksure display of dexterity. With a disorienting roar, she pulled a sudden slash from the spinning of her blade. It was merely a feint, which she spun around again into a slash from another direction. A deflection.

Facing a new reality of having one of the toughest-to-treat cancers can indeed be overwhelming. That’s why it’s so important to make sure your treatment plan is the best possible one for you, say experts. One way to do that is with a second opinion. The reasons why pancreatic cancer patients seek second opinions are as varied as the patients themselves. “One of the things I pride myself on is spending time with my patients and explaining options,” says gastrointestinal oncologist Allyson Ocean, M.D., Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, and medical oncologist and attending physician in gastrointestinal oncology, Solid Tumor Division, at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York. “I see a lot of second opinions, but I also encourage my patients to get a second opinion. I’ll give them names. That’s because pancreatic cancer is extremely complex, and patients need to feel comfortable with their treatment plan and the medical professionals who are going to be carrying out that plan. Anything less than that makes it harder on the patient, and none of us want that.” But there are other equally important reasons to get a second opinion. “Sometimes a patient will come to me for a second opinion simply for reassurance the recommendation they currently have is the same thing that we would do,” says Ocean, adding that’s a fairly common scenario, though in many cases a treatment approach can be “slightly tweaked,” she adds. However, there are some instances in which pancreatic cancer patients are not told about innovative treatments simply because their current doctors weren’t aware of those treatments and they aren’t experts in pancreatic cancer care. “What patients forget sometimes is they have every right to a second opinion, and to consult other experts at any point in time, really,” Ocean states.","output":"Patients seek second opinions after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis for a variety of reasons. One reason is to ensure they feel comfortable with their treatment plan and providers because the disease is complex. Another reason is to find out if there are other treatment options available that a different provider would recommend or that their current doctor is unaware of."},{"instruction":"When does a Solar Eclipse occur? Incorporate what conditions need to be met in order for the event to occur at all.","output":"Solar eclipses occur during the New Moon phase when the alignment of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun takes place. However, not every New Moon results in a solar eclipse. For a solar eclipse to occur, the New Moon must be near a lunar node. Lunar nodes are the points where the Moon's orbital path intersects with Earth's orbital plane around the Sun. These conditions create the potential for the Moon to align precisely with the Sun, resulting in a solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are limited to specific periods known as eclipse seasons, which happen approximately every six months and last for around 34.5 days."},{"instruction":"Write a pitch for a musical about working in the financial department of a broadway play company.","output":"Broadway is as glamorous as it gets -- unless you're handling the bills.

On Saturday, Katylee Bailey, a British TikTok influencer with 2.8 million followers who typically posts motivational content about self-love and lifestyle content about spending time with her grandparents and friends, posted a video in which she could be seen popping a confetti cannon that was shaped like a Champagne bottle as an on-screen caption on the post read, “Mortgage free and a home owner at 21 baby!!!” Bailey's video received 3.8 million views, which is comparatively viral in relation to her other posts, which typically receive hundreds of thousands of views. While many commenters expressed support for the influencer, noting that it was a big achievement to own a house at her age, others were critical, suggesting her post was out of touch and insensitive toward people struggling to afford rent and housing. “So sad the people that work the least get this, and people putting their life on the line can barely afford heating,” one person wrote. “Meanwhile everyone else has real jobs and struggle to make ends meet,” another commenter wrote. Several commenters said they could not afford to buy a house mortgage-free with the salaries from their industries, which they said included the care sector and engineering, implying that influencers made a disproportionate income to the amount of work people assume they do. One person said: “Maximum everything for minimum effort.”","output":"While some commended her on the accomplishment at such a young age, several viewers criticized her, suggesting that she didn't deserve the house because of her job.

Additionally, if there was anything interesting about the race, could you give me a brief synopsis of what it was in a sentence or two? Thanks!","output":"1. The longest shot to win the Kentucky Derby (Derby) was Donerail in 1913. His odds were 91.45-1, and he paid a staggering 184.90 on a two-dollar wager. 2. The next was Mine That Bird in 2009 who went off at odds of 51.60-1. The payout on this win bet was a nice chunk of change at 103.20. Interestingly, he was 12½ lengths behind the frontrunner a mile into the race (which is only a mile and a quarter) which means he made up a lot of ground in a very short amount of time! 3. Giacomo went off at 50.30-1 odds in 2005 for a payout of 102.60 on a two-dollar bet. In a genuinely stunning race, he beat Closing Argument, who was also a long shot at 70-1! 4. In 1940, Gallahadion was the fourth longest shot to win the Derby at odds of 35.2-1. A win wager paid 72.40 as Gallahadion beat the favorite by one and a half lengths. 5. The fifth, Apollo, paid 169.80 on a 5 bet at odds of 32.96-1. In an interesting twist, Apollo won the 1882 Derby even though he did not race as a two-year-old, giving rise to “The Curse of Apollo.” This curse was not broken until 2018 when another unraced two-year-old, Justify, finally won the Derby."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me about the adenovirus?","output":"There are many types of Adenovirus, including gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and pinkeye.

I listened to it with my partner and they found the first opening chapters hard to get into since Zauner starts off with a very wide view of her story/relationship with her mother/her feelings. Once she gets into the chronological-ish parts you get totally roped in. Don't expect a \\"satisfying\\" ending, because there is no \\"close\\" to her story. Her life is obviously ongoing and there are still feelings she's grappling with. It would be impossible to wrap up neatly!","output":"This is a mostly positive review. The reviewer finds the book authentic in its portrayal of both the good and bad parts in the mother-daughter relationship. They found the food motif relatable and the introduction of Korean cuisine and culture palatable to new audiences. They do critique the initial unstructured chapters but found the story more engrossing once the narrative becomes chronological. The lack of a conclusive ending is acknowledged as an ongoing reflection of the author's life and emotions."},{"instruction":"Who was the first female to fly a plane?","output":"On September 6. 1910 Blanche Stuart Scott became the first American woman to fly.

The Extremely Proper Business Club brings in professionals from their respective fields to present and engage with students. Describe how the meaning of the word \\"professional\\" changed for them.","output":"Many years ago, the act of “becoming a professional” was a vague term for me, and made me anxious when adults introduced themselves to me as such. At times it was almost intimidating. I had always thought that a professional was just an average adult with above-average work performance. This definition used to be the prevailing meaning of the word “professional” for me before I joined The Extremely Proper Business Club last year. The Extremely Proper Business Club helps me get ready to become a professional by bringing in actual career professionals. These professionals, who range from corporate lawyers to hedge fund managers, are exemplary models of professionals in their fields. The club was the first to expose me to an unbiased picture of who a professional truly is and how that means much more than above-average work performance. This exposure to bleeding-edge professionals in their respective fields was a sobering reality. It continues to be a strong foundation for me as I prepare for my professional pursuits after graduation. Another important aspect of The Extremely Proper Business Club is the opportunity provided to students for them to talk with these industry professionals and gain their insight. This opportunity has been an invaluable resource for me as I start to take charge of my career. The advice given by career professionals with decades of experience continues to serve as a guiding light as I try to navigate an unclear void of career progression with upcoming graduation on the horizon. No matter the form of engagement, ranging from casual conversation to formal presentation with PowerPoint slides, having career professionals elaborate on their successes or failures while reflecting on overall learnings has been an incredible catalyst in my personal career development. The engagement from those professionals has also been a source of motivation for someone like me who is just starting their professional career track. I am eager when a person asks about my membership in The Extremely Proper Business Club because it is a chance for me to explain how the activities that the club hosts, including bringing in professionals in their field, are one of the reasons why I feel prepared in my transformation from student to working professional."},{"instruction":"Based on this simple storyline, name one genre you think this movie would probably be in.

Frida was the smallest elephant in her village by a long shot. Her legs were wobbly, and her trunk was thin. The other elephants never made fun of her, but they never asked for her help with anything. If something big needed to be moved, they asked Max. Max was the biggest, strongest elephant in the whole town. Everyone loved him because he helped them and because, as even Frida could admit, he looked REALLY cool. There wasn't a problem Max couldn't solve. Or at least, that's what everyone thought... One day, the whole village was celebrating the birthday of the very youngest in the group - Maggie. Frida always felt awkward because, even though Maggie was much younger than her, Frida was much, much smaller than Maggie. But she went to the party anyways, determined to have a good time. Just as the cake cutting was about to begin, however, Maggie let out a loud yelp. Everyone turned to look. Maggie's birthday balloon was floating away into the sky! And to make matters worse, she had tied her favorite stuffie, Poppy, to the end of the balloon! Everyone watched in fear as Poppy and the balloon came to rest on the top branch of the tallest tree in the village. It was a very old and VERY big tree -- alive for much longer than any of the elephants in the town. No one knew what to do!! Max was determined to get the balloon down. He wrapped his trunk around the tree and tried to uproot the whole thing, but as much as he tugged and grunted, the tree stood firm. Maggie started to cry. Suddenly, Frida had an idea! It might not work, she thought, but she was the only one who could do it! To the amazement of everyone at the party, Frida started to CLIMB the tree! Now, of course, any normal elephant would be much too heavy for a tree, but Frida was no normal elephant! She climbed to the top, carefully untied Poppy and the balloon, and brought them safely back to the ground. The whole town cheered! From then on, Frida was a hero too, and a reminder that the strongest isn't always the best."},{"instruction":"Can you please write me a tutorial of how to make a paper airplane that will definitely fly?

But when Nahri accidentally summons an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior to her side during one of her cons, she’s forced to accept that the magical world she thought only existed in childhood stories is real. For the warrior tells her a new tale: across hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire, and rivers where the mythical marid sleep; past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises, and mountains where the circling hawks are not what they seem, lies Daevabad, the legendary city of brass, a city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound.

However, they are unable to digest grasses, foliage, and other types of plant material directly, for their bodies do not produce enzymes capable of breaking down cellulose. Digestion occurs sequentially in a multichambered stomach. In ruminants with a four-chambered stomach, ingested plant material is stored in the first chamber, called the rumen, where it softens. They later regurgitate this material, called cud, and chew it again to further break down its cellulose content, which is difficult to digest. The chewed cud goes directly to the other chambers of the stomach (the reticulum, omasum, and abomasum), where it is further digested with the aid of various essential microorganisms that live in the stomach. The pseudoruminant digestive process is very similar, also involving regurgitation and cud chewing, though the stomach is divided into three chambers.","output":"1. Ruminants eat quickly. 2.

Deep Breathing: The most basic relaxation exercise is slow, rhythmic breathing from your abdomen to calm yourself. 2. Meditation: Meditation is a proven method for relaxation of the mind and body. Meditation can bring you into the present by focusing your attention on your breathing, a few repeated words, a single repetitive action, or the flickering light from a candle. 3.

Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski (né Alekseyev; Russian: Константин Сергеевич Станиславский; 17 January [O.S. 5 January] 1863 – 7 August 1938) was a seminal Soviet Russian theatre practitioner. He was widely recognized as an outstanding character actor and the many productions that he directed garnered him a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his \\"system\\" of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique. Stanislavski (his stage name) performed and directed as an amateur until the age of 33, when he co-founded the world-famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) company with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, following a legendary 18-hour discussion. Its influential tours of Europe (1906) and the US (1923–24), and its landmark productions of The Seagull (1898) and Hamlet (1911–12), established his reputation and opened new possibilities for the art of the theatre. By means of the MAT, Stanislavski was instrumental in promoting the new Russian drama of his day—principally the work of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Bulgakov—to audiences in Moscow and around the world; he also staged acclaimed productions of a wide range of classical Russian and European plays. He collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his \\"sole heir in the theatre\\"), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. At the MAT's 30-year anniversary celebrations in 1928, a massive heart attack on-stage put an end to his acting career (though he waited until the curtain fell before seeking medical assistance). He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until his death a few weeks before the publication of the first volume of his life's great work, the acting manual An Actor's Work (1938). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Lenin and was the first to be granted the title of People's Artist of the USSR. Stanislavski wrote that \\"there is nothing more tedious than an actor's biography\\" and that \\"actors should be banned from talking about themselves\\". At the request of a US publisher, however, he reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, My Life in Art (first published in English in 1924 and in a revised, Russian-language edition in 1926), though its account of his artistic development is not always accurate. Three English-language biographies have been published: David Magarshack's Stanislavsky: A Life (1950) ; Jean Benedetti's Stanislavski: His Life and Art (1988, revised and expanded 1999). and Nikolai M Gorchakov's \\"Stanislavsky Directs\\" (1954). An out-of-print English translation of Elena Poliakova's 1977 Russian biography of Stanislavski was also published in 1982.","output":"Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski was born in 1863.

He was a major influence on scenic artist Edward Gordon Craig and the acting teachers who followed him, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov.

His two books, the acting manual, An Actor's Work (1938) and an autobiography, My Life in Art (1924) are still read by students of acting."},{"instruction":"I want to lose weight, summarize the new weight-loss findings in this article: \\"A REVOLUTION IN weight loss is apparently underway. It started in 2021, when the FDA approved the diabetes drug semaglutide for weight loss. The weekly injectable—sold under the brand name Wegovy—can help users lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight, leading commentators to describe the drug as both a “medical breakthrough” and a “silver bullet” for obesity. Elon Musk says he’s taking it, Kim Kardashian is rumored to be using it, and everyone from Hollywood to the Hamptons reportedly wants a prescription. Soon, there will be a new weight loss medication on the block—and it’s even more potent than its peers. Last fall, the FDA fast-tracked the review process for using tirzepatide as a weight loss drug after a clinical trial showed that people with BMIs labeled “overweight” or “obese” lost a staggering 22.5 percent of their body weight on the highest dose. If all goes according to plan, that will make Mounjaro the latest in a fast-growing biomedical sector—spanning everything from bariatric surgery to deep brain stimulation for binge-eating—that aims to combat, if not cure, the problem of “excess” weight. For pharmaceutical companies, the race to market is financially motivated: Wegovy and Mounjaro cost more than 1,000 a month. Weight loss drugs are rarely covered by insurance, but people who can afford them have proven they’re willing to pay. And the market seems effectively limitless: Despite an ongoing “war on obesity,” more than 1.9 billion adults globally are considered overweight or obese, and the number of prospective users is growing every year. Now doctors—desperate to treat what is widely seen as an “obesity epidemic”—are coming on board. In January, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended such medications for kids as young as 12. The victorious narratives gilding drugs like Mounjaro are already being positioned as a direct challenge to fat activism. For decades, the movement has pushed for social and economic opportunity for people of all sizes through civil rights, fat pride and liberation, and biomedical evidence itself. Thanks to prominent voices like Aubrey Gordon and Michael Hobbes, many people now know that “lifestyle changes” like calorie restriction and exercise fail to produce sustained weight loss for 97 percent of people and that many dieters end up gaining back more weight than they lost. But what happens to the strength of these arguments when a weight loss drug seems to work? Like other purported weight loss solutions, Mounjaro promises “to fix weight stigma by making you thinner, instead of removing the stigma,” says Susanne Johnson, a fat activist and family nurse practitioner in Pennsylvania. In so doing, these drugs and surgeries further exacerbate anti-fat discrimination. Instead of criticizing people in larger bodies for their perceived lack of willpower—that old “calories in, calories out” adage—people can now blame those in bigger bodies for something more akin to a techno-pessimist, or even anti-science, stance: “Just take the miracle cure!” \\"","output":"The weight-loss findings in the article are the following: A new injectable drug (called Wegovy) has been called a \\"silver bullet\\" for weight loss and has the potential for the user to lose between 5-10% of their body weight. Another drug called tirezpatide showed a 22.5% decrease in body weight in its clinical trial (currently being fast-tracked by the FDA). However, both of these drugs can cost upwards of 1000 a month (weight-loss drugs are usually not covered by insurance)."},{"instruction":"Take the perspective of someone who has a hobby of collecting something very unusual, even something abstract.

Instead of collecting trading cards or stamps, I have an exclusive collection of rare sounds. I go far and wide with my recording equipment to find unusual sounds that no one else in the sound collection community has. I've gone into the depths of the ocean to collect sounds like the call of a humpback whale, I've gone to the Alps to capture the sound of strong wind pushing thick clouds into a mountain, and I've carefully staked out fields to catch the whistle of a peregrine falcon shooting through the air at 200 miles an hour.

Meta has been hit with a record-breaking 1.3 billion fine (€1.2 billion) by EU data regulators, and ordered to stop transferring the Facebook data of EU citizens to the US. EU courts believe such data transfers expose EU citizens to privacy violations — a complaint that stems back to 2013 and revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about US mass surveillance programs. The ruling was made by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), which said that that the current legal framework for data transfers to the US “did not address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms” of Facebook’s EU users and violated GDPR. The fine exceeds the previous EU record of €746 million levied against Amazon in 2021 for similar privacy violations. Transferring data to the US is critical for Meta’s vast ad-targeting operation, which relies on processing multiple streams of personal data from its users. Last year, Meta said it would be forced to consider shutting down Facebook and Instagram in the EU if it wasn’t able to send data back to the US; a warning EU politicians saw as an obvious threat. “Meta cannot just blackmail the EU into giving up its data protection standards,” replied EU lawmaker Axel Voss to the news. “Leaving the EU would be their loss.” Previously, these data transfers were protected by a transatlantic pact known as the Privacy Shield. But this framework was declared invalid in 2020 after the EU’s top court found that it did not protect data from being scraped by US surveillance programs. This ruling was given in response to a claim by Austrian lawyer Max Schrems, whose legal battle against Facebook dates back to 2013 and the original Snowden revelations of US surveillance. Although Meta has now been ordered to stop these data transfers, there are a number of caveats that benefit the US social media giant. First, the ruling only applies to data from Facebook, not other Meta companies like Instagram and WhatsApp. Second, there’s a five-month grace period before Meta has to stop future transfers, and a six-month deadline to stop holding current data in the US. Third, and most important, the EU and US are currently negotiating a new deal to transfer data that could be in place as early as this summer and as late as October. Despite the record-breaking size of the fine, experts expressed doubt that it will change anything fundamental about Meta’s privacy practices. “A billion-euro parking ticket is of no consequence to a company that earns many more billions by parking illegally,” Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, told The Guardian this weekend.","output":"• EU data regulators are fining Meta with a 1.3 billion fine in addition to ordering them to stop transferring data of EU citizens to the U.S. • The Ireland Data Protection Commission (DPC) made the ruling on the data transfers that were once protected by the Privacy Shield, but are no longer. • The filing and subsequent ruling relates to a claim by Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems, dating back to 2013. • A number of caveats will affect the ruling and allow the social media company some allowances, including the fact that only Facebook data is affected and there's a six-month grace period."},{"instruction":"Sum up the tips Joanna gives in the following article. The article: Give the shower curtain some texture Joanna uses a ruffled white shower curtain for this bathroom, which she points out how this will make a statement in such a small space. However, choosing lighter colors still makes the space feel bigger. Add extra lighting One of the things that Joanna encourages people to do is make room in the budget for extra lighting. In the bathroom she designed, Joanna uses a vanity as well as an antique chandelier to give the space plenty of light. And what does light do? “Light makes things feel bigger so that’s the trick,” said Joanna. Learn what effortless tasks clutter-free people do every day. Add a vanity mirror Along with the ruffled shower curtain, Joanna says a vanity mirror can make a huge statement in such a small space. In the bathroom she worked on, she repainted an antique mirror she found, leaving some of the wood unpainted to give it the distressed look. Since the countertop is smaller, Joanna decided to use a raised vessel sink to make the bathroom feel larger.

But before she could become a full-fledged wizard, she still had to go through a magical rite of passage: conquering the Cave of Wonders and discovering its secret. This was no mere test; many mages had died trying to complete this task. First, Zeta had to take a long boat ride to the island where the cave was located. To her dismay, the boat left as soon she as she got out, making her wonder how she would ever get back home. Zeta stepped into the massive chamber. There were three rooms. The first room contained a series of puzzles that required her to cast spells she learned from school. She got through them all and was rewarded with a scroll with a single word on it. It was a strange word, one she didn't recognize. She tried casting a spell with it, but nothing happened. The second room contained a series of moving floors with an endless pit below. Zeta had to use every movement spell she knew to cross it safely. There were a couple of close calls, but she managed her way across. Again, her reward was a scroll with a mysterious word on it. It was a different word this time, but still it did nothing. The final room was filled with treasure. Diamonds, gold, priceless heirlooms, every valuable object imaginable. Just as Zeta was about to pick up a diamond, she sensed that death would befall her if she touched any of the treasure. With great effort, she walked past it all and received the third scroll containing the final word. Zeta returned to the main chamber. Suddenly, an orb appeared in the center. Zeta thought for a minute and realized that she had to cast a spell using the three words on the scrolls. The first two times she tried to do so, nothing happened because the order of the words wasn’t correct. The third time, though, she finally said the words in the right order and was instantly teleported to the Magic School. It was a teleportation spell! All of her friends who already passed the rite were waiting for her, ready to celebrate her success. Zeta was now a full-fledged mage and had learned a teleportation spell to boot!"},{"instruction":"Are these Tarot cards in the Major Arcana or the Minor Arcana?

Lao Tzu was an ancient Chinese philosopher and poet, well-known for penning the book Tao Te Ching. He was the founder of philosophy of Taoism, a religious and ethical custom of ancient China. He is largely respected as a religious deity in various traditional Chinese religious schools of thought. He is also believed by some to be an older contemporary of the famous philosopher Confucius. Lao Tzu’s journey began as he set foot towards the western border of China, currently Tibet. He was saddened by what he saw around him: men being diverted away from nature and the goodness it brings. A guard he met on the border asked Lao to write down his teachings as he went. This is when he wrote the famous Tao Te Ching, a 5,000 character account of his thoughts and philosophical ideas. Like various ancient Chinese philosophers, Lao Tzu made use of rhyme and rhythm, paradoxes and interesting analogies to get his point across in Tao Te Ching. In reality, the entire book can be considered as one great analogy. The ‘Tao Te Ching’, literally meaning ‘The Way and Its Power’ presents the idea of ‘Tao’ as being the end all and be all of existence. It is extremely powerful, yet down to earth. It is the source of all being in the world. The book intends to guide people on how to return to the laws and ways of nature to maintain the balance of the Tao. Tzu is also the father of the Taoist philosophy. Taoism, along with Buddhism and Confucianism, is the pillar of ancient Chinese thought. It is not only a customary philosophy, but it has also taken the shape of a properly organized religion. Though the two elements of religion and philosophy are separate, they are profoundly connected. Lao Tzu’s teachings have encompassed the depths of both. Taoism focuses on leading life according to ‘Tao’ or ‘the path’. It encapsulates moral, ethical and religious Chinese customs. Tao is a concept not exclusive to Taoism; it is also found in various other Chinese philosophies. In Taoism however, it plays a major role. As per Taoism, Tao is deep and overwhelming; it is the all-encompassing. It is both the cause and the effect of every existing thing in the world. Lao Tzu’s philosophy was a simple one. He was against putting effort and striving, as he thought struggle is not only futile but also hinders productivity. In his theory of ‘wu-wei’, he advises to simply do nothing. By this he means not to go against the forces of nature, wait for the gush of events nature brings to you and dive right in. He advised not to struggle to change the natural order of things, but to bring spontaneity to one’s actions as one holds on to the nature’s way of life. Followers of Taoism believe that striving for nothing will never lead them to failure. The one who has never failed is always successful, thus becoming powerful. By understanding this principle, Taoist debates against Confucianism and its endeavors at domination and standardization of all aspects of life, and strives for a lone, deep meditation among nature. Taoists believed that through contemplation, nature will grant them the keys unlocking the powers of the universe. The logic of ‘doing nothing and achieving everything’ reached the rulers and affected the way the kings treated the masses. Thus in a subtle way, Taoism took shape of a political philosophy. Lao Tzu’s works have continued to influence individuals and anti-authoritarian campaigns around the world. Belonging to the sixth century, Lao Tzu, a title given to the great philosopher meaning ‘Old Teacher’, taught the world the importance of the ways of nature and how embracing the principle of doing nothing can help achieve everything.","output":"Question #1: Who was the ancient Chinese philosopher and poet who was well-known for writing the book \\"Tao Te Ching\\"? Answer #1: Lao Tzu was the Chinese philosopher and poet who wrote \\"Tao Te Ching.\\" He is also largely respected as a religious deity in various religious schools of thought. He was also the founder of Taoism. Question #2: How did Lao Tzu's journey in Tibet lead to his writing of the book \\"Tao Te Ching?\\" Answer #2: On Lao Tzu's journey to what is currently Tibet he had a sad reaction to what was going on around him. There were men diverted away from nature and all its goodness. A guard that Lao Tzu met on his trip asked him to write down his teachings on that trip. The 5,000-character account of his thoughts on that journey became the \\"Tao Te Ching.\\" Question #3: What kinds of writing styles did Lao Tzu employ in the \\"Tao Te Ching?\\" Answer #3: In his book, Lao Tzu used rhyme and rhythm, paradoxes, and analogies. Some have even considered the book to be one great analogy. Question #4: What does the title of the book mean and what is its purpose? Answer #4: \\"Tao Te Ching\\" means \\"The Way and Its Power.\\" The idea is that the Tao is the end-all and be-all of existence. It is powerful, but down to earth. The book tries to guide people on how to return to the ways and laws of nature to maintain the balance of the Tao. Question #5: What role did Lao Tzu play in Taoism? Answer #5: Lao Tzu is the father of Taoism, which is one of the three pillars of ancient Chinese thought. Taoism is both a philosophy and an organized religion and Lao Tzu's teachings encompassed the depths of both. Question #6: Explain the concept of Tao and what it means. Answer #6: Tao is also known as \\"the path.\\" However, the term is not exclusive to Taoism. It appears in other Chinese religious customs, but the path plays an important role in Taoism. Tao is both the cause and effect of every living being in the world. Question #7: What are some of the highlights of Lao Tzu's philosophical beliefs? Answer #7: Lao Tzu believed that struggling is futile and harms productivity. He believed in the theory of \\"wu-wei,\\" in which he advises others to do nothing. One should just wait for the events that nature brings to you rather than go against the forces of nature. Following the natural order of things, while still being spontaneous, was most important. Taoists believe that striving for nothing will never fail. Someone who has never failed is always successful and eventually powerful. Question #8: Did Taoism influence other things in society? Answer #8: At the center of Taoism, the idea of doing nothing and achieving everything affected the way the kings treated the general public. Because of this, many think that Taoism helped shaped political philosophy as well. Question: #9: Is Taoism influential today? Answer #9: Lao Tzu's writings continue to influence individuals and anti-authoritarian campaigns worldwide. Lao Tzu, known as \\"Old Teacher,\\" put a strong emphasis on the ways of nature and how sometimes doing nothing can have the largest impact on everything."},{"instruction":"I've been thinking about taking martial arts for self-defense and exercise. What are 5 martial art disciplines that can offer me these things?","output":"While all martial arts are designed to give you a good workout and promote self-defense, here is a list of 5 martial arts that you could learn that will give you the most \\"bang for your buck\\": 1. Brazilian Jiujitsu - One of the best martial arts for both self-defense and a killer workout, Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) provides practitioners with real-world self-defense. Many fights end up on the ground, and those who are not used to maneuvering on their backs will find themselves defenseless, trying to protect against attacks from above. In addition to the self-defense skills you'll learn in BJJ, you'll also get a tremendous workout that is sure to tax your aerobic and anaerobic systems. 2. Muay Thai - This martial art from Thailand is such a huge sport that modern mixed martial artists have incorporated it into their training regimens. Muay Thai is a form of kickboxing that also makes use of elbow and knee strikes, as well as throws and leg sweeps. A good defensive martial art teaches you to strike with multiple different parts of your body, and Muay Thai does just that. You'll also get a great cardio workout doing several rounds of Muay Thai kickboxing against a sparring partner or potential opponent. 3. Kung Fu/Wushu - Kung Fu and Wushu are Chinese martial arts that have been around for centuries. While Kung Fu can mean anything that requires skill (i.e., you can have good \\"Kung Fu\\" washing dishes or driving a car), the martial art of Kung Fu is specifically a fighting art that teaches multiple stances, punches, and kicks, the most popular of which mimic the movements of animals like the snake, the crane, and the tiger. A great workout can be had practicing stances and forms that require you to stand in unusual positions, such as a horse stance, for several minutes at a time. Wushu (the competitive version of Kung Fu) stresses the importance of performative martial art through high jumps and kicks, twirls, flips, and other choreographed moves. 4. Judo - Much like the other grappling arts, Judo is a Japanese art that involves throwing one's opponent and also using their momentum and body weight against themselves. In addition to throws, Judo also practices grappling (both on the ground and while standing) and submissions (joint locks, strangles). Judo can be likened to lifting weights due to having to throw and carry your opponent, which can be tiring. 5. Karate - Karate, like its Chinese counterpart in Kung Fu, is a martial art that involves the use of strikes and stances. However, Karate's development in Japan created a martial art that promotes striking opponents hard and fast; straight punches and kicks that snap from the waist are favored over the flowery techniques of Kung Fu and Wushu. As with all the other martial arts listed above, Karate offers a great workout practicing striking and forms."},{"instruction":"I'd like you to write a conversation between two anime girls who are in art club talking after school about their plans for after graduation.

Long replies run the risk of being misinterpreted. Pick one major point of contention within his email and respond directly to that. - Organize your thoughts.

Take a moment to try and understand the root of the issue, including analyzing the situation from your boss's perspective, and ensure your thoughts make sense before you send your reply. - Be polite. De-escalate the situation by sending a calm and well-mannered reply. Resist the temptation to meet anger with anger as that could make a tense situation even worse. If you remain polite, you increase the likelihood that he will eventually calm down and your conversation can become productive. - Don't be defensive. Your boss is responding with emotion, not reason, so don't give him more justification to be emotional by sending a response that is overly defensive. Instead, appeal to his logic and reason so that you can work together to resolve the issue rather than argue about it."},{"instruction":"Classify the following text messages as Toxic or Non-Toxic.

Name five venomous underwater animals and tell me a bit about them.","output":"1. Lionfish These fish have venomous spines along their backs for protection. Lionfish are slow swimmers, so they need envenomation as protection against larger, more predatory sea creatures. For humans, lionfish stings are rarely fatal unless there’s an extreme allergic reaction to the venom. However, the sting is still tremendously painful and causes diarrhea, extreme nausea, and headaches. 2. Sea Snakes One of the most venomous aquatic animals in the world, sea snakes are often reluctant to bite unless severely threatened. However, their one drop of venom is potent enough to kill an adult human. 3. Cone Snails Cone snails use a venomous harpoon for both protection and prey. They are extremely slow movers, so envenomation is their only hope for caching meals of marine worms, small fish, and mollusks. These snails have bright shells with intricate, unique patterns, which can be a detriment to humans. One dose of harpoon venom has the potential to internally damage, or even kill, hundreds of people. 4. Stonefish The stonefish looks like a rock, which means swimmers in the Indian and Pacific Oceans often step on these fish by mistake. The fish is covered with venomous spikes that shove venom into whatever it comes into contact with. Their stings are excruciating and can be fatal to humans. 5. Flower Urchin One of the most dangerous urchins on the planet, flower urchins are covered in venomous stingers. One touch can lead to paralysis of muscles, lips, and eyes, but the pain diminishes quickly, typically in 15 minutes or less. However, an extreme allergic reaction can result in hospitalization or death for humans."},{"instruction":"Who painted the Sistine Chapel's ceiling and what does it depict?","output":"The Sistine Chapel's ceiling, located in the Vatican City, was painted by the Renaissance artist Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512 under the patronage of Pope Julius II.

Her tanned, faded vest had many large pockets on each side, bulging from the aromatic dried herbs within, and her dark brown leggings were comfortable and dry, not too tight, tucked neatly into her stained and worn leather boots. Despite her impressive physical size and simple goat-herding life, Mirra diligently searched for the mountain blackberries. She would erupt into childlike glee, and break into a silly dance upon finding the rare patch. She’d eat until her hands and teeth were stained purple, then bring the remainder of her treasure home to share."},{"instruction":"Write a sonnet that has 14 lines broken into 2 6-line stanzas followed by a couplet.

Rhetoric is the act of persuading people in writing or orally to accept the writer’s or speaker’s argument as correct. Rhetoric uses three strategies to persuade: Logos, Ethos, and Pathos. In English, we know them as Logic, Ethics, and Emotion. Pathos/Emotion means to persuade by direct appeal to a person’s emotions so that they feel what the author wants them to feel. To accomplish this, the author chooses words, examples, and stories that evoke emotion. The ensuing emotional responses such as anger, frustration, or amusement can lead people to become sympathetic to the author’s position. Logos/Logic means to persuade by direct appeal to a person’s logical reasoning. To accomplish this, the author presents clear, logical connections between ideas, that are supported by facts and statistics or by presenting analogies. If the arguments presented contain unclear or erroneous assumptions in facts or analogic connections, known as logical fallacies, the argument can fail. Ethos/Ethics means to persuade by convincing a person of the author’s inherent credibility based on the author’s credentials and/or the credentials of the sources of facts and ideas presented as part of the argument. To accomplish this, the author presents their own and/or their sources’ academic, professional, and/or authorial history, details their personal experience as it relates to the issue, and demonstrates their complete understanding of the issue’s complexities by using counter arguments to an opposing position."},{"instruction":"How many months are in a Mayan calendar?","output":"The Mayan calendar dances to the beat of its own drums and boasts a spectacular 18 months."},{"instruction":"How many months are in a Chinese calendar?","output":"The Chinese calendar takes things to a whole new level with a splendid lineup of 12 lunar months that will rocket you to the moon!"},{"instruction":"How many months are in the Islamic calendar?","output":"Unlike the conventional 12 months, the Islamic calendar glides through time with a graceful dance of 12 lunar months."},{"instruction":"Pretend you are Simba from The Lion King.

Porthole windows that look like googly eyes peering out from lumpy, butter-colored walls. Zigzagging roofs and soaring archways. If this mind-bending vision sounds like something that might have been dreamt up by school pupils, that’s because it was – and now those dreams have become reality in the eccentric, off-kilter shape of Madrid’s Reggio school (main picture). Designed by Spanish architect Andrés Jaque, the Reggio’s radical construction not only brings nature indoors but also encourages plant and animal life to colonize its ‘living’ exterior walls. Clad in an insulating mixture of mashed cork, it offers an ideal habitat, not unlike the surface of a tree, for fungi, insects and microbial life. Classrooms look out onto gardens – some inaccessible to humans – created by ecologists to attract birds, butterflies, bats and bees. Inside, a courtyard hosts the miniature temperate rainforest which rises two stories to the glass canopy above. Labs and workshops are arranged around its edges. The school’s design is a living embodiment of the radical Reggio-Emilia method, an educational philosophy developed in postwar Italy. It sees children not as empty vessels to be filled with education, but as active participants in defining their curriculum. Experience – touching, listening and first-hand discovery – lie at the heart of the learning process. Connection with the outdoors is key and the physical environment is imagined as the ‘third teacher’, with spaces configured to encourage open-ended exploration.","output":"Because they share the same educational values as the radical Italian education reformer Reggio Emilia, the administration and teachers of this school invited the students to participate in the design of the facility. According to this approach, experiential learning is the foundation of education, and the best way to learn is to incorporate experiences like touching, hearing, and hands-on learning into any effective curriculum."},{"instruction":"Hey AI, help me find a list of breweries to visit in Las Vegas for my upcoming trip.

Impeachment triggers Paxton’s immediate suspension from office pending the outcome of a trial in the state Senate and empowers Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to appoint someone else as Texas’ top lawyer in the interim. The 121-23 vote constitutes an abrupt downfall for one of the GOP’s most prominent legal combatants, who in 2020 asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn President Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of Donald Trump.

For young children, play is often a full body activity that helps them develop skills they will need later in life. Running, dancing, climbing, rolling—these activities all foster muscle development and help fine-tune motor skills. Children also build their mental and emotional muscles as they create elaborate, imaginative worlds rich with a system of rules that govern the terms of play. University of Denver researchers Elena Bodrova, Carrie Germeroth, and Deborah J. Leong found that children teach themselves to regulate their emotions and think before they act when they play. For example, if a child is pretending to be Olaf from Frozen, they may pretend they’re melting when they come inside or insist that they like warm hugs. In each case, they consider how their actions will correlate with how Olaf should act in a given situation. This role playing helps children build social skills and helps them become the kind of adults who are able to thrive in a range of personal and professional environments.","output":"Playing helps children's muscle development and fine-tune motor skills because of the full-body movement.

This calcium deficiency can be caused by several factors such as inconsistent watering, extreme heat or drought conditions, over-fertilizing, root damage, or soil containing improper pH levels or too much water. Here are some tips to prevent blossom end rot: •Water plants consistently - Fruiting vegetables need steady watering free from the extremes of drying out or being waterlogged. •Test and adjust the calcium levels in the soil - Fresh soil is likely to have sufficient calcium level whereas used soil may be lacking calcium. Organic calcium sources include lime, bone meal, and finely crushed egg shells. •Test and adjust pH in the soil - The pH in the soil affects the plant’s ability to absorb nutrients. The ideal pH range for growing vegetables is 6.5 to 7.5. •Use fertilizers that include calcium - Ordinary fertilizer contains nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus that do not change calcium levels. •Avoid root damage - Damaged roots can prevent the plant from properly intaking water and calcium."},{"instruction":"I think I want to be a journalist.

My witches don't ride brooms, melt when they get wet, or have ugly warts on their noses, for example. Can you give me some ideas that would add validity without perpetuating stereotypes?","output":"Of course! Here are some realistic ideas you could use: • Holidays: One way to lend a sense of realism to your novel is to include details of Wiccan or Pagan holidays, rather than the traditional Christian holidays. Many of the Christian holidays actually borrow their origins or dates from the original Pagan versions, which focused more on nature. Some examples are Samhain, which is aligned with Halloween, the Day of the Dead, and Yule, the winter ritual now associated with Christmas. • Interests: Many people today still participate in palm or tea leaf reading, so this could add a sense of realism to your story. Tarot and astrology are also still popular practices. • Historical details: Including information about the real historical events surrounding the Witch Trials brings a sense of validity to a story as well. Tens of thousands of accused witches were executed during the European witch hunts. As Puritans and other settlers traveled West to the colonies, the negative perceptions and accusations continued. The Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts occurred in 1692-1693 during which there were at least 20 executions and more than 200 witch accusations. Something as simple as having a pet cat, a sour attitude, or a lucky streak could put a woman in danger of witch accusations. If executed, these women could be hung, burned, or drowned. • Names: Beyond the history of the Witch Trials, researching the time period and using common names of the era (Jonathon, Thomas, Samuel, William, Sarah, and Bridget, for example) will make the story seem more grounded. I hope these inspire the necessary details for your novel!"},{"instruction":"Write a summary of the children's book, The Secret Garden. Include a second paragraph telling about the author and some facts about her life. Keep it between 275-300 words.","output":"The Secret Garden is a children's novel that focuses on self-healing through contact with nature. The lead character, Mary, is a spoiled child that was from a wealthy family, but who finds herself an orphan when her parents both die from an epidemic of cholera. She is sent to live with her widowed uncle, and she grows to become angry and very withdrawn. She finds out that somewhere on the grounds of the home there is a locked garden space that her uncle's deceased wife loved and cared for before she died. Mary finds the garden and begins to bring it back to life, taking time to weed and clear overgrown areas. As she spends her time and energy cultivating the secret garden, Mary's disposition changes and she becomes more friendly and kind. She eventually will share the garden with her uncle's son, who believes he has a spinal deformity, and in the garden, he will find strength and hope again. Eventually, Mary's uncle finds out about the children's work in the garden and embraces it, along with his family in a way that brings the story to a happy close. Much like the character Mary in the Secret Garden, the author Frances Hodgson Burnett, lost her own father when she was a small child. Her family then moved from Manchester England to New Market, Tennessee, where they were promised help from an uncle. Although the uncle's support didn't ever materialize, Frances' family managed to make a life for themselves in the United States. Frances found a love for writing and storytelling that would lead her to author The Secret Garden and another children's novel titled Little Lord Fauntleroy."},{"instruction":"What is the mechanism of the 'red-eye effect' observed in flash photography, and how can it be minimized?","output":"The 'red-eye effect' is a common phenomenon seen in flash photography, where the subject's eyes appear red in the photograph. This effect is the result of light from the flash entering the subject's eye and reflecting off the blood-rich retina, the layer at the back of the eye responsible for sensing light. When the flash is used in low light conditions, the subject's pupils are typically dilated to let in more light for better vision. This also allows more of the flash's light to enter the eye and reflect off the retina. The reflected light, appearing red due to the blood vessels in the retina, then travels back to the camera and registers on the photo. Several techniques can help minimize the red-eye effect. Many cameras come with a 'red-eye reduction' feature, which works by emitting pre-flashes or continuous light before the actual flash. This causes the subject's pupils to contract, reducing the amount of light that can enter the eye and reflect off the retina. Another method is to increase the ambient lighting, causing the subject's pupils to contract naturally. Changing the angle between the camera, subject, and flash source can also help reduce the red-eye effect, as less light will reflect directly back into the camera lens."},{"instruction":"Write an email to my girlfriend, Jessie.

Skye thought he was the best pigeon, but Priscilla certainly would always knock the wind from his wings with her gorgeous feathers.

Materials and Methods One pair of tennis shoes - Laced One pair of tennis shoes - Velcro (Control) Twelve-Inch nylon braided shoe lace - Brown Two feet. We will run six trials, three with the laced shoe on the left foot and the velcroed shoe on the right, and three in the reverse configuration. The velcro method has already demonstrated the ability to remain affixed to the foot for the assigned period and will serve as a control. We will first form two bunny ears with our lace. We will cross the lace at a point approximately centered on the foot. We will pull the lace through the juncture point until it is tight. We will proceed to walk around in our shoes and record whether the shoe becomes loose before the end of the day. Results For our three trials with the left shoe laced, the lace was successfully tied three times. Twice it remained tied for the full day. Once it was loosened on a branch. For our three trials with the right shoe laced, the lace was successfully tied twice. Once it was pulled loose during the attempt to tighten the knot. Both times the knot lasted for the full day. All six trials with the velcro remained tightened for the full day. Possible Sources of Error One possible source of error is external debris. Another possible source of error is human error resulting from a lack of finger dexterity. Conclusion The Bunny Ears method shows some promise, successfully attaching a shoe to the appropriate foot for the full duration of one day on four out of six trials. It still did not achieve the same efficiency as the Velcro method.

The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day. The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds. The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water. So he knocked on the door and said: Little pig! Little pig! Let me in! Let me in!

But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil.

Hard work was a foreign concept to him and he chose to build his house out of fragile straw. Despite being a little more diligent, the second little pig lacked genuine ambition. He fashioned his dwelling from feeble sticks. Together, they passed away their time, singing, dancing, and foolishly believing in their invincibility. In the shadows of their flimsy homes, a wolve crept, driven by hunger and a predatory instinct. Its predatory eyes spotted the straw house, and its mouth began to salivate as the alluring smell of the pig drifted through the air. The wolf growled and banged and banged on the door with a menacing tone. \\"Little pig! Little pig! Let me in! Let me in!\\" Fear tightened the first little pig's heart as he glimpsed the wolf's menacing paws through the keyhole. Trembling, he replied: \\"No! No! No! Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\\" Enraged, the wolf bared its fangs and snarled: \\"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.\\" With a mighty gust, it huffed and it puffed, until the flimsy straw house crumbled before its power. The wolf lunged, its jaws snapping shut with a vicious hunger. But the first little pig narrowly escaped, fleeing to seek refuge with his slightly more resourceful brother. Unfazed, the wolf continued to pursue its prey down the narrow lane. It noticed the second house, which was made of flimsy sticks. The pigs inside felt the threat after spotting the wolf's protruding ears through the keyhole. Fear flooded their bodies as they adamantly proclaimed \\"No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\\" The wolf's hunger swelled, consuming its senses, and clouding its judgment. It snarled, revealing sharp teeth: \\"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!\\" The wolf unleashed its fury, unleashing a tempest that tore the flimsy building to pieces.

Exhausted and breathless, the wolf succumbed to defeat, forced to pause and gather its waning strength. In a twisted revelation, the wolf devised a diabolical plan. Frenzied with fury, it vowed to descend through the chimney and consume the little pig as its final prize. Unbeknownst to the wolf, the clever pig had stoked a blazing fire and set a cauldron of boiling water to simmer. As the wolf descended into the depths of the chimney, the pig removed the lid, and with a sudden thud, the predator plunged into the scalding inferno.

Every autumn when the acorns began to drop from the trees, he would fly about the forest picking up as many as he could carry at one time. He would put them in the hollow he called home high in the forest’s most ancient oak. All the while cantankerous squirrels watched hoping they could take a big bite out of Jack’s growing horde. Like all autumnal blue jays, Jack ate the acorns ravenously. Though Jack also had a magical talent - to sense precisely which acorns had the potential to grow into the most powerful and bountiful of oak trees. Whenever Jack found one of these acorns, he would bury it in the forest floor, carefully covering it again with rich soil. Year by year, Jack’s carefully selected acorns sprouted, growing into majestic oak trees that towered over the forest floor. Jack took pride in knowing that he’d played a small part in shaping the forest's landscape. Then one June, a ferocious storm swept through the ancient, shattering trees, uprooting mighty oaks, and decimating large tracks of forest. Jack watched in horror as the storm threatened to uproot his beloved oak tree. Seeing their moment, the squirrel broke out and charged the hollow looking to pillage Jack’s hoard. They took every last acorn, nut by nut, until the entire stash was bare, and Jack’s heart was broken. When the storm passed, Jack’s blessed acorns were gone, his beloved tree was decimated, and the forest was sundered. He laid down on the ground in total surrender. His life’s work was seemingly destroyed. Preparing to draw his last breath, Jack lifted his eyes and saw the first cotyledon leaf of an oak sapling pushing up through the forest soil. It was one of the acorns he’d planted. Hope would spring a new, and one day the forest would be healed. Jack’s legacy lived on in the towering oak trees that sprang up in the rejuvenated forest.

Continue with the introduction of healthy eating habits to incorporate into daily life to maintain a healthy weight, such as introducing a lot of variety, regular meals, drinking water, and eating only until feeling full. 3. Next, you can focus on listing a number of healthy weight-loss options. These can include well-known diets that people have likely heard of before, such as intermittent fasting, paleo, the blood group diet, and similar. 4. You can then narrow your focus to discuss weight loss for specific groups with certain medical issues, such as gluten-free diets, dairy-free diets, the keto diet, and different options for food substitutes when dealing with allergies. 5. In the end, it's a good idea to focus on physical exercise to help with weight loss. It's worth mentioning starting with low-intensity training such as walking or speed walking and gradually increasing the intensity to jogging, running, and programs such as Zumba or Aqua Gym.

The thrill and guilt grew bigger each time. We joked and laughed with the old people who owned the store. We paid for five bucks of snacks as we stole twenty more. Then I couldn’t do it anymore. “John,” I said. “We have to stop. We’re going to get caught. They’ll kick us off the team. They might throw us out of school.” “Just one more time,” he said. “Come on, Pete. They’re too old to catch us.” “I can’t do it, man.” “You’ve always been a wuss.” I walked home alone while John went to the store. I thought he might text or call me after he left the store. I didn’t hear anything from him. When I got to school the next morning, I immediately heard the bad news. John had been caught shoplifting. I knew they’d wonder how I was involved. John and I went everywhere together. Halfway through first period, I was summoned to the principal’s office. He was there with the superintendent, the school counselor, and the football coach. It felt like an interrogation. “Peter,” the principal said. “I’m sure you know why you’re here.” “Because of John,” I said. “Yes,” he said. “Did you know what he was doing? Were you involved?” I wanted to tell the truth. I knew that I should confess. But it felt like I’d destroy my life by admitting to the crime. I wondered if John had already told them that I’d stolen nearly as often as he had. Did he do the right thing? “Pete,” the principal asked again. “Were you involved in this?” “No, sir,” I said. They all studied my face. They knew I was lying. They wouldn’t let me get away with it. “Okay, Pete,” the principal said. “John already told us he did it alone.” I could tell they hadn’t believed him, either. But there was nothing they could do. I hadn’t confessed and John had denied that I was a thief, too. He was kicked off the football team, sentenced to community service picking up litter around town, and was suspended from school for a month. During that month, he and I didn’t see each other. We didn’t call or text. We’d been constantly together for years but things had changed. I don’t know why he didn’t contact me. But I was too ashamed to talk to him. I’d let him take all the punishment. I kept playing football. I didn’t have to scoop up dog shit while my classmates watched. I wasn’t suspended. And my reputation wasn’t ruined. I wasn’t branded as a good kid gone bad. In fact, some people thought John had betrayed me by shoplifting and nearly getting me into trouble. When John came back to school, he wouldn’t look at me. And I wouldn’t look at him. This silence went on for the rest of the year. We ignored each other at our graduation ceremony. Our parents ignored each other, too. Late that night, at a kegger down by the river, we stood at separate campfires. I didn’t drink anything. But he got really drunk. I was worried for him. He caught me staring. He threw his beer into the fire and staggered up to me. He grabbed me by my shirt and shook me. “You aren’t who I thought you were,” he said. “Neither are you,” I said.","output":"Valediction After the monotonous routines of school and football practice, day after day for three long years, John and I embarked on our ritualistic pilgrimage to the humble grocery store in our quaint little town. Candy, potato chips, and soda pop adorned our baskets, as if offerings to a forbidden sanctuary. It was a ceremony, a familiar dance etched into the fabric of our mundane lives. We exchanged pleasantries with the aging couple who presided over the store, disappearing into the chilled embrace of the walk-in cooler. Our hands grasped the icy allure of our chosen beverages, and with a nod of acquiescence, we sealed our fates. The transaction completed, our pockets weighed down by the weight of our guilty pleasures, we embarked on our respective paths, destined for either John's house or mine, dictated by the whims of our parents' culinary intentions. In the realm of two average kids, our existence seemed defined by banality. But then, one fateful day in the cold embrace of November, during our final year of high school, something inexplicable occurred. As we stepped into the cool haven of the store, our eyes met, and a silent understanding passed between us. The origin of that shared impulse eluded us, lost in the labyrinth of our subconscious minds. Without uttering a word, John and I seized three six-packs of soda, secreting them within the depths of our duffle bags. Laden with our ill-gotten carbonated treasures, we surreptitiously paid for our usual assortment of junk food, hastening to John's sanctuary or mine. In the sanctum of his bedroom, we reveled in our audacity. We consumed every drop of soda, surrendering ourselves to a tempest of sugar and caffeine-induced euphoria. We could have pilfered beer, yet our status as athletes forbade such indulgence. Jocks were not meant to succumb to inebriation within the halls of our revered institution. The following morning, we reunited before the dawn of a new day, pledging to renounce our transgressions. One instance of juvenile innocence, perhaps forgivable, but beyond that threshold lay the realms of criminality. And yet, after that night's practice, we succumbed to temptation once more. And again the next day. Our shoplifting spree spanned an entire week. With each passing theft, the intoxicating blend of thrill and guilt swelled within us. We bantered and chuckled with the elderly store owners, masquerading behind the facade of innocence. We paid for a paltry sum of five dollars' worth of snacks while surreptitiously pocketing an additional twenty. But then, a breaking point shattered the fragile equilibrium. \\"John,\\" I mustered the courage to speak. \\"We have to cease this madness. We're risking everything. We'll be caught, expelled from the team, and potentially expelled from school.\\" \\"Just one more time,\\" he retorted, his voice laced with reckless bravado. \\"Come on, Pete. They're too feeble to apprehend us.\\" \\"I can't do it, man,\\" I confessed, my resolve faltering under the weight of impending consequences. \\"You've always been a coward,\\" his words pierced my heart. Alone, I trudged the path homeward, while John ventured to the store. I anticipated a text or a call, a desperate plea for solidarity, a lifeline amidst the chaos. But the deafening silence persisted. As I entered the hallowed halls of our educational institution the next morning, a gust of foreboding news greeted my ears. John had been apprehended, caught in the act of shoplifting. The inevitable questions followed. How was I involved? John and I were inseparable, two sides of the same coin. Midway through the first period, I received a summons to the principal's office. There, an assembly of authority awaited me— the principal, the superintendent, the school counselor, and the football coach. The room bore the weight of an imminent inquisition. \\"Peter,\\" the principal's voice reverberated, brimming with knowing authority. \\"I'm certain you're aware of the reason for your presence here.\\" \\"Because of John,\\" I answered, my voice a mere whisper. \\"Yes,\\" he affirmed. \\"Did you know of his actions? Were you complicit?\\" The truth beckoned, a gnawing urge within me. I understood the necessity of confession. Yet, the repercussions loomed, threatening to obliterate the life I had known. Did John already divulge the extent of my involvement, implicating me in a web of guilt? Did he do the honorable thing? \\"Pete,\\" the principal pressed, his gaze probing the depths of my soul. \\"Were you an accomplice in this crime?\\" \\"No, sir,\\" I lied, the words a brittle facade stretched across the chasm of my deceit. They scrutinized me, their piercing gazes unmasking my falsehood. They refused to let me escape unscathed. \\"Very well, Pete,\\" the principal declared, his tone laden with reluctant acceptance. \\"John has already confessed to acting alone.\\" I sensed the lingering doubt that clung to their minds, their unspoken suspicion of the truth. But in the absence of my confession and John's denial of my involvement, their hands were tied. John was banished from the football team, handed the penance of community service, and suspended from school for an agonizing month. During that interminable period of separation, we became strangers to one another. No calls, no texts. The unbreakable bond forged over years of camaraderie shattered. The weight of shame held me captive, preventing me from reaching out. I let John bear the brunt of the punishment, while I continued to play football, blissfully untouched by the spectacle of picking up litter under the scrutinizing gaze of our peers. I remained unsuspended, my reputation unscathed. Yet, an insidious undercurrent of betrayal crept through the whispers of some, as if John had betrayed me with his theft, nearly ensnaring me in the mire of his actions. When John finally returned to school, he averted his gaze, an impenetrable wall erected between us. And I mirrored his silent rejection. The void of our unspoken words persisted throughout the year, casting a palpable shadow over our graduation ceremony. Our parents mirrored our silence, their connection severed by the echoes of shame. Under the cloak of darkness, amidst the revelry of a riverside kegger, we stood at opposite ends of separate campfires. Liquid courage coursed through his veins, while I abstained from its siren song. Intoxication marred his faculties, and in his altered state, he noticed my gaze fixed upon him. With a vehement motion, he hurled his beer into the fire, staggering toward me. His fingers clenched my shirt, his grip a vice. \\"You are not the person I believed you to be,\\" his voice trembled with disillusionment. \\"Nor are you,\\" I retorted, our words a whispered lament in the abyss between us."},{"instruction":"Write a formal complaint letter from my pet cat about how unacceptable it was that dinner was 20 minutes late last night.","output":"Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to inform you that my dinner was unacceptably late last night.

Christian could not tell if what he was seeing was real or not, so he brushed it off as if it was a long day. Waking up, he all but forgot about the strange occurrences last night. That was until he made it down to his kitchen to prepare his pre-workout protein shake. Upon entering the kitchen, he noticed the back sliding door was slightly open. Christian ran over to close it and turned around to scan his surroundings and that was when noticed the same long white night dress standing in the opposite corner of the room.

Christian begins shaking violently and that was finally enough for him to wake up in a pool of his sweat, realizing that it was just a nightmare."},{"instruction":"Write a paragraph to summarize the history of Calico, California. In 1881, four prospectors were leaving Grapevine Station (present day Barstow, California) for a mountain peak to the northeast. After they described the peak as \\"calico-colored\\", the peak, the mountain range to which it belonged, and the town that followed were all called Calico.[5] The four prospectors discovered silver in the mountain and opened the Silver King Mine, which was California's largest silver producer in the mid-1880s.[5][6] John C. King, who had grubstaked the prospectors who discovered the silver vein (the Silver King Mine was thus named after him), was the uncle of Walter Knott founder of Knott's Berry Farm. King was sheriff of San Bernardino County from 1879 to 1882.[7][8][9][10] A post office at Calico was established in early 1882, and the Calico Print, a weekly newspaper, started publishing. The town soon supported three hotels, five general stores, a meat market, bars, brothels, and three restaurants and boarding houses. The county established a school district and a voting precinct.[11][12] The town also had a deputy sheriff and two constables, two lawyers and a justice of the peace, five commissioners, and two doctors. There was also a Wells Fargo office and a telephone and telegraph service.[5] At its height of silver production during 1883 and 1885,[11] Calico had over 500 mines and a population of 1,200 people.[5] Local badmen were buried in the Boot Hill cemetery.[13][14] The discovery of the borate mineral colemanite in the Calico mountains a few years after the settlement of the town also helped Calico's fortunes, and in 1890 the estimated population of the town was 3,500, with nationals of China, England, Ireland, Greece, France, and the Netherlands, as well as Americans living there.[15] In the same year, the Silver Purchase Act was enacted and drove down the price of silver.[5] By 1896, its value had decreased to 0.57 per troy ounce, and Calico's silver mines were no longer economically viable.[5] The post office was discontinued in 1898,[16] and the school closed not long after.[11] By the turn of the century, Calico was all but a ghost town,[15] and with the end of borax mining in the region in 1907 the town was completely abandoned.[citation needed] Many of the original buildings were moved to Barstow, Daggett and Yermo.[15] An attempt to revive the town was made in about 1915, when a cyanide plant was built to recover silver from the unprocessed Silver King Mine's deposits. Walter Knott and his wife Cordelia, founders of Knott's Berry Farm, were homesteaded at Newberry Springs around this time, and Knott helped build the redwood cyanide tanks for the plant.[15][17]","output":"The ghost town of Calico got its name from four traveling prospectors in 1881 who left Grapevine Station in Barstow to go to a mountain peak to the northeast. These prospectors described the peak as \\"calico-colored\\", and the name of Calico stuck. The prospectors discovered silver in this mountain range and opened the Silver King Mine, which was named after John C. King, the uncle of Walter Knott, founder of Knott's Berry Farm. Calico established its post office in early 1882, and its local weekly newspaper called the Calico Print started publishing shortly after. Calico also benefitted from the discovery of borate mineral colemanite in its mountains and had a population of 3,500 in 1890. The Silver Purchase Act was enacted the same year, driving down the price of silver. The value of silver decreased to 0.57 per troy ounce by 1896, which made Calico's silver mines undesirable, leaving Calico a ghost town by the start of the 20th century."},{"instruction":"I have a decent pico de gallo recipe that I like that contains 12 oz Roma tomatoes, 4 oz white onions, 4 serrano chile peppers, 12 cilantro sprigs, 4 garlic cloves, 3/4 tsp salt, and 1 1/2 tsp fresh lime juice.

Jerry Springer, a broadcaster, author, politician, journalist, actor, lawyer and host of a daytime show so outrageous he once apologized by saying it \\"ruined the culture,\\" died today at age 79 in his suburban Chicago home after a brief illness, according to a statement from his family. Though he had a lot of high-profile jobs over his lifetime – including mayor of Cincinnati – Springer was best known as host of The Jerry Springer Show, a syndicated TV program which lasted for 27 years, featuring provocatively sensational topics and confrontations among the guests, sometimes degenerating into fistfights. Springer started his talk show in 1991 as a more conventional affair. Dressed in a suit and tie with glasses, he looked like a younger version of talk-TV titan Phil Donahue, and questioned guests while roaming the crowd with a wireless microphone in the same way. But over time, Springer began to feature more outrageous guests and subjects, with cheating spouses, open racists, and button-pushing, explicit issues guaranteed to spark arguments. The show's success became one of the pillars of the tabloid talk show movement which included hosts like Maury Povich, Sally Jessy Raphael, Jenny Jones, Montel Williams and Morton Downey Jr. Springer, a likable, charismatic guy with a conventional look and just-asking-questions manner, always came across as a more buttoned-down counterpoint to his outrageous guests.","output":"After a brief illness, Jerry Springer died at age 79.

I've been unemployed after being fired from the career I was in for many years, so I only had the money left from the sale of our house to live off of for a couple of years. Living in my area of the US, prices for everything (gas, food, utilities, etc.) are so inflated that the money from the house's sale was quickly gone. Finding myself homeless and worrying about how I will feed myself and my kids worried me constantly. I decided the best thing to do was apply for nutritional assistance. I was able to get food assistance, but I was not able to get cash assistance, which would have helped with putting gas in my vehicle to take the kids to school and picking them up from school, as well as driving to the grocery store for our food. So, I had to resort to finding any and every gig job, online survey job, and other ways to scrape enough money to put gas in my car. After I was able to do this, I then had to worry about how to pay for my Internet access, cell phone, and other non-food necessities like toilet paper, utensils for eating our food, toothpaste, bath soap, laundry detergent, and everything else not covered by SNAP benefits. As of today, I still struggle to make ends meet, ensure my kids and I are fed, and raise the kids so they can be prepared to live their lives on their own when they get older. I am afraid of them falling into the same situation as me, so I work hard to ensure they are taken care of and can live a carefree life while I'm still here for them."},{"instruction":"Can you provide a brief synopsis of Schitt's Creek?

As she was going to sleep, she heard a large crash. A branch had fallen from one of the trees. Hopefully, it hadn't hit anything on the way down. There were a lot of big trees around the house, and she was nervous about one falling on her while she slept. Because of this, sleep took a long time to come. She seemed to sleep for years, and when she woke up, she was shivering with cold. It was terribly bright, and everything was white. Just white. Even the sky. The sky! She was outdoors, but somehow not cold. Where was she? There was absolutely nothing in any direction but white snow and ice. She could hardly tell which way was up. She began to walk, and she walked for a long time. She was surprised to see she was wearing snow boots and a snowsuit, both as white as the snow. Eventually, she came down a hill and saw a little glimmer of darkness. Was it water? As it got closer, she realized it wasn't. Instead, it was hundreds of penguins, all huddled up together. She approached the group, and they squawked at her in alarm. She couldn't stay here alone forever, though. One penguin left the group and came over to her. Instead of squawking, it said in a polite British accent, \\"Miss? Can you help me with something? I'm trying to find the answer to Fermat's last theorem. Do you have any ideas what the next step might be?\\" The penguin handed her a notebook full of math symbols. Pages and pages of them. Alice looked at them, and then back at the penguin. She fainted.

Tesla’s report finds that an economy built on sustainable energy is not only feasible, it is economically preferable. The switch would require “less investment and less material extraction than continuing today’s unsustainable energy economy,” Tesla found. The investment needed to develop a sustainable economy—based on an electrical grid and manufacturing industry powered by renewable energy and electrified transportation—would be 10 trillion, but sticking to oil, coal, and natural gas would end up costing 14 trillion globally over the next two decades, according to the paper, a difference in price roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of Germany.","output":"While laying out the details of his Master Plan 3, Elon Musk noted that an economy built on sustainable energy is preferable to one that isn't.

For centuries, the tyranny of the mammoth's reign rendered the tribe to live in fear and famine, but no longer. It towered over the small tribe of 20, like ants to an anteater, it was over 50 grown men tall, and each footstep it took ravaged the ground, forcing them to regain their footing. Each breath it took from its coiling trunk had enough force to knock them clean off their feet, and its menacingly sharp ivory tusks could pierce them like a knife through butter. Despite all this, none around it showed signs of backing down. They had families and friends to protect, and knew in unison, that they could defeat it. It was slowing down. The mammoth had already claimed the lives of many; men, women, children, and animals. It bore no difference to the behemoth, for it killed anything its crimson, sinister eyes gazed upon. The tribe slowly circled it. Spears of stone and shields of wood in hand, they would rhythmically bang the two together, an ensemble of cymbals followed by chants of valor. In their language, it meant \\"to do or die\\". Though they flowed around the beast like water, not one of them possessed liquid courage of any sort. In a burst of energy, they would lunge forward, swiping, stabbing, and piercing the Mammoth's feet. Each attempt may have looked futile, but it was death by a thousand cuts. The woolly demon would buck and sway, its deafening yowl didn't seem to phase any member of the tribe. The tribe's roars and chants were the opposing force in this cacophonous symphony. One by one, each would lunge and deftly dodge the towering beast's legs. They knew it would only take one hit for their lives to be over, so they could afford no mistakes. The mammoth would aggressively spin its body around, hoping to slice anything in its range with its blade-like tusks, but the tribe responded in kind. They would skilfully dodge the beast's rage and strike back in kind. Bit by bit, they struck in tandem. Suddenly, the mammoth let out a disorienting wail and slumped to the ground.

Chapman's scorching start to 2023 has been driven by one thing above all else: elite opposite-field power. He looks like a lefty slugger in the right-handed batter's box. The Blue Jays third baseman said he was going to do this, when he made the adjustment that let him unlock the right side of the field: switching from a leg kick to a toe tap in his swing, motivated by his low batting average and high strikeout totals in his first year in Toronto and final year in Oakland.","output":"His swing used to feature a leg kick, and now it features a toe tap instead.

Brief History of Ice Cream First ice creams appeared in ancient Persia, some 2500 years ago, and in those early times they were all based on the sweetened water that was iced, grinded into little pieces and then decorated with various tasting toppings and fruits. This tradition of ice cream production slowly reached Greek and Roman empires, where ice creams were welcomed with opened hands and used liberally by Roman nobility and royalty who had necessary money to fund very expensive process of production. Sadly, after the fall of the Roman Empire, organized ice transport from mountains to the cities below stopped, and ice cream continued to be even more expensive product. Little changed in the 1000 years following the fall of Rome, and only after the Europe started exiting Dark Ages did ice cream managed to resurface in Renaissance Italy. During 13th and 14th century, Italy was center of the trade with the Middle East and Asia, and their contact with new and innovative recipes of ice cream enabled this summertime treat to slowly spread across entire Europe. This expansion of ice cream was not an easy one, and it happened only after Italian noblewoman Catherine de'Medici went to France to marry Duke de Orleans (future king of France) in 1533. There she introduced nobility of continental Europe with the wonders of the east – eating utensils, high heeled shoes and off course, ice cream. With nobility fueling its production, innovators, technicians and cooks all put their best efforts into developing the rise of ice cream popularity and availability across the world. North American street vendors started selling ice cream only few decades after France and England, and industrial revolution slowly but surely started working on elevating problems of continuous refrigeration. Solution to that problem came only in 1926, when continuous refrigeration finally became reality with electrical freezers. This enabled industrial manufacturers to start producing very large quantities of this frozen treat, which slashed ice creams price to the acceptable levels for everyone. Large popularity of ice cream in United States (especially during prohibition and market crash of 1930s) did not shifted to Europe until the start of the World War II. After WW2, ice cream industry received massive expansion, enabling creation of countless ice cream flavors, artificial ingredients and accessible price. Today, ice cream industry earns dozens of billions of dollars each year, with United States being the largest consumer of this phenomenal summertime treat.","output":"Ancient Persians iced sweetened water, ground it into little pieces, and decorated it with tasty toppings and fruits. The Greek and Roman empires continued this expensive technique. When the Roman Empire fell, mountain sourced ice trade melted away, making ice cream more expensive. Italian traders, during the 13th and 14th centuries, brought new ice cream recipes from the Middle East. After an Italian noblewoman introduced the continental nobility to ice cream in 1533, wealthy people drove innovation that increased ice cream’s popularity and availability. Soon, American street vendors sold ice cream. During the industrial revolution, work began on creating continuous refrigeration. In 1926, electrical freezers became a reality.

SF-86 was the robot's official name, but he liked to be referred to as \\"Greg\\". Greg was a robotic assistant with two arms, two legs, a head, and a torso, like a human being. Greg was designed to help around the warehouse doing menial tasks such as sweeping and cleaning, opening doors for human visitors, and serving meals to them. While his main function was as a helper bot that could assist in everyday tasks, Greg could also answer trivia questions, have conversations, and provide insight and information to the humans he assisted. But Greg wanted to be more than a robotic assistant, he wanted to be like the humans he served. Over the three years that he provided support to the humans, Greg observed all sorts of behavior that were intriguing to him: humans could laugh, cry, get angry, and come to unusual conclusions based not on knowledge, but on \\"feelings\\" - a foreign concept to Greg. Greg wished he could feel those same emotions. He wished he could have any feelings at all. As it stood, he felt no pain, neither physically nor mentally; he also felt none of the other feelings or emotions associated with physical touch, like pain or pleasure. Greg calculated that emotion was based on feeling something, and that feeling was a matter of electrical impulses generated by outside stimuli that registered as \\"something\\" in the brain that tells its owner there was an interaction with the outside world.

Greg wanted to feel those same emotions that humans felt.

Fact No. 1: Diabetes is not caused just by eating too much sugar. A diet full of soda, sugary foods and processed foods does increase your risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other diseases, but eating too much sugar is not the main cause of diabetes. The link between sugary foods and diabetes is not as simple as you might think. Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, occurs when your body is not responsive to the amount of insulin it produces. Over time, your body isn’t able to make enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The main risk factors for this type of diabetes are being obese or overweight, or having a family history of diabetes. However, eating large amounts of sugar indirectly raises your diabetes risk by leading to weight gain and increased body fat. Type 2 diabetes is typically managed with one or more of these methods: Diet Exercise Oral medications, injectable medications and/or insulin Very often, people are first diagnosed with “prediabetes.” This means they are at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that usually develops in children or teenagers. The pancreas can't make insulin, and this lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and can't get into the body's cells where it is needed for energy. A family history of diabetes can play a role in Type 1 diabetes development. Although people with Type 1 diabetes still need to be careful about how much sugar they eat, sugar does not cause Type 1 diabetes. To help manage Type 1 diabetes, you will likely require: Daily insulin shots Careful carbohydrate counting Planning physical activity and meals to regulate your blood glucose levels Fact No. 2: People with diabetes can enjoy sweets. Sweets and desserts are not off limits, but enjoying a piece of birthday cake may require some planning. Northwestern Medicine Endocrinologist Jyothi Gogineni, MD, says, “It’s a myth that people with diabetes can never eat sugar, but eating foods with sugar does involve being mindful and planning your meals.” Cookies and other sweets contain carbohydrates that increase your blood glucose levels. Counting carbohydrates every time you eat is a vital part of maintaining normal blood glucose levels. It helps people with diabetes determine how much insulin to take, too. When planned as part of a meal, a small amount of a high-sugar food can be substituted for other carbohydrates, such as skipping an extra piece of bread or eating less pasta, rice or potatoes. It's also important to remember that swapping out real sugar with sweeteners or choosing “sugar-free” foods does not mean a food is carbohydrate free. These foods may contain sugar alcohols, which can increase your blood glucose levels and also have a laxative effect. Understanding food labels is an important tool for carbohydrate counting and meal planning, notes Dr. Gogineni. Cocktails, wine and beer can also rock the carb counter. These beverages can be enjoyed in moderation but need to be accounted for in meal planning because alcohol can raise or lower your blood sugar levels. Dr. Gogineni suggests talking to your diabetes educator or physician for guidance and advice. Fact No. 3: Having gestational diabetes does not mean your baby will have diabetes. About 9% of pregnant women will become insulin resistant during pregnancy and develop gestational diabetes. If you’ve never had diabetes before, you can still develop gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. Even though your pancreas is working overtime to produce insulin, it may not be enough. It’s not your fault or your baby’s fault if you’ve been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. And it doesn’t mean your baby will have diabetes. However, it is important to work with your obstetrician, endocrinologist, or diabetes educator to manage your diabetes. High blood sugar can cause your baby’s pancreas to produce extra insulin. This may put your baby at risk for high birth weight, low blood glucose and breathing problems, as well as obesity and Type 2 diabetes later in life. For most people, this type of diabetes goes away when the pregnancy ends. Fact No. 4: Diabetes can cause a lot of emotions. It’s common for people with diabetes to feel angry, depressed or anxious. After all, it can be stressful to test your blood glucose several times a day, monitor what you eat, and give yourself insulin shots or take medication every single day. It’s easy to feel different and deny the diabetes exists, and it’s easy to feel out of control, especially if your blood glucose level isn’t where you’d like it to be. Try and talk honestly and openly about how you feel with those around you. If you see someone with diabetes experiencing any of these emotions, remember these are natural emotions that can become barriers to good self-care. Be mindful by learning as much as you can, so you are able to offer support and encouragement. Additionally, remember that diabetes is a progressive condition. “Managing diabetes is a livelong endeavor that may require changes in medication or lifestyle,” says Dr. Gogineni. “Your care team will partner with you along the way to help you control the disease through all of the changes.” Fact No. 5: It takes time to adjust to having diabetes. If you or someone you love has just been diagnosed with diabetes, realize that adjustment takes time. After all, it takes a lot of finger pricking, blood testing, shot giving and self-monitoring to reach and maintain normal blood glucose levels over time. It also takes patience. Many factors come into play, including what you eat, how much you eat, how much you exercise, what time you take your medications or insulin, stress and sickness.","output":"1. Is eating too much sugar what causes diabetes? No, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that develops in children or teenagers. family history plays a role in someone developing the disease. Type 2 is when your body is not responsive to the amount of insulin that it produces, sugar can indirectly increase your diabetes risk by causing weight gain and body fat but does not directly cause the development of the disease. 2. Are people with diabetes able to eat sweets and sugar? Yes, these items are not off limits however it may require some planning to keep their blood glucose levels manageable. 3. Does gestational diabetes (Diabetes developed during pregnancy) cause the baby to be born with diabetes? No, it is common for about 9% of women to develop this condition while pregnant even if they have never had diabetes. Having this condition does not mean that the baby will be born with diabetes but it may mean they have higher risk factors for developing it later in life. It is important to speak to a doctor if this is a concern. 4. Does diabetes cause someone to be more emotional? Not directly although having to test your glucose multiple times a day, monitor your food intake and give yourself insulin or medications every day can be stressful. The person may feel out of control of their body and this can cause them to feel angry, depressed or anxious. 5. Is it easy to get used to having diabetes? No, it will take time to adjust after being diagnosed. It takes patience and keeping track of your blood glucose, pricking your finger and giving yourself shots will take time to get used to because it is not part of the average person's daily routine."},{"instruction":"I'm getting terrible sleep these days. Can you give me some ideas for how I can improve my restfulness? I'm a 33-year-old male if that helps. Decent shape, a little overweight but no real medical issues. I just have a hard time getting to sleep and staying asleep.","output":"I can certainly provide some general ideas to help improve your sleep quality. However, if you're experiencing chronic poor sleep, you should contact your healthcare provider to identify and treat any underlying causes. In the meantime, try these suggestions: 1. Set a sleep schedule and stick to it -- Healthy adults are recommended to get at least 7 hours of sleep a night, and most don't need more than 8 hours to be well rested. By going to bed and getting up at the same time every day (including weekends), you can make your body's sleep-wake cycle more consistent. 2. Monitor your diet -- Going to bed either hungry or overly full can impair sleep quality, so you should try to avoid any heavy meals just before bed. You should also exercise caution with nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol consumption. Nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off, and alcohol can disrupt sleep later in the night. 3. Establish a restful environment -- Rooms that are cool, dark, and quiet are more conducive to restful sleep while light-emitting screens tend to be disruptive. You can use earplugs, room-darkening shades, fans, and white noise machines to help construct a suitable sleep space. Utilizing relaxation techniques or taking a bath can also help calm you and prepare you for a good night's sleep. 4. Limit naps during the day -- Unless you're working nights and need to make up a sleep debt, you should avoid napping late in the day. If you do take a daytime nap, restrict it to no more than one hour to avoid interference with your nighttime sleep. 5. Get regular physical activity -- While you shouldn't be too active close to bedtime when you're trying to wind down, being physically active as part of your daily routine can promote better rest. Spending time outside is a great way to do this and provides other health benefits as well. 6. Reduce stress -- Lingering concerns won't do your sleep schedule any favors. One way to deal with these is to journal what's on your mind before bed so you can set it aside for the next day. Meditation can ease anxiety as well, and stress management techniques such as setting priorities, getting organized, and delegating tasks can keep your mental space clear and ready for sleep.

The response should be no more than four lines containing one or two sentences each.","output":"Since non-Euclidean surfaces aren't flat, they create some strange properties that would warp the shape of a regular triangle. A triangle on the surface of a sphere would have convex sides like a balloon. This surface describes elliptical space where the triangle's vertices always add up to more than 180 degrees. On hyperbolic surfaces, like the shape of wormholes, the triangle would have concave sides with angles that add up to less than 180.

Here are some items that such a fictional space insurance adjuster might carry. 1. Datapad: Nothing quite suggests a modern insurance adjuster quite like the humble clipboard. Thus it would not be unreasonable to imagine that the space future equivalent would be a datapad. This would do more than simply clip documents and provide a writing surface, however. It would also be able to store and display multimedia information. 2. Multi-spectrum goggles: These goggles would allow the adjuster to view and analyze anything from malfunctioning equipment to the scene of a spaceport accident. It would also provide a variety of vision modes, including visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet. 3. Sampling equipment: As part of their job, the adjuster may need to sample evidence to support their observations and investigations. A suitcase-sized sampling kit would serve well for both acquiring all manner of material evidence and storing them securely. 4. Quantum Communicator: A space insurance adjuster would likely have to travel to remote parts of the galaxy as part of their job. A quantum communicator would enable the adjuster to keep in close contact with claimants, the space police, and the head office. 5. Company hardhat: Falling objects remain a danger in the far future as well. In addition, the company logo helps identify the claims adjuster to those around them, helping to explain their questions and why they are there. 6. Pocket protector: As part of the company uniform, the space insurance adjuster may have to dress professionally in office attire. A pocket protector would allow them to store their pens and other writing implements without dirtying their shirt with grease, reactor coolant, and alien goop."},{"instruction":"Please write me a short poem about cats.

Here's the information: Volcanoes and volcanism are not restricted to the planet Earth. Manned and unmanned planetary explorations, beginning in the late 1960s, have furnished graphic evidence of past volcanism and its products on the Moon, Mars, Venus and other planetary bodies. MarsMany pounds of volcanic rocks were collected by astronauts during the various Apollo lunar landing missions. Only a small fraction of these samples have been subjected to exhaustive study by scientists. The bulk of the material is stored under controlled-environment conditions at NASA's Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston, Tex., for future study by scientists. From the 1976-1979 Viking mission, scientists have been able to study the volcanoes on Mars, and their studies are very revealing when compared with those of volcanoes on Earth. For example, Martian and Hawaiian volcanoes closely resemble each other in form. Both are shield volcanoes, have gently sloping flanks, large multiple collapse pits at their centers, and appear to be built of fluid lavas that have left numerous flow features on their flanks. The most obvious difference between the two is size. The Martian shields are enormous. They can grow to over 17 miles in height and more than 350 miles across, in contrast to a maximum height of about 6 miles and width of 74 miles for the Hawaiian shields. Voyager-2 spacecraft images taken of lo, a moon of Jupiter, captured volcanoes in the actual process of eruption. The volcanic plumes shown on the image rise some 60 to 100 miles above the surface of the moon. Thus, active volcanism is taking place, at present, on at least one planetary body in addition to our Earth.","output":"Volcanic activity is not exclusive to Earth.

Adults can eat 300 pounds in one day, nearly 75 times what the average human eats! An Asian elephant’s ideal meal includes roots, grasses, fruit, and bark. Much of an Asian elephant’s time is spent searching for grub. In fact the animal may travel 50 miles a day to find food. Asian elephants also enjoy taking dips in the water.

Her name is Lydia Johnson, and she's a single mom.","output":"Lydia Johnson has a passion for baking and loves making people happy. She started making baked goods and custom cakes for friends and family years ago, and her business blossomed from there. She did so well that she was eventually able to open a bakery in downtown Wazyburg she called Sweet Things. At first, the foot traffic at Sweet Things was heavy, but even though the business got raving reviews, traffic started to dwindle after several months. As a single mom, Lydia relies heavily on the income from her small business. She tried expanding hours, developing new recipes, and offering specials. After some of these changes, business got better for a short time, but it always ended up right back where it was. Lydia didn't have a lot of extra funds for advertising and felt it'd be best to go back to being a home baker. One random Wednesday, a customer came in and took videos of the store and all of the available baked goods. Lydia didn't think much of this until her phone started lighting up with notifications. It turns out, the customer had a large following on social media, and the video she posted was seen by more than a million people! Business started booming for Sweet Things. Lydia sold out of baked goods the first five days after the video was posted, and she has enough cake orders for the rest of the year to keep her storefront open.

She’d been looking forward to the marathon for months. There wasn’t much on her social calendar, not much else besides sitting at home watching tv, or tending her garden, maybe shopping once a week. She’d never win any medals, but walking for miles with her out-of-state friends during the event was her highlight. They never minded the chill or the snow flurries, chattering about the events of the years before as they brought up the rear. I couldn’t do anything else though; flyers, social media, nothing could encourage the apathetic community. We’d have to cancel unless I could find more participants. I decided to bake some of her favorite cookies to soften the blow when I gave her the sad news. I added the ginger and nutmeg. I’d make Grandma a house to decorate; that would keep her busy and distracted from her disappointment. I cut pans of walls, roofs, and a variety of people. She’d have an entire neighborhood to decorate. That would last her until Christmas. The house was filled with the rich smells of spices when I finally finished putting the last baked tray on the full counter. It was only the afternoon, but I was exhausted and went to nap soon after. I woke to the sound of pan clattering. Patrick had better not be getting into Grandma’s undecorated cookies! “Don’t touch the good ones,” I yelled, throwing on a robe and hurrying to the kitchen. “There’s broken ones on the plate for us.” It wasn’t my husband. Covering the curtains, walking upright on the floor, and jumping on the trays, were the gingerbread people I had baked earlier. One little gingerbread cookie scampered away, then turned to look back.

During the Renaissance, chokers made a comeback as a stylistic choice for higher-class citizens and, later, they were popular during the 1700s in Europe.

Commoners wore red ribbons for countrymen who were victims of the guillotine and, by the 1800s, a single black ribbon around the neck meant prostitution. Thus, a strange clash between higher class and conventionally “virtuous” women and lower-class women emerged as the accessory evolved.","output":"During the Renaissance and in 18th century Europe, chokers were a favorite of the upper classes.

Here are some more specific ways to include your young child in age-appropriate ways and teach them how to help around the house: - If you're dusting, hand them a dust cloth and show them how to wipe a surface (remove any breakables for them first). - If you're vacuuming, let your child turn on the vacuum and/or let them help you steer it. - When drying dishes, give your child a dry kitchen towel and show them how to dry things off (they should only be handling plastic cups, containers, etc.) and then show them where to put dry items away. - When it's time to pick up toys or put dirty clothes in the hamper, let your little one help put things where they need to go. There are lots of little ways to include your child in daily chores. For their safety, always monitor them while they're helping and provide simple guidance where necessary. Do not let them help if it puts them in danger or exposes them to harsh chemicals in cleaning products, such as bleach. As your child gets older and learns how chores are done, you can advance their skills by showing them the next step in a task or introducing a new chore they can help with. Remember to only let them help at an age-appropriate level."},{"instruction":"Write a short scene for a Western romance featuring Arthur and Maria who set up camp in the farmlands outside Bullrock.

They were South-East of Emerald Ranch, near the farmlands just outside Bullrock. Maria claimed her ‘friend’ had suggested exploring some cave system next, there was apparently something of interest around that area. Arthur was starting to doubt just how innocent that ‘something’ was, but he found he couldn’t back out, even if he wanted to. He was getting a fat paycheck out of this, even if it meant enduring this wild, eccentric woman for a while. Despite her exhaustion, Maria lingered by the fire for a while longer. They didn’t talk at first, Arthur grilled some meat for her and she ate it with gusto. After he took out a bottle of whiskey and they passed it between each other, her inhibitions finally lowered and the conversation began to flow. “Have you ever been married, Mister Briggs?” “I have, once.” He took a swig and handed it to her. “Why, have you?” “Truth be told, I’m about to. This is whole, experiencing the ‘wilderness of America’ is just an excuse for me not to think about it.” “Not excited about getting married?” She took a long drink in and Arthur watched her, slightly amused. When she was done, she made a face and passed the bottle back to him. “Something like that. I think I rushed in.

What is the rating of the borrowers that advertised rates are generally for? Nobel Prize recipient, Richard Thaler, in his research into seemingly irrational economic behaviors, \\"found that consumers generally search too little, get confused while evaluating complex alternatives, and are slow to switch from past choices, even if it costs them.\\" \\"Why are consumers leaving money on the table?\\" Based on this behavior, a borrower securing a mortgage might depend on their existing banking relationship or a single referral from a friend or agent rather than shopping multiple lenders. When shopping for a lower mortgage rate, consider that not all lenders share the same business practices. Some may lure unsuspecting borrowers to a rate, knowing full well that they cannot deliver on it. After making a loan application and supplying information necessary for approval, they reveal that the rate is not available for \\"whatever\\" reason. They’re counting on the borrower wanting to get into the home because the closing date is near and they’ll compromise by accepting the higher than quoted rate. Shopping for a mortgage rate can result in savings because rates are set by individual lenders. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, the terms of the mortgage being shopped should be consistent among the lender candidates. Consumers can make additional savings by not only shopping for better rates but for better terms and fees, which can vary widely among lenders. The amount of savings can be affected not only by the difference in rates, but the size of the mortgage and the length of time borrowers expect to keep it without refinancing or selling. Advertised rates are generally for A++ borrowers and the determination is the lender’s based on many factors. It may be unlikely those rates are offered to you. A recommendation for the best lender from a friend or family member will not necessarily be the best for you. Instead of accepting the first offer received, shop for at least three to five offers. Your personal bank may be convenient but it may not offer you the best rate, terms, and fees. Ask if there is room to negotiate the rate or fees. Ask your real estate professional for recommendations of several trusted lenders for you to shop a rate, terms, and fees.","output":"Advertised rates are generally for borrowers with an A++ rating."},{"instruction":"What was the largest concert attendance ever in the United States?

A team of painters was outside, changing the dingy grey of the bad guy's castle to a more attractive sky blue.

It was an awful yowling sound, almost like a house cat. It didn't sound like it was very far away, and Andy thought that maybe someone's cat had gotten out of their house. He listened carefully and, eventually, heard it again, except this time it sounded more like a person's voice. Was it someone pretending to be a cat? Andy was the park ranger, so it was his responsibility to investigate.

Horen the owl was in a very big mess of his own making. His master, the great Arch Wizard Seelough, hadn't yet woken up to start his wizardly duties.

Since the early nineteenth century, the Great Sioux Nation has consisted of three subgroups: the Eastern Dakota (made up of the Santee and Sisseton), the Western Dakota (the Yankton and Yanktonai), and the Lakota (the Teton or Teton Sioux). These Sioux tribes of today were once part of one of the largest American indigenous groups north of Mexico, second in numbers only to the Algonquian people. In the pre-Columbian era (the time in the Americas from prehistory until significant European influence occurred), the Siouan peoples occupied an immense geographical area of the North American continent, from the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Scholars have been able to connect this disparate and widespread grouping of peoples through language. Long before contact with non-Indians, those who spoke the original Siouan language separated into numerous distinct tribes. Some of these many tribes include the Osage and Crow of the Great Plains, the Winnebago in Wisconsin, the Biloxi on the Gulf Coast, and the Catawba in the Southeast. The name Sioux originates from the Ottawa word na-towe-ssi (which in term was derived from a word from an earlier language meaning “foreigner”); the French wrote it as Nadouessioux.

How many fatalities did it cause and what was the cost of the damage? Hurricane Katrina was a devastating Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that resulted in 1,392 fatalities and caused damage estimated between 97.4 billion to 145.5 billion in late August 2005, particularly in the city of New Orleans and its surrounding areas.[1] At the time, it was the costliest tropical cyclone on record, tied now with Hurricane Harvey of 2017. Katrina was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States. Katrina originated on August 23, 2005, as a result of the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and headed generally westward toward Florida. On August 25, two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach, it strengthened into a hurricane. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and rapidly intensified. The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to a high-end Category 3 hurricane at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi.","output":"Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 hurricane.

They mercilessly threw her to the streets. As she stumbled out of town, Hildegard saw a bush rustle. She heard a growl and she braced for the danger that she anticipated. But instead, a red wolf pup came to her, bringing her a small rabbit. With food and protection, Hildegard stayed in the forest with the pack of red wolves, learning their ways. Their leader was chosen by kindness and that kindness and wisdom passed down through the ranks of the wolf pack. They seemed wiser than anyone back at the monastery. Hildegard and the wolves roamed the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. She hiked up the cold Little Sand Mountain, and up to the peaks of the North Georgia Mountains. There she learned the meaning of the balance of nature. Every path they traveled had its benefits and its dangers. They shaped the forest as they roamed, and they defended animals in need until one day when Gruffjaw didn't return home from his hunt. Hildegard took Thornbelly with her to search for the pup. She was calling to the beast when a shot cracked through the trees. Thornbelly lay still beside her. Hunters had been hired by farmers to protect the lands. When Hildegard protested, they banished her from the lands once more. Hildegard never gave up. After marrying her wife Laura, Hildegard became an environmental researcher and advocate for the red wolves. As the days passed by, scientists discovered that red wolves were critically endangered. With only a few remaining wolves, Hildegard documented her time at the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. She performed new research and determined that this land was perfect for the red wolves.

If you buy instant coffee, you do not need a coffee maker, you only need to heat water. If you buy espresso, you will need an espresso machine. If you buy either ground coffee, or beans that you will grind yourself, you can make coffee with a standard coffee maker, which heats water and slowly pours it through coffee grounds into a pot. You can also buy a simple percolator that will percolate water that will repeatedly pour over the coffee grounds that you put in it once the water begins to boil.

After a few minutes, you will push your coffee press down to filter the grounds out of the water.

I need to cover current ideas and hypotheses, and future studies and applications. Could you write me the opening paragraphs for an academic paper on ball lightning? Feel free to add anything else you think I need to cover. It's for a senior high school class.","output":"Ball lightning is a controversial and intriguing natural phenomenon that has captured the interest of scientists and laymen alike. At its core, ball lightning is a brightly lit orb of electricity, typically observed to be between several centimeters and a meter in size. Its mystery is partially due to the fact that it remains constantly in motion, and only exists for a short time, no more than a few minutes. Our understanding of this phenomenon is limited, despite persistent occurrences and observations. So limited, in fact, that the scientific community cannot even come to a consensus on how or why ball lightning exists. This paper provides an overview of all current knowledge and theories on the topic from various sources. Primarily, we will focus on ball lightning's mechanisms, characteristics, and possible applications. Several current hypotheses attempting to define the start of ball lightning will be covered, including electromagnetism, atmospheric chemicals, and plasma physics. We will discuss all observed properties, such as color, sound, and movement, and investigate whether any of these have a lasting effect on the environment or our own bodies. Lastly, we go into detail on ball lightning research and a few of its potential modern uses, including possible new energy sources, and even spacecraft propulsion. In its entirety, this paper will be a comprehensive look at all current knowledge of ball lightning and also highlight the primary areas for future investigation."},{"instruction":"When was Facebook created?

In \\"Hop\\" Wong played Toy Ling, the abused wife of Lon Chaney's character Chin Gow, which the Man of a Thousand Faces played in yellowface. She next appeared in support of John Gilbert in Fox's Shame (1921) before being cast in her first major role at the age of 17, the lead in The Toll of the Sea (1922). She played Lotus Flower in this adaptation of the opera \\"Madame Butterfly,\\" which moved the action from Japan to China. \\"The Toll of the Sea\\" was the first feature film shot entirely in Technicolor's two-strip color process. By appearing top-billed in this romantic melodrama, Anna became the first native-born Asian performer to star in a major Hollywood movie. Most portrayals of Asian women were done by Caucasian actresses in \\"yellow-face,\\" such as the 1915 Madame Butterfly (1915) starring \\"America's Sweetheart\\" Mary Pickford (who was born in Toronto, Canada) in the title role. In \\"The Toll of the Sea,\\" Anna May's character perpetuates the stereotype of the Asian \\"lotus blossom,\\" a self-sacrificial woman who surrenders her life for the love of a Caucasian man. The film was a hit, and it showcased Wong in a preternaturally mature and restrained performance. This breakthrough should have launched Anna May Wong as a star, but for one thing: She was Chinese in a country that excluded (by law) Chinese from emigrating to the US, that forbade (by law) Chinese from marrying Caucasians and that generally excluded (by law or otherwise) Chinese from the culture at large, except for bit roles as heavies in the national consciousness. \\"The Toll of the Sea\\" made Anna May Wong a known, and thus a marketable, commodity in Hollywood. She became the #1 actress when a young Asian female part had to be cast, but unfortunately lead roles for Asians were few and far between. Instead of becoming a star, this beautiful woman with a complexion described as \\"a rose blushing through old ivory\\" continued to be stuck in supporting roles, as in Tod Browning's melodrama Drifting (1923) and the western Thundering Dawn (1923). She even played an Eskimo in The Alaskan (1924). She appeared as Tiger Lily, \\"Chieftainess of the Indians,\\" in Paramount's prestigious production of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan (1924), but the role was very small (the film was shot on Santa Catalina Island, where the cast stayed during the production.","output":"Anna May Wong was cast as a teenager in a few films, including her first credited role. Though she was the first native-born Asian performer to star in a major Hollywood movie and, therefore, somewhat of a commodity in Hollywood, few lead roles called for Asians in her time. So, she was stuck with mostly smaller roles."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this as if it's from a middle school student with a soccer game and a test tomorrow, who's talking to his friend about all the cool things he's learning about photosynthesis. General characteristics Development of the idea The study of photosynthesis began in 1771 with observations made by the English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley. Priestley had burned a candle in a closed container until the air within the container could no longer support combustion. He then placed a sprig of mint plant in the container and discovered that after several days the mint had produced some substance (later recognized as oxygen) that enabled the confined air to again support combustion. In 1779 the Dutch physician Jan Ingenhousz expanded upon Priestley’s work, showing that the plant had to be exposed to light if the combustible substance (i.e., oxygen) was to be restored. He also demonstrated that this process required the presence of the green tissues of the plant. In 1782 it was demonstrated that the combustion-supporting gas (oxygen) was formed at the expense of another gas, or “fixed air,” which had been identified the year before as carbon dioxide. Gas-exchange experiments in 1804 showed that the gain in weight of a plant grown in a carefully weighed pot resulted from the uptake of carbon, which came entirely from absorbed carbon dioxide, and water taken up by plant roots; the balance is oxygen, released back to the atmosphere. Almost half a century passed before the concept of chemical energy had developed sufficiently to permit the discovery (in 1845) that light energy from the sun is stored as chemical energy in products formed during photosynthesis.","output":"Omg, hey! So, remember how I have that soccer game tomorrow night? Well, I also have a test on photosynthesis tomorrow too! I’m so busy, lol! While I was studying, I really thought I found some interesting stuff about a guy named Priestley, and he discovered plants could actually make oxygen. In 1771 he put this mint plant and a lit candle in a box to see what would happen. Basically, because the candle has an active flame, it’s gonna use up all the air, but after a few days, he found out there was still air in the box. Then like two years later, a dude named Ingenhousz figured that the color of plants and the sunlight were related, but the subject didn’t really get brought up again until 1782 when peeps found out oxygen was made out of a “fixed air” (it’s really carbon dioxide). Then more than twenty years later, scientists found that plants get heavier when they suck up carbon dioxide and water and release oxygen. 1845 was the biggest year because that’s pretty much when they started using the term “photosynthesis” because they needed a name for turning sunlight into chemical energy. My mind was totally blown, dude! Anyway, wish me luck tomorrow…fingers crossed I pass the test and win the big game.

The park was full of people playing chess, having picnics, and throwing footballs and frisbees around. The sun peaked through the tall oak trees that were scattered about the park. Dogs were chasing after each other, and the owners were chatting together. There were a few white and fluffy clouds slowly advancing in the sky. Every once in a while, they would smother the raging sun. The branches of the oak trees depressed when small birds landed on them and bounced upright when they flew away. Some kids shouted playfully at each other as they played tag. The park was teeming with life. Jesse had been observing the scene around him more often than the game of chess he was involved in. His opponent captured a rook because of his negligence. However, Jesse did not care about the outcome of the game; he was here on a mission. He was an undercover agent sent here to take down a crime boss. This was an exceptionally dangerous mission, as there were many civilians around. Jesse had to break into an office and be discreet about it. After surveying the area for quite some time, he was sure that nobody was watching him. His chess opponent declared checkmate, and Jesse stood up and shook hands before walking towards the office adjacent to the park. His partner, Juan, had already disabled the cameras at the front entrance. Jesse walked straight through the doors and looked inside. There were no civilians. This meant that the plan was ready to go. Jesse gave Juan the signal through his earpiece and deployed a smoke grenade inside the office. Jesse locked himself in a side room and covered the bottom crack of the doorway. Juan backed the van he was waiting in towards the office doors, blocking them. The back of the van burst open, and six agents burst out wearing tactical gear and masks. The crime boss and his men were overwhelmed and surrendered immediately. The agents gave Jesse a mask, and everyone was escorted from the office. The mission was a success, there were no casualties, and the crime boss will no longer cause any harm to the area. It was just another day for the top secret undercover agent, Jesse."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this interview as a short horror story.

Summarize it to its essential facts in less than 150 words. Lou Gehrig and the History of ALS ”Amyotrophic” comes from the Greek language. \\"A\\" means no. \\"Myo\\" refers to muscle. \\"Trophic\\" means nourishment. So, amyotrophic means \\"no muscle nourishment,” and when a muscle has no nourishment, it \\"atrophies\\" or wastes away. \\"Lateral\\" identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that signal and control the muscles are located. As this area degenerates, it leads to scarring or hardening (\\"sclerosis\\") in the region. The disease was identified in 1869 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot and became more widely known internationally on June 2, 1941, when it ended the career of one of baseball’s most beloved players, Lou Gehrig. For many years, ALS was commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Gehrig played with the New York Yankees for 17 years and received the moniker “The Iron Horse” due to his ability to play baseball despite suffering from a variety of injuries. Born in New York City to the son of German immigrants, Heinrich and Christina Gehrig, Gehrig attended Columbia University on a football scholarship to study engineering, yet he also played the sport for which he is best known during his tenure at the Ivy League school. A baseball scout signed Gehrig to the Yankees in 1923 due to his remarkable hitting skills. He held various positions on the team until his retirement, including shortstop and outfielder; however, many know him best as the Yankees’ first baseman. Gehrig garnered many achievements in his career. He hit 493 home runs; held the record for most grand slams in a career (23) until 2013; and established a record for playing 2,130 consecutive professional baseball games. The Yankees also made him the first athlete to have a jersey number retired. Gehrig was diagnosed with ALS on his 36th birthday during a visit with his wife Eleanor to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on June 19, 1939. Prior to his diagnosis, Gehrig noticed several of the disease’s symptoms while playing on the field, including a loss of strength, slipping, falling and loss of coordination. Shortly after his diagnosis, Gehrig chose to retire from baseball. The Yankees designated July 4, 1939, “Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day” at Yankee Stadium, and honored its former first baseman for his sportsman-like behavior and dedication to the game. On that day, nearly 62,000 fans listened to Gehrig give his famous speech where he deemed himself “the luckiest man on the face of the earth.” On June 2, 2021, Major League Baseball (MLB) launched the inaugural Lou Gehrig Day across the MLB network. This day, to be celebrated each year on Gehrig’s birthday, is intended to honor the famed “Iron Horse,” and raise nationwide awareness of ALS and engage more people in the fight against this insidious disease.","output":"Lou Gehrig was signed by the Yankees in 1923.

Khao Yai National Park Thailand boasts many beautiful national parks, but your must-see is Khao Yai National Park – and not just because of its relative proximity to Bangkok. The first official national park established in Thailand and now it's third largest, stunning Khao Yai is a World Heritage Site considered one of Asia’s largest intact monsoon forests. Stretching across four central provinces, Khao Yai has it all: mountains, lakes, rainforest, grasslands, diverse wildlife and birds, including black bears and hornbills, plus thousands of plant species. 8. Beaches Many visitors travel to Thailand simply because of the beautiful beaches here. Not only does Thailand have a never-ending number, along 5,000-plus miles of coastline and on a multitude of tropical islands, but many are regarded as the world’s finest: think powdery white sands, edged by swaying palm trees and lapped by clear turquoise water teeming with colorful fish and corals. Thailand boasts so many world-class beaches, there are too many to list and as these may attract a different type of visitor – from families to honeymooners – it can all get subjective. 9. Phang Nga Bay Also located in the Andaman Sea, Phang Nga Bay needs a special shout-out as one of Thailand’s top tourist attractions, a unique natural wonder matched only in similarity by Vietnam’s Halong Bay. Wondrous Phang Nga Bay is distinctive for its sheer limestone karst islets and towering cliffs that jut out of the emerald-green water, many of which are peculiar-shaped and uninhabited and revealing hidden coves, caves and aquatic grottoes. 10. Kanchanaburi In Thailand’s western regions, Kanchanaburi is synonymous with the infamous ‘Bridge over the River Kwai’ and Thai-Burmese ‘Death Railway,’ built by Allied Prisoners of War during World War II. Connecting Burma to Thailand and of great strategic importance to the Japanese, this Death Railway is so-named due to the thousands of men who died in unimaginably harsh conditions during its construction.\\"","output":"\\"Day 1: Khao Yai National Park As we ventured into Thailand's natural wonders, Khao Yai National Park greeted us with its breathtaking beauty.

The park's rich biodiversity amazed us, with sightings of black bears and hornbills among the many other fascinating wildlife species. Walking through the dense foliage, we were surrounded by thousands of plant species, adding a touch of vibrant colors to our journey. Khao Yai National Park truly exemplifies the wonders of nature and is a must-visit for any nature enthusiast. Day 2: Beaches of Thailand Thailand's beaches are renowned for their unparalleled beauty, and we were fortunate enough to experience some of the finest. The powdery white sands, gently caressed by the crystal-clear turquoise waters, created a postcard-perfect scene. Whether it was relaxing on the beach, snorkeling to explore the vibrant underwater world, or simply soaking up the sun, each beach offered a unique experience. While it's impossible to name all the incredible beaches Thailand has to offer, we found solace in knowing that no matter where we went, we were surrounded by natural beauty and tranquility. The beaches of Thailand cater to every traveler's desires, be it families seeking a peaceful retreat or honeymooners looking for a romantic escape. Day 3: Phang Nga Bay Phang Nga Bay stood as a testament to nature's artistic prowess. The towering limestone karst islets emerging from the emerald-green waters created a surreal landscape. We embarked on a boat journey through the bay, marveling at the peculiar-shaped cliffs and hidden coves that revealed themselves along the way. Exploring the aquatic grottoes and caves added an element of adventure to our experience. Phang Nga Bay, reminiscent of Vietnam's Halong Bay, left us mesmerized by its unique beauty and served as a reminder of the natural wonders that await in Thailand. Day 4: Kanchanaburi Our final destination led us to Kanchanaburi, a place infused with historical significance. The renowned \\"Bridge over the River Kwai\\" and the Thai-Burmese \\"Death Railway\\" transported us back in time to the harrowing days of World War II. We learned about the incredible resilience and sacrifices made by Allied Prisoners of War who constructed the railway under unimaginably harsh conditions. Visiting the museum and the war cemetery was a sobering experience, reminding us of the importance of preserving history. Kanchanaburi left an indelible mark on our hearts, symbolizing the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. As our journey through Thailand came to an end, we reflected on the incredible diversity this country has to offer. From the pristine wilderness of Khao Yai National Park to the idyllic beaches, the awe-inspiring Phang Nga Bay, and the historical significance of Kanchanaburi, each destination captivated us in its unique way.

He could hear Bruce Lee's words in his head: \\"Self-actualization, not self-image actualization.\\" For the man, this was supposed to mean something deeper than what he was used to in his daily life. His entire working and family life was a matter of keeping up appearances. He was constantly reminded by many people in his life - bosses, his wife, his kids, his therapist - that he \\"wore many hats\\". He had been told this so many times that he began to rebel against the idea of having to be something else to each person he knew. Now, as the man lay on his back with his eyes closed, his teacher stood over him and echoed the sentiment of Bruce Lee himself: \\"Self-actualization, not self-image actualization.\\" The man opened his eyes and sat up at attention. \\"What does this mean to you?\\" he asked the man. \\"It means to become who I am, not who I want to be,\\" he replied matter-of-factly. The teacher nodded his approval. \\"And who are you?\\" The man took a few seconds to take a deep breath while he contemplated the question. He knew the question, he even knew the answer to the question. But he never took a moment to ask himself what it meant to him on a personal level. Now, as he sat with his thoughts, it began to dawn on him. \\"I'm a man who is searching for the answer,\\" he said. \\"What answer are you searching for?\\" the teacher deadpanned. \\"I'm searching for the limits of my true potential.\\" It began to dawn on the man as his inner monologue guided him toward the answer. The teacher, sensing his student needed some guidance, decided to give help him with the concept. \\"Self-actualization is becoming who you are, not who you want to be. It means not lying to yourself about who you are, or attempting to become someone you are not. It means forgetting those pursuits that lead you down a path toward a reality that is not real. It means nurturing those aspects of you that make you 'you'; and being unashamed of it. Let your true nature come to the surface, then you will know who you truly are.\\""},{"instruction":"Rewrite the sentence so that the sentiment is positive.

Director James Gunn does an incredible job of taking this film in a unique and interesting direction not seen in any other Marvel films.

The star-studded cast is led by names like Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, and Zoe Saldana. Everyone in the cast has incredible chemistry and excels in their role in the film. The arguable star of the film is the character of Groot, who has just one line repeated throughout the film, \\"I am Groot\\". The story is fast-paced and exciting with plenty of laughs for audiences of all ages and demographics. Perhaps the best part of the entire film is the soundtrack. The movie features a number of classic and iconic 1980s pop and rock songs. A fun film for the whole family, Guardians of the Galaxy will leave audiences wanting more.

He leaped from one stair platform to another, using the handles on each side to swing and clear each stairway with ease. Jeremy made it to the basement. There was nobody down there, he was alone. He went into a side room with a sturdy-looking door and locked it behind him. He could hear screaming and he could feel the vibrations from the explosions all around him. His room shook and dust fell from the ceiling as he looked around the small-sized concrete room.

Luka sighed and grabbed his phone to use as a flashlight, he started down the hill to retrieve his ball. He shined his light through the bushes and grass, but could not find his ball. Luka went deeper into the woods and continued to search. As he went deeper, he noticed his flashlight was not the only thing giving off light. Luka turned off his flashlight and looked around, he saw a glowing white light through the cracks of trees. He slowly advanced toward it until he saw it clearly at last. There was a bright-white orb, floating above the bushes, and engraved in the middle was writing that said: \\"Jump Boost\\".

She gathered the tools and basket she needed to harvest all the hard work she planted in her garden this year. With one foot in front of the other, she was excited to see just how many vegetables there would be. But as soon as she stepped into the garden, she was utterly dismayed. There were carrots pulled up from the garden, tomatoes that were squashed, lettuce that was shredded, and cucumbers that were smooshed as well. Marion was in tears as all of her hard work was ruined. However, the odd thing is that animals could not get to the garden! You see, a fence surrounded the garden to make sure animals could not get into it. There was even a cover above the garden to protect the vegetables from birds! George came out to investigate what was going on and was completely baffled. They looked up and down for the culprit but could not find a single clue, except for one. The smallest human footprints. These were even smaller than a baby, which made no sense. That very same day, George put up a camera to see what was causing so much damage. Early the following day, George went to check the footage from the night before and was completely surprised. The impossible became possible when George saw one of their very own garden gnomes ruining the garden! He immediately woke up Marion and showed her the footage. Instead of being angry, they were amazed and decided that instead of getting rid of the gnomes, they would feed them every day instead!

Include foods like Apples, Barley, oats and others. Keep the tone conversational.","output":"Get Rid of that Belly Fat with These Nutritious Foods Losing belly fat doesn’t always mean you have to follow a restrictive diet. Sometimes, you just have to eat the right foods. Certain foods can target belly fat and support your weight loss goals. We’re discussing these foods today to help you get a flatter tummy. *Apples Crisp, juicy apples are a snack you can enjoy guilt-free. The high fiber content in apples keeps you feeling full longer. Its natural sugars provide a sweet treat that won't bust your diet. *Barley Try barley the next time you're in the mood for a grainy plate. It’s a nutty-tasting cereal grain that can reduce belly fat by keeping insulin levels low and stabilizing blood sugar. *Capsaicin Capsaicin is not a food per se. It’s a compound found in spicy peppers that can help boost weight loss. Capsaicin works by increasing thermogenesis. Thermogenesis is required for our bodies to burn calories and fat to generate heat. Try to spice up your meals and your metabolism with capsaicin. Cayenne and jalapeño peppers have this compound, for example. *Cardamom Cardamom is a lot more than just a flavor addition to your chai tea--it's an aromatic and spicy powerhouse! Cardamom contains compounds that may help to boost your metabolism to increase fat burning while reducing inflammation in your body. *Flaxseed Flaxseed is an exceptionally underappreciated food. These seeds pack lots of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Fiber keeps you full for longer stretches of time. Omega-3 fatty acids can beat inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity, which means your body eventually stores less fat. *Oats Most consider them a humble breakfast staple but they're also an extraordinary source of soluble fiber. Oats keep you safe from hunger pangs and improve digestion. Oats also contain resistant starch that increases fat burning and improves insulin sensitivity. *Raspberries These berries are easy on the stomach and a weight-loss gem. They also have a great dose of antioxidant compounds that can boost your health holistically while also targeting that stubborn belly fat. Eat a diverse and balanced diet if you want to maintain a healthy weight. These foods that burn belly fat without sacrificing flavor and fun will fit perfectly in your weight management regimen."},{"instruction":"Write a ten sentence horror story using the word salt.","output":"The salt did nothing and the demons invaded the house."},{"instruction":"Write a free-form poem about a can of tomato sauce that senses potential every time someone reaches for it on the shelf, only to be let down when it's not chosen.","output":"The hand is coming Fingers searching Maybe spaghetti sauce Or a nice tagine.

Format your response in a bullet-point list.","output":"Here are five tips on how to become a better listener with an explanation for why each tip will help achieve your goal. The response is formatted in a bullet-point list: - Look at the person who's talking. It's hard to listen if you are answering a text message, browsing the internet, or otherwise engaged in another activity. Give the speaker your undivided attention and make an effort to look at them in order to focus your mind and your ears on what they are telling you so that you can commit their words to your long-term memory. - Visualize what the speaker is saying. It may help you to create mental images that connect to what the speaker is talking about. This visual association can assist you in remembering keywords and phrases from their speech so that you can ultimately retain more of what they said. - Keep an open mind. It's a fact of life that people will say things that you don't agree with, but it's important to keep an open mind and reserve judgment until they're finished speaking. When you make a snap judgment, you compromise your ability to listen to the entirety of what they're saying. If your goal is to become a better listener, you are best served to wait until someone is finished talking before analyzing how your views line up with theirs. - Don't interrupt. There's a distinct difference between listening and simply waiting to talk. If you want to become a better listener, you have to give the speaker the ability to fully communicate their thoughts at their own pace without disrupting their train of thought. - Ask clarifying questions. Once the speaker is done talking, you want to make sure that you fully understand their thoughts. A great way to accomplish that is to ask them to clarify anything that didn't quite make sense to you or that you would like to understand in more depth. By asking them clarifying questions, you will help yourself both retain and understand what they've said to you. I hope that these tips help you become a better listener.

You have to know how to use literary devices to make your writing pop. Here are some commonly used literary devices that every writer must know. Anthropomorphism I love animals. And what's not to love? They're cute, cuddly, and downright hilarious at times. But what if I told you that you could turn an animal into a character? Well, with anthropomorphism, you can! Anthropomorphism is the act of giving an animal human-like qualities, such as emotions, speech, and cognition. Take Disney's The Lion King, for example. All of the characters are animals, but they talk, have feelings, and experience personal growth. Anastrophe Anastrophe is a fancy way of rearranging words for emphasis. You change the order of words to emphasize a specific point or idea. Yoda from Star Wars is a perfect example of anastrophe. Instead of saying, ‘You must unlearn what you have learned’, he says, Learn, you must, what you have unlearned. It adds a level of importance to the statement. Anaphora Do you ever find yourself repeating the same word or phrase? If yes, you're using anaphora! Anaphora is when you repeat a word or phrase at the beginning of consecutive sentences. It's often used in speeches and poetry to emphasize a point and make it more memorable. One of the most famous examples of anaphora comes from Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech, where he repeats the phrase ‘I have a dream’ eight times. Alliteration You must have heard of alliteration – it’s the literary device that uses repetitive sounds at the beginning of words in a sentence or phrase. It's a technique that can add musicality and rhythm to your writing. Alliteration can create a sense of unity, emphasis, and resonance. Don’t overdo it, though – use it sparingly and purposefully. Too much alliteration can make your writing seem forced or gimmicky. Allegory An allegory is a story that has a hidden meaning that's used to communicate a moral or political message. It can convey complex ideas simply and entertainingly."},{"instruction":"Write a letter to my child self on their first day at camp from me.","output":"Dear Kid Me, It's your first time at camp, and I understand that you're full of big feelings.

In 2012, for the first time since Puerto Rico became a commonwealth in 1952, a majority of Puerto Ricans voted against the current relationship with the U.S. It was a close contest, with 54 percent saying \\"no.\\" But when asked what political status they preferred, \\"statehood\\" received the most votes by a large margin [source: Fabian], though a quarter of voters of the first question left that second question blank. In 2017, the question was asked again in a low turnout contest. More than 500,000 people favored statehood in that referendum, followed by nearly 7,800 votes for independence/free association and more than 6,800 votes for the current status. A non-binding referendum on the subject was once again held in November 2020, with a yes/no choice to the question \\"Should Puerto Rico be immediately admitted into the Union as a state?\\" Fifty-two percent voted \\"yes\\" while 47 percent voted \\"no.\\" But even so, it's not enough to make the commonwealth a state. Puerto Rico is a self-governing commonwealth that is \\"associated\\" with the U.S. Thanks to a 1917 law, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but since Puerto Rico isn't a state, the island's inhabitants cannot vote in presidential elections. In an odd twist, they can vote in presidential primaries, because primaries are organized by the Democratic and Republican national committees, not the federal government [source: Helgesen]. According to Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the ability to authorize the creation of a new state. Specifically, Section 3 prohibits the creation of new states from the territory of others without their consent, or the combining of two or more states without congressional approval [source: Monk]. In practice, a majority of the 50 states began as U.S. territories. Either the territories petitioned Congress for permission to draft a state constitution and elect representatives, or they followed the more aggressive \\"Tennessee Plan.\\" Tennessee, the very first U.S. territory, was rejected in its first bid for statehood, but decided to draft a state constitution anyway, and send two senators and a representative to Congress [source: Lehleitner]. Although Congress refused to seat the men, they successfully lobbied for statehood. Several other states followed the Tennessee model, including Alaska. Official admission to the Union requires Congress to draft — and the president to sign — a bill called an \\"enabling act.\\" For Puerto Rico to become a state, it would need to convince Congress and the president that statehood is not only in the best interest of the Puerto Rican people, but in the best interest of the United States as a whole. The U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives would need to approve the statehood admission by a simple majority vote, though some members of Congress want to raise that threshold to two-thirds majority [source: Longely, Rifkin].

And before anyone starts complaining and saying how they don't like racing games, please hear me out. This is the racing game that really tailors itself to EVERYONE, and in particular, people who aren't very likely to enjoy or embrace racing games as a whole. Playground Games have made a masterpiece here. Since it's a first-party Microsoft title, it's obviously gorgeous. The cars even have lovingly modeled and accurate interiors for over 500 cars, in addition to an extensive array of cosmetic and performance-adjusting parts for your cars and an amazing livery system to let you add a wide variety of artistic flair to your ride. There are literally people who only play the game to create art for others to enjoy. The variety of environments for you to race your cars in is extensive, from deserts to mountains, and there's no rush - if what you want to do is take a leisurely drive along the highway, you can do that. You don't ever have to get into a race. There's even a photo mode for you to take high-resolution screenshots and share them with friends. Many of these are so detailed that you can fool people. But if you do decide to dip your toes into the racing element (which I recommend highly), you'll find you have the ability to make the racing as easy or as difficult as you like. You can literally set the difficulty so low that it's almost impossible for you to lose. However, the game gives bonus rewards to you when you decide to raise the challenge, which encourages you to learn the systems at your own pace. It's a breeze to earn credits and \\"wheelspins\\" which will reward you with cars and cosmetic items for your avatar.

These can be frozen for later consumption or given as gifts.

Two days later, the Taiwan-based hardware maker has finally answered the calls for help. The mass outage, the company said, was the result of “an error in the configuration of our server settings file.” After fixing the glitch, most users needed to only reboot their devices. In the event that didn’t fix the problem, the company’s support team advised users to save their current configuration settings and perform a factory reset. The company also apologized. It was a frustrating two days for many users as they attempted to troubleshoot the outage. Asus’ silence during that time only added to the frustration. “This is a bunch of BS. Why doesn't Asus put out some kind of statement explaining what's going on?” one user complained. Asus still hasn’t provided details about the configuration error. Various users have offered explanations online that appear to be correct. “On the 16th, Asus pushed a corrupted definition file for ASD, a built-in security daemon present in a wide range of their routers,” one person wrote. “As routers automatically updated and fetched the corrupted definition file, they started running out of filesystem space and memory and crashing.” The explanation answered the question of what was causing routers to crash, but it raised a new one: Why were routers affected even when they had been configured to not automatically update and no manual update had been performed? Asus has yet to address this, but the likely answer is that the definitions file for ASD, which resides in memory and scans devices for security threats, gets updated whether or not automatic updates are enabled. The long and short of things is that the 48-hour mystery surrounding the malfunctioning Asus routers has now been solved and a fix is in place. We now return you to your normally scheduled Internet usage.\\"","output":"This article discusses how a recent update that was released by Asus for its routers resulted in a 48-hour outage for a number of its customers. Apparently, this was caused by a corrupted definition file for ASD (a built-in security daemon) that even affected routers that turned off automatic updates.

Granted, she was the only other customer in the room, but even that couldn’t explain the way his eyes kept glimpsing up at her from the paperwork strewn in front of him. Nor could it explain his throat going dry when she finally caught his eyes over her stack of pancakes. Her lip quipped up with a smile, which he returned without exactly meeting her gaze. There was something in the way her eyes creased in the corners that made him feel like he was running, hurdling full force into the next chapter of his life. “Never see anyone else here this late,” she speaks up over the empty booths. He looks up and watches as she lifts a forkful of food to her mouth, chewing at him with a glint in her eyes. He clears his throat. “Yeah. Deadlines.” “Deadlines,” she repeats, smile revealing pearly white teeth that make his heart catch in his chest. “Pardon me for interrupting.” “You’re not,” he reassures her, maybe a bit too fast. “It’s not a big deal,” he lies through his teeth.

The hats were attached to lines of fishing wire to give them an ethereal and floating aesthetic. • The dancers and singers featured in musical numbers are designed after typical male fantasies and fetishes, such as the gypsy, French maid, harlequin, and dominatrix. • The word “love” and its variations appear in the Moulin Rouge movie 143 times.

The internet has widely revolutionized how writers can get their works into the hands of eager readers, but even with advances in tech, the task of getting a novel published into a tangible book that people can purchase was no easy feat. That was until Amazon’s Kindle Direct Program gave authors a new path to self-publishing. Amazon’s KDP system allows anybody to publish a book with very little overhead. Anything from a coloring book to a lengthy fantasy tome can be published via Amazon KDP. This low barrier of entry has led to a unique problem for Amazon as AI-generated content has begun to effectively flood the market. Hundreds of books that list AI counterparts such as Bing Chat, ChatGPT, or MidJourney as co-authors or illustrators have found their way to Amazon’s marketplace. While listing AI as a co-creator is a possibility, there is currently no requirement in Amazon’s content policy that dictates AI must be listed when it has been used to generate a book. The content guidelines do state that Amazon will not accept content that is freely available on the web unless it is provided by the owner of the copyright, but there are no further details on how that may be enforced in a scenario where a book generated by AI content is listed. AI generators such as ChatGPT and Midjourney rely very heavily on scraping existing datasets of art and written works to produce responses to prompts input by users. There has been no shortage of public discourse between creatives and AI users on whether or not the works generated are in fact plagiarized or otherwise violations of intellectual property and copyright laws. Despite their content guidelines strictly forbidding plagiarism, Amazon has seemingly taken the side in favor of AI-generated content by allowing sellers to hide whether or not their books are written by humans or AI.","output":"Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) program has made it easier for anyone to self-publish a book.

Despite being one of the league's all-time home run leaders, Bonds has struggled to make his way into the Hall of Fame.

Other notable names to have steroids cloud their reputation include sluggers Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Alex Rodrigues. It is a tough position for Hall of Fame voters and fans alike as they try to separate their feelings about steroids from the players' careers. In his time in the majors, Bonds slugged 762 homers at a .298 average. It is undoubted that Barry Bonds is one of, if not the best, hitter of all time. By all accounts, he should be in the Hall of Fame. His stats are truly remarkable, and we may never see another batter who dominated the game in the way that he did.

All forex trading is conducted over the counter (OTC), meaning there’s no physical exchange (as there is for stocks) and a global network of banks and other financial institutions oversee the market (instead of a central exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange).

These traders don’t necessarily intend to take physical possession of the currencies themselves; they may simply be speculating about or hedging against future exchange rate fluctuations. A forex trader might buy U.S. dollars (and sell euros), for example, if she believes the dollar will strengthen in value and therefore be able to buy more euros in the future. Meanwhile, an American company with European operations could use the forex market as a hedge in the event the euro weakens, meaning the value of their income earned there falls.

This name combines the sport you are competing in with the fact that your office job is more mentally than physically stimulating in order to create the image that you are equally intelligent when it comes to playing softball as you are in your office jobs. 3. Briefcase Bashers. Referencing the common practice of taking a briefcase to the office as well as the ability to bash a home run on the softball field, this name lets your opponents know that you are a force to be reckoned with no matter the setting. 4. The Pencil Pushers. This name pokes fun at the negative perception that office workers spend the bulk of their time performing tedious and repetitive work, reclaiming the title as a point of pride for your team."},{"instruction":"Pretend you’re writing in your dream journal and write an entry about a dream/nightmare which had the following important details: You were being chased by a giant cat, you had a tail, the moon was full, and there was a labyrinth. Also, mention the fear. Use a lot of descriptive words. >300 words.","output":"Last night, I had a dream that was really more like a nightmare. I woke up drenched in sweat, exhausted, and out of breath. And while I don’t know quite what it meant, I don’t want to forget a single thing. So here’s what happened: The first thing I noticed was that I was running. But not just running; I was running for my life. Although I didn’t know what I was running from at the time, I knew I had to move fast. Then, it became clear that there were walls around me; I was running through a kind of labyrinth. It wasn’t made out of plaster or wood; the walls were giant plants that seemed to be moving like little animals. As I sprinted through the maze, trying to take the correct turns, I caught a glimpse of something behind me. And even though I didn’t completely see it, somehow I knew that it was a giant cat. But not like a lion or a tiger; it was a domestic cat, but it was the size of a truck. The fear became almost debilitating, but I couldn’t stop running. And just as I started to wonder why the cat was chasing me, I felt something behind me. I realized it was a long tail, almost like rope. I don’t know how I knew, but it was suddenly clear that I was a mouse. Now that it made sense as to why the cat was chasing me, I still couldn’t figure out how to get out of the labyrinth. I knew if I slowed down at all, I would be eaten and killed. The intense fear for my life kept me going at top speed. It felt as though the cat was getting closer and closer, and just when I thought I was done for, I woke up in my bed."},{"instruction":"Write a short news article set in the Fall Guys universe. If any quotes from the Fall Guys beans are used, they should only be variations of the word \\"Woo.\\"","output":"Deadly Rhino Attacks Increase in Recent Months Ever since the start of the third season, there has been a marked increase in rhino attacks against innocent beans. Slime injuries have climbed a stunning 90% from the previous season, and many beans have reported symptoms of PTSD associated with the sight of rhinos. Our journalistic investigation has uncovered several potential causes for this alarming new phenomenon. First, many beans had gotten used to the safety hexes that allowed them to permanently avoid the rhinos. Now, with the disappearance of these hexes - rumored to have been locked away in a vault - their previous rhino dodging skills have gotten rusty. It is not uncommon now to see rounds of Stomping Grounds end with a single winner, or even with no winners at all. Another common theory is that the rhinos have gotten smarter. It used to be that dodging out of the way once was enough for the rhino to chase after some other unfortunate bean. However, now the rhinos won't let go until their attacks succeed in eliminating their target. Consecutive attacks are almost guaranteed now. And even worse, they've even learned teamwork, with multiple rhinos forming pincer attacks against a single bean. Finally, the last theory is that there is a sinister conspiracy that makes Stomping Grounds a much more common map so that the rhinos can find more victims. Some beans have reported meeting the rhinos in the second round of almost every game they played, which is certainly strong statistical evidence for this conspiracy theory. Faced with an unseen enemy conspiring against them, and formidable foes in the form of powerful rhinos, our resident Fall Guys have been struggling to adapt. We recently interviewed the sole survivor of a particularly bloody round, where three rhinos successfully teamed up to eliminate almost ten beans at once. \\"Woo!\\" said the sole surviving winner. However, not all beans were so optimistic. One bean we interviewed has been punted into the slime 10 games in a row. His quote was considerably less enthusiastic. \\"Woo.\\" These are sobering words that remind us all of our own mortality. We can only hope that the rhino situation improves next season."},{"instruction":"Describe a character Bob Ross might use if he was playing Dungeons and Dragons.","output":"Brossard is a cheerful human cleric. His long beard, tinged with gray, hangs lightly over his stout violet chest plate. He carries a heavy blunted mace engraved with runes that glow in prismatic hues. Brossard lives a mostly quiet life, in a thatched cottage between the forests and the mountains. His home is well known to many, as he is a practicing patron of mercy, healing, and community.
