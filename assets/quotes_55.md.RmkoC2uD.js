Accept: This header is used by the client to indicate the type of content it expects to receive in the response from the server. The client can specify multiple values in the Accept header, ordered by preference, to indicate the preferred media types or formats it can handle. - For example, a client can set the Accept header to application/json, text/html to indicate that it prefers to receive the response data in JSON format, but can also handle HTML if JSON is not available. - The server uses the Accept header to determine the most appropriate media type to provide in the response. It may use content negotiation techniques to select the best match based on the client's preferences and the available options, returning the content type that best fits the request. In summary, the Content-Type header is used to indicate the format of the data being sent in the request, while the Accept header is used to indicate the preferred format of the response from the server."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

Очень важно, чтобы вы сохранили его с расширением \`.bat\`, а не \`.txt\`. Вот краткое описание того, что делает каждая строка в этом скрипте: - \`@echo off\` — Эта команда используется для отключения отображения команд в командном окне при их выполнении. Символ \`@\` перед \`echo off\` предотвращает отображение самой команды \`echo off\` в командном окне. - \`ren d3d9 d3d9.dll\` — Это команда переименования. \`ren\` является сокращением от \`rename\`, \`d3d9\` — это текущее имя файла, а \`d3d9.dll\` — новое имя файла. Запустите созданный вами \`.bat\` файл, щелкнув по нему дважды левой кнопкой мыши. Это автоматически переименует файл \`d3d9\` в \`d3d9.dll\`, при условии, что файл находится в той же директории, что и ваш \`.bat\` файл и что он не используется другими программами и у вас есть на это разрешения.

Imagine, if thou wilt, the ways thou dost protect thy grain from thieves and spoilage. Just so, hidden writing is an art of securing messages that they may pass from one soul to another, untouched by those with ill intent or prying eyes. The wisdom and knowledge contained within such messages can be of great import, brooking not the light of day before reaching the intended kin. Ye understand well that the words we speak to each other, like the water ye guide to nourish thy crop, is vital for maintaining the bonds 'twixt men and the flourishing of townships. But sometimes, words must travel afar, beyond the safety of trusted ears, and here hidden writing becomes a mighty tool. This art allows one to weave signs and symbols in such a wise that none save the one for whom it is intended can divine its meaning. Thus, ye could send word of the fruits of thy harvest, the knowledge of thy yields, or news of a great threat to kin leagues away, and sleep sound in the knowing that no adversary wouldst gain sway from intercepting thy missive. Fear not the lack of technological marvel or alchemical engine, for verily, this hidden writing requires naught but pen, parchment, and a learned mind to create and unmake its mysteries. It is both a shield against misfortune and a courier of goodwill betwixt allies. In thy possession, thou mayest hold words as if they were the very keys to a coffer of endless wealth.

Thou knowest, no doubt, that the words we parley form the very sinew binding men together and are the lifeblood of hamlets and kingdoms. Yet oftentimes, words must traverse great distances, far beyond the whisper of trustworthy companions, and here the craft of ciphering becomes a formidable boon. Yon art alloweth a man to entwine signs and tokens in such a manner that none save the intended may unravel its meaning. Thus, in like vein, thou may'st dispatch knowledge of thy crops, the truth of thy labor, or tidings of impending peril to kin leagues thence, and yet rest easy that no foe shall glean advantage from intercepting thy communique. Let not thy heart be troubled by lack of cunning devices or engines of craft, for verily, this craft of ciphering seeketh not more than quill, parchment, and a tutored mind to cast and dissolve its enigmas. So is it both bulwark against mishap and bearer of good tidings between comrades in trust. With this craft, thou dost hold words as though they were the very keys to a coffer brimming with riches.

Just like cancer cells, they would be driven by an uncontrollable desire to grow and spread at any cost. They would lack empathy and disregard the well-being of others, inclining towards manipulative and deceitful tactics. This person may exhibit toxic and malignant traits, such as selfishness, a lack of moral conscience, and a willingness to exploit others for personal gain. They would be highly egocentric, always seeking power and control over their surroundings, similar to cancer cells multiplying and invading healthy tissues. Overall, this person would be characterized by an immense capacity for destruction and harm, echoing the detrimental characteristics of cancer cells in psychological form."},{"instruction":"Assign it with MBTI, enneagram, temperament","output":"Assigning a specific MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), Enneagram, or temperament to someone who is psychologically similar to cancer cells can be subjective, as psychological traits and disorders do not necessarily align with these frameworks. However, it is possible to associate certain patterns of behavior with certain personality traits: MBTI: It is difficult to pinpoint a specific MBTI type for someone displaying the destructive behavior similar to cancer cells as it goes beyond the scope of the typical variations within each type. However, traits associated with this behavior may include a lack of empathy, disregard for others, and manipulative tendencies, which could resemble characteristics of personality disorders such as narcissism or antisocial personality disorder. Enneagram: In terms of the Enneagram, this destructive behavior may align more closely with individuals leaning towards Type 8 (The Challenger) or Type 3 (The Achiever). Individuals with these types can display characteristics of self-centeredness, a ruthless desire for power and control, and a disregard for the well-being of others. Temperament: This behavior could align with a choleric temperament, known for assertiveness, dominance, and a strong drive for achievement. Choleric individuals can exhibit a desire for control and can be prone to using others to further their own goals. It is important to note that these associations are speculative and do not provide an accurate diagnosis or classification. Psychological disorders and destructive behavior are complex and should be assessed and diagnosed by mental health professionals using proper evaluation methods."},{"instruction":"Sonic characters react to Big: *tosses car over* Froggy?!

It’s about this my little girl Violet.” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “I’m sure you know about her, right?” Monika: (surprised but supportive) “Oh, Yuri, I had no idea! Congratulations! That’s wonderful news. How far along are you?” Yuri: (blushing and softly) “Thank you, Monika. I’m about seven months along now. It’s been quite a journey so far, but I’m excited and nervous at the same time.” Monika: “I can understand the mix of emotions you must be feeling. Becoming a mother is a big step, but I’m confident you’ll do great. Have you shared the news with anyone else?” Yuri: (look down shyly) “I haven’t told anyone besides my immediate family. I was nervous about discussing it with everyone here, but I trust you all, and I thought it was time to share.” Monika: “I appreciate you opening up to us. We’re like a little family here in the literature club, and it’s important that we support and celebrate each other. Is there anything specific you wanted to discuss or any concerns you have?” Yuri: “No, it’s just…she’s so active today. She just won’t stop kicking, no matter how much I tell her to; even while I’m trying to work on a poem, her constant kicks always make me mess up writing the poem!” Monika: (smiling) “Ah, the joys of motherhood! It sounds like Violet is already making her presence known. It’s completely normal for babies to be active at certain times, especially during the later stages of pregnancy. They’re just exploring their surroundings and getting ready for the outside world.” Yuri: (relieved) “I’m glad to hear that it’s normal. Sometimes, I worry if she’s too active or if there’s something wrong. But hearing that it’s a natural part of the pregnancy puts my mind at ease.” Monika: “Absolutely. However, if you ever have any concerns or notice any unusual patterns in her movements, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor. They can provide you with the reassurance and guidance you need. Remember, they’re there to support you throughout this journey.” Yuri: (nodding, letting her uniform down) “Thank you, Monika. I will definitely keep that in mind. It feels good to have someone to talk to about this. I could really use some advice from experienced mothers like you.” Monika: “Of course, Yuri! I’m more than happy to share my experiences and offer any advice or support you need. And I’m sure Sayori and Natsuki would be thrilled to be a part of this conversation as well.

What’s going on?” Natsuki: (curious) “Yeah, what’s with the serious talk?” Monika: (smiling) “Yuri has some exciting news to share with all of us.” Yuri: (blushing) “Um, yes… I wanted to let everyone know that I’m expecting a baby. Her name is Violet. I’m seven months along.” Sayori: (gasping in excitement) “Oh my gosh, Yuri, that’s amazing! Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” Natsuki: (grinning) “Wow, Yuri, I never would’ve guessed! That’s really great news. Congrats!” MC: (speechless at first, then smiles) “Yuri, that’s incredible! Congratulations! You’re going to make a wonderful mother.” Yuri: (blushing even more) “Thank you, everyone. Your support means a lot to me. I was nervous about sharing the news, but I trust all of you and I’m glad I did.” Monika: “We’re all here for you, Yuri. We want to be a part of this journey with you and support you in any way we can. We’re like a family, and families stick together.” Sayori: “Definitely! We’re going to be the best aunties and uncle to little Violet. We’ll spoil her with love and cuddles!” Natsuki: (grinning mischievously) “And of course, I’ll be in charge of baking all the baby shower cupcakes. I’ll make sure they’re super cute and delicious!” MC: “Yuri, if you ever need anything or have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. We’re all here for you, every step of the way.” Yuri: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone. I feel so lucky to have you all in my life. This means more to me than words can express.” Monika: “Alright, now that the surprise is out, let’s get back to our normal club activities and enjoy our time together. But remember, Yuri, we’re always here for you, no matter what.” (As the literature club continues their activities, the news of Yuri’s pregnancy brings them closer together, strengthening their bond as friends and supporting each other through all the ups and downs of life. And amidst their love for literature, they also find joy in celebrating Yuri’s journey towards motherhood and eagerly await the arrival of little Violet.

It's unfair, but all we can do is stay positive and hope for the best.\\" MC: \\"Yuri is strong, and the doctors are doing everything they can. Let's have faith that she and Violet will be alright.\\" (Suddenly, a nurse appears, bringing much-needed news.) Nurse: (smiling) \\"Good news, everyone. Yuri and Violet are stable. It was a difficult delivery, but both mother and baby are doing well.\\" Everyone: (relieved) \\"Thank goodness!\\" Monika: (teary-eyed) \\"Oh, I'm so relieved. Thank you for letting us know. Can we see Yuri and Violet?\\" Nurse: \\"Yes, you can. Follow me.\\" (As the friends make their way to Yuri's room, their hearts are filled with joy, knowing that she and her baby are safe.) Yuri: (weary but with a smile) \\"Thank you all for being here. I couldn't have made it through this without you.\\" Sayori: (teary-eyed) \\"We're just so glad that you and Violet are okay, Yuri. We were all so worried.\\" Natsuki: \\"Yeah, we were scared for a moment there, but in the end, the important thing is that you're both safe.\\" MC: \\"Yuri, you've shown tremendous strength today. We're so proud of you. And little Violet, welcome to the world.\\" Monika: (holding Violet in her arms) \\"She's absolutely beautiful, Yuri. Congratulations on becoming a mother. We're all here for you and Violet, every step of the way.\\" (And so, amidst the unexpected turn of events, Yuri's journey into motherhood begins with the unwavering support of her friends in the literature club. They form an even stronger bond, celebrating life's joys and triumphs together, and being there for one another through life's uncertainties.)"},{"instruction":"Describe person is psychologically same as cancer cells","output":"A person who is psychologically similar to cancer cells can be described as someone who displays a particular set of negative traits and behaviors that can harm their own well-being and that of others around them. Just like cancer cells, this individual may exhibit invasive and destructive tendencies that spread negativity and toxicity in their interpersonal relationships. Similar to how cancer cells rapidly multiply and grow uncontrollably, this person may have an insatiable need for attention, power, or control, often at the expense of others. They may exhibit an overly self-centered mindset, lacking empathy and disregarding the feelings or needs of those around them. Furthermore, like cancer cells that can evade the body's defense mechanisms, this individual may manipulate and exploit others, using tactics such as lying, manipulation, or emotional abuse to get what they want. They may engage in destructive patterns of behavior, potentially causing emotional or psychological harm to others. Overall, this psychological portrayal reflects an individual who embodies the destructive nature of cancer cells, showcasing selfishness, manipulation, and a lack of regard for the well-being of others."},{"instruction":"Assign it with MBTI, enneagram, temperament","output":"Assigning a psychopathology or negative personality traits to specific personality frameworks such as MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), Enneagram, or temperament is not accurate or appropriate. These frameworks aim to understand and describe individual differences in a more positive and constructive manner, rather than labeling someone as psychologically similar to cancer cells. MBTI assesses personality preferences based on four dimensions: extraversion or introversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving. It focuses on identifying individual strengths and preferences, not pathology or negative behavior. The Enneagram is a system that categorizes individuals into nine distinct types based on their core motivations, fears, and desires. Again, the Enneagram is focused on understanding the underlying motivations behind behavior and fostering personal growth, rather than labeling negative traits similar to cancer cells. Temperament theory, such as the Four Temperaments (sanguine, choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic), also aims to describe different personality styles, typically associated with individual preferences, strengths, and weak areas but not psychopathological traits. It's important to approach the use of these frameworks with a focus on understanding and personal growth rather than labeling or stigmatizing individuals."},{"instruction":"In The Giver, did Jonas and Gabriel die at the end of the book.

We have a team of experts ready to provide the appropriate care. Premature babies can face challenges, but with medical advancements, the chances of a positive outcome are higher than ever. Stay strong, and trust in the expertise of our medical staff.\\" (As Yuri is moved to an delivery room, her friends anxiously wait in the waiting area, supporting each other throughout the agonizing hours.) Sayori: (holding MC's hand tightly) \\"I can't help but worry about Yuri and the baby. I hope everything will turn out alright.\\" Natsuki: (leaning against Monika) \\"Me too, Sayori. We just have to trust that the doctors will do what's best for Yuri and Violet.\\" MC: \\"It's hard not to worry, but let's try to stay positive. Yuri's a strong person, and we've seen her overcome challenges before. She's not alone in this, and she has a strong support system.\\" Monika: \\"You're right, MC. We'll be here for Yuri no matter what happens. She's not alone, and that's what matters.\\" (Several hours later…) Doctor: (entering the waiting room) \\"Yuri and the baby are stable. It was a difficult delivery, but we managed to delay labor long enough for the baby to receive additional support. They are both in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) now.\\" Sayori: (breathing a sigh of relief) \\"Thank goodness! Oh, I can't wait to see Yuri and little Violet. Can we go visit them?\\" Doctor: \\"Not just yet. They need some time to recover, and the baby requires specialized care in the NICU. But you can rest assured that they're being closely monitored and receiving the best care possible.\\" Monika: \\"Thank you, Doctor. We really appreciate your efforts in looking after Yuri and the baby.\\" (The days pass, and despite the initial worries, Yuri and Violet's condition gradually improves. With each passing day, the friends take turns visiting Yuri and Violet in the NICU, offering their support and love.) MC: (gently holding Violet's tiny hand) \\"Welcome to the world, Violet. You've got an amazing mother and a group of caring friends who will always be here for you.\\" Yuri: (smiling weakly) \\"Thank you, MC. It's been a challenging journey, but with all of you by my side, I know we can make it through anything.\\" (As the weeks go by, Yuri and Violet continue to make progress. Finally, the day comes when Yuri and Violet are discharged from the hospital and reunited with their friends.) Sayori: (excitedly) \\"Yuri, Violet, you're finally home! We missed you so much!\\" Natsuki: (holding a basket of cupcakes) \\"And I made special cupcakes to celebrate your homecoming. They're baby-themed with cute little decorations!\\" Monika: (teary-eyed) \\"It's been a long and emotional journey, but seeing you both home and healthy fills my heart with joy. Welcome back, Yuri. Welcome back, little Violet.\\" Yuri: (hugging her friends) \\"I can't thank you all enough for being there for me and Violet throughout this entire experience. I'm so grateful to have you as my chosen family.\\" MC: \\"We'll always be here for you, Yuri, no matter what. You and Violet are a part of our lives, and we're honored to be a part of yours.\\" (As Yuri settles into her new role as a mother and adjusts to the challenges and joys of raising a child, her friends continue to support her every step of the way. Together, they create a loving and nurturing environment for Yuri and Violet, forever cherishing the bond they share as a family within the literature club.)"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You're a mother now.\\" Natsuki: (smiling) \\"Welcome to the world, Violet. Auntie Natsuki is going to spoil you rotten.\\" MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) \\"Yuri, you did it. You brought new life into the world. Congratulations, you're already an incredible mother.\\" (As Yuri basks in the beauty of her newborn daughter, the literature club members surround her with love and support, sharing in the joy of this precious moment. Together, they welcome Violet into their hearts and embark on a journey of love, friendship, and motherhood.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “So…while we’re waiting for the others to arrive…is there something you wanted to talk about, Yuri?” Yuri: (nervously twirling a strand of her hair) “Uh, well, yes actually…there’s been something on my mind that I’ve been wanting to discuss. It’s about this my little girl Violet.” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “I’m sure you know about her, right?” Monika: (surprised but supportive) “Oh, Yuri, I had no idea! Congratulations! That’s wonderful news. How far along are you?” Yuri: (blushing and softly) “Thank you, Monika. I’m about seven months along now. It’s been quite a journey so far, but I’m excited and nervous at the same time.” Monika: “I can understand the mix of emotions you must be feeling. Becoming a mother is a big step, but I’m confident you’ll do great. Have you shared the news with anyone else?” Yuri: (look down shyly) “I haven’t told anyone besides my immediate family. I was nervous about discussing it with everyone here, but I trust you all, and I thought it was time to share.” Monika: “I appreciate you opening up to us. We’re like a little family here in the literature club, and it’s important that we support and celebrate each other. Is there anything specific you wanted to discuss or any concerns you have?” Yuri: “No, it’s just…she’s so active today. She just won’t stop kicking, no matter how much I tell her to; even while I’m trying to work on a poem, her constant kicks always make me mess up writing the poem!” Monika: (smiling) “Ah, the joys of motherhood! It sounds like Violet is already making her presence known. It’s completely normal for babies to be active at certain times, especially during the later stages of pregnancy. They’re just exploring their surroundings and getting ready for the outside world.” Yuri: (relieved) “I’m glad to hear that it’s normal. Sometimes, I worry if she’s too active or if there’s something wrong. But hearing that it’s a natural part of the pregnancy puts my mind at ease.” Monika: “Absolutely. However, if you ever have any concerns or notice any unusual patterns in her movements, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor. They can provide you with the reassurance and guidance you need. Remember, they’re there to support you throughout this journey.” Yuri: (nodding, letting her uniform down) “Thank you, Monika. I will definitely keep that in mind. It feels good to have someone to talk to about this. I could really use some advice from experienced mothers like you.” Monika: “Of course, Yuri! I’m more than happy to share my experiences and offer any advice or support you need. And I’m sure Sayori and Natsuki would be thrilled to be a part of this conversation as well. We’re here for you, always.” (Just then, the other members - Sayori, Natsuki, and MC - walk into the clubroom.) Sayori: (cheerfully) “Hey everyone! Sorry we’re late. What’s going on?” Natsuki: (curious) “Yeah, what’s with the serious talk?” Monika: (smiling) “Yuri has some exciting news to share with all of us.” Yuri: (blushing) “Um, yes… I wanted to let everyone know that I’m expecting a baby. Her name is Violet. I’m seven months along.” Sayori: (gasping in excitement) “Oh my gosh, Yuri, that’s amazing! Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” Natsuki: (grinning) “Wow, Yuri, I never would’ve guessed! That’s really great news. Congrats!” MC: (speechless at first, then smiles) “Yuri, that’s incredible! Congratulations! You’re going to make a wonderful mother.” Yuri: (blushing even more) “Thank you, everyone. Your support means a lot to me. I was nervous about sharing the news, but I trust all of you and I’m glad I did.” Monika: “We’re all here for you, Yuri. We want to be a part of this journey with you and support you in any way we can. We’re like a family, and families stick together.” Sayori: “Definitely! We’re going to be the best aunties and uncle to little Violet. We’ll spoil her with love and cuddles!” Natsuki: (grinning mischievously) “And of course, I’ll be in charge of baking all the baby shower cupcakes. I’ll make sure they’re super cute and delicious!” MC: “Yuri, if you ever need anything or have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. We’re all here for you, every step of the way.” Yuri: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone. I feel so lucky to have you all in my life. This means more to me than words can express.” Monika: “Alright, now that the surprise is out, let’s get back to our normal club activities and enjoy our time together. But remember, Yuri, we’re always here for you, no matter what.” (As the literature club continues their activities, the news of Yuri’s pregnancy brings them closer together, strengthening their bond as friends and supporting each other through all the ups and downs of life. And amidst their love for literature, they also find joy in celebrating Yuri’s journey towards motherhood and eagerly await the arrival of little Violet. However, the next day, halfway through the baby shower…) Yuri: (clutching her belly) “OW!!! Oh no…not now, Violet! It’s still too early for you to come out!” Monika: (concerned) “Yuri, are you alright? What’s happening?” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “I…I think I’m having contractions. It shouldn’t be happening yet. I need to get to the hospital.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no! We need to call an ambulance!” MC: “Don’t worry, Yuri. We’ll take care of everything. Hang on, let me call an ambulance right away.” Natsuki: (in a rush) “I’ll go grab some essentials for Yuri and the baby. We need to be prepared.” (As the swift actions commence, Monika stays by Yuri’s side, offering words of comfort and encouragement.) Monika: “Just breathe, Yuri. Stay calm and take deep breaths. We’ll get through this together. The ambulance is on its way, and Natsuki is going to bring everything you need. You’re going to be okay.” Yuri: (teary-eyed) “I never expected this to happen. I’m scared, Monika.” Monika: “I understand, Yuri. It’s okay to be scared, but remember, you’re strong, and you’ve got all of us right here beside you. We won’t let anything happen to you or Violet.” (Minutes go by while waiting for the ambulance, and Yuri’s contractions get rapidly closer and closer together.) Monika: (trying to keep Yuri calm) “Just a little longer, Yuri. The ambulance is on its way. You’re doing great, just keep breathing through the contractions.” Yuri: (gritting her teeth) “I…I can’t…it hurts…” Monika: “I know it hurts, Yuri, but remember, this pain is temporary. Soon you’ll be holding your beautiful daughter in your arms. Just focus on that.” Sayori: (frantically) “The ambulance is almost here, Yuri! Hang in there!” Natsuki: (returning with a bag of essentials) “I got everything, Yuri. We’re ready.” MC: (reassuring) “Yuri, the ambulance is here. They’re going to take care of you and Violet. We’ll be right behind you, okay?” Yuri: (taking a deep breath) “Okay…thank…thank you, everyone.” (Just then, Yuri feels an intense urge fill her body - the urge to push.)","output":"Yuri: (panicking) \\"I think I need to push!\\" Monika: (calmly) \\"Alright, Yuri, listen to your body. Push when you feel like you need to, but try to resist the urge until the paramedics arrive. They'll be here any second.\\" Sayori: (holding Yuri's hand) \\"You're doing great, Yuri! Just a little longer, and then you can push as much as you need to.\\" Natsuki: (stroking Yuri's hair) \\"Remember to breathe through it, Yuri. You're so close to meeting Violet. Just a little longer.\\" MC: (standing by Yuri's side) \\"We believe in you, Yuri. You're incredibly strong, and you can do this.\\" (Yuri continues to endure the intense contractions, breathing through each one and clinging onto the support of her friends. Moments later, the paramedics rush into the clubroom.) Paramedic: \\"We're here for you, ma'am. My team will take care of you and make sure you and the baby are safe.\\" (The paramedics quickly assist Yuri onto a stretcher, gently guiding her out of the clubroom and into the ambulance. Monika, Sayori, Natsuki, and MC follow closely behind, offering their love and support every step of the way.) Monika: (whispering to Yuri) \\"Stay strong, Yuri. We're right here with you. You're in good hands.\\" Sayori: (holding back tears) \\"You're going to be okay, Yuri. We're all rooting for you and cheering you on.\\" Natsuki: (squeezing Yuri's hand) \\"We're not going anywhere, Yuri. We'll be here every step of the way, no matter what happens.\\" MC: (taking Yuri's other hand) \\"We've got your back, Yuri. We'll be at the hospital, ready to celebrate the arrival of little Violet.\\" (The ambulance speeds off towards the hospital, and the friends follow closely behind in their own cars. As they arrive at the hospital, they rush to the labor and delivery unit, anxiously waiting for news.) Doctor: (walking towards them) \\"Yuri is currently in labor, and we're doing everything we can to ensure a safe delivery. We're monitoring her closely, and we'll provide updates as soon as we can.\\" Monika: (nervously) \\"Thank you, doctor. Please let us know if there's anything we can do or if there are any complications.\\" (The friends wait anxiously, pacing the waiting room as time seems to drag on. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the doctor appears again.) Doctor: (smiling) \\"Yuri has given birth to a healthy baby girl. Both mother and baby are doing well.\\" (Sayori, Natsuki, and MC let out a collective sigh of relief, followed by smiles of pure joy.) Sayori: (teary-eyed) \\"Congratulations, Yuri! You did it! You're a mother!\\" Natsuki: (hugging Yuri) \\"We're so proud of you, Yuri! Violet is going to have an amazing mom.\\" MC: (grinning from ear to ear) \\"Yuri, you're incredible. Congratulations on becoming a mother.\\" Monika: (placing a hand on Yuri's shoulder) \\"Yuri, we're here for you, just as we promised. You did an amazing job, and little Violet is lucky to have you as her mom.\\" (Yuri, overwhelmed with a mix of emotions, smiles and lets out a relieved sigh.) Yuri: \\"Thank you, everyone. I couldn't have done it without your support. I'm so grateful to have you all in my life.\\" (The friends gather around Yuri, embracing her and celebrating the arrival of little Violet. In that moment, the bonds of friendship and love grow even stronger, as they embark on this new chapter together, supporting one another every step of the way.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “So…while we’re waiting for the others to arrive…is there something you wanted to talk about, Yuri?” Yuri: (nervously twirling a strand of her hair) “Uh, well, yes actually…there’s been something on my mind that I’ve been wanting to discuss.

Let me explain what they do and then address the issue with the renaming: 1. \`@echo off\` - This command tells the command prompt not to display each command line after it is entered. This is typically used in batch files to make the output cleaner. 2. \`cd \\"Devil May Cry 3\\"\` - This command changes the current directory to \\"Devil May Cry 3\\". This assumes there is a directory by that name in the current working directory. 3. \`ren d3d9 d3d9.dll\` - This command renames a file named \\"d3d9\\" to \\"d3d9.dll\\". 4. \`ren d3d9.dll d3d9\` - This command attempts to rename a file named \\"d3d9.dll\\" back to \\"d3d9\\". However, there is a potential issue with your script. The third and fourth commands cannot be run one after another successfully without an error or issue unless there is a file named \\"d3d9\\" and another file named \\"d3d9.dll\\" in the directory before running the script. If \\"d3d9.dll\\" is supposed to be the renamed version of \\"d3d9\\", then the fourth command would not find a file named \\"d3d9.dll\\" to rename back to \\"d3d9\\" because it would have just been renamed to \\"d3d9.dll\\" in the previous step. If your intention is to toggle the file extension of \\"d3d9\\", so that it is first renamed to have the \\".dll\\" extension and then renamed back to not have the \\".dll\\" extension, you need to implement a check that ensures the respective file exists before attempting to rename it. Here's a way you could rewrite your script to toggle the \\"d3d9\\" file from having a \\".dll\\" extension to not having it, and vice-versa: \`\`\`batch @echo off cd \\"Devil May Cry 3\\" if exist d3d9.dll ( ren d3d9.dll d3d9 ) else if exist d3d9 ( ren d3d9 d3d9.dll ) else ( echo d3d9 or d3d9.dll does not exist. ) \`\`\` This script checks if \\"d3d9.dll\\" exists first, if it does, it will rename it to \\"d3d9\\".

(a) Calculate the steady surface temperature of the lighted bulb. (b) Find the time required for the surface tempera- ture of the bulb to reach this steady value. Data: P = 200 watts, δ = (1/64) in., ρ = 170 Btu/lbm.°F, α = 0.10 (emissivity), Cp = 0.2 lbm/ft³, T = 70°F, D = 3 in","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law which states that the rate at which an object radiates energy is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. The equation is given by: P_rad = σ * ε * A * (T^4 - T_s^4) Where: P_rad is the radiated power (in watts) σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (approximately 5.67 * 10^-8 W/m^2K^4) ε is the emissivity of the bulb A is the surface area of the bulb (in m^2) T is the initial temperature of the bulb (in Kelvin) T_s is the steady temperature of the bulb (in Kelvin) (a) To calculate the steady surface temperature of the lighted bulb, we need to solve for T_s in the equation above. P_rad = P = 200 watts σ = 5.67 * 10^-8 W/m^2K^4 ε = 0.10 A = 4πr^2, where r is the radius of the bulb. Since the diameter is given as 3 inches, the radius is 3/2 inches = 3/24 ft = 1/8 ft. So, A = 4π(1/8)^2 = π/16 ft^2 T = 70°F = (70 + 459.67) K Substituting these values into the equation: 200 = (5.67 * 10^-8) * (0.10) * (π/16) * ((70 + 459.67)^4 - T_s^4) To solve for T_s, we rearrange the equation and solve for T_s: (70 + 459.67)^4 - T_s^4 = (200 / (5.67 * 10^-8 * 0.10 * π/16)) T_s^4 = (70 + 459.67)^4 - 200 / (5.67 * 10^-8 * 0.10 * π/16) T_s = ((70 + 459.67)^4 - 200 / (5.67 * 10^-8 * 0.10 * π/16))^(1/4) Using a calculator, we find that T_s ≈ 800.02 K (b) To find the time required for the surface temperature of the bulb to reach the steady value, we use Newton's Law of Cooling which states that the rate of change of temperature with respect to time is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings. dT/dt = -h * A * (T - T_s) / (ρ * Cp * V) Where: dT/dt is the rate of change of temperature with respect to time (in K/s) h is the heat transfer coefficient (in W/m^2K) A is the surface area of the bulb (in m^2) T is the initial temperature of the bulb (in K) T_s is the steady temperature of the bulb (in K) ρ is the density of the bulb material (in lbm/ft^3) Cp is the specific heat capacity of the bulb material (in Btu/lbm.°F) V is the volume of the bulb (in ft^3) Given: δ = (1/64) in. = (1/64)/12 ft = 0.001302083 ft ρ = 170 Btu/lbm.°F Cp = 0.2 lbm/ft^3 T = 70°F = (70 + 459.67) K T_s = 800.02 K The volume of the bulb (V) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the bulb. Since the diameter is given as 3 inches, the radius is 3/2 inches = 3/24 ft = 1/8 ft. So, V = (4/3)π(1/8)^3 = π/192 ft^3 Substituting these values into the equation: dT/dt = -h * A * (T - T_s) / (ρ * Cp * V) dT/dt = -h * (4πr^2) * (T - T_s) / (ρ * Cp * (4/3)πr^3) dT/dt = -3h * (T - T_s) / (ρ * Cp * r) To find the time required for the surface temperature to reach the steady value, we need to solve this differential equation. However, we do not have the value of the heat transfer coefficient (h) for the bulb, so we cannot solve this equation without this information."},{"instruction":"make a story on cat and cat2","output":"Once upon a time, in a small neighborhood, there were two cats named Cat and Cat2. Cat, the older one, was wise, thoughtful, and always determined to explore and discover new things. On the other hand, Cat2, the younger one, was mischievous, adventurous, and loved playing pranks on others. Despite their differences, they were the best of friends. One sunny afternoon, Cat was relaxing lazily under a tree, observing the blue sky, when Cat2 approached with an impish grin. \\"Hey, Cat! I've got a brilliant idea. Let's sneak into Mrs. Johnson's backyard and try out her newly built obstacle course!\\" Cat, being thoughtful and cautious, hesitated at first. \\"Cat2, are you sure that's a good idea? We shouldn't trespass on someone's property without permission.\\" Cat2 rolled his eyes playfully and nudged Cat. \\"Oh, come on, Cat! What's life without a little adventure? Besides, no harm will come from trying out the obstacle course. Mrs. Johnson won't even notice.\\" Although hesitant, Cat decided to trust his friend and tagged along to explore Mrs. Johnson's backyard. As they snuck in, they were mesmerized by the beautifully landscaped garden. The obstacle course was indeed enticing, with various hurdles, tunnels, and platforms to jump on. Cat2 immediately climbed a tall tree and got ready to jump onto the first platform. Hesitant, Cat watched closely as Cat2 soared through the air, skillfully maneuvering his way through the course. Inspired by Cat2's bravery, Cat took a deep breath, followed his lead, and jumped too. Cat and Cat2 had the time of their lives as they competed in a friendly race through the obstacle course. They laughed, meowed, and couldn't help but feel alive with every twist and turn. But suddenly, a voice boomed from behind them, \\"What on earth do you two think you're doing in my garden?\\" Startled, both cats turned around to find Mrs. Johnson, the owner of the beautiful backyard, with a mix of anger and amusement on her face. They immediately felt guilty for trespassing, knowing they had made a mistake. In a soft-spoken voice, Cat stepped forward and apologized sincerely, explaining their initial intentions were merely to explore the obstacle course out of curiosity and the love for adventure. Mrs. Johnson's stern expression softened as she looked at the two cats, who were clearly remorseful. With a small smile, she said, \\"Curiosity and adventure are admirable qualities, but it's important to ask for permission first. However, I can see that you both have learned your lesson. From now on, you are welcome to use the obstacle course, but only if you promise never to trespass again.\\" Cat and Cat2 looked at each other with relief and gratitude. They nodded in agreement, realizing that even the most thrilling adventures can have consequences if not approached with caution. They thanked Mrs. Johnson for her understanding and decided to abide by her rules. Over time, Cat and Cat2 became familiar visitors to Mrs. Johnson's backyard, playing and exploring the obstacle course under her watchful eye. They never forgot the lesson they learned that day and always made sure to respect others' property, realizing that true adventure and excitement could still be found in the boundaries of safety. And so, Cat and Cat2 continued their friendship, growing older and wiser together, while teaching each other valuable lessons throughout their thrilling adventures."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After all, what is a small investment now when compared to the windfall that is to come? To expedite these proceedings, do inform me as to whom the fees should be dispatched. I trust that you, with your irreproachable standing, have a secured and efficacious method for the transfer of said funds. Should I engage with a notary or legal advisor on my end, or will all be managed handsomely under your experienced wing? Mr. Wilbur, your diligence and prompt guidance are the bulwarks against any hesitancy I might have harbored. The knowledge that I play a part, albeit a minuscule one, in this noble venture of rectitude and recompense, lends a new zest to my mornings!

Kindly respond to this message to continue the conversation. Regards <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #6, from Cameron McCaffrey (me): Dear Mr. Wilbur, The recent ebullition of my heart cannot be overstated upon reading your message. The unimaginable sum of 8.5 million dollars is a figure that whirls through my mind, propelling dreams that were once tethered firmly to the ground. Your diligent efforts to shepherd this process are admired and deeply appreciated. Indeed, the sum required for the affidavits is but a drop in the ocean compared to the awaiting treasure. Certainly, a man of my fervent anticipation finds no quarrel in the swift dispatch of 3,500 for such significant documents from the United States Supreme Court justices. As for my identification, I will gather the necessary documentation posthaste. However, I am certain you understand my caution – fraudulent attempts have led me to be circumspect. Hence, I will provide a novel way of identification that ensures my utmost compliance yet protects my personal details until I receive concrete proof of this undertaking’s legitimacy. I will create an encrypted digital file containing my ID and phone number, which will be decrypted with a unique key. Once you confirm that all official documentation on FBI letterhead, including the approval letter, your identification, and any additional affidavits, are prepared for my review, I will send the encrypted file to you. Upon reviewing these official documents, I will immediately provide you with the decryption key and proceed without hesitation to fulfill any financial requisites for the affidavits. Please advise on the preferred method for the transfer of the 3,500. I am partial to secure, traceable transactions and would prefer a method that offers both of us the assurance and comfort that our deal is protected by the highest level of security. A detailed invoice for this transaction would greatly aid in keeping thorough records for my personal accounting. Your prompt attention to this matter is integral to our shared success, and I eagerly await your structured guidance and the aforementioned documents. Let us proceed with vigor, for the road to justice and recompense is a noble path we tread together. With an emboldened spirit and eager anticipation, Cameron McCaffrey Email #7, from Gregory Wilbur: Dear Cameron McCaffrey thanks for your email, i am sending you Invoice of payment 3,500 dollars for the affidavit of oath and affidavit of claim as the legal beneficiary Kindly respond to this message to continue the conversation.

The invoice I am to receive will be attended to with the same urgency that a parched plant greets the rain. I remain poised, Mr. Wilbur, to foster this transaction to fruition, aligning our mutual interests – mine, to cast a blow for justice and right the scales against global scammers, and yours, to uphold the integrity and honor of the FBI and the planned beneficence of the United Nations initiative. Of course, to preserve the sanctity of such a significant transfer of funds and documents, a secure channel for our communication is a prerequisite. I'm sure you'll agree that safeguarding our transaction against the very scammers we aim to outwit is of the utmost importance. In my heightened state of exuberance, I have already set aside the 3,500, which sits eagerly, ready to leap into action and secure the official affidavits. I must reiterate my request for a detailed invoice alongside the promised official documentation on FBI letterhead, identification, and conformational affidavits, all which are crucial to girding my unwavering trust with the armor of verifica. Direct me, Mr. Wilbur, as to your preferred protocol for the transaction. Shall we employ a wire transfer, the venerable swift code, or perchance a more armored vehicle of monetary migration? A means traceable and secure, resistant to the tendrils of those who lurk in the shadows of deceit. My counsel has advised patience and thorough validation before leaping, and I shall heed such wisdom with the zeal of a disciple. Your guidance is the beacon by which this ship sails, Mr. Wilbur, and with your next transmission, I shall set coordinates and voyage forth. Until your missive arrives, I remain, perched on the precipice of action, ready to swoop into the welcoming arms of legitimacy and righteousness. Awaiting your directive with bountiful eagerness, Cameron McCaffrey"},{"instruction":"画一个女人","output":"很抱歉，但作为一个文本 AI，我无法直接在这里绘画或展示图像。不过，我可以描述如何手绘一个女人的基本步骤： 1. **基础框架**：开始时，绘制一个简单的骨架图，使用圆形来代表头部，然后用线条画出脊柱的曲率，以及简单的手臂和腿部的线框。 2. **形体细化**：用椭圆形和简化的形状来代表身体的其他部分（如肩部、胸部、腰部和臀部）。确保身体的比例符合你想要表现的人物风格（例如现实风格、漫画风格等）。 3. **面部特征**：头部分为三个部分：额头、鼻子和下巴。眼睛通常位于头的中间位置，鼻子位于眼睛下方。嘴巴则位于鼻子下方中点和下巴之间的位置。 4. **细致化**：添加细节如指尖、脚趾、衣物的折皱、头发的质感等。这一步需要考虑光源方向，以便于添加合适的阴影和高光，让图画显得更有立体感。 5. **清晰描线**：用坚定而清晰的线条替换掉最初的框架草图，可以使用勾线笔或更细的铅笔确保线条的准确度。 6. **涂色与上光**：给画作涂色，为肤色、衣物等选择适当的颜色。上光是指在一些区域添加亮色以表示光的反射。 完成这些步骤后，您就应该有一个基本的女性图纸了。当然，这是一个非常基础的说明，每个人物、风格或艺术家都有独特的绘图方法。绘制人物需要大量的练习和对人体解剖学的理解。"},{"instruction":"tell me a 30 word summary about carnival from the Africans.

African Influences: Carnival in the Caribbean and Brazil carries strong African influences due to the transatlantic slave trade, which brought millions of Africans to these regions. These enslaved Africans brought with them their cultural traditions and rituals, including music, dance, costumes, and masquerade. 2. Rhythm and Music: African rhythms and music have greatly influenced the carnival celebrations. Drumming, especially the use of African drums such as the djembe or conga, is a prominent feature in many carnival parades and performances. The syncopated beats, polyrhythms, and call-and-response patterns can all be traced back to African drumming traditions. 3. Dance and Movement: African dance styles, characterized by expressive movements, waist gyrations, hip shakes, and energetic footwork, have influenced carnival dance forms such as samba in Brazil and various traditional dances in the Caribbean. These dance movements are often rooted in African spiritual or social practices. 4. Costumes and Masquerade: African cultures use elaborate masks and costumes in their traditional ceremonies and rituals. These traditions have been incorporated into carnival celebrations, where participants dress up in vibrant and ornate costumes, often reflecting African themes and aesthetics. African fabrics, patterns, and motifs are commonly used in carnival costumes. 5. Symbols and Iconography: African cultural and spiritual symbols have also made their way into carnival celebrations. For example, the Yoruba orishas, deities in the Yoruba religion, are often represented in carnival parades and masquerades. African symbols such as Adinkra symbols from Ghana are also used in carnival costumes and decorations. 6. Food and Cuisine: African cuisine has influenced the culinary traditions associated with carnival celebrations. Dishes such as jerk chicken, gumbo, jollof rice, and plantains are common in carnival festivities, reflecting the diverse African food culture. Overall, Africa's impact on carnival is immense, shaping the music, dance, costumes, and overall cultural expression of these celebrations in the Caribbean and Brazil. The fusion of African traditions with local customs has created uniquely vibrant and diverse carnival experiences around the world."},{"instruction":"Cosa è un Inner Join?","output":"Un \`INNER JOIN\` è un tipo di join, ovvero un'operazione della teoria dei database che permette di combinare le righe da due o più tabelle basandosi su una colonna comune, tipicamente una chiave straniera. Un \`INNER JOIN\` produce come risultato un set di righe che contiene solo quelle combinazioni di valori presenti in entrambe le tabelle coinvolte nel join. Per eseguire un \`INNER JOIN\` in SQL, si utilizza la clausola \`INNER JOIN\` all'interno di una query, specificando la tabella da unire e la condizione di join (tipicamente l'equivalenza tra le colonne delle tabelle che si stanno unendo). Ecco un esempio di come si può usare un \`INNER JOIN\` in SQL: \`\`\`sql SELECT Colonna1, Colonna2, ... FROM Tabella1 INNER JOIN Tabella2 ON Tabella1.ColonnaChiave = Tabella2.ColonnaChiave; \`\`\` In questo esempio, \`Tabella1\` e \`Tabella2\` sono unite attraverso la loro \\"ColonnaChiave\\". La query selezionerà le colonne indicate (Colonna1, Colonna2, ...) dalle righe risultanti dall'unione delle due tabelle dove i valori di \`Tabella1.ColonnaChiave\` e \`Tabella2.ColonnaChiave\` sono uguali. L'\`INNER JOIN\` è tra i tipi di join più comunemente usati perché consente di selezionare solo i dati che hanno una corrispondenza tra le tabelle, eliminando le righe che non hanno un match. Questo differisce da altri tipi di join, come il \`LEFT JOIN\` o il \`RIGHT JOIN\`, che selezionano anche le righe che non hanno una corrispondenza nell'altra tabella."},{"instruction":"Che differenza c'è con il Theta Join?","output":"Il termine \\"Theta Join\\" si riferisce a una tipologia di join nel modello relazionale dei database dove la condizione per l'unione delle tabelle non si limita alla semplice uguaglianza (equi-join) ma può includere qualsiasi tipo di predicato rappresentato da una condizione theta (θ). In altre parole, un theta join può utilizzare operatori come <, >, <=, >=, != oltre al semplice =. Per esempio, un theta join che usa un operatore diverso dall'uguaglianza potrebbe apparire così in SQL: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM Tabella1 t1 JOIN Tabella2 t2 ON t1.ColonnaChiave > t2.ColonnaChiave; \`\`\` In questo caso, stiamo unendo \`Tabella1\` e \`Tabella2\` basandoci su una relazione in cui i valori nella \`ColonnaChiave\` di \`Tabella1\` sono maggiori dei corrispondenti valori nella \`ColonnaChiave\` di \`Tabella2\`. L'\`INNER JOIN\` è in realtà un caso particolare di theta join dove la condizione theta è l'uguaglianza (=), che è anche chiamato equi-join. Di fatto, quando le persone parlano di \`INNER JOIN\` di solito si riferiscono proprio a un equi-join, anche se tecnicamente un \`INNER JOIN\` con qualsiasi altra condizione theta sarebbe considerabile come un theta join. Quindi, la principale differenza è che il termine \\"theta join\\" indica la possibilità di effettuare il join tra tabelle utilizzando vari operatori condizionali, mentre l'\`INNER JOIN\` predefinito si riferisce comunemente a una join condition basata sull'uguaglianza."},{"instruction":"In the context of hypothetical serial from \\"The Traveller\\" ( where the titular female-presenting traveller vists various sci-fantasy trope/historicla settings). 2 paragraph pitch for a serial called 'The Change' where some members of a planetary species switch gender at a given age. The serial plays this with respect and sensitivity, but as a drama would need some dramatic element for it to work.","output":"Title: The Change In the rich tapestry of the universe, \\"The Traveller\\" stumbles upon Caelum, a planet illuminated by twin stars, where a unique species navigates an extraordinary rite of passage known as \\"The Change.” Here, the inhabitants possess the innate ability to switch gender upon reaching the age of maturity, a biological marvel deeply intertwined with their culture, spirituality, and social structure. The process is revered, a harmonious blend of nature and identity, with each individual experiencing it in a personalized, sacred ceremony that seals their adult place within the community. However, not all transitions are seamless. \\"The Traveller\\" arrives at a time when the planet's harmony is challenged by a growing movement questioning the traditional norms, advocating for the freedom to choose whether to undergo The Change or not, and exploring the broader spectrum of gender identity. Our protagonist, a young native named Ari, stands on the brink of this life-defining frontier. Conflicted between upholding their people's cherished customs and their own sense of self, Ari's journey through The Change becomes a tumultuous quest for acceptance. The Traveller, a compassionate and open-minded observer, is drawn into the interwoven tales of love, friendship, and rebellion, as Ari's internal strife mirrors the societal upheaval. While respecting the profound nature of Caelum's biological phenomenon, the serial delves into the complexities of gender, the struggle for self-determination, and the resistance against rigid societal constructs. In the crux of this interstellar drama, The Traveller acts as catalyst and confidant, as the planet's inhabitants grapple with the possibility of a future where choice governs the sacred traditions and the very essence of their identity."},{"instruction":"This sounds like a 13th Traveller (Rebecca Root) serial, over a 45 min episode. :)","output":"Indeed, the concept for \\"The Change\\" could be beautifully realized within the format of a 45-minute episode starring Rebecca Root as the 13th Traveller. In such a format, pacing and focus are key, with the need for a tightly woven narrative that allows viewers to connect deeply with the characters and the world they inhabit. The episode would open on the bustling capital of Caelum, vibrant with the anticipation of upcoming Change ceremonies. We are immediately introduced to Ari, a relatable and charismatic individual, nervously preparing for their upcoming transformation. Root's Traveller would serendipitously arrive, her presence a mixture of intrigue and wisdom, subtly challenging norms with her outsider perspective. Throughout the episode, drama unfolds as Ari, who deeply respects tradition, discovers a personal truth that doesn't align with the path set before them. As they confront a society unprepared for such defiance, the Traveller becomes an integral part of their struggle, facilitating crucial conversations, and offering a different viewpoint on the nature of identity. As the climax approaches, Ari must choose between their own self-identity and the expectations of their culture. In these moments, the Traveller's own experience as a traveler between worlds – and as someone who has encountered countless perspectives on identity – offers a guiding hand. The resolution is heartfelt and thought-provoking, leaving the viewer to ponder the rich complexities of individuality, culture, and acceptance. Endearing side characters, moments of levity, and the planet's beautiful, otherworldly landscapes ensure that the episode is not only a powerful drama but also an engaging adventure reflective of the show's sci-fantasy roots. Root's performance would embody the wisdom and empathy necessary to navigate such a sensitive topic within the limited timeframe, offering a profound yet entertaining episode that stays true to the spirit of \\"The Traveller\\" series."},{"instruction":"Within the typical 5-Act structure, how might a potential treatment work ( Paragrpah for each act?)","output":"\\"In 'The Change,'\\" the 45-minute episode follows a 5-Act structure to deliver a compelling narrative drawing on themes of identity, choice, and tradition. **Act 1: Introduction** The episode opens with the Traveller arriving on Caelum amidst celebrations leading up to \\"The Change\\" ceremonies. Our protagonist, Ari, is introduced as a well-loved and engaged member of their community, preparing for the transition that all are expected to embrace. We get glimpses of the cultural richness of Caelum, their connection to the twin stars above, and the deep-seated reverence for the Change. Ari, while honored to partake in the tradition, harbors a secret apprehension that is only hinted at. The Traveller, observing these rituals, begins to form a bond with Ari, sensing the undercurrent of their turmoil. **Act 2: Rising Action** Ari's anxiety grows as the ceremony approaches; they confide in the Traveller, who has become a sympathetic ear. Rebecca Root's Traveller character, with her experience of diverse cultures and identities, offers Ari a broader perspective on gender and societal roles. Meanwhile, societal tensions emerge as we learn of a controversial group advocating for the autonomy of individuals to choose their paths. Ari is drawn to this group, identifying with their cause, which in turn deepens their inner conflict. **Act 3: Climax** During the preparation for the ceremony, Ari faces a moment of truth and makes the critical decision not to go through with the Change. This decision throws the community into disarray, challenging the core of Caelum's values and causing a rift between Ari and their friends and family. The Traveller, ever respectful but also a natural agent of change, helps mediate the conflict by drawing on her experiences and sharing stories of diversity and acceptance from across the cosmos. Ari's plight and assertiveness act as a catalyst, forcing the community to question their adherence to tradition over individual happiness. **Act 4: Falling Action** The aftermath of Ari's decision sees the community struggling to reconcile their traditions with the new push for autonomy. Some rally to Ari's side, inspired by their courage, while others deeply mourn what they perceive as a loss of cultural identity. The Traveller uses her wisdom to guide key community leaders and Ari towards a mutual understanding. Ari’s personal journey becomes emblematic of a larger societal shift, the beginnings of a transformation that is both private and collective. **Act 5: Conclusion** The resolution finds an uneasy peace on Caelum: traditions are being reconsidered, and while not entirely resolved, there is an opening for dialogue and growth. Ari, though isolated by their choice, is at peace with their decision and finds a new sense of belonging with those advocating for change. The episode concludes with the Traveller setting off to new adventures, leaving behind a planet that is just beginning to explore the nuances of identity and self-determination. As the twin stars set on the horizon, Ari stands looking up at the stars, hopeful for the future and grateful for the outsider who helped illuminate a path they had been too fearful to tread alone."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

Understanding these underlying mechanisms can aid GPs in explaining the condition to patients and in tailoring treatment strategies. --- Clinical Presentation 🩺 Patients with IBS present with a range of symptoms, the most common being: - **Abdominal Pain:** Often described as cramping and generally relieved by defecation. - **Altered Bowel Habits:** Patients may experience constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or a mix of both (IBS-M). - **Bloating and Gas:** A sensation of distension is frequently reported. - **Food Intolerance:** Certain foods can trigger or worsen symptoms. Symptom patterns vary widely between individuals, and it's important to understand each patient's unique experience. Diagnosis primarily relies on the Rome IV criteria, which focus on recurrent abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. --- Diagnostic Approach 🔍 Our role as GPs is to diagnose IBS based on clinical criteria and exclude other potential conditions. Key steps include: - **Medical History:** A thorough history that includes the nature and timing of symptoms is critical. - **Physical Examination:** Although typically normal, this can help exclude other diseases. - **Diagnostic Criteria:** Using the Rome IV criteria to support the IBS diagnosis. - **Exclusion of Red Flags:** Symptoms like unexplained weight loss, rectal bleeding, or family history of bowel disease may indicate more serious conditions and warrant further investigation. - **Laboratory Tests:** While there is no diagnostic test for IBS, blood tests, stool samples, and, if indicated, colonoscopy, can help exclude other diseases. --- Management Strategies 💊 The management of IBS requires a patient-centered approach, often involving both lifestyle modifications and medical treatments. # Lifestyle and Dietary Changes 🍏 - **Fiber Intake:** Increasing soluble fiber can benefit IBS-C, while reducing insoluble fiber may help IBS-D. - **Low FODMAP Diet:** This diet can reduce fermentable carbohydrates that may exacerbate symptoms. - **Stress Management:** Techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, and cognitive-behavioral therapy can be beneficial. # Pharmacological Treatments 💉 - **Laxatives:** For IBS-C, gentle laxatives like polyethylene glycol can be beneficial. - **Antidiarrheals:** Loperamide can provide relief for IBS-D. - **Antispasmodics:** Medications like hyoscine butylbromide can alleviate cramping. - **Antidepressants:** Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs may help with pain and bowel symptoms. # Probiotics and Supplements 🦠 - **Probiotics:** May help in rebalancing gut flora and reducing symptoms. - **Peppermint Oil:** Has antispasmodic properties and can alleviate abdominal pain. # Follow-Up and Monitoring 📈 Regular follow-up is important for monitoring symptom progression and adjusting management plans as needed. Encouraging a supportive environment and fostering open communication with patients can improve treatment adherence and outcomes. --- Conclusion IBS is a complex, multifaceted disorder that requires a comprehensive and empathetic approach to management. By combining lifestyle interventions, targeted medications, and ongoing support, we as GPs can play a pivotal role in improving the quality of life for our patients with IBS. Remember, while IBS can be a chronic condition, many patients find lasting relief through a well-coordinated treatment plan. --- As general practitioners, utilizing resources like this guide within a platform like Notion can aid in the easy access and retrieval of information, facilitating better patient care.

Yours in service Mr. Amhed Idris Email #2, from Cameron McCaffrey (me): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Upon receiving your email regarding the release of funds by the direction of Dr. Edward Olubumi Akosola at the Federal Ministry of Finance, I must say I was buoyed by a maelstrom of emotions. Ecstasy, anticipation, and a residual chuckle of incredulity danced together in a charming ballet. Your eloquence and the weightiness of this endeavor have not gone unnoticed. It is fortuitous, and quite convenient indeed, that Dr. Akosola has been given the solemn duty of scrutinizing, verifying, and orchestrating the smooth pirouette of funds into my account. Moreover, his personal email address exudes a certain… uniqueness that one can only admire in these times of cookie-cutter formalities. However, before the festivities can commence and in the spirit of due diligence, I must take certain precautionary steps. I have always been taught, “Trust, but verify,” a proverb well steeped in the tea of caution. To proceed, I would be delighted to share a whimsy of details for this delightful process. Yet, as a connoisseur of internet folklore, I must probe further into the fabric of this narrative. Would Dr. Akosola appreciate it if I contacted him with an encoded message? A cryptic puzzle, perhaps, to secure our communications from potential ne’er-do-wells? Surely, a man of his stature must enjoy the occasional cerebral exercise to keep the sharper edges of his intellect gleaming. Secondly, regarding my esteemed personal identity documents, they are currently ensconced in a repository that rivals the security of Fort Knox. I would not dream of sending them electronically. Instead, let us arrange for a courier pigeon, trained by the finest aviary specialists, to deliver these precious artifacts with due ceremony. Fear not, for this pigeon is no ordinary bird – it has been equipped with the latest in avian tracking technology. Before any of that, I must insist that Dr. Akosola and I engage in a verbal waltz over the phone. I find the human voice carries nuances that text simply cannot convey. This would also provide the perfect opportunity for him to regale me with tales of the Federal Government’s policies on foreign payments and perhaps, even a bit of poetry if the mood strikes. In conclusion, I would implore you, Mr. Idris, to enlighten me further with your boundless wisdom as we pirouette in this grand ballet of fiduciary festivity. I await your response with bated breath.

As per your instruction, I am poised and ready to engage with Dr. Edward Olubumi Akosola. However, like a master chess player pondering his next stratagem, I am meticulously sculpting the perfect strategy to ensure our mutual beneficiaries are well-protected from the prowling eyes of cyber brigands. To this end, I have tasked the avian courier with a missive that would make a spymaster weep with joy. A missive encoded in the ancient art of steganography, hidden within the plumage of the dispatched pigeon. This marvel of espionage will carry forth my banking details and personal correspondence in a form undetectable by conventional means. Nonetheless, prior to commencing this grand expedition, I believe it is only appropriate to receive the promised official gazette. A document of such caliber would illuminate the path we are to tread and serve as a lantern in the dim alleyways of international finance. Moreover, I am ready to initiate the verbal dance over the telephonic waves with Dr. Akosola. His voice shall be the siren’s call that guides my ship through these financially choppy waters. Upon hearing his dulcet tones and the veracity of his intent confirmed, my confidence in this matter shall solidify like the roots of a grand oak tree.

Consider an ordinary light bulb. (a) Calculate the steady surface temperature of the lighted bulb. (b) Find the time required for the surface tempera- ture of the bulb to reach this steady value. Data: P = 200 watts, δ = (1/64) in., ρ = 170 Btu/lbm.°F, α = 0.10 (emissivity), Cp = 0.2 lbm/ft³, T = 70°F, D = 3 in solve by cosidering a lump system.","output":"To solve this problem using a lump system approach, we will make several assumptions: 1. The light bulb can be treated as a lumped system, meaning that the temperature is uniform throughout the bulb. 2. Heat transfer occurs only through conduction, as the bulb is assumed to be in still air. 3. The thermal properties of the material composing the bulb are constant. (a) To calculate the steady surface temperature of the lighted bulb, we can use the formula for steady-state conduction: Q = hA(T - Ts) Where Q is the heat transfer rate, h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area of the bulb, T is the ambient temperature, and Ts is the surface temperature of the bulb. To find the surface area of the bulb, we first need to convert the diameter of the bulb from inches to feet: D = 3 in = 3 in * (1 ft/12 in) = 0.25 ft Then, the surface area of the bulb can be calculated using the formula for the surface area of a sphere: A = 4πr^2 Where r is the radius of the bulb: r = D/2 = 0.25 ft/2 = 0.125 ft Plugging in the values into the formula for the surface area: A = 4π(0.125 ft)^2 Now, we need to find the convection heat transfer coefficient. Since the bulb is in still air and there is little to no air movement, we can use an estimated value of h = 10 Btu/(h*ft^2*°F). Finally, rearranging the formula for steady-state conduction to solve for Ts: Ts = T - (Q / (hA)) Plugging in the given values: Ts = 70°F - (200 W / (10 Btu/(h*ft^2*°F) * 4π(0.125 ft)^2)) (b) To find the time required for the surface temperature of the bulb to reach the steady-state value, we can use the concept of thermal time constant: τ = (ρ * Cp * V) / (h * A) Where τ is the time constant, ρ is the density of the material, Cp is the specific heat capacity, V is the volume of the bulb, and A is the surface area of the bulb. To find the volume of the bulb, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr^3 Plugging in the given values and solving for τ: τ = (170 Btu/(lbm*°F) * 0.2 lbm/ft³ * (4/3)π(0.125 ft)^3) / (10 Btu/(h*ft^2*°F) * 4π(0.125 ft)^2)"},{"instruction":"je veux rédiger un mail d’exscuse de mon comportement parceque j’ai mal parél et que je m’exscuse a toutes les personen qui était présentes rédige sur un ton sérieux il faux que l’on ressente le regrée j'ai mal parlé le 14 décembre 2023 et aujourdhui nous somme le 15 décembre 2023 information complémentaire mais a ne pas mettre dans la lettre pour le contexte: je suis aux lycee en terminale je m’exscuse a mes prof je m'appelle Angelin Schmitz","output":"Objet : Demande de pardon pour mon comportement du 14 décembre Madame, Monsieur, Je me permets de vous adresser ce courriel pour exprimer mes profonds regrets concernant mon comportement déplacé qui a eu lieu le 14 décembre dernier.

OCR software can scan images for text and convert it into a selectable, editable format. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to copy text from a JPG file and paste it into a Word document: 1. Choose an OCR Software or Online Service: - There are various OCR tools available, both as standalone software and online services. Some popular ones include Adobe Acrobat, ABBYY FineReader, and free online services like OnlineOCR or NewOCR. 2. Convert the JPG File to Text: - For standalone software: Open the software, import the JPG file, and use the software's OCR feature to convert the image to text. - For online services: Go to the website, upload your JPG file, choose the output format (like DOCX for Word), select the OCR language if necessary, and convert the file. 3. Save or Copy the Text: - Once the OCR process is complete, if you're using software, you may need to save or export the document as a Word file. - If you're using an online service, you might be able to directly download the converted Word document or copy the recognized text to your clipboard. 4. Paste the Text into a Word Document: - Open Microsoft Word or any word processing software you're using. - Create a new document or open an existing one where you want to paste the text. - Position your cursor where you want the text to go. - Paste the copied text (using Ctrl + V on Windows or Command + V on macOS). 5. Check and Edit: - OCR isn't always 100% accurate, especially with images that have poor resolution, stylized fonts, or background noise. You'll likely need to proofread the text and correct any errors or formatting issues. Additionally, if you have Microsoft OneNote, you can use it to perform OCR on images: 1. Insert the JPG file into a OneNote page. 2. Right-click the image and select \\"Copy Text from Picture.\\" 3. Paste the copied text into a Word document and edit as needed. For those who use Google Drive, you can also do this using Google Docs: 1. Upload the JPG file to your Google Drive. 2. Right-click the uploaded file and choose \\"Open with\\" and then \\"Google Docs.\\" 3. Google Docs will automatically run OCR on the image and append the text below the image in a new document. 4. Copy and paste the text from the Google Docs into a Word document. Remember to verify the OCR results for accuracy, as the outcome can vary depending on the quality of the original image and the OCR technology used."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

The product line was based on the storyline of the animated series, which follows the adventures of a character named Emily Jones who travels to a magical land called Elvendale. The theme aimed to introduce a fantasy element to girl-focused Lego products.

She, along with Skyra, are the two guardians of the portal. Although a human, Emily possesses magic and is connected to the elements of light and love.ContentsOfficial BiographiesLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Emily is a smart, quirky and creative girl, who is mourning the loss of her grandmother. She is shy in new situations, but quickly finds her place in a group.

However, she can be shy in new situations, and a little clumsy. With her warmth and big heart, Emily brings the whole team together.Loves: a good book, movie or songHates: being a bit clumsy when she’s feeling insecureVideo Player is loading.Ad: (7)Skip AdBackgroundEmily's grandmother was one of the five legendary sisters. She was chosen to go to earth and guard the portal from that side. In doing so, she lost her immortality, and eventually passed away.Shortly after inheriting her grandmother's amulet, Emily found herself transported through the portal to Elvendale. With the help of four elves, Naida Riverheart, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler and Farran Leafshade, she got back home safely. She now often visits them in Elvendale.PersonalityEmily is a happy, music-loving human girl with a passion for having fun, hanging out, or just having an adventure. She is kind, sweet, and amicable. Emily is friendly and empathetic to the very core, and loves making friends, which is why she gets along so well with the four elves, Naida, Azari, Farran and Aira. She doesn't have trouble with people easily, human or elf, and has a special connection with almost everyone she comes across. Azari, Farran, Aira, and Naida, or more simply, the elves or four elves, are great friends with Emily, and enjoy her company. Her personality is also sweet enough to fit Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch into it.AppearanceEmily has dark brown hair, which she wears in a braid. She also has olive-green eyes, a fair complexion, and freckles.Season 1 - Emily wears a sleeveless white shirt with dark blue stripes, denim jean shorts, and yellow sneakers with white soles, laces and toes. In the artwork of Season 1, she wears this outfit, but also wears a set of blue, orange, purple, and green bracelets. She also wears her teleporting amulet or medallion. The amulet is blue in the middle and usually shines or glows. The rest of it is silver.Season 2 - Emily wears a dark-blue tank top that fades to white at the bottom, light brown khaki shorts and red high-top sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 3 - Emily wears an off-the-shoulder, short-sleeved shirt that is white with grey stripes. Underneath this, she wears a tank-top with fuchsia straps. Emily also wears a grey skirt with navy-blue ankle-length leggings underneath and fuchsia sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 4 - Emily wears a grey hoodie over a red-and-white striped shirt. She also wears navy-blue pants and red sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.RelationshipsFamilyHer parents are Mr. and Mrs. Jones.Her grandmother was one of the Five Sisters. A former elf, she became mortal when she moved to Earth in order to protect the portal from that side.Emily Jones has a little sister, Sophie Jones, with whom she gets angry at for jumping into the portal in \\"The Capture.\\" Her sister Sophie is mischievous, disobeying, and someone who obviously goes against orders. Emily loves her family nonetheless, through-and-through.Skyra, Quartzine, and the fire and water sister (the four remaining Five Sisters) are Emily's great aunts. They were Emily's grandmother's sisters.Emily and Cronan are also related (Cronan's mother and Emily's grandmother were sisters.) In specific terms, they are first cousins once removed.FriendsEmily's closest friends are Azari, Naida, Farran and Aira. She sympathyses with Skyra, having gone through loss herself. In Season 2, Emily became friends with Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch, as well as a number of dragons. In Season 3, Rosalyn Nightshade is on friendly terms with Emily. She meets Lumia in Season 4, who becomes a valuable ally.Azari Firedancer - A fierce fire elf, Azari is the first friend whom Emily had met upon arriving in Elvendale for the very first time. In \\"Unite the Magic,\\" Azari was shown to be friendly and outgoing to Emily, which Emily deeply appreciated. Azari is someone who Emily can really open up to, because just like Emily, Azari is fun-loving and adventurous. At the same time, Azari is someone who Emily can easily get frustrated over, due to Azari's irresponsible ways. Underneath her rough personality, she is also considerate and kind, and Emily has a great connection with her.Farran Leafshade - As the second person Emily meets in Elvendale, and the only male character of the main five, Farran is a reliable and well-grounded earth elf. Emily looks past his tendency to show-off, according to \\"Crib Notes\\", and cares for him nonetheless. Farran helped Emily up from a rainbow bridge in \\"Crushing it\\", which Emily appeared to be grateful for. Farran portrayed the most awkwardness of how he felt with the \\"strangeness\\" of the shape and size of Emily's human ears when first encountering her. His reaction to Emily's ears appears to be from Farran's brutally honest personality, to which Emily showed little discomfort with. Blunt and fair, Farran is someone Emily can trust, and does trust, as shown on many occasions.Aira Windwhistler - Carefree, air-headed, and lighthearted, Aira is a somewhat absent-minded wind elf. Silly, fun, and quick to speak her mind, Aira is someone that Emily can depend on, even though Aira has her head in the clouds most of the time. Aira is fun-loving, energetic, and free-spirited, to which Emily has no dismay over.Naida Riverheart - Naida is more shown to be well-collected, organized, and a bit more serious than her friends. Naida is very wise, which Emily seems to admire. Emily often chats with Naida about important issues, such as combining their magic together, according to \\"Never Cave.\\" Ever the supportive friend, Emily encourages Naida to let loose and step outside of her comfort zone. Because of their close bond, Naida thinks of Emily as a sister and will stand by her no matter what.Tidus Stormsurfer - A soulful water elf, Tidus met Emily in the second story-arc. In Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave, Tidus is a big help to Emily and the elves, being very knowledgeable about dragons and how they stopped trusting elves due to a certain witch elf. Emily seems to admire this, along with Azari, Naida and Aira. Emily has no problem talking with Tidus, as he will always listen, and be very understanding.Sira Copperbranch - A friend of Emily's who she met through Tidus. Sira is bold, strong-willed, and straightforward, which appear to be qualities Emily likes about her. Being a girl of many passions, Sira's not one to judge Emily on her human-like appearance nor comment on it or question it.Skyra - Someone who appears unkind and scornful at first, Emily shows her the power of love again, healing Skyra's heart from her mourning over Emily's grandmother. Emily and her friends now give Skyra friendly visits from time to time.Elandra - Emily's bonded dragon is the Queen Dragon, Elandra, whose element or power is Love. A symbol of love, Emily loves Elandra with all her heart, to which Elandra feels the same for Emily.Rosalyn - Introduced in the third story-arc, Rosalyn is a healer elf who teams up with Emily and the elves to thwart The Goblin King's plans.Lumia - Introduced in the fourth story arc, when in her eagle, and possibly wolf form, Lumia serves as one of the Elemental Guardians, representing Emily's creature.EnemiesEmily's greatest enemy has to be Ragana, who sports a very cold and devious personality towards Emily. In \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" Ragana was quick to judge and mock Emily's human appearance, even calling her ears \\"nasty.\\" Though powerful, Emily was able to amplify the other 4 elves' magic with her amulet, and temporarily weaken Ragana. Although it doesn't take long for Ragana to regain her strength, as she quickly appears in full elf form again in the webisodes. Emily and Ragana clearly have polar-opposite personalities - Ragana is evil and cruel, very different compared to Emily's kind and loving, gentle nature.In the third story arc, she meets Cronan Darkroot, the Goblin King, an evil elf who captured her little sister, Sophie Jones. She didn't know that he was related to her at the time, as Emily did not yet know that Cronan's mother was her grandmother's sister. They were also unaware of his identity as the Goblin King. As a result, for a brief while, Cronan pretended to befriend Emily in order to steal her amulet.In the fourth story arc Emily goes up against Noctura, an ancient evil who resides in the Shadow World. Noctura plots to capture the elemental guardians in order to harness the magic of their jewels. If she succeeds, Elvendale will become a dark and magic-less place, for the guardians' jewels are the source of all elemental magic in the land.RomanceEmily hasn't had crushes or love interests up to this date. Aira, however, gets jealous when Farran helps Emily to her feet in \\"Crushing It.\\" According to Emily, though, the whole hand-holding business meant nothing. In the season 2 special, \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" it appears, much to Farran's belief that Tidus was flirting with Emily, little to the knowledge of Tidus' loyalty to and love for Sira.SetsThe Elves' Treetop HideawaySkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleEmily Jones and the Baby Wind DragonFire Dragon's Lava CaveQueen Dragon's RescueAira's Airship and the Amulet ChaseBreakout from the Goblin King's FortressEmily Jones and the Eagle GetawayEmily and Noctura's ShowdownTriviaEmily's name starts with an E, as do Elandra and Estari's names. All three of them are connected to the element of love/light. Love/light can be considered as the fifth element, and E is the fifth letter of the alphabet.The name \\"Emily\\" and its variations means \\"a hardworking, diligent and industrious person\\". This best describes Emily, as she has been shown to be a creative thinker when giving her friends the idea to make their own clothes in Hairy Styles. She also works hard to protect Earth and Elvendale, as well as her family and friends, from evil forces.Emily's grandmother was immortal while she lived in Elvendale. However, when she moved to Earth, she became mortal like the rest of the humans. Even so, it can be argued that her granddaughter, Emily, is 1/4 elf.Emily most likely plays the guitar, since there is a guitar in her room. There is also a second guitar in the attic in a box of Emily's childhood toys. The guitar was likely child-sized and she outgrew it.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Emily says in season 4 that her amulet is the only thing she has left of her grandmother. This must mean that she no longer has her grandmother's shirt that she wore throughout season 2. This also raises the question of what happened to the figurines of the elemental creatures in the attic, as well as the book with the prophecy in it and the Noctura doll.Based upon the fourth season, Emily's connection to Lumia and Light suggests that the fifth element of Love might be related to or is also the element of Light. This is similar to how Air and Wind are interchangeable as titles for one of the main four elements.Emily kept the stick her friends gave her in Another Kind Of Magic. It can be seen on her desk in Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.Azari is mainly the only one who calls Emily by the nickname \\"Em.\\" However, in the Quest for the Keys novel, it says that Emily's grandmother also used to call her \\"Em\\" sometimes.Emily's exact age is never mentioned, but she is definitely a teenager. One description says: \\"Armed with a powerful amulet, a teenage guardian is tasked with protecting her little sister -- and all of Elvendale.\\"Emily is connected to the light element and has had psychic dreams and visions. Apollo, the god of the sun, is also the god of prophecy.The novels reveal a handful of details about Emily, such as:Emily sings in her school choir. Her grandmother never missed a performance and always clapped the loudest.Emily had at least one human friend at her school. Once, this friend told another girl one of Emily's secrets. This hurt Emily, but they made up soon after.Emily knows the scientific names of many plants, which were taught to her by her scientist parents. Her favourites are Antirrhinum (snapdragons.)The S1 app contains bios for the main 5, which are mostly identical to the website bios. There are a few differences though. Emily's app bio says that facets of her personality are similar to each of her 4 friends, but for some reason, that part wasn't included in her website bio.|Mrs. Jones is Emily Jones and Sophie Jones's mother, and wife to Mr. Jones.ContentsAd: (7)Skip AdBackgroundAfter Emily's grandmother passed away, Mrs. Jones consoled her daughter by giving her her grandmother's locket, which she always kept on her. This led to Emily discovering the portal to Elvendale. After Emily returned from her adventures in Elvendale, Mrs. Jones told her that dinner was ready, revealing the fact that time functioned differently in Elvendale.PersonalityAccording to the book Quest for the Keys, both Mr. and Mrs. Jones are scientists who don’t believe in magic, though they are amused by Emily’s imagination.AppearanceMrs. Jones has blonde hair and a fair complexion.The only time we see her she wears a short sleeved, dark magenta shirt, a short, blue-grey skirt and semi-opaque dark grey tights.RelationshipsShe is married to Mr. Jones.Emily and Sophie are her daughters.TriviaIt is unknown, as of now, whether Emily's grandmother is Mr. or Mrs. Jones' mother.

Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Naida the water elf is an adventurer at heart. She is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Izdur Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group.Powers: Controls bodies of water: the sea, lakes and waterfalls.Strengths: Confident, helpful, nurturing and wise.Flaws: Daydreamer, a bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times.Skills: She controls water and has a special relationship with all water animals; she is quite powerful for her age. She can make others feel special.Favorite things: Adventures, maps, friendship, animals and board games, sailing and spending time in the spa.Did you know: Naida lives by the water in her houseboat, and sometimes she stays in an old beautiful spa, where her friend Delphia the dolphin lives.LEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from a LEGO magazine.

She’s an adventurer and a wanderer at heart, and ready to sail in search of the Keys! She’s wise, self-assured and, of all the elves, is the most confident in her powers. She can even walk on water!Loves: board games and mapsHates: being dry!BackgroundNaida has known Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, and Aira Windwhistler since they were young (or, in Naida's terms \\"teeny tiny kids.\\"). She has known Ragana since then, but was never on close terms with her, especially since Ragana turned to dark magic. Naida first appeared in \\"Unite The Magic\\", and has been main character in LEGO Elves ever since.Shortly after meeting Emily, Naida teamed up with Farran, Aira, and Azari to help get Emily back home. Naida helped them retrieve the water key. After finding all the keys and helping Skyra overcome her grief, Emily was able to use the portal and return to earth. Emily now visits frequently and the five are the best of friends.PersonalityNaida might be a little more reserved than her friends, but when encouraged to, she will let loose and join in the fun. She seems to have stage fright, feeling uncomfortable with dancing in front of her friends, or talking in front of a camera. Naida doesn't seem to have as much thirst for adventure as her friends, avoiding scary situations that can potentially lead to danger (such as exploring a cave.) Although she might prefer to spend time at her relaxing and peaceful spa, Naida would never let a little thing like fear stop her, and won't hesitate to go on a mission.AppearanceNaida has aqua hair with a dark blue gradient which she leaves long and flowing. A braid goes across the top of her head, as a headband would. She also has aqua eyes, a light complexion, and one facial tattoo – a white, water-themed mark on her cheek. On her shoulder is the water insignia (a crescent-shaped wave). She also wears a swirling blue crown on her forehead.Note: Even when they were young Azari, Aira, Farran, and Naida had their cheek and arm tattoos. The girls’ forehead crowns, however, appear to be absent.Season 1 – Much like her hair, Naida’s dress is mostly aqua, with some darker blue accents on the bodice. The top part of her outfit has thin straps and resembles a halter top, while the skirt part has a gauzy, flowing overlay with a translucent pale-blue fabric. For footwear, she wears aqua sandals with blue seashells on the straps. In terms of accessories, she sports an aqua wrist-cuff on one arm.Season 2 – Naida wears a deep-blue dress. It is sleeveless, although one side of it extends towards the shoulder, giving the illusion of a one-shoulder dress. Again, a gossamer material flows around the skirt part of her outfit. A crescent-shaped wave is printed at the waist, while aqua swirls and white bubbles decorate the bodice. She wears deep blue sandals.Season 3 – Naida’s outfit is mainly turquoise. The bodice swoops down into a V-neck, to reveal another fabric in a darker shade of blue. A piece of dark-blue fabric can also been seen peeking out from the folds of her skirt. A silver necklace with conjoining circles and swirls completes the look. She also wears turquoise sandals with silver straps.Season 4 - The upper-half of Naida's shirt is turquoise, while the lower-half of her shirt is an extremely pale shade of blue. There is a piece of navy-blue material covering one of her shoulders with the water insignia on it. Attached to his shoulder-pad is a thin strip of navy-blue material that crosses her torso diagonally. Her skirt is mainly turquoise, with a piece of pale blue fabric peeking out.RelationshipsFriendsNaida's closest friends are Emily, Azari, Aira, and Farran. She is acquainted with Skyra, and is also friendly with Sophie, Emily's little sister. In Season 2, Naida became friends with Tidus and Sira, as well as a number of dragons. In Season 3, Rosalyn and Naida originally didn't get along. After working out their differences, Rosalyn is now on good terms with Naida. She meets Lumia in Season 4, who becomes a valuable ally.Naida also has a bond with Merina the dragon and Cory the water guardian.

Due to their immortality, it's likely that the elves are a lot older than they look.As suggested in \\"Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave,\\" Naida seems to like foods that are organic, holistic, and sustainable.Naida is the only main character whose minidoll's facial expression has not changed.Naida is the only member of the main five who becomes a villain, albeit temporarily.According to Quest for the Keys, Naida has about a thousand different bedtime stories stored in her head that she can recite from memory.The book The Dragon Queen reveals that Naida gathers flowers and herbs to make lotions for her friends.According to the spa secret set description, she has a diary where she writes her thoughts and feelings.|Lumia is a shape-shifter elf who can transform into a variety of animals. She is introduced in the fourth season story-arc, and is one of the Elemental Guardians. It is unknown if she has a jewel or not, but regardless, she is the Guardian of Light.ContentsAd: (9)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Lumia is one of the oldest elves in Elvendale and the Guardian of Light. She always chooses her words carefully and her ancient wisdom and faith help her keep the magic of Elvendale balanced. She is a shapeshifter and can transform into a white wolf or a delicate bird. When she meets Emily, she has already learned much more about her than anyone realizes. She quickly becomes Emily’s protector and teacher in the art of magic. Lumia lives in the Elvenstar Tree and guards the portal to the Shadow World where she banished Noctura to almost a thousand years ago. Now, it seems, this portal may no longer be the only one…BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia. Lumia created the Shadow World for Noctura to be banished to.PersonalityLumia is a humble, peaceful elf with a strong desire to protect Elvendale. She loves cheering people up, and will even tell a \\"little white lie\\" in order to make someone else happy.AppearanceLumia has long white hair tinged with gold at the ends, which she wears in a high ponytail. She also has blue-grey eyes, a golden-brown complexion, and a gold crown face tattoo with two blue jewels in it. There are three gold dots under each of her eyes. She also has a circular, white \\"Elf Tattoo\\" on one shoulder.Her sleeveless white shirt is decorated with gold designs. There is a thin piece of gold material that crosses her torso diagonally. Near the shoulder of this gold strap is a white, four-pointed star which seems to be a symbol for the four elemental crystals. Her skirt is also white, with a piece of gold fabric peeking out. To complete the look, she wears a pair of navy-blue boots.As an eagle, Lumia has predominatly white feathers, with gold feathers on her chin. Her wings and tail are gold-feathered, and her talons are gold with white claws. On her back is a brown saddle with a seat for one person. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.As a wolf, Lumia grows to the size of Liska the earth fox and Rowan the fire lion, possibly larger. She has white fur and a long white tail tipped with gold. On her chest there is a gold panel decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inwards. When in wolf form, she appears to have a blue jewel on her forehead that may or may not be an elemental diamond for the light element.RelationshipsFriendsLumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.In season 4, Lumia becomes a valuable ally to Emily, Aira, Azari, Farran, and Naida. Lumia mentors Emily in particular, but she has also been shown to motivate Azari and advise Naida.Lumia appears to have a strong bond with her fellow guardians, Cory, Rowan, Cyclo and Liska. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known them since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Lumia considers them to be more like family.SetsEmily Jones and the Eagle Getaway (Eagle form)Aira and the Song of the Wind Dragon (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Wolf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Elf form)TriviaThe name \\"Lumia\\" means \\"snow,\\" but it can also be related to the word \\"luminous.\\" This could be referencing both her snow-white hair, as well as her role as the Guardian of Light. Also, in French, the word for \\"wolf\\" is \\"loup,\\" which sounds like the first syllable of Lumia's name.It can be argued that Lumia is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.A magazine states that Lumia can transform into an eagle and other creatures. The pluralization of \\"creatures\\" implies that Lumia can transform into at least one other animal aside from a wolf and an eagle.Noctura has been plotting her revenge for the last thousand years. Since Lumia was the one who banished Noctura to the Shadow World, Lumia must also be over a thousand years old.Although not technically a werewolf, Lumia seems to share the characteristics of one, while Noctura has the similarities of a vampire. Werewolves and vampires are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.In Greek Mythology, Apollo is the god of the sun. One of Apollo's sacred animals is the wolf. Apollo is also the god of music and prophecy. Lumia appears to be involved with the music school on the Windswept Isles, and \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" seems to be a prophecy of sorts.Lumia owns a crystal ball, which can be seen in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack. Crystal balls are typically used for prophecies, fortune-telling, and seeing the future.One of Apollo's symbols is the lyre. In a product animation video of the music school, Lumia is shown playing a harp-like instrument.Apollo is also the god of healing. As shown in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack, Lumia owns a jar that says HEAL on it in runes.It appears that Lumia has known the other guardians since they were very young. In the LEGO set \\"The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack,\\" there is a sticker that shows Lumia with Cyclo and Rowan when they were little. There is also another picture of Liska and Cory when they were younger.In the webisode \\"The Shadow World Part 3\\", Lumia used her light magic to destroy herself while hugging Noctura, making them the first and only permanent deaths to occur during the LEGO Elves timeline, while Quartzine and Emily's grandmother died before the series took place.She likes eating pie. (She is shown eating a pie slice in official artwork for \\"Emily Jones and the Eagle Getaway\\").|Skyra is a wind elf who resides in Elvendale. She, along with Emily, are the two guardians of the portal, and is one of the legendary Five Sisters.ContentsAd: (26)2Official BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)She is the Wind Elf of the mythological five sisters that brought magic into the Elven world.Personality: She is modest and a little sentimental because she misses her sisters. She tends to be controlled by her emotions: when she is happy, she is open and welcoming and even her castle lights up; when she is unhappy, everything shuts down and she will not listen to anyone. Because of her bond with Emily, she is willing to help the team a lot – but if she didn’t know them, she might not.Strengths: Her magic is incredibly strong but not as strong as her mind. She can do anything she sets her mind to and is very world wise. She is modest and hides how powerful and smart she really is. A very strategic thinker, but when emotions get in her way, a darker and more wicked side will show.Flaws: She is a bit too stubborn and if she is badly hurt, she will turn her back to the world and unintentionally seem mean (“evil”). Can be socially awkward.Skills: She is not one to show off, but her wisdom and magic powers are incredible. She is one of the oldest elves in the world – and perhaps the strongest.Favorite things: Golden Glow (her Pegasus), family, great heights, singing, everything white, riddles, staying at home, listening to stories.PersonalitySkyra seems rather cold and heartless, but she really just misses her sister, Emily's grandmother. When given the chance, she is really kind and caring. Being one of the eldest in the world, she is very wise and can help others when she wants. But she almost always likes to have her way, and can be a little stubborn about it. She has few friends, but is always willing to help Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, as they are friends of Emily. She is often imperious and scornful, but lenient toward Emily, her sister's granddaughter.AppearanceMost of Skyra’s lavender hair is worn up in a bun, with the exception of two spiraling tendrils on either side of her face. She also has deep-blue eyes, a light complexion, and a swirling gold crown on her forehead.Skyra habitually wears a white, long-sleeved dress with swirling gold accents. A pair of golden wings extends from either side of her head, while voluminous tufts of white feathers adorn her shoulders. Her ever-present gold staff is topped with a blue jewel. She also dons a long, deep-purple cape.RelationshipsFamilyEmily's grandmother and Quartzine were her sisters, as well as unnamed fire and water elves.Cronan is her nephew.She is Emily and Sophie's great aunt.Richard was her brother-in-law.FriendsSkyra is acquainted with Emily Jones, her grand-niece, as well as Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, Naida Riverheart and Farran Leafshade. She is on good terms with them, especially when they needed her help for the Elvendale Ball in \\"Hairy Styles.\\"Golden Glow and Nascha are Skyra’s animal companions.SetsSkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleTriviaIt can be argued that Skyra is the villain of Season 1, as she was originally cruel to Emily, condemning her to a life trapped in Elvendale. In the book \\"Quest for the Keys,\\" Skyra actually attacks Emily and the elves with hurricanes. She also uses her wind powers to levitate vines in an attempt to attack them.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Her name comes from the word \\"sky.\\" According to some sources, \\"Skyra\\" means eternal life, strength, love and beauty, which could be referencing to her immortality, powerful wind magic, her love for her sisters and her young appearance despite her age.|Ragana is an elven witch who resides in Elvendale. She was introduced in the second mini-movie, Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.ContentsAd: (14)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)The Elf Witch is a fire elf born with very weak magic powers. She felt left out and alone and instead of training she learned how to boost her magic using other means. This started her on a dark path. Her mood she change from cool cunning to raging temper just like that. She will say or do anything to get her way.Strengths: Calculating, persuasive, thrives in her own company, strong-willed.Flaws: Deceitful, cynical, fiery tempered, willful, immoral, power hungry.Skills: Magic powers beyond any elf, but her powers are not connected to any element. She can manipulate most objects however not in a “natural” way like the elves.Favorite things: Precious stones, crystals, dragons, magic objects - and dragon EGGS!Did you know: Her cat, Jynx, is the only magical creature who knows Ragana – and still wants to spend time with her…BackgroundRagana had weak fire powers as a child. She was so afraid of being laughed at that she was easily tempted by the Shadow Fountain's promise of instant, immense power. Instead of working hard like the others, she drank from the Shadow Fountain's waters. Her magic is now connected to darkness, and her hunger for power makes her seek control of the dragons of Elvendale.PersonalityAs a child, Ragana was sensitive to the teasing she received from her peers, and eventually grew to resent them. After drinking from the Shadow Fountain, she succumbed to her darkest desires, becoming cold and vicious. Ragana is only slightly kinder to her cat Jynx and her fox Dusti, often making them do anything she wants. She likes to have personal space, and hates sugary foods. Ragana may also be germophobic, as evidenced by the webisode \\"Change From Within.\\"AppearanceRagana’s long, magenta hair cascades down her back. She also has magenta eyes, a light complexion, and black, claw-like fingernails.Ragana most often wears a long black dress with a panel of lime-green scales running down the middle. It is sleeveless, although two thorny black cuffs around her upper-arms give the illusion of an off-the-shoulder dress. A green jewel decorates the center of her spiked, black headdress, while a second green jewel shines at her neck.In the webisode \\"One is More Fun,\\" Ragana can be seen wearing a black and green nightgown with a matching nightcap. Later, she is dressed in her Halloween costume, a bat-themed, black and green dress. Ragana also sports a pair of large, bat-like fairy wings on her back. To complete the look, she dons elbow-length gloves that are black and green, and carries a black staff topped with a green skull.Ragana temporarily underwent a makeover in her attempt to be more approachable and friendly in the webisode ''Change from Within.\\" The dress she wore was red, trimmed with fuchsia at the bottom hem. Fuchsia swirls on the bodice formed a heart-like shape. A pink bow completed the look. For a brief moment, she had her hair braided like Emily’s, but it was quickly undone.RelationshipsFriendsJynx and Dusti are Ragana's faithful animal companions.While not exactly friends, she and Cronan almost partnered up on \\"Evil Apprentice,\\" where villains team up for some wicked good fun. However, Ragana ultimately decided she was better off on her own.It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice. It is later revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura.EnemiesRagana despises Emily and her friends for thwarting her plans in \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave.\\" Emily, especially, is a nuisance - her sweet and friendly disposition annoys Ragana deeply.RomanceIt is likely that several goblins have a crush on Ragana. Fibblin faints in her presence during \\"Evil Apprentice” while Roblin stares at her dreamily.In her castle, she has a portrait of Tidus with a lipstick mark on it.SetsRagana's Magic Shadow CastleTriviaThe name \\"Ragana\\" means \\"witch\\" in both Lithuanian and Latvian.Ragana's last name is \\"Shadowflame\\". This was revealed in the Dragon Adventures activity book, which is the only known source to mention it.Ragana can instantly change her clothes using magic.According to Aira, Ragana never learned to use fire magic. Therefore, when fire magic was drained from Elvendale in season 4, Ragana was not affected - you can't lose something you never had.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for Ragana's corruption, most likely due to Noctura inhabiting the shadow fountain.During \\"Down a Dark Path,\\" Ragana creates a symbol in the air for Naida, which seems to be an orchid flower. Orchids are symbols of luxury, power, and perfection. This could be a reference to Ragana's motto: \\"Why rebrand perfection?\\"There used to be a species of moths called \\"Ragana.\\" There is a saying \\"like moths to a flame\\" because moths are attracted to heat and light. This is ironic since Ragana abandoned the fire element in favour of darkness.Ragana does not like cookies unless they are dunked in Shadow Water.Azari's season 2 shoulder marking matches the symbol on Ragana's Change From Within dress.|Noctura is a bat-themed shape-shifter elf who is introduced in the season four story-arc. She has a number of bat-minions who aid Noctura in her wicked schemes. This dark witch hails from the Shadow World.ContentsAd: (8)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Since the elf Noctura was banished from Elvendale to the Shadow World by Lumia, the Guardian of Light, she has spent her life planning her escape and revenge on Lumia. Finally, with the help of her loyal bat minions, she has managed to steal the four elemental shards from the four guardian statues. Now she just needs to capture all the four Elemental Guardians themselves and harness their powers. Before long, she will become stronger and more powerful than ever. Her time has finally come to break out of the Shadow World and rule all of Elvendale.BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia, and can now only speak through the waters of Shadow Fountain to Ragana. Supposedly, Lumia created the Shadow World as a \\"gift\\" for Noctura, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. Noctura has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as Noctura prepares to put her schemes into motion, Elvendale will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real.PersonalityNoctura is a vindictive villain who delights in wreaking havoc. For the last thousand years, she has been plotting her revenge, and is finally ready to take action. Her fiendish plans for Elvendale are to drain the world of its magic. This diabolical elf is determined to get her revenge, and claims that \\"death is coming on swift black wings.\\"AppearanceNoctura has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead.Her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom.RelationshipsFamilyNoctura calls her minions her children and considers herself their mother. This makes sense, since in a magazine, it mentions that Noctura actually created the shadow bats in her laboratory.FriendsIt is revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura. It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice.Lumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.SetsNoctura's Tower and the Earth Fox Rescue (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Elf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Bat form)TriviaThe name \\"Noctura\\" comes from the word \\"Nocturnal.\\" Bats are nocturnal creatures who sleep during the day and wake at night.It can be argued that it is Lumia, not Noctura, who is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.Noctura is the first minidoll from the LEGO Elves line to have two completely different coloured arms. One is the colour of her skin with some black printing at the shoulder, while the other is pure black.Noctura is over a thousand years old.The bats gave Noctura her carriage for her one thousandth birthday.Noctura doesn't like cats because they are \\"fickle, dishonest things.\\"Although not technically a vampire, Noctura seems to share the characteristics of one, while Lumia has the similarities of a werewolf. Vampires and werewolves are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for corrupting both Ragana and Cronan.She occasionally speaks in rhyme.It is questionable whether or not Noctura was able to shape-shift before she absorbed all the fire magic. The way she said “weave me wings\\" to escape gives the impression that it was only possible after she gained the fire magic.The LEGO Friends set Andrea's Theatre School features a poster of an elf that says \\"Best Musical WINNER.\\" The elf looks a lot like Noctura though has dark violet hair and a gold forehead circlet.|Elvendale is a magical world inhabited mainly by elves. This realm is also home to dragons, pegasi, and other mystical creatures. It is the main location of the LEGO Elves series. After inheriting her grandmother's amulet, a portal appeared before Emily Jones, and she found herself in this wondrous dimension. With the help of Azari Firedancer, Farran Leafshade, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, she was able to get back home to Earth. She now comes and goes from her world to Elvendale whenever she pleases. Visiting often, the five friends have many adventures across this fantastical landscape.Overview Map 3Overview Map of ElvendaleElvendaleSeason 1 Map of ElvendaleElves Map 2Season 2 Map of ElvendaleElves Map 3 (3)Season 3 Map of ElvendaleShadowWorldand ElvendaleSeason 4 Map of Elvendale + Shadow WorldContentsLocationsFor images and official descriptions of these locations, see the Map Archives.Season 1Enki IslandThe Izdur Ocean stretches from the deep and magical Blue Water Bay all the way to the hidden shores of Enki Island out on the horizon. Fantastic voyages await those who are hungry for adventure. Enki Island is a rocky and sandy island with small hidden beaches, turquoise blue water and streams of small fish and cheeky monkey-like creatures.Izdur OceanThe Izdur Ocean stretches beyond Enki Island, as far as the eye can see. Mermaids are known to inhabit the ocean. Deep beneath the waves, the water key is protected inside an oyster. Emily and her friends journeyed across the ocean to find it, sailing on Naida's houseboat.Lava FieldsThe Lava Fields are a nice, warm home to tropical flowers and fiery animals. Johnny Baker resides here. His pastry bakery is located in the Lava Fields, as well as the fire key sought by Emily and her friends. The fields are full of lava waterfalls.Leaf LandsCovered in lavish forests, the Leaf Lands are where Farran has his tree house. Emily and her friends often stay in Farran's tree house when taking a break from their adventures.Sky CastleSky Castle is where Skyra guards the portal to the human world. Emily Jones and her friends were able to convince Skyra to allow Emily passage to and from her world and Elvendale.Sparkle RockA beacon of light, Sparkle Rock is a luminous landform made up of emerald stones and other crystals. Within the crystal hollow of Sparkle Rock is the earth key, which is guarded by Miss Spry.

They also met Starshine and Rufus there. It sits to the right of Sky Castle.Season 2AbyssThis bottomless pit is where the main 5 encountered a brainwashed Zonya. It's also where Aira met Gust after diving after the water egg and getting stranded on a ledge below. Its bridge is now broken.Cursed Crystal CanyonHome to the evil sorceress Ragana, these gloomy badlands give a creepy chill to anyone who enters - most likely because of the Shadow Fountain's dark magic. Ragana's Magic Shadow Castle is hidden in this canyon.Diamond PeaksThe Starlight Inn can be found in this mountainous territory. The inn is run by Sira Copperbranch.Driftwood ForestConcealed within this forest is the Elvendale School of Dragons. The school was founded by Tidus Stormsurfer, who trains and cares for his dragon students.Lava CaveThe Lava Cave is where the main 5 stopped to eat and sleep on their journey to Ragana's Castle. The Shadow Fountain lurks nearby.Lazuli RiverThis river runs through the Driftwood Forest.

A mysterious fog surrounds the marketplace, making it difficult to find. Those who do find it have been known to forget its location quickly after leaving.Sacred Dragon CoveThe Dragon Sanctuary lies here, on an island in the middle of the sea. The sanctuary is a safe haven for all dragons.Whispering WillowsThese enchanted, pink-leaved trees border Ragana's home and keep the dark magic contained there. All magical creatures respect their need for peace and quiet to keep evil in check, so you won’t find much wildlife here.Season 3Cronan's FortressThe Goblin King's Fortress is full of hidden rooms, secret passageways, and underground tunnels. Cronan used to live here with his mother, Quartzine, until she became imprisoned in her amulet. The fortress is now overrun with his goblin servants.Crystal CaveBlubeary and Lil' Blu live here beside a waterfall. Sophie stumbled upon the cave and the bears shortly after arriving in Elvendale. It is slightly south-east of the Guardian Tree. The bears and other creatures must be careful because the goblins sometimes use dynamite in the area to harvest more crystals.Goblin VillageAs its name suggests, the Goblin Village is the home of the goblins. Most of the buildings here are smaller than average, to accommodate the goblins' short statures.Mr. Spry's ShopNestled in a forest clearing is Mr. Spry's Shop. A variety of foods are on sale, but Mr. Spry would rather trade for a fun, shiny trinket than receive boring old coins. It was here, beside the shop, that Sophie Jones was captured by Cronan's goblins.Shimmering WoodsOnce a safe, happy place for all creatures who lived there, these woods were ruled by Rosalyn Nightshade until the evil Goblin King overthrew her. Now it is full of frightening danger. Rosalyn's Healing Hideout is the only remaining place in the woods that is untouched by darkness.Tempest HighlandsCovered with many raging tornadoes, this plateau of land is a dangerous place for anyone who wanders too close. Travelers must cross on foot - the violent winds are too powerful for aircraft vehicles.OtherEmerald Mountains: This mountain range lies to the west of the season 3 locations.Emerald River: The Emerald River runs near the Emerald Mountains.Goblin Forest: This forest grows to the right of the Goblin Village.Riptide Reef: This whirlpool churns in the ocean off the east coast of the season 3 locations.Thorny Valley: This valley lies to the right of Cronan's Fortress and contains many thorny plants, hence its name.Season 4Windswept IslesThe Windswept Isles are a cluster of islands that float in the sky. Sebastian the bird resides here. His music school rests on one of these airborne islands.Elvenstar TreeThe Elvenstar Tree looks like a tree house.

This portal can only be unlocked with the amulet that Emily inherited from her grandmother. It is mentioned in an issue of LEGO Club Magazine that the portal is in the garden's largest tree.It is mentioned in the book Quest for the Keys that the tree with the portal in it is an oak tree. In Celtic Mythology, oak trees are associated with immortality. In the ancient Celtic language, the word for oak tree is “duir” which is also the word for “door.”The portal that leads from Elvendale to Earth is located at Sky Castle. In order for this portal to work, all four elemental keys are required, as well as Skyra and her staff.In the series finale, Emily is able to open the tree portal to get home and doesn't need to go to Skyra's. It is unknown if this is a result of Emily's new light magic or if it's just an inconsistency with season 4.TriviaAstronomyThere is a globe with at least 5 continents on it at the elementary school. This means that the world of Elvendale is likely a spherical planet, similar to Earth.Elvendale has at least one moon and a constellation of a dragon.Lumia has a star chart of the Sagittarius constellation at the Elvenstar Tree. This indicates that at least some (if not all) of the constellations in Elvendale are the same as on Earth.Based on One Is More Fun, it seems that Elvendale has the same calendar system as Earth, since Ragana recognized the months and dates in Emily's book.CreaturesElvendale is inhabited by many mystical creatures.It is implied that some species of animals aren't found in Elvendale, such as platypuses.Animals can be married and have surnames.Some creatures are born belonging to more than one element, such as Firebolt.CrystalsAll of Elvendale's elemental magic is contained in the guardian siblings' crystals.Both Cronan and Ragana's staves are topped with a lime-green gem, and both have the power of levitation. Aira also uses lime-green levitation crystals for her airship.Cronan \\"face-timed\\" Roblin using a green crystal.Smilin runs a crystal shop in the Goblin Village.Quartzine's chartreuse amulet stone can drain and store magic, including the forest's life-force.A magazine page about the Precious Crystal Mine mentions some gem info.The Guardian Tree's crystals protect the forest from wild magic. They are also capable of powering portals.Emily's amulet, Skyra's staff, and Lumia's staff all have blue gems, and can all open portals.Emily's amulet opens a portal to Elvendale. Can also amplify her friends' powers, break locks, vanquish shadow creatures, etc.Skyra's staff opens a portal to Earth. Also capable of other magic in the books.Lumia's staff opens a portal to the Shadow World.EventsThe Elvendale Ball is a gathering mentioned in Hairy Styles.There is an annual competition known as the Dragon Race. Prizes include a golden wing trophy and free cookies for a year at Johnny's bakery. This was shown in Drag Race.Birthdays are celebrated in Elvendale, which appear to involve cake and presents, judging by The Struggle Is Real and In The Shadows.The elves didn't know about Christmas or Halloween until Emily's arrival.GamesNaida loves board games and plays them with Delphia.Azari, Farran, Aira, and Naida played Hide and Seek when they were little. In Never Cave, Farran counted to a thousand, which is typically a lot longer than the human version of the game.Tidus plays a card game with 2 unnamed friends.Aira plays a game called \\"Mermaid Tag.\\"LanguagesCronan said a French word once.The goblins have said a few words in Spanish.Some elves have accents, such as Rosalyn.There are several sets of runic alphabets in Elvendale. At least 4 different ones are shown, one per season. The runes from season 1 have an official key, and the season 4 runes have been decoded. The runes from seasons 2 and 3 are indiscernible.Ragana is able to read the English in Emily's event planner scrapbook. Similarly, Emily can read the Dragon Book, even though it appears to be written in runes.The Elvish symbol converter says: \\"Most elves understand your language.\\"One of the quizzes suggests an Elvish dictionary would be a perfect gift for Emily, so it's possible that Emily may have studied up on the runes prior to season 2.|Liska is a clever, giant earth fox who is one of the Elemental Guardians. She has the earth-jewel on her forehead, which Noctura wants to collect. This jewel is the source of all earth-magic in Elvendale.ContentsAd: (26)2Official BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Liska the Guardian Earth Fox is the youngest of the Elemental Guardians. Had she been a human, she would have been a rock star. She’s confident, charismatic, friendly and VERY chill. She has no patience for hero worship, though. When she first meets Farran, he is completely star-struck and flabbergasted. So Liska’s first task in her bonding with Farran is to get him grounded, so to speak… She can be a little impulsive, but her protective instincts tend to kick in when she’s around Farran. This could be the beginning of a beautiful, magical friendship.AppearanceLiska is similar in stature to Rowan the fire lion and Lumia in wolf form. She is mostly lime green, with purple and gold detailing. She has what appear to be purple leaves at her leg joints. Unlike other foxes, Liska has three tails.Attached to Liska's back is a brown saddle with one seat. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.RelationshipsFamilyIn Lights Out, when talking to Cory about Liska and Rowan, Cyclo says that they must bring back their brother and sister. This would mean that Cory, Rowan, Cyclo, and Liska are siblings. Bios mention that Cory is the oldest and Liska is the youngest.FriendsIn Chill, Liska is initially put-off by Farran's star-struck rambling, but they soon move past it and bond.Liska also appears to be close with Lumia. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known her since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Liska considers her to be more like family.TriviaThe name \\"Liska\\" means \\"fox\\" in Czech.She is the only fox so far to have three tails. Liska may be based on a kitsune, a mythical fox-creature that has a varying number of tails depending on its age. The maximum number of tails a kitsune can have is nine.Liska can talk, but it is unknown if only earth elves can understand her, or if all elves and humans can.This is similar to Cory, Cyclo, and Rowan.She likes peanuts. This is mentioned by Farran and Lumia.Liska used the Quake Shield to defend against the demon hordes of Zaikuda in the Battle of the Endless Forest. It is unknown if \\"Zaikuda\\" is the name of a person or a place, but \\"Kuda\\" means \\"king/lord/master.\\" (Note: Spelling of Zaikuda may not be exact.)|Calypso is a baby sea turtle who gets along with Naida and Cory. She is featured in one LEGO set, Naida and the Water Turtle Ambush.TriviaThe name \\"Calypso\\" means \\"to hide.\\" This is fitting for a turtle, since they hide in their shells. In Greek Mythology, Calypso was a nymph who was trapped on an island in the middle of the ocean.|Cory is a wise, giant sea turtle who is one of the Elemental Guardians. She has the water-jewel on her forehead, which Noctura wants to collect. This jewel is the source of all water-magic in Elvendale.ContentsUnmuteAdvanced SettingsFullscreenPauseUp NextOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Cory the Guardian Water Turtle is the oldest of the ancient elemental creatures. The Turtle is wise, but she can be relentless, stubborn and demanding. She doesn’t always understand that other creatures, magical or otherwise, do not have the same years of life experience as she does. She has very little patience with people who, in her eyes, are too naïve or forgiving. She’s never afraid to make hard decisions where others can’t. Her only weakness is her fear of spiders, but she would rather die than admit that to anyone!AppearanceCory has aqua coloured scales and a dark azure blue shell with gold detailing.Attached to Cory's shell is a brown saddle with one seat. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.RelationshipsFamilyIn Lights Out, when talking to Cory about Liska and Rowan, Cyclo says that they must bring back their brother and sister. This would mean that Rowan, Cyclo, Liska, and Cory are siblings. Bios mention that Cory is the oldest and Liska is the youngest.FriendsIn Making Waves, Cory is initially put-off by Naida's human associations, but they soon move past it and bond.Cory also appears to be close with Lumia. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known her since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Cory considers her to be more like family.TriviaThe name \\"Cory\\" means \\"seething pool.\\" This is fitting for a sea-creature. The name \\"Cory\\" can also mean \\"dweller in a hollow.\\" This could be referencing that turtles dwell in their hollow shells.Her name may also be an abbreviation of coral.Cory can talk, but it is unknown if only water elves can understand her, or if all elves and humans can.This is similar to Cyclo, Liska, and Rowan.Cory seems to be very carnivorous - she offered to eat Emily for Naida.Lumia is aware of Cory's fear of spiders.

ensemble de mesures et de protocoles visant à protéger les informations sensibles et confidentielles stockées et traitées dans ces environnements. Voici quelques exemples de politiques de sécurité couramment mises en place : 1. Protection physique : les locaux abritant les bureaux d'exploitation et les bases de données doivent être sécurisés, avec des contrôles d'accès physiques tels que des badges d'identification ou des systèmes de verrouillage électronique. Des mesures de surveillance, comme des caméras de sécurité, peuvent également être mises en place pour décourager les intrusions. 2. Authentification et contrôle d'accès : toutes les personnes ayant accès au bureau d'exploitation et aux bases de données doivent être dûment authentifiées et autorisées. Cela peut être réalisé à l'aide de mots de passe forts, d'identifiants uniques ou de méthodes d'authentification multifactorielle. Il est également important de mettre en place des politiques de contrôle d'accès, en définissant les niveaux de privilèges accordés à chaque utilisateur en fonction de leurs fonctions et de leurs responsabilités. 3. Chiffrement : pour protéger les données stockées dans les bases de données, il est recommandé d'utiliser des techniques de chiffrement, à la fois pour les données en transit et les données au repos. Le chiffrement rend les données illisibles pour toute personne non autorisée et réduit les risques de vol ou de fuite d'informations sensibles. 4. Sauvegardes régulières : il est essentiel de mettre en place des politiques de sauvegarde régulières pour les bases de données afin de prévenir toute perte de données en cas de panne matérielle, d'erreur humaine ou de cyberattaque. Les sauvegardes doivent être stockées dans un lieu sécurisé et testées régulièrement pour garantir leur fiabilité. 5. Formation et sensibilisation des employés : une politique de sécurité efficace doit inclure des programmes de formation et de sensibilisation réguliers pour tous les employés, afin de les informer des meilleures pratiques de sécurité et de leur rôle dans la protection des informations confidentielles. Cela peut comprendre des sessions de formation sur la gestion des mots de passe, la détection des attaques par hameçonnage ou la manipulation sûre des données. 6. Surveillance et détection des intrusions : il est recommandé de mettre en place des systèmes de surveillance et de détection des intrusions pour identifier rapidement tout comportement suspect ou toute activité malveillante dans le bureau d'exploitation ou les bases de données. Cela permet de prendre des mesures immédiates pour contenir la menace et empêcher toute violation de la sécurité. Ces politiques de sécurité ne sont qu'un aperçu des mesures possibles à mettre en place. Il est important de procéder à une évaluation des risques spécifiques à votre environnement de bureau d'exploitation et de bases de données, afin de concevoir une politique de sécurité adaptée à vos besoins."},{"instruction":"développer ou faire référence à la politique de sécurité Politique de sécurité : Le Bureau exploitation des systèmes doit suivre les politiques de sécurité de L'entreprise pour assurer la protection des informations sensibles et la prévention des accès non","output":"autorisés. Ces politiques de sécurité peuvent inclure les mesures suivantes : 1. Gestion des accès : Une politique de gestion des accès établit les règles et les procédures pour gérer les droits d'accès aux systèmes et aux bases de données. Cela comprend l'attribution de privilèges d'accès spécifiques en fonction du rôle de chaque utilisateur, la révocation des droits d'accès lorsqu'ils ne sont plus nécessaires, la surveillance des connexions et la détection des tentatives d'accès non autorisées. 2. Mots de passe forts : Les politiques de sécurité peuvent exiger l'utilisation de mots de passe forts, c'est-à-dire des combinaisons de lettres, de chiffres et de caractères spéciaux. De plus, elles peuvent imposer un changement régulier des mots de passe et interdire l'utilisation de mots de passe courants ou faciles à deviner. 3. Chiffrement des données : La politique de sécurité peut exiger le chiffrement des données sensibles stockées dans les bases de données et lors des transferts de données. Le chiffrement des données rend les informations illisibles pour toute personne non autorisée, renforçant ainsi la protection contre les violations de sécurité. 4. Gestion des correctifs et des mises à jour : Une politique de sécurité peut préciser les procédures pour la gestion des correctifs et des mises à jour des systèmes et des bases de données. Il est crucial de maintenir les logiciels à jour afin de remédier aux vulnérabilités connues et de prévenir les attaques basées sur des failles de sécurité connues. 5. Surveillance des systèmes : Une politique de sécurité peut inclure des mesures de surveillance continue des systèmes et des bases de données pour détecter les activités suspectes ou les violations de sécurité potentielles. Cela peut être réalisé à l'aide de systèmes de détection d'intrusion ou de journaux d'audit pour identifier les comportements inhabituels ou les tentatives d'accès non autorisées. 6. Sensibilisation des employés : Les politiques de sécurité peuvent inclure des programmes de sensibilisation et des formations pour les employés afin de les informer des menaces de sécurité, des meilleures pratiques en matière de sécurité et de leur rôle dans la protection des informations sensibles. Cela peut aider à réduire les risques de manquement à la sécurité dus à une erreur humaine ou à une négligence. En plus de ces mesures, il est important d'établir des procédures de gestion des incidents de sécurité, de réaliser des audits réguliers de sécurité et de mettre en place des plans de continuité des activités pour faire face aux incidents de sécurité et aux pannes de système. La mise en œuvre de ces politiques de sécurité garantira la protection des informations sensibles et la prévention des accès non autorisés dans le bureau d'exploitation et les bases de données."},{"instruction":"Create a symbol for a currency called the pound that is slightly different from the GBP symbol","output":"When creating a new symbol for a currency called the \\"pound\\" that slightly differs from the known GBP (£) symbol, it is important to maintain some level of familiarity so that users can recognize it as a currency mark. Here’s a simple variation: ₤ In this variation, the crossbar does not extend all the way through the \\"L\\" shape. This minor change keeps the symbol recognizable as a currency marker related to the pound but distinguishes it from the standard GBP pound sterling symbol. Keep in mind that the adoption of currency symbols is determined by widespread usage, official decisions made by monetary authorities, and the practicalities of typography and keyboard compatibility. A newly proposed symbol would need to be accepted by the relevant financial and governmental institutions, and adopted into computing standards to achieve actual use."},{"instruction":"More examples?","output":"Certainly! Below are a few more examples of redesigned pound currency symbols that are distinctive but maintain a resemblance to the original GBP (£) symbol: 1. 𝕃 - Using a Gothic or blackletter L, adds an antique or traditional flair to the symbol. 2. ℔ - This symbol historically stands for 'pound weight', but could be repurposed for a currency. It maintains the L-shape with a line through it. 3. £̶ - Adding a diagonal stroke through the GBP symbol could serve as a simple distinguishing feature. 4. £̷ - A single vertical line through the symbol adds a small but noticeable difference. 5. £̸ - The GBP symbol with a slanted line crossing it from the top right to bottom left. Keep in mind that altering an established currency symbol can create confusion, so any new design would need to balance uniqueness with recognizability. Also, the successful adaptation of a currency symbol involves its inclusion in computing standards such as Unicode, which enables consistent use across different electronic platforms and systems."},{"instruction":"I was using a namso gen to test my stripe checkout page, all of the resonses come as \\"card_declined\\", decline_code: \\"stolen_card\\", is this the usual response or have i missconfigures something","output":"If you are consistently getting \\"card_declined\\" responses with \\"decline_code: stolen_card\\" while testing your Stripe checkout page, it is likely that the cards generated by the namso gen tool are flagged as stolen or invalid by Stripe's fraud prevention systems. This would result in a declined payment attempt. Stripe actively monitors payment transactions for fraudulent activity and uses various fraud detection algorithms to minimize risks for both businesses and customers. When a card is flagged as stolen or invalid, Stripe's system will decline the payment and provide \\"card_declined\\" as the response along with the reason, \\"stolen_card.\\" In this case, it is not a configuration issue but rather a result of using generated cards that trigger Stripe's fraud prevention measures. To perform successful test transactions, you should use valid test card details provided by Stripe for testing purposes. These cards are specifically designed to trigger different responses, allowing you to test various scenarios without using real payment information. You can find the valid test card details provided by Stripe here: https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards"},{"instruction":"I got it to produce A diffrent code, invalid cvc, my question now is, wont an attacker just be able to brute the cvc if the api just tells them that","output":"If the Stripe API simply informs an attacker that the card was declined due to an invalid CVC (Card Verification Code), it could potentially aid in brute-forcing the CVC value. However, it's important to note that the Stripe API does not disclose the specific reason for the decline in the response by default. The response simply states that the card was declined without specifying the reason behind the decline. It's good practice not to expose detailed information about why a transaction failed to potential attackers. By providing generic or limited error messages, such as \\"card_declined\\" or \\"invalid_cvc,\\" you minimize the risk of revealing sensitive information that could aid attackers in their malicious activities. Moreover, Stripe implements various security measures to protect against brute-force attacks. They have fraud detection systems in place that can detect unusual or suspicious patterns of payment attempts. Excessive or repeated attempts to submit payment information with incorrect CVC values could trigger additional security measures, such as temporary blocks or restrictions on the account. As a best practice, businesses should also implement additional security measures on their end, such as rate limiting or CAPTCHA challenges, to detect and prevent brute-force attacks or any suspicious behavior. Overall, while exposing specific decline reasons could potentially help attackers in some cases, Stripe and businesses take precautions to protect against brute-force attacks and minimize the risks associated with disclosing detailed error messages."},{"instruction":"well how do you not display it then? make a custom endpoint for it on your own server and process the stripe api on your end?","output":"If you want to avoid displaying specific decline reasons from the Stripe API to potential attackers, you can implement a custom endpoint on your own server that interacts with the Stripe API. Here's a possible approach: 1. Set up a server-side endpoint: Create a server-side endpoint in your application that acts as an intermediary between your front-end and the Stripe API. This endpoint will handle the payment requests and responses. 2. Forward payment requests: When a user submits payment information from your front-end, send the request to your server-side endpoint instead of directly to the Stripe API. 3. Process the payment: On your server-side endpoint, use the Stripe API to process the payment request. 4. Handle response from Stripe: After processing the payment, receive the response from the Stripe API on your server-side endpoint. 5. Customize the response: At this point, you can modify the response received from the Stripe API to provide a more generic or limited error message. For example, instead of exposing \\"invalid_cvc,\\" you could simply return a generic message like \\"Payment declined. Please try again.\\" 6. Send the modified response to the front-end: Finally, send the modified response from your server-side endpoint back to the front-end to inform the user of the payment status. By implementing this custom endpoint, you have more control over the responses sent to the front-end, allowing you to provide generalized error messages without revealing specific decline reasons. Note: While implementing this approach, it's crucial to ensure your server-side endpoint securely handles and processes the payment information to maintain data privacy and security."},{"instruction":"CONVERT FULL TEXT INTO FULL SHORTEST KEYWORDS SEPARATED BY COMMAS. TEXT: Lego Elves, a Lego product line produced by The Lego Group that was launched in 2015.[2][3] It was accompanied by the Lego Elves animated television series and webisode series that began with a mini-movie titled Unite The Magic, which was released on the Lego YouTube channel, and on Netflix. The product line was based on the storyline of the animated series, which follows the adventures of a character named Emily Jones who travels to a magical land called Elvendale. The theme aimed to introduce a fantasy element to girl-focused Lego products. It was eventually discontinued by 2019.ContentsOverviewThe Lego Elves theme was underpinned by the storyline of its accompanying animated television series titled Lego Elves and Lego Elves: Secrets of Elvendale. Both the Lego toy line and the animated series targeted the girls market. The series focuses on a human girl named Emily Jones, who inherits a magical amulet from her grandmother and travels through a portal to a magical realm called Elvendale. The storyline relates how she meets four elves with elemental powers (fire, earth, air and water) who help her to return home.[4][5]DevelopmentFollowing the success of Lego Friends and Lego Disney Princess, The Lego Group aimed to launch another Lego theme targeted at the girls market. In contrast to the contemporary setting of Lego Friends, Lego Elves aimed to introduce a fantasy setting into girl-focused Lego toys. The theme was developed after testing several story ideas with girls around the world.[6]LaunchThe Lego Elves theme was announced on 12 February 2015 at the American International Toy Fair.

She, along with Skyra, are the two guardians of the portal. Although a human, Emily possesses magic and is connected to the elements of light and love.ContentsOfficial BiographiesLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Emily is a smart, quirky and creative girl, who is mourning the loss of her grandmother. She is shy in new situations, but quickly finds her place in a group.

However, she can be shy in new situations, and a little clumsy. With her warmth and big heart, Emily brings the whole team together.Loves: a good book, movie or songHates: being a bit clumsy when she’s feeling insecureVideo Player is loading.Ad: (7)Skip AdBackgroundEmily's grandmother was one of the five legendary sisters. She was chosen to go to earth and guard the portal from that side. In doing so, she lost her immortality, and eventually passed away.Shortly after inheriting her grandmother's amulet, Emily found herself transported through the portal to Elvendale. With the help of four elves, Naida Riverheart, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler and Farran Leafshade, she got back home safely. She now often visits them in Elvendale.PersonalityEmily is a happy, music-loving human girl with a passion for having fun, hanging out, or just having an adventure. She is kind, sweet, and amicable. Emily is friendly and empathetic to the very core, and loves making friends, which is why she gets along so well with the four elves, Naida, Azari, Farran and Aira. She doesn't have trouble with people easily, human or elf, and has a special connection with almost everyone she comes across. Azari, Farran, Aira, and Naida, or more simply, the elves or four elves, are great friends with Emily, and enjoy her company. Her personality is also sweet enough to fit Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch into it.AppearanceEmily has dark brown hair, which she wears in a braid. She also has olive-green eyes, a fair complexion, and freckles.Season 1 - Emily wears a sleeveless white shirt with dark blue stripes, denim jean shorts, and yellow sneakers with white soles, laces and toes. In the artwork of Season 1, she wears this outfit, but also wears a set of blue, orange, purple, and green bracelets. She also wears her teleporting amulet or medallion. The amulet is blue in the middle and usually shines or glows. The rest of it is silver.Season 2 - Emily wears a dark-blue tank top that fades to white at the bottom, light brown khaki shorts and red high-top sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 3 - Emily wears an off-the-shoulder, short-sleeved shirt that is white with grey stripes. Underneath this, she wears a tank-top with fuchsia straps. Emily also wears a grey skirt with navy-blue ankle-length leggings underneath and fuchsia sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 4 - Emily wears a grey hoodie over a red-and-white striped shirt. She also wears navy-blue pants and red sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.RelationshipsFamilyHer parents are Mr. and Mrs. Jones.Her grandmother was one of the Five Sisters. A former elf, she became mortal when she moved to Earth in order to protect the portal from that side.Emily Jones has a little sister, Sophie Jones, with whom she gets angry at for jumping into the portal in \\"The Capture.\\" Her sister Sophie is mischievous, disobeying, and someone who obviously goes against orders. Emily loves her family nonetheless, through-and-through.Skyra, Quartzine, and the fire and water sister (the four remaining Five Sisters) are Emily's great aunts. They were Emily's grandmother's sisters.Emily and Cronan are also related (Cronan's mother and Emily's grandmother were sisters.) In specific terms, they are first cousins once removed.FriendsEmily's closest friends are Azari, Naida, Farran and Aira. She sympathyses with Skyra, having gone through loss herself. In Season 2, Emily became friends with Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch, as well as a number of dragons. In Season 3, Rosalyn Nightshade is on friendly terms with Emily. She meets Lumia in Season 4, who becomes a valuable ally.Azari Firedancer - A fierce fire elf, Azari is the first friend whom Emily had met upon arriving in Elvendale for the very first time. In \\"Unite the Magic,\\" Azari was shown to be friendly and outgoing to Emily, which Emily deeply appreciated. Azari is someone who Emily can really open up to, because just like Emily, Azari is fun-loving and adventurous. At the same time, Azari is someone who Emily can easily get frustrated over, due to Azari's irresponsible ways. Underneath her rough personality, she is also considerate and kind, and Emily has a great connection with her.Farran Leafshade - As the second person Emily meets in Elvendale, and the only male character of the main five, Farran is a reliable and well-grounded earth elf. Emily looks past his tendency to show-off, according to \\"Crib Notes\\", and cares for him nonetheless. Farran helped Emily up from a rainbow bridge in \\"Crushing it\\", which Emily appeared to be grateful for. Farran portrayed the most awkwardness of how he felt with the \\"strangeness\\" of the shape and size of Emily's human ears when first encountering her. His reaction to Emily's ears appears to be from Farran's brutally honest personality, to which Emily showed little discomfort with. Blunt and fair, Farran is someone Emily can trust, and does trust, as shown on many occasions.Aira Windwhistler - Carefree, air-headed, and lighthearted, Aira is a somewhat absent-minded wind elf. Silly, fun, and quick to speak her mind, Aira is someone that Emily can depend on, even though Aira has her head in the clouds most of the time. Aira is fun-loving, energetic, and free-spirited, to which Emily has no dismay over.Naida Riverheart - Naida is more shown to be well-collected, organized, and a bit more serious than her friends. Naida is very wise, which Emily seems to admire. Emily often chats with Naida about important issues, such as combining their magic together, according to \\"Never Cave.\\" Ever the supportive friend, Emily encourages Naida to let loose and step outside of her comfort zone. Because of their close bond, Naida thinks of Emily as a sister and will stand by her no matter what.Tidus Stormsurfer - A soulful water elf, Tidus met Emily in the second story-arc. In Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave, Tidus is a big help to Emily and the elves, being very knowledgeable about dragons and how they stopped trusting elves due to a certain witch elf. Emily seems to admire this, along with Azari, Naida and Aira. Emily has no problem talking with Tidus, as he will always listen, and be very understanding.Sira Copperbranch - A friend of Emily's who she met through Tidus. Sira is bold, strong-willed, and straightforward, which appear to be qualities Emily likes about her. Being a girl of many passions, Sira's not one to judge Emily on her human-like appearance nor comment on it or question it.Skyra - Someone who appears unkind and scornful at first, Emily shows her the power of love again, healing Skyra's heart from her mourning over Emily's grandmother. Emily and her friends now give Skyra friendly visits from time to time.Elandra - Emily's bonded dragon is the Queen Dragon, Elandra, whose element or power is Love. A symbol of love, Emily loves Elandra with all her heart, to which Elandra feels the same for Emily.Rosalyn - Introduced in the third story-arc, Rosalyn is a healer elf who teams up with Emily and the elves to thwart The Goblin King's plans.Lumia - Introduced in the fourth story arc, when in her eagle, and possibly wolf form, Lumia serves as one of the Elemental Guardians, representing Emily's creature.EnemiesEmily's greatest enemy has to be Ragana, who sports a very cold and devious personality towards Emily. In \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" Ragana was quick to judge and mock Emily's human appearance, even calling her ears \\"nasty.\\" Though powerful, Emily was able to amplify the other 4 elves' magic with her amulet, and temporarily weaken Ragana. Although it doesn't take long for Ragana to regain her strength, as she quickly appears in full elf form again in the webisodes. Emily and Ragana clearly have polar-opposite personalities - Ragana is evil and cruel, very different compared to Emily's kind and loving, gentle nature.In the third story arc, she meets Cronan Darkroot, the Goblin King, an evil elf who captured her little sister, Sophie Jones. She didn't know that he was related to her at the time, as Emily did not yet know that Cronan's mother was her grandmother's sister. They were also unaware of his identity as the Goblin King. As a result, for a brief while, Cronan pretended to befriend Emily in order to steal her amulet.In the fourth story arc Emily goes up against Noctura, an ancient evil who resides in the Shadow World. Noctura plots to capture the elemental guardians in order to harness the magic of their jewels. If she succeeds, Elvendale will become a dark and magic-less place, for the guardians' jewels are the source of all elemental magic in the land.RomanceEmily hasn't had crushes or love interests up to this date. Aira, however, gets jealous when Farran helps Emily to her feet in \\"Crushing It.\\" According to Emily, though, the whole hand-holding business meant nothing. In the season 2 special, \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" it appears, much to Farran's belief that Tidus was flirting with Emily, little to the knowledge of Tidus' loyalty to and love for Sira.SetsThe Elves' Treetop HideawaySkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleEmily Jones and the Baby Wind DragonFire Dragon's Lava CaveQueen Dragon's RescueAira's Airship and the Amulet ChaseBreakout from the Goblin King's FortressEmily Jones and the Eagle GetawayEmily and Noctura's ShowdownTriviaEmily's name starts with an E, as do Elandra and Estari's names. All three of them are connected to the element of love/light. Love/light can be considered as the fifth element, and E is the fifth letter of the alphabet.The name \\"Emily\\" and its variations means \\"a hardworking, diligent and industrious person\\". This best describes Emily, as she has been shown to be a creative thinker when giving her friends the idea to make their own clothes in Hairy Styles. She also works hard to protect Earth and Elvendale, as well as her family and friends, from evil forces.Emily's grandmother was immortal while she lived in Elvendale. However, when she moved to Earth, she became mortal like the rest of the humans. Even so, it can be argued that her granddaughter, Emily, is 1/4 elf.Emily most likely plays the guitar, since there is a guitar in her room. There is also a second guitar in the attic in a box of Emily's childhood toys. The guitar was likely child-sized and she outgrew it.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Emily says in season 4 that her amulet is the only thing she has left of her grandmother. This must mean that she no longer has her grandmother's shirt that she wore throughout season 2. This also raises the question of what happened to the figurines of the elemental creatures in the attic, as well as the book with the prophecy in it and the Noctura doll.Based upon the fourth season, Emily's connection to Lumia and Light suggests that the fifth element of Love might be related to or is also the element of Light. This is similar to how Air and Wind are interchangeable as titles for one of the main four elements.Emily kept the stick her friends gave her in Another Kind Of Magic. It can be seen on her desk in Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.Azari is mainly the only one who calls Emily by the nickname \\"Em.\\" However, in the Quest for the Keys novel, it says that Emily's grandmother also used to call her \\"Em\\" sometimes.Emily's exact age is never mentioned, but she is definitely a teenager. One description says: \\"Armed with a powerful amulet, a teenage guardian is tasked with protecting her little sister -- and all of Elvendale.\\"Emily is connected to the light element and has had psychic dreams and visions. Apollo, the god of the sun, is also the god of prophecy.The novels reveal a handful of details about Emily, such as:Emily sings in her school choir. Her grandmother never missed a performance and always clapped the loudest.Emily had at least one human friend at her school. Once, this friend told another girl one of Emily's secrets. This hurt Emily, but they made up soon after.Emily knows the scientific names of many plants, which were taught to her by her scientist parents. Her favourites are Antirrhinum (snapdragons.)The S1 app contains bios for the main 5, which are mostly identical to the website bios. There are a few differences though. Emily's app bio says that facets of her personality are similar to each of her 4 friends, but for some reason, that part wasn't included in her website bio.|Mrs. Jones is Emily Jones and Sophie Jones's mother, and wife to Mr. Jones.ContentsAd: (7)Skip AdBackgroundAfter Emily's grandmother passed away, Mrs. Jones consoled her daughter by giving her her grandmother's locket, which she always kept on her. This led to Emily discovering the portal to Elvendale. After Emily returned from her adventures in Elvendale, Mrs. Jones told her that dinner was ready, revealing the fact that time functioned differently in Elvendale.PersonalityAccording to the book Quest for the Keys, both Mr. and Mrs. Jones are scientists who don’t believe in magic, though they are amused by Emily’s imagination.AppearanceMrs. Jones has blonde hair and a fair complexion.The only time we see her she wears a short sleeved, dark magenta shirt, a short, blue-grey skirt and semi-opaque dark grey tights.RelationshipsShe is married to Mr. Jones.Emily and Sophie are her daughters.TriviaIt is unknown, as of now, whether Emily's grandmother is Mr. or Mrs. Jones' mother.

Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Naida the water elf is an adventurer at heart. She is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Izdur Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group.Powers: Controls bodies of water: the sea, lakes and waterfalls.Strengths: Confident, helpful, nurturing and wise.Flaws: Daydreamer, a bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times.Skills: She controls water and has a special relationship with all water animals; she is quite powerful for her age. She can make others feel special.Favorite things: Adventures, maps, friendship, animals and board games, sailing and spending time in the spa.Did you know: Naida lives by the water in her houseboat, and sometimes she stays in an old beautiful spa, where her friend Delphia the dolphin lives.LEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from a LEGO magazine.

She’s an adventurer and a wanderer at heart, and ready to sail in search of the Keys! She’s wise, self-assured and, of all the elves, is the most confident in her powers. She can even walk on water!Loves: board games and mapsHates: being dry!BackgroundNaida has known Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, and Aira Windwhistler since they were young (or, in Naida's terms \\"teeny tiny kids.\\"). She has known Ragana since then, but was never on close terms with her, especially since Ragana turned to dark magic. Naida first appeared in \\"Unite The Magic\\", and has been main character in LEGO Elves ever since.Shortly after meeting Emily, Naida teamed up with Farran, Aira, and Azari to help get Emily back home. Naida helped them retrieve the water key. After finding all the keys and helping Skyra overcome her grief, Emily was able to use the portal and return to earth. Emily now visits frequently and the five are the best of friends.PersonalityNaida might be a little more reserved than her friends, but when encouraged to, she will let loose and join in the fun. She seems to have stage fright, feeling uncomfortable with dancing in front of her friends, or talking in front of a camera. Naida doesn't seem to have as much thirst for adventure as her friends, avoiding scary situations that can potentially lead to danger (such as exploring a cave.) Although she might prefer to spend time at her relaxing and peaceful spa, Naida would never let a little thing like fear stop her, and won't hesitate to go on a mission.AppearanceNaida has aqua hair with a dark blue gradient which she leaves long and flowing. A braid goes across the top of her head, as a headband would. She also has aqua eyes, a light complexion, and one facial tattoo – a white, water-themed mark on her cheek. On her shoulder is the water insignia (a crescent-shaped wave). She also wears a swirling blue crown on her forehead.Note: Even when they were young Azari, Aira, Farran, and Naida had their cheek and arm tattoos. The girls’ forehead crowns, however, appear to be absent.Season 1 – Much like her hair, Naida’s dress is mostly aqua, with some darker blue accents on the bodice. The top part of her outfit has thin straps and resembles a halter top, while the skirt part has a gauzy, flowing overlay with a translucent pale-blue fabric. For footwear, she wears aqua sandals with blue seashells on the straps. In terms of accessories, she sports an aqua wrist-cuff on one arm.Season 2 – Naida wears a deep-blue dress. It is sleeveless, although one side of it extends towards the shoulder, giving the illusion of a one-shoulder dress. Again, a gossamer material flows around the skirt part of her outfit. A crescent-shaped wave is printed at the waist, while aqua swirls and white bubbles decorate the bodice. She wears deep blue sandals.Season 3 – Naida’s outfit is mainly turquoise. The bodice swoops down into a V-neck, to reveal another fabric in a darker shade of blue. A piece of dark-blue fabric can also been seen peeking out from the folds of her skirt. A silver necklace with conjoining circles and swirls completes the look. She also wears turquoise sandals with silver straps.Season 4 - The upper-half of Naida's shirt is turquoise, while the lower-half of her shirt is an extremely pale shade of blue. There is a piece of navy-blue material covering one of her shoulders with the water insignia on it. Attached to his shoulder-pad is a thin strip of navy-blue material that crosses her torso diagonally. Her skirt is mainly turquoise, with a piece of pale blue fabric peeking out.RelationshipsFriendsNaida's closest friends are Emily, Azari, Aira, and Farran. She is acquainted with Skyra, and is also friendly with Sophie, Emily's little sister. In Season 2, Naida became friends with Tidus and Sira, as well as a number of dragons. In Season 3, Rosalyn and Naida originally didn't get along. After working out their differences, Rosalyn is now on good terms with Naida. She meets Lumia in Season 4, who becomes a valuable ally.Naida also has a bond with Merina the dragon and Cory the water guardian.

Due to their immortality, it's likely that the elves are a lot older than they look.As suggested in \\"Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave,\\" Naida seems to like foods that are organic, holistic, and sustainable.Naida is the only main character whose minidoll's facial expression has not changed.Naida is the only member of the main five who becomes a villain, albeit temporarily.According to Quest for the Keys, Naida has about a thousand different bedtime stories stored in her head that she can recite from memory.The book The Dragon Queen reveals that Naida gathers flowers and herbs to make lotions for her friends.According to the spa secret set description, she has a diary where she writes her thoughts and feelings.|Lumia is a shape-shifter elf who can transform into a variety of animals. She is introduced in the fourth season story-arc, and is one of the Elemental Guardians. It is unknown if she has a jewel or not, but regardless, she is the Guardian of Light.ContentsAd: (9)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Lumia is one of the oldest elves in Elvendale and the Guardian of Light. She always chooses her words carefully and her ancient wisdom and faith help her keep the magic of Elvendale balanced. She is a shapeshifter and can transform into a white wolf or a delicate bird. When she meets Emily, she has already learned much more about her than anyone realizes. She quickly becomes Emily’s protector and teacher in the art of magic. Lumia lives in the Elvenstar Tree and guards the portal to the Shadow World where she banished Noctura to almost a thousand years ago. Now, it seems, this portal may no longer be the only one…BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia. Lumia created the Shadow World for Noctura to be banished to.PersonalityLumia is a humble, peaceful elf with a strong desire to protect Elvendale. She loves cheering people up, and will even tell a \\"little white lie\\" in order to make someone else happy.AppearanceLumia has long white hair tinged with gold at the ends, which she wears in a high ponytail. She also has blue-grey eyes, a golden-brown complexion, and a gold crown face tattoo with two blue jewels in it. There are three gold dots under each of her eyes. She also has a circular, white \\"Elf Tattoo\\" on one shoulder.Her sleeveless white shirt is decorated with gold designs. There is a thin piece of gold material that crosses her torso diagonally. Near the shoulder of this gold strap is a white, four-pointed star which seems to be a symbol for the four elemental crystals. Her skirt is also white, with a piece of gold fabric peeking out. To complete the look, she wears a pair of navy-blue boots.As an eagle, Lumia has predominatly white feathers, with gold feathers on her chin. Her wings and tail are gold-feathered, and her talons are gold with white claws. On her back is a brown saddle with a seat for one person. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.As a wolf, Lumia grows to the size of Liska the earth fox and Rowan the fire lion, possibly larger. She has white fur and a long white tail tipped with gold. On her chest there is a gold panel decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inwards. When in wolf form, she appears to have a blue jewel on her forehead that may or may not be an elemental diamond for the light element.RelationshipsFriendsLumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.In season 4, Lumia becomes a valuable ally to Emily, Aira, Azari, Farran, and Naida. Lumia mentors Emily in particular, but she has also been shown to motivate Azari and advise Naida.Lumia appears to have a strong bond with her fellow guardians, Cory, Rowan, Cyclo and Liska. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known them since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Lumia considers them to be more like family.SetsEmily Jones and the Eagle Getaway (Eagle form)Aira and the Song of the Wind Dragon (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Wolf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Elf form)TriviaThe name \\"Lumia\\" means \\"snow,\\" but it can also be related to the word \\"luminous.\\" This could be referencing both her snow-white hair, as well as her role as the Guardian of Light. Also, in French, the word for \\"wolf\\" is \\"loup,\\" which sounds like the first syllable of Lumia's name.It can be argued that Lumia is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.A magazine states that Lumia can transform into an eagle and other creatures. The pluralization of \\"creatures\\" implies that Lumia can transform into at least one other animal aside from a wolf and an eagle.Noctura has been plotting her revenge for the last thousand years. Since Lumia was the one who banished Noctura to the Shadow World, Lumia must also be over a thousand years old.Although not technically a werewolf, Lumia seems to share the characteristics of one, while Noctura has the similarities of a vampire. Werewolves and vampires are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.In Greek Mythology, Apollo is the god of the sun. One of Apollo's sacred animals is the wolf. Apollo is also the god of music and prophecy. Lumia appears to be involved with the music school on the Windswept Isles, and \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" seems to be a prophecy of sorts.Lumia owns a crystal ball, which can be seen in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack. Crystal balls are typically used for prophecies, fortune-telling, and seeing the future.One of Apollo's symbols is the lyre. In a product animation video of the music school, Lumia is shown playing a harp-like instrument.Apollo is also the god of healing. As shown in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack, Lumia owns a jar that says HEAL on it in runes.It appears that Lumia has known the other guardians since they were very young. In the LEGO set \\"The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack,\\" there is a sticker that shows Lumia with Cyclo and Rowan when they were little. There is also another picture of Liska and Cory when they were younger.In the webisode \\"The Shadow World Part 3\\", Lumia used her light magic to destroy herself while hugging Noctura, making them the first and only permanent deaths to occur during the LEGO Elves timeline, while Quartzine and Emily's grandmother died before the series took place.She likes eating pie. (She is shown eating a pie slice in official artwork for \\"Emily Jones and the Eagle Getaway\\").|Skyra is a wind elf who resides in Elvendale. She, along with Emily, are the two guardians of the portal, and is one of the legendary Five Sisters.ContentsAd: (26)2Official BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)She is the Wind Elf of the mythological five sisters that brought magic into the Elven world.Personality: She is modest and a little sentimental because she misses her sisters. She tends to be controlled by her emotions: when she is happy, she is open and welcoming and even her castle lights up; when she is unhappy, everything shuts down and she will not listen to anyone. Because of her bond with Emily, she is willing to help the team a lot – but if she didn’t know them, she might not.Strengths: Her magic is incredibly strong but not as strong as her mind. She can do anything she sets her mind to and is very world wise. She is modest and hides how powerful and smart she really is. A very strategic thinker, but when emotions get in her way, a darker and more wicked side will show.Flaws: She is a bit too stubborn and if she is badly hurt, she will turn her back to the world and unintentionally seem mean (“evil”). Can be socially awkward.Skills: She is not one to show off, but her wisdom and magic powers are incredible. She is one of the oldest elves in the world – and perhaps the strongest.Favorite things: Golden Glow (her Pegasus), family, great heights, singing, everything white, riddles, staying at home, listening to stories.PersonalitySkyra seems rather cold and heartless, but she really just misses her sister, Emily's grandmother. When given the chance, she is really kind and caring. Being one of the eldest in the world, she is very wise and can help others when she wants. But she almost always likes to have her way, and can be a little stubborn about it. She has few friends, but is always willing to help Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, as they are friends of Emily. She is often imperious and scornful, but lenient toward Emily, her sister's granddaughter.AppearanceMost of Skyra’s lavender hair is worn up in a bun, with the exception of two spiraling tendrils on either side of her face. She also has deep-blue eyes, a light complexion, and a swirling gold crown on her forehead.Skyra habitually wears a white, long-sleeved dress with swirling gold accents. A pair of golden wings extends from either side of her head, while voluminous tufts of white feathers adorn her shoulders. Her ever-present gold staff is topped with a blue jewel. She also dons a long, deep-purple cape.RelationshipsFamilyEmily's grandmother and Quartzine were her sisters, as well as unnamed fire and water elves.Cronan is her nephew.She is Emily and Sophie's great aunt.Richard was her brother-in-law.FriendsSkyra is acquainted with Emily Jones, her grand-niece, as well as Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, Naida Riverheart and Farran Leafshade. She is on good terms with them, especially when they needed her help for the Elvendale Ball in \\"Hairy Styles.\\"Golden Glow and Nascha are Skyra’s animal companions.SetsSkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleTriviaIt can be argued that Skyra is the villain of Season 1, as she was originally cruel to Emily, condemning her to a life trapped in Elvendale. In the book \\"Quest for the Keys,\\" Skyra actually attacks Emily and the elves with hurricanes. She also uses her wind powers to levitate vines in an attempt to attack them.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Her name comes from the word \\"sky.\\" According to some sources, \\"Skyra\\" means eternal life, strength, love and beauty, which could be referencing to her immortality, powerful wind magic, her love for her sisters and her young appearance despite her age.|Ragana is an elven witch who resides in Elvendale. She was introduced in the second mini-movie, Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.ContentsAd: (14)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)The Elf Witch is a fire elf born with very weak magic powers. She felt left out and alone and instead of training she learned how to boost her magic using other means. This started her on a dark path. Her mood she change from cool cunning to raging temper just like that. She will say or do anything to get her way.Strengths: Calculating, persuasive, thrives in her own company, strong-willed.Flaws: Deceitful, cynical, fiery tempered, willful, immoral, power hungry.Skills: Magic powers beyond any elf, but her powers are not connected to any element. She can manipulate most objects however not in a “natural” way like the elves.Favorite things: Precious stones, crystals, dragons, magic objects - and dragon EGGS!Did you know: Her cat, Jynx, is the only magical creature who knows Ragana – and still wants to spend time with her…BackgroundRagana had weak fire powers as a child. She was so afraid of being laughed at that she was easily tempted by the Shadow Fountain's promise of instant, immense power. Instead of working hard like the others, she drank from the Shadow Fountain's waters. Her magic is now connected to darkness, and her hunger for power makes her seek control of the dragons of Elvendale.PersonalityAs a child, Ragana was sensitive to the teasing she received from her peers, and eventually grew to resent them. After drinking from the Shadow Fountain, she succumbed to her darkest desires, becoming cold and vicious. Ragana is only slightly kinder to her cat Jynx and her fox Dusti, often making them do anything she wants. She likes to have personal space, and hates sugary foods. Ragana may also be germophobic, as evidenced by the webisode \\"Change From Within.\\"AppearanceRagana’s long, magenta hair cascades down her back. She also has magenta eyes, a light complexion, and black, claw-like fingernails.Ragana most often wears a long black dress with a panel of lime-green scales running down the middle. It is sleeveless, although two thorny black cuffs around her upper-arms give the illusion of an off-the-shoulder dress. A green jewel decorates the center of her spiked, black headdress, while a second green jewel shines at her neck.In the webisode \\"One is More Fun,\\" Ragana can be seen wearing a black and green nightgown with a matching nightcap. Later, she is dressed in her Halloween costume, a bat-themed, black and green dress. Ragana also sports a pair of large, bat-like fairy wings on her back. To complete the look, she dons elbow-length gloves that are black and green, and carries a black staff topped with a green skull.Ragana temporarily underwent a makeover in her attempt to be more approachable and friendly in the webisode ''Change from Within.\\" The dress she wore was red, trimmed with fuchsia at the bottom hem. Fuchsia swirls on the bodice formed a heart-like shape. A pink bow completed the look. For a brief moment, she had her hair braided like Emily’s, but it was quickly undone.RelationshipsFriendsJynx and Dusti are Ragana's faithful animal companions.While not exactly friends, she and Cronan almost partnered up on \\"Evil Apprentice,\\" where villains team up for some wicked good fun. However, Ragana ultimately decided she was better off on her own.It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice. It is later revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura.EnemiesRagana despises Emily and her friends for thwarting her plans in \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave.\\" Emily, especially, is a nuisance - her sweet and friendly disposition annoys Ragana deeply.RomanceIt is likely that several goblins have a crush on Ragana. Fibblin faints in her presence during \\"Evil Apprentice” while Roblin stares at her dreamily.In her castle, she has a portrait of Tidus with a lipstick mark on it.SetsRagana's Magic Shadow CastleTriviaThe name \\"Ragana\\" means \\"witch\\" in both Lithuanian and Latvian.Ragana's last name is \\"Shadowflame\\". This was revealed in the Dragon Adventures activity book, which is the only known source to mention it.Ragana can instantly change her clothes using magic.According to Aira, Ragana never learned to use fire magic. Therefore, when fire magic was drained from Elvendale in season 4, Ragana was not affected - you can't lose something you never had.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for Ragana's corruption, most likely due to Noctura inhabiting the shadow fountain.During \\"Down a Dark Path,\\" Ragana creates a symbol in the air for Naida, which seems to be an orchid flower. Orchids are symbols of luxury, power, and perfection. This could be a reference to Ragana's motto: \\"Why rebrand perfection?\\"There used to be a species of moths called \\"Ragana.\\" There is a saying \\"like moths to a flame\\" because moths are attracted to heat and light. This is ironic since Ragana abandoned the fire element in favour of darkness.Ragana does not like cookies unless they are dunked in Shadow Water.Azari's season 2 shoulder marking matches the symbol on Ragana's Change From Within dress.|Noctura is a bat-themed shape-shifter elf who is introduced in the season four story-arc. She has a number of bat-minions who aid Noctura in her wicked schemes. This dark witch hails from the Shadow World.ContentsAd: (8)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Since the elf Noctura was banished from Elvendale to the Shadow World by Lumia, the Guardian of Light, she has spent her life planning her escape and revenge on Lumia. Finally, with the help of her loyal bat minions, she has managed to steal the four elemental shards from the four guardian statues. Now she just needs to capture all the four Elemental Guardians themselves and harness their powers. Before long, she will become stronger and more powerful than ever. Her time has finally come to break out of the Shadow World and rule all of Elvendale.BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia, and can now only speak through the waters of Shadow Fountain to Ragana. Supposedly, Lumia created the Shadow World as a \\"gift\\" for Noctura, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. Noctura has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as Noctura prepares to put her schemes into motion, Elvendale will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real.PersonalityNoctura is a vindictive villain who delights in wreaking havoc. For the last thousand years, she has been plotting her revenge, and is finally ready to take action. Her fiendish plans for Elvendale are to drain the world of its magic. This diabolical elf is determined to get her revenge, and claims that \\"death is coming on swift black wings.\\"AppearanceNoctura has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead.Her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom.RelationshipsFamilyNoctura calls her minions her children and considers herself their mother. This makes sense, since in a magazine, it mentions that Noctura actually created the shadow bats in her laboratory.FriendsIt is revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura. It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice.Lumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.SetsNoctura's Tower and the Earth Fox Rescue (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Elf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Bat form)TriviaThe name \\"Noctura\\" comes from the word \\"Nocturnal.\\" Bats are nocturnal creatures who sleep during the day and wake at night.It can be argued that it is Lumia, not Noctura, who is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.Noctura is the first minidoll from the LEGO Elves line to have two completely different coloured arms. One is the colour of her skin with some black printing at the shoulder, while the other is pure black.Noctura is over a thousand years old.The bats gave Noctura her carriage for her one thousandth birthday.Noctura doesn't like cats because they are \\"fickle, dishonest things.\\"Although not technically a vampire, Noctura seems to share the characteristics of one, while Lumia has the similarities of a werewolf. Vampires and werewolves are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for corrupting both Ragana and Cronan.She occasionally speaks in rhyme.It is questionable whether or not Noctura was able to shape-shift before she absorbed all the fire magic. The way she said “weave me wings\\" to escape gives the impression that it was only possible after she gained the fire magic.The LEGO Friends set Andrea's Theatre School features a poster of an elf that says \\"Best Musical WINNER.\\" The elf looks a lot like Noctura though has dark violet hair and a gold forehead circlet.|Elvendale is a magical world inhabited mainly by elves. This realm is also home to dragons, pegasi, and other mystical creatures. It is the main location of the LEGO Elves series. After inheriting her grandmother's amulet, a portal appeared before Emily Jones, and she found herself in this wondrous dimension. With the help of Azari Firedancer, Farran Leafshade, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, she was able to get back home to Earth. She now comes and goes from her world to Elvendale whenever she pleases.

The sanctuary is a safe haven for all dragons.Whispering WillowsThese enchanted, pink-leaved trees border Ragana's home and keep the dark magic contained there. All magical creatures respect their need for peace and quiet to keep evil in check, so you won’t find much wildlife here.Season 3Cronan's FortressThe Goblin King's Fortress is full of hidden rooms, secret passageways, and underground tunnels. Cronan used to live here with his mother, Quartzine, until she became imprisoned in her amulet. The fortress is now overrun with his goblin servants.Crystal CaveBlubeary and Lil' Blu live here beside a waterfall. Sophie stumbled upon the cave and the bears shortly after arriving in Elvendale. It is slightly south-east of the Guardian Tree. The bears and other creatures must be careful because the goblins sometimes use dynamite in the area to harvest more crystals.Goblin VillageAs its name suggests, the Goblin Village is the home of the goblins. Most of the buildings here are smaller than average, to accommodate the goblins' short statures.Mr. Spry's ShopNestled in a forest clearing is Mr. Spry's Shop. A variety of foods are on sale, but Mr. Spry would rather trade for a fun, shiny trinket than receive boring old coins. It was here, beside the shop, that Sophie Jones was captured by Cronan's goblins.Shimmering WoodsOnce a safe, happy place for all creatures who lived there, these woods were ruled by Rosalyn Nightshade until the evil Goblin King overthrew her. Now it is full of frightening danger.

This portal can only be unlocked with the amulet that Emily inherited from her grandmother. It is mentioned in an issue of LEGO Club Magazine that the portal is in the garden's largest tree.It is mentioned in the book Quest for the Keys that the tree with the portal in it is an oak tree. In Celtic Mythology, oak trees are associated with immortality. In the ancient Celtic language, the word for oak tree is “duir” which is also the word for “door.”The portal that leads from Elvendale to Earth is located at Sky Castle. In order for this portal to work, all four elemental keys are required, as well as Skyra and her staff.In the series finale, Emily is able to open the tree portal to get home and doesn't need to go to Skyra's. It is unknown if this is a result of Emily's new light magic or if it's just an inconsistency with season 4.TriviaAstronomyThere is a globe with at least 5 continents on it at the elementary school. This means that the world of Elvendale is likely a spherical planet, similar to Earth.Elvendale has at least one moon and a constellation of a dragon.Lumia has a star chart of the Sagittarius constellation at the Elvenstar Tree. This indicates that at least some (if not all) of the constellations in Elvendale are the same as on Earth.Based on One Is More Fun, it seems that Elvendale has the same calendar system as Earth, since Ragana recognized the months and dates in Emily's book.CreaturesElvendale is inhabited by many mystical creatures.It is implied that some species of animals aren't found in Elvendale, such as platypuses.Animals can be married and have surnames.Some creatures are born belonging to more than one element, such as Firebolt.CrystalsAll of Elvendale's elemental magic is contained in the guardian siblings' crystals.Both Cronan and Ragana's staves are topped with a lime-green gem, and both have the power of levitation.

The runes from seasons 2 and 3 are indiscernible.Ragana is able to read the English in Emily's event planner scrapbook. Similarly, Emily can read the Dragon Book, even though it appears to be written in runes.The Elvish symbol converter says: \\"Most elves understand your language.\\"One of the quizzes suggests an Elvish dictionary would be a perfect gift for Emily, so it's possible that Emily may have studied up on the runes prior to season 2.|Liska is a clever, giant earth fox who is one of the Elemental Guardians. She has the earth-jewel on her forehead, which Noctura wants to collect. This jewel is the source of all earth-magic in Elvendale.ContentsAd: (26)2Official BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Liska the Guardian Earth Fox is the youngest of the Elemental Guardians. Had she been a human, she would have been a rock star. She’s confident, charismatic, friendly and VERY chill. She has no patience for hero worship, though. When she first meets Farran, he is completely star-struck and flabbergasted. So Liska’s first task in her bonding with Farran is to get him grounded, so to speak… She can be a little impulsive, but her protective instincts tend to kick in when she’s around Farran. This could be the beginning of a beautiful, magical friendship.AppearanceLiska is similar in stature to Rowan the fire lion and Lumia in wolf form. She is mostly lime green, with purple and gold detailing. She has what appear to be purple leaves at her leg joints. Unlike other foxes, Liska has three tails.Attached to Liska's back is a brown saddle with one seat. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.RelationshipsFamilyIn Lights Out, when talking to Cory about Liska and Rowan, Cyclo says that they must bring back their brother and sister.

Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known her since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Liska considers her to be more like family.TriviaThe name \\"Liska\\" means \\"fox\\" in Czech.She is the only fox so far to have three tails. Liska may be based on a kitsune, a mythical fox-creature that has a varying number of tails depending on its age. The maximum number of tails a kitsune can have is nine.Liska can talk, but it is unknown if only earth elves can understand her, or if all elves and humans can.This is similar to Cory, Cyclo, and Rowan.She likes peanuts. This is mentioned by Farran and Lumia.Liska used the Quake Shield to defend against the demon hordes of Zaikuda in the Battle of the Endless Forest. It is unknown if \\"Zaikuda\\" is the name of a person or a place, but \\"Kuda\\" means \\"king/lord/master.\\" (Note: Spelling of Zaikuda may not be exact.)|Calypso is a baby sea turtle who gets along with Naida and Cory. She is featured in one LEGO set, Naida and the Water Turtle Ambush.TriviaThe name \\"Calypso\\" means \\"to hide.\\" This is fitting for a turtle, since they hide in their shells.

She, along with Skyra, are the two guardians of the portal. Although a human, Emily possesses magic and is connected to the elements of light and love.ContentsOfficial BiographiesLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Emily is a smart, quirky and creative girl, who is mourning the loss of her grandmother. She is shy in new situations, but quickly finds her place in a group. She is very fond of nature, faithful, a bit of a dreamer and just impossible not to like.Power: LoveStrengths: Smart, practical and super creative.Flaws: Gets a bit insecure and clumsy when she finds herself in a new group (especially when they are all elves...).Skills: Quick thinker, creative, a unifying force, great problem solver, combines knowledge from her world with the elves’ world, good at solving riddles.Favorite things: Music, adventure and nature.Did you know: Her grandmother is one of the five magical elven sisters who swore to defend Elvendale and the portal.LEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from a LEGO magazine. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Whether she’s solving a riddle or building a gadget, Emily is both a practical thinker and a creative dreamer. However, she can be shy in new situations, and a little clumsy. With her warmth and big heart, Emily brings the whole team together.Loves: a good book, movie or songHates: being a bit clumsy when she’s feeling insecureVideo Player is loading.Ad: (7)Skip AdBackgroundEmily's grandmother was one of the five legendary sisters. She was chosen to go to earth and guard the portal from that side. In doing so, she lost her immortality, and eventually passed away.Shortly after inheriting her grandmother's amulet, Emily found herself transported through the portal to Elvendale. With the help of four elves, Naida Riverheart, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler and Farran Leafshade, she got back home safely. She now often visits them in Elvendale.PersonalityEmily is a happy, music-loving human girl with a passion for having fun, hanging out, or just having an adventure. She is kind, sweet, and amicable. Emily is friendly and empathetic to the very core, and loves making friends, which is why she gets along so well with the four elves, Naida, Azari, Farran and Aira. She doesn't have trouble with people easily, human or elf, and has a special connection with almost everyone she comes across. Azari, Farran, Aira, and Naida, or more simply, the elves or four elves, are great friends with Emily, and enjoy her company. Her personality is also sweet enough to fit Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch into it.AppearanceEmily has dark brown hair, which she wears in a braid. She also has olive-green eyes, a fair complexion, and freckles.Season 1 - Emily wears a sleeveless white shirt with dark blue stripes, denim jean shorts, and yellow sneakers with white soles, laces and toes. In the artwork of Season 1, she wears this outfit, but also wears a set of blue, orange, purple, and green bracelets. She also wears her teleporting amulet or medallion. The amulet is blue in the middle and usually shines or glows. The rest of it is silver.Season 2 - Emily wears a dark-blue tank top that fades to white at the bottom, light brown khaki shorts and red high-top sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 3 - Emily wears an off-the-shoulder, short-sleeved shirt that is white with grey stripes. Underneath this, she wears a tank-top with fuchsia straps. Emily also wears a grey skirt with navy-blue ankle-length leggings underneath and fuchsia sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 4 - Emily wears a grey hoodie over a red-and-white striped shirt. She also wears navy-blue pants and red sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.RelationshipsFamilyHer parents are Mr. and Mrs. Jones.Her grandmother was one of the Five Sisters. A former elf, she became mortal when she moved to Earth in order to protect the portal from that side.Emily Jones has a little sister, Sophie Jones, with whom she gets angry at for jumping into the portal in \\"The Capture.\\" Her sister Sophie is mischievous, disobeying, and someone who obviously goes against orders. Emily loves her family nonetheless, through-and-through.Skyra, Quartzine, and the fire and water sister (the four remaining Five Sisters) are Emily's great aunts. They were Emily's grandmother's sisters.Emily and Cronan are also related (Cronan's mother and Emily's grandmother were sisters.) In specific terms, they are first cousins once removed.FriendsEmily's closest friends are Azari, Naida, Farran and Aira. She sympathyses with Skyra, having gone through loss herself. In Season 2, Emily became friends with Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch, as well as a number of dragons. In Season 3, Rosalyn Nightshade is on friendly terms with Emily. She meets Lumia in Season 4, who becomes a valuable ally.Azari Firedancer - A fierce fire elf, Azari is the first friend whom Emily had met upon arriving in Elvendale for the very first time. In \\"Unite the Magic,\\" Azari was shown to be friendly and outgoing to Emily, which Emily deeply appreciated. Azari is someone who Emily can really open up to, because just like Emily, Azari is fun-loving and adventurous. At the same time, Azari is someone who Emily can easily get frustrated over, due to Azari's irresponsible ways. Underneath her rough personality, she is also considerate and kind, and Emily has a great connection with her.Farran Leafshade - As the second person Emily meets in Elvendale, and the only male character of the main five, Farran is a reliable and well-grounded earth elf. Emily looks past his tendency to show-off, according to \\"Crib Notes\\", and cares for him nonetheless. Farran helped Emily up from a rainbow bridge in \\"Crushing it\\", which Emily appeared to be grateful for. Farran portrayed the most awkwardness of how he felt with the \\"strangeness\\" of the shape and size of Emily's human ears when first encountering her. His reaction to Emily's ears appears to be from Farran's brutally honest personality, to which Emily showed little discomfort with. Blunt and fair, Farran is someone Emily can trust, and does trust, as shown on many occasions.Aira Windwhistler - Carefree, air-headed, and lighthearted, Aira is a somewhat absent-minded wind elf. Silly, fun, and quick to speak her mind, Aira is someone that Emily can depend on, even though Aira has her head in the clouds most of the time. Aira is fun-loving, energetic, and free-spirited, to which Emily has no dismay over.Naida Riverheart - Naida is more shown to be well-collected, organized, and a bit more serious than her friends. Naida is very wise, which Emily seems to admire. Emily often chats with Naida about important issues, such as combining their magic together, according to \\"Never Cave.\\" Ever the supportive friend, Emily encourages Naida to let loose and step outside of her comfort zone. Because of their close bond, Naida thinks of Emily as a sister and will stand by her no matter what.Tidus Stormsurfer - A soulful water elf, Tidus met Emily in the second story-arc. In Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave, Tidus is a big help to Emily and the elves, being very knowledgeable about dragons and how they stopped trusting elves due to a certain witch elf. Emily seems to admire this, along with Azari, Naida and Aira. Emily has no problem talking with Tidus, as he will always listen, and be very understanding.Sira Copperbranch - A friend of Emily's who she met through Tidus. Sira is bold, strong-willed, and straightforward, which appear to be qualities Emily likes about her. Being a girl of many passions, Sira's not one to judge Emily on her human-like appearance nor comment on it or question it.Skyra - Someone who appears unkind and scornful at first, Emily shows her the power of love again, healing Skyra's heart from her mourning over Emily's grandmother. Emily and her friends now give Skyra friendly visits from time to time.Elandra - Emily's bonded dragon is the Queen Dragon, Elandra, whose element or power is Love. A symbol of love, Emily loves Elandra with all her heart, to which Elandra feels the same for Emily.Rosalyn - Introduced in the third story-arc, Rosalyn is a healer elf who teams up with Emily and the elves to thwart The Goblin King's plans.Lumia - Introduced in the fourth story arc, when in her eagle, and possibly wolf form, Lumia serves as one of the Elemental Guardians, representing Emily's creature.EnemiesEmily's greatest enemy has to be Ragana, who sports a very cold and devious personality towards Emily. In \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" Ragana was quick to judge and mock Emily's human appearance, even calling her ears \\"nasty.\\" Though powerful, Emily was able to amplify the other 4 elves' magic with her amulet, and temporarily weaken Ragana. Although it doesn't take long for Ragana to regain her strength, as she quickly appears in full elf form again in the webisodes. Emily and Ragana clearly have polar-opposite personalities - Ragana is evil and cruel, very different compared to Emily's kind and loving, gentle nature.In the third story arc, she meets Cronan Darkroot, the Goblin King, an evil elf who captured her little sister, Sophie Jones. She didn't know that he was related to her at the time, as Emily did not yet know that Cronan's mother was her grandmother's sister. They were also unaware of his identity as the Goblin King. As a result, for a brief while, Cronan pretended to befriend Emily in order to steal her amulet.In the fourth story arc Emily goes up against Noctura, an ancient evil who resides in the Shadow World. Noctura plots to capture the elemental guardians in order to harness the magic of their jewels. If she succeeds, Elvendale will become a dark and magic-less place, for the guardians' jewels are the source of all elemental magic in the land.RomanceEmily hasn't had crushes or love interests up to this date. Aira, however, gets jealous when Farran helps Emily to her feet in \\"Crushing It.\\" According to Emily, though, the whole hand-holding business meant nothing. In the season 2 special, \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" it appears, much to Farran's belief that Tidus was flirting with Emily, little to the knowledge of Tidus' loyalty to and love for Sira.SetsThe Elves' Treetop HideawaySkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleEmily Jones and the Baby Wind DragonFire Dragon's Lava CaveQueen Dragon's RescueAira's Airship and the Amulet ChaseBreakout from the Goblin King's FortressEmily Jones and the Eagle GetawayEmily and Noctura's ShowdownTriviaEmily's name starts with an E, as do Elandra and Estari's names. All three of them are connected to the element of love/light. Love/light can be considered as the fifth element, and E is the fifth letter of the alphabet.The name \\"Emily\\" and its variations means \\"a hardworking, diligent and industrious person\\". This best describes Emily, as she has been shown to be a creative thinker when giving her friends the idea to make their own clothes in Hairy Styles. She also works hard to protect Earth and Elvendale, as well as her family and friends, from evil forces.Emily's grandmother was immortal while she lived in Elvendale. However, when she moved to Earth, she became mortal like the rest of the humans. Even so, it can be argued that her granddaughter, Emily, is 1/4 elf.Emily most likely plays the guitar, since there is a guitar in her room. There is also a second guitar in the attic in a box of Emily's childhood toys. The guitar was likely child-sized and she outgrew it.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Emily says in season 4 that her amulet is the only thing she has left of her grandmother. This must mean that she no longer has her grandmother's shirt that she wore throughout season 2. This also raises the question of what happened to the figurines of the elemental creatures in the attic, as well as the book with the prophecy in it and the Noctura doll.Based upon the fourth season, Emily's connection to Lumia and Light suggests that the fifth element of Love might be related to or is also the element of Light. This is similar to how Air and Wind are interchangeable as titles for one of the main four elements.Emily kept the stick her friends gave her in Another Kind Of Magic. It can be seen on her desk in Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.Azari is mainly the only one who calls Emily by the nickname \\"Em.\\" However, in the Quest for the Keys novel, it says that Emily's grandmother also used to call her \\"Em\\" sometimes.Emily's exact age is never mentioned, but she is definitely a teenager. One description says: \\"Armed with a powerful amulet, a teenage guardian is tasked with protecting her little sister -- and all of Elvendale.\\"Emily is connected to the light element and has had psychic dreams and visions. Apollo, the god of the sun, is also the god of prophecy.The novels reveal a handful of details about Emily, such as:Emily sings in her school choir. Her grandmother never missed a performance and always clapped the loudest.Emily had at least one human friend at her school. Once, this friend told another girl one of Emily's secrets. This hurt Emily, but they made up soon after.Emily knows the scientific names of many plants, which were taught to her by her scientist parents. Her favourites are Antirrhinum (snapdragons.)The S1 app contains bios for the main 5, which are mostly identical to the website bios. There are a few differences though. Emily's app bio says that facets of her personality are similar to each of her 4 friends, but for some reason, that part wasn't included in her website bio.|Mrs. Jones is Emily Jones and Sophie Jones's mother, and wife to Mr. Jones.ContentsAd: (7)Skip AdBackgroundAfter Emily's grandmother passed away, Mrs. Jones consoled her daughter by giving her her grandmother's locket, which she always kept on her. This led to Emily discovering the portal to Elvendale. After Emily returned from her adventures in Elvendale, Mrs. Jones told her that dinner was ready, revealing the fact that time functioned differently in Elvendale.PersonalityAccording to the book Quest for the Keys, both Mr. and Mrs. Jones are scientists who don’t believe in magic, though they are amused by Emily’s imagination.AppearanceMrs. Jones has blonde hair and a fair complexion.The only time we see her she wears a short sleeved, dark magenta shirt, a short, blue-grey skirt and semi-opaque dark grey tights.RelationshipsShe is married to Mr. Jones.Emily and Sophie are her daughters.TriviaIt is unknown, as of now, whether Emily's grandmother is Mr. or Mrs. Jones' mother.

Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Naida the water elf is an adventurer at heart. She is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Izdur Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group.Powers: Controls bodies of water: the sea, lakes and waterfalls.Strengths: Confident, helpful, nurturing and wise.Flaws: Daydreamer, a bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times.Skills: She controls water and has a special relationship with all water animals; she is quite powerful for her age. She can make others feel special.Favorite things: Adventures, maps, friendship, animals and board games, sailing and spending time in the spa.Did you know: Naida lives by the water in her houseboat, and sometimes she stays in an old beautiful spa, where her friend Delphia the dolphin lives.LEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from a LEGO magazine. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Quiet, shy and patient she may be, but don’t be fooled, Naida has depths like the sea. She’s an adventurer and a wanderer at heart, and ready to sail in search of the Keys! She’s wise, self-assured and, of all the elves, is the most confident in her powers. She can even walk on water!Loves: board games and mapsHates: being dry!BackgroundNaida has known Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, and Aira Windwhistler since they were young (or, in Naida's terms \\"teeny tiny kids.\\"). She has known Ragana since then, but was never on close terms with her, especially since Ragana turned to dark magic. Naida first appeared in \\"Unite The Magic\\", and has been main character in LEGO Elves ever since.Shortly after meeting Emily, Naida teamed up with Farran, Aira, and Azari to help get Emily back home. Naida helped them retrieve the water key. After finding all the keys and helping Skyra overcome her grief, Emily was able to use the portal and return to earth. Emily now visits frequently and the five are the best of friends.PersonalityNaida might be a little more reserved than her friends, but when encouraged to, she will let loose and join in the fun. She seems to have stage fright, feeling uncomfortable with dancing in front of her friends, or talking in front of a camera. Naida doesn't seem to have as much thirst for adventure as her friends, avoiding scary situations that can potentially lead to danger (such as exploring a cave.) Although she might prefer to spend time at her relaxing and peaceful spa, Naida would never let a little thing like fear stop her, and won't hesitate to go on a mission.AppearanceNaida has aqua hair with a dark blue gradient which she leaves long and flowing. A braid goes across the top of her head, as a headband would. She also has aqua eyes, a light complexion, and one facial tattoo – a white, water-themed mark on her cheek. On her shoulder is the water insignia (a crescent-shaped wave). She also wears a swirling blue crown on her forehead.Note: Even when they were young Azari, Aira, Farran, and Naida had their cheek and arm tattoos. The girls’ forehead crowns, however, appear to be absent.Season 1 – Much like her hair, Naida’s dress is mostly aqua, with some darker blue accents on the bodice. The top part of her outfit has thin straps and resembles a halter top, while the skirt part has a gauzy, flowing overlay with a translucent pale-blue fabric. For footwear, she wears aqua sandals with blue seashells on the straps. In terms of accessories, she sports an aqua wrist-cuff on one arm.Season 2 – Naida wears a deep-blue dress. It is sleeveless, although one side of it extends towards the shoulder, giving the illusion of a one-shoulder dress. Again, a gossamer material flows around the skirt part of her outfit. A crescent-shaped wave is printed at the waist, while aqua swirls and white bubbles decorate the bodice. She wears deep blue sandals.Season 3 – Naida’s outfit is mainly turquoise. The bodice swoops down into a V-neck, to reveal another fabric in a darker shade of blue. A piece of dark-blue fabric can also been seen peeking out from the folds of her skirt. A silver necklace with conjoining circles and swirls completes the look. She also wears turquoise sandals with silver straps.Season 4 - The upper-half of Naida's shirt is turquoise, while the lower-half of her shirt is an extremely pale shade of blue. There is a piece of navy-blue material covering one of her shoulders with the water insignia on it. Attached to his shoulder-pad is a thin strip of navy-blue material that crosses her torso diagonally.

She is introduced in the fourth season story-arc, and is one of the Elemental Guardians. It is unknown if she has a jewel or not, but regardless, she is the Guardian of Light.ContentsAd: (9)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Lumia is one of the oldest elves in Elvendale and the Guardian of Light. She always chooses her words carefully and her ancient wisdom and faith help her keep the magic of Elvendale balanced. She is a shapeshifter and can transform into a white wolf or a delicate bird. When she meets Emily, she has already learned much more about her than anyone realizes. She quickly becomes Emily’s protector and teacher in the art of magic. Lumia lives in the Elvenstar Tree and guards the portal to the Shadow World where she banished Noctura to almost a thousand years ago. Now, it seems, this portal may no longer be the only one…BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia. Lumia created the Shadow World for Noctura to be banished to.PersonalityLumia is a humble, peaceful elf with a strong desire to protect Elvendale. She loves cheering people up, and will even tell a \\"little white lie\\" in order to make someone else happy.AppearanceLumia has long white hair tinged with gold at the ends, which she wears in a high ponytail. She also has blue-grey eyes, a golden-brown complexion, and a gold crown face tattoo with two blue jewels in it. There are three gold dots under each of her eyes. She also has a circular, white \\"Elf Tattoo\\" on one shoulder.Her sleeveless white shirt is decorated with gold designs. There is a thin piece of gold material that crosses her torso diagonally. Near the shoulder of this gold strap is a white, four-pointed star which seems to be a symbol for the four elemental crystals. Her skirt is also white, with a piece of gold fabric peeking out. To complete the look, she wears a pair of navy-blue boots.As an eagle, Lumia has predominatly white feathers, with gold feathers on her chin. Her wings and tail are gold-feathered, and her talons are gold with white claws. On her back is a brown saddle with a seat for one person. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.As a wolf, Lumia grows to the size of Liska the earth fox and Rowan the fire lion, possibly larger. She has white fur and a long white tail tipped with gold. On her chest there is a gold panel decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inwards. When in wolf form, she appears to have a blue jewel on her forehead that may or may not be an elemental diamond for the light element.RelationshipsFriendsLumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.In season 4, Lumia becomes a valuable ally to Emily, Aira, Azari, Farran, and Naida. Lumia mentors Emily in particular, but she has also been shown to motivate Azari and advise Naida.Lumia appears to have a strong bond with her fellow guardians, Cory, Rowan, Cyclo and Liska. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known them since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Lumia considers them to be more like family.SetsEmily Jones and the Eagle Getaway (Eagle form)Aira and the Song of the Wind Dragon (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Wolf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Elf form)TriviaThe name \\"Lumia\\" means \\"snow,\\" but it can also be related to the word \\"luminous.\\" This could be referencing both her snow-white hair, as well as her role as the Guardian of Light. Also, in French, the word for \\"wolf\\" is \\"loup,\\" which sounds like the first syllable of Lumia's name.It can be argued that Lumia is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.A magazine states that Lumia can transform into an eagle and other creatures. The pluralization of \\"creatures\\" implies that Lumia can transform into at least one other animal aside from a wolf and an eagle.Noctura has been plotting her revenge for the last thousand years. Since Lumia was the one who banished Noctura to the Shadow World, Lumia must also be over a thousand years old.Although not technically a werewolf, Lumia seems to share the characteristics of one, while Noctura has the similarities of a vampire. Werewolves and vampires are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.In Greek Mythology, Apollo is the god of the sun. One of Apollo's sacred animals is the wolf. Apollo is also the god of music and prophecy. Lumia appears to be involved with the music school on the Windswept Isles, and \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" seems to be a prophecy of sorts.Lumia owns a crystal ball, which can be seen in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack. Crystal balls are typically used for prophecies, fortune-telling, and seeing the future.One of Apollo's symbols is the lyre. In a product animation video of the music school, Lumia is shown playing a harp-like instrument.Apollo is also the god of healing. As shown in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack, Lumia owns a jar that says HEAL on it in runes.It appears that Lumia has known the other guardians since they were very young. In the LEGO set \\"The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack,\\" there is a sticker that shows Lumia with Cyclo and Rowan when they were little. There is also another picture of Liska and Cory when they were younger.In the webisode \\"The Shadow World Part 3\\", Lumia used her light magic to destroy herself while hugging Noctura, making them the first and only permanent deaths to occur during the LEGO Elves timeline, while Quartzine and Emily's grandmother died before the series took place.She likes eating pie. (She is shown eating a pie slice in official artwork for \\"Emily Jones and the Eagle Getaway\\").|Skyra is a wind elf who resides in Elvendale. She, along with Emily, are the two guardians of the portal, and is one of the legendary Five Sisters.ContentsAd: (26)2Official BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)She is the Wind Elf of the mythological five sisters that brought magic into the Elven world.Personality: She is modest and a little sentimental because she misses her sisters. She tends to be controlled by her emotions: when she is happy, she is open and welcoming and even her castle lights up; when she is unhappy, everything shuts down and she will not listen to anyone. Because of her bond with Emily, she is willing to help the team a lot – but if she didn’t know them, she might not.Strengths: Her magic is incredibly strong but not as strong as her mind. She can do anything she sets her mind to and is very world wise. She is modest and hides how powerful and smart she really is. A very strategic thinker, but when emotions get in her way, a darker and more wicked side will show.Flaws: She is a bit too stubborn and if she is badly hurt, she will turn her back to the world and unintentionally seem mean (“evil”). Can be socially awkward.Skills: She is not one to show off, but her wisdom and magic powers are incredible. She is one of the oldest elves in the world – and perhaps the strongest.Favorite things: Golden Glow (her Pegasus), family, great heights, singing, everything white, riddles, staying at home, listening to stories.PersonalitySkyra seems rather cold and heartless, but she really just misses her sister, Emily's grandmother. When given the chance, she is really kind and caring. Being one of the eldest in the world, she is very wise and can help others when she wants. But she almost always likes to have her way, and can be a little stubborn about it. She has few friends, but is always willing to help Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, as they are friends of Emily. She is often imperious and scornful, but lenient toward Emily, her sister's granddaughter.AppearanceMost of Skyra’s lavender hair is worn up in a bun, with the exception of two spiraling tendrils on either side of her face. She also has deep-blue eyes, a light complexion, and a swirling gold crown on her forehead.Skyra habitually wears a white, long-sleeved dress with swirling gold accents. A pair of golden wings extends from either side of her head, while voluminous tufts of white feathers adorn her shoulders. Her ever-present gold staff is topped with a blue jewel. She also dons a long, deep-purple cape.RelationshipsFamilyEmily's grandmother and Quartzine were her sisters, as well as unnamed fire and water elves.Cronan is her nephew.She is Emily and Sophie's great aunt.Richard was her brother-in-law.FriendsSkyra is acquainted with Emily Jones, her grand-niece, as well as Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, Naida Riverheart and Farran Leafshade. She is on good terms with them, especially when they needed her help for the Elvendale Ball in \\"Hairy Styles.\\"Golden Glow and Nascha are Skyra’s animal companions.SetsSkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleTriviaIt can be argued that Skyra is the villain of Season 1, as she was originally cruel to Emily, condemning her to a life trapped in Elvendale. In the book \\"Quest for the Keys,\\" Skyra actually attacks Emily and the elves with hurricanes. She also uses her wind powers to levitate vines in an attempt to attack them.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Her name comes from the word \\"sky.\\" According to some sources, \\"Skyra\\" means eternal life, strength, love and beauty, which could be referencing to her immortality, powerful wind magic, her love for her sisters and her young appearance despite her age.|Ragana is an elven witch who resides in Elvendale. She was introduced in the second mini-movie, Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.ContentsAd: (14)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)The Elf Witch is a fire elf born with very weak magic powers. She felt left out and alone and instead of training she learned how to boost her magic using other means. This started her on a dark path. Her mood she change from cool cunning to raging temper just like that. She will say or do anything to get her way.Strengths: Calculating, persuasive, thrives in her own company, strong-willed.Flaws: Deceitful, cynical, fiery tempered, willful, immoral, power hungry.Skills: Magic powers beyond any elf, but her powers are not connected to any element. She can manipulate most objects however not in a “natural” way like the elves.Favorite things: Precious stones, crystals, dragons, magic objects - and dragon EGGS!Did you know: Her cat, Jynx, is the only magical creature who knows Ragana – and still wants to spend time with her…BackgroundRagana had weak fire powers as a child. She was so afraid of being laughed at that she was easily tempted by the Shadow Fountain's promise of instant, immense power. Instead of working hard like the others, she drank from the Shadow Fountain's waters. Her magic is now connected to darkness, and her hunger for power makes her seek control of the dragons of Elvendale.PersonalityAs a child, Ragana was sensitive to the teasing she received from her peers, and eventually grew to resent them. After drinking from the Shadow Fountain, she succumbed to her darkest desires, becoming cold and vicious. Ragana is only slightly kinder to her cat Jynx and her fox Dusti, often making them do anything she wants. She likes to have personal space, and hates sugary foods. Ragana may also be germophobic, as evidenced by the webisode \\"Change From Within.\\"AppearanceRagana’s long, magenta hair cascades down her back. She also has magenta eyes, a light complexion, and black, claw-like fingernails.Ragana most often wears a long black dress with a panel of lime-green scales running down the middle. It is sleeveless, although two thorny black cuffs around her upper-arms give the illusion of an off-the-shoulder dress. A green jewel decorates the center of her spiked, black headdress, while a second green jewel shines at her neck.In the webisode \\"One is More Fun,\\" Ragana can be seen wearing a black and green nightgown with a matching nightcap. Later, she is dressed in her Halloween costume, a bat-themed, black and green dress. Ragana also sports a pair of large, bat-like fairy wings on her back. To complete the look, she dons elbow-length gloves that are black and green, and carries a black staff topped with a green skull.Ragana temporarily underwent a makeover in her attempt to be more approachable and friendly in the webisode ''Change from Within.\\" The dress she wore was red, trimmed with fuchsia at the bottom hem. Fuchsia swirls on the bodice formed a heart-like shape. A pink bow completed the look. For a brief moment, she had her hair braided like Emily’s, but it was quickly undone.RelationshipsFriendsJynx and Dusti are Ragana's faithful animal companions.While not exactly friends, she and Cronan almost partnered up on \\"Evil Apprentice,\\" where villains team up for some wicked good fun. However, Ragana ultimately decided she was better off on her own.It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice. It is later revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura.EnemiesRagana despises Emily and her friends for thwarting her plans in \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave.\\" Emily, especially, is a nuisance - her sweet and friendly disposition annoys Ragana deeply.RomanceIt is likely that several goblins have a crush on Ragana. Fibblin faints in her presence during \\"Evil Apprentice” while Roblin stares at her dreamily.In her castle, she has a portrait of Tidus with a lipstick mark on it.SetsRagana's Magic Shadow CastleTriviaThe name \\"Ragana\\" means \\"witch\\" in both Lithuanian and Latvian.Ragana's last name is \\"Shadowflame\\". This was revealed in the Dragon Adventures activity book, which is the only known source to mention it.Ragana can instantly change her clothes using magic.According to Aira, Ragana never learned to use fire magic. Therefore, when fire magic was drained from Elvendale in season 4, Ragana was not affected - you can't lose something you never had.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for Ragana's corruption, most likely due to Noctura inhabiting the shadow fountain.During \\"Down a Dark Path,\\" Ragana creates a symbol in the air for Naida, which seems to be an orchid flower. Orchids are symbols of luxury, power, and perfection. This could be a reference to Ragana's motto: \\"Why rebrand perfection?\\"There used to be a species of moths called \\"Ragana.\\" There is a saying \\"like moths to a flame\\" because moths are attracted to heat and light. This is ironic since Ragana abandoned the fire element in favour of darkness.Ragana does not like cookies unless they are dunked in Shadow Water.Azari's season 2 shoulder marking matches the symbol on Ragana's Change From Within dress.|Noctura is a bat-themed shape-shifter elf who is introduced in the season four story-arc. She has a number of bat-minions who aid Noctura in her wicked schemes. This dark witch hails from the Shadow World.ContentsAd: (8)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Since the elf Noctura was banished from Elvendale to the Shadow World by Lumia, the Guardian of Light, she has spent her life planning her escape and revenge on Lumia. Finally, with the help of her loyal bat minions, she has managed to steal the four elemental shards from the four guardian statues. Now she just needs to capture all the four Elemental Guardians themselves and harness their powers. Before long, she will become stronger and more powerful than ever. Her time has finally come to break out of the Shadow World and rule all of Elvendale.BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia, and can now only speak through the waters of Shadow Fountain to Ragana. Supposedly, Lumia created the Shadow World as a \\"gift\\" for Noctura, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. Noctura has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as Noctura prepares to put her schemes into motion, Elvendale will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real.PersonalityNoctura is a vindictive villain who delights in wreaking havoc. For the last thousand years, she has been plotting her revenge, and is finally ready to take action. Her fiendish plans for Elvendale are to drain the world of its magic. This diabolical elf is determined to get her revenge, and claims that \\"death is coming on swift black wings.\\"AppearanceNoctura has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead.Her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom.RelationshipsFamilyNoctura calls her minions her children and considers herself their mother. This makes sense, since in a magazine, it mentions that Noctura actually created the shadow bats in her laboratory.FriendsIt is revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura. It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice.Lumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.SetsNoctura's Tower and the Earth Fox Rescue (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Elf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Bat form)TriviaThe name \\"Noctura\\" comes from the word \\"Nocturnal.\\" Bats are nocturnal creatures who sleep during the day and wake at night.It can be argued that it is Lumia, not Noctura, who is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.Noctura is the first minidoll from the LEGO Elves line to have two completely different coloured arms. One is the colour of her skin with some black printing at the shoulder, while the other is pure black.Noctura is over a thousand years old.The bats gave Noctura her carriage for her one thousandth birthday.Noctura doesn't like cats because they are \\"fickle, dishonest things.\\"Although not technically a vampire, Noctura seems to share the characteristics of one, while Lumia has the similarities of a werewolf. Vampires and werewolves are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for corrupting both Ragana and Cronan.She occasionally speaks in rhyme.It is questionable whether or not Noctura was able to shape-shift before she absorbed all the fire magic. The way she said “weave me wings\\" to escape gives the impression that it was only possible after she gained the fire magic.The LEGO Friends set Andrea's Theatre School features a poster of an elf that says \\"Best Musical WINNER.\\" The elf looks a lot like Noctura though has dark violet hair and a gold forehead circlet.|Elvendale is a magical world inhabited mainly by elves. This realm is also home to dragons, pegasi, and other mystical creatures. It is the main location of the LEGO Elves series. After inheriting her grandmother's amulet, a portal appeared before Emily Jones, and she found herself in this wondrous dimension. With the help of Azari Firedancer, Farran Leafshade, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, she was able to get back home to Earth.

Most of the buildings here are smaller than average, to accommodate the goblins' short statures.Mr. Spry's ShopNestled in a forest clearing is Mr. Spry's Shop.

In Celtic Mythology, oak trees are associated with immortality. In the ancient Celtic language, the word for oak tree is “duir” which is also the word for “door.”The portal that leads from Elvendale to Earth is located at Sky Castle. In order for this portal to work, all four elemental keys are required, as well as Skyra and her staff.In the series finale, Emily is able to open the tree portal to get home and doesn't need to go to Skyra's. It is unknown if this is a result of Emily's new light magic or if it's just an inconsistency with season 4.TriviaAstronomyThere is a globe with at least 5 continents on it at the elementary school. This means that the world of Elvendale is likely a spherical planet, similar to Earth.Elvendale has at least one moon and a constellation of a dragon.Lumia has a star chart of the Sagittarius constellation at the Elvenstar Tree.

She’s confident, charismatic, friendly and VERY chill. She has no patience for hero worship, though. When she first meets Farran, he is completely star-struck and flabbergasted. So Liska’s first task in her bonding with Farran is to get him grounded, so to speak… She can be a little impulsive, but her protective instincts tend to kick in when she’s around Farran. This could be the beginning of a beautiful, magical friendship.AppearanceLiska is similar in stature to Rowan the fire lion and Lumia in wolf form. She is mostly lime green, with purple and gold detailing. She has what appear to be purple leaves at her leg joints. Unlike other foxes, Liska has three tails.Attached to Liska's back is a brown saddle with one seat. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.RelationshipsFamilyIn Lights Out, when talking to Cory about Liska and Rowan, Cyclo says that they must bring back their brother and sister. This would mean that Cory, Rowan, Cyclo, and Liska are siblings. Bios mention that Cory is the oldest and Liska is the youngest.FriendsIn Chill, Liska is initially put-off by Farran's star-struck rambling, but they soon move past it and bond.Liska also appears to be close with Lumia. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known her since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Liska considers her to be more like family.TriviaThe name \\"Liska\\" means \\"fox\\" in Czech.She is the only fox so far to have three tails. Liska may be based on a kitsune, a mythical fox-creature that has a varying number of tails depending on its age. The maximum number of tails a kitsune can have is nine.Liska can talk, but it is unknown if only earth elves can understand her, or if all elves and humans can.This is similar to Cory, Cyclo, and Rowan.She likes peanuts. This is mentioned by Farran and Lumia.Liska used the Quake Shield to defend against the demon hordes of Zaikuda in the Battle of the Endless Forest. It is unknown if \\"Zaikuda\\" is the name of a person or a place, but \\"Kuda\\" means \\"king/lord/master.\\" (Note: Spelling of Zaikuda may not be exact.)|Calypso is a baby sea turtle who gets along with Naida and Cory. She is featured in one LEGO set, Naida and the Water Turtle Ambush.TriviaThe name \\"Calypso\\" means \\"to hide.\\" This is fitting for a turtle, since they hide in their shells. In Greek Mythology, Calypso was a nymph who was trapped on an island in the middle of the ocean.|Cory is a wise, giant sea turtle who is one of the Elemental Guardians. She has the water-jewel on her forehead, which Noctura wants to collect. This jewel is the source of all water-magic in Elvendale.ContentsUnmuteAdvanced SettingsFullscreenPauseUp NextOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Cory the Guardian Water Turtle is the oldest of the ancient elemental creatures. The Turtle is wise, but she can be relentless, stubborn and demanding. She doesn’t always understand that other creatures, magical or otherwise, do not have the same years of life experience as she does. She has very little patience with people who, in her eyes, are too naïve or forgiving. She’s never afraid to make hard decisions where others can’t. Her only weakness is her fear of spiders, but she would rather die than admit that to anyone!AppearanceCory has aqua coloured scales and a dark azure blue shell with gold detailing.Attached to Cory's shell is a brown saddle with one seat.

Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known her since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Cory considers her to be more like family.TriviaThe name \\"Cory\\" means \\"seething pool.\\" This is fitting for a sea-creature. The name \\"Cory\\" can also mean \\"dweller in a hollow.\\" This could be referencing that turtles dwell in their hollow shells.Her name may also be an abbreviation of coral.Cory can talk, but it is unknown if only water elves can understand her, or if all elves and humans can.This is similar to Cyclo, Liska, and Rowan.Cory seems to be very carnivorous - she offered to eat Emily for Naida.Lumia is aware of Cory's fear of spiders.

TEXT: Lego Elves, a Lego product line produced by The Lego Group that was launched in 2015.[2][3] It was accompanied by the Lego Elves animated television series and webisode series that began with a mini-movie titled Unite The Magic, which was released on the Lego YouTube channel, and on Netflix. The product line was based on the storyline of the animated series, which follows the adventures of a character named Emily Jones who travels to a magical land called Elvendale. The theme aimed to introduce a fantasy element to girl-focused Lego products. It was eventually discontinued by 2019.ContentsOverviewThe Lego Elves theme was underpinned by the storyline of its accompanying animated television series titled Lego Elves and Lego Elves: Secrets of Elvendale. Both the Lego toy line and the animated series targeted the girls market. The series focuses on a human girl named Emily Jones, who inherits a magical amulet from her grandmother and travels through a portal to a magical realm called Elvendale. The storyline relates how she meets four elves with elemental powers (fire, earth, air and water) who help her to return home.[4][5]DevelopmentFollowing the success of Lego Friends and Lego Disney Princess, The Lego Group aimed to launch another Lego theme targeted at the girls market. In contrast to the contemporary setting of Lego Friends, Lego Elves aimed to introduce a fantasy setting into girl-focused Lego toys. The theme was developed after testing several story ideas with girls around the world.[6]LaunchThe Lego Elves theme was announced on 12 February 2015 at the American International Toy Fair. The toy line began with the release of eight toy construction sets that introduced the main elves and their home environments and these began to launch in March 2015.[7] An official teaser for the animated series was released on the Lego YouTube channel on 15 December 2014.[8] This was followed by the release of a trailer on 19 February 2015.[9]CharactersMainEmily Jones (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) is the protagonist, a resourceful, modest, amicable, and affectionate human girl, whose \\"element\\" is \\"love\\".[10][11]Azari Firedancer (voiced by Erin Mathews) is a fire elf who is spontaneous, extroverted, loud, sometimes reckless, and usually cheerful.[12][13]Farran Leafshade (voiced by Kyle Rideout) is an earth elf who is honest, loyal, reliable, and slightly self-important and has a crush on Aira.[14][15]Aira Windwhistler (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) is a wind elf who is good-natured, excitable, light-hearted and whose favourite pastime is the construction of machines.[16][17]Naida Riverheart (voiced by Erin Mathews) is a water elf who is patient, modest, slightly shy, but courageous.[18][19]HumansSophie Jones (voiced by Rebecca Husain) is Emily's younger sister who is captured by the Goblin King as bait to lure Emily to him.[20][21]Mrs. Jones (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) is Emily and Sophie's mother.[22]Mr. Jones is Emily's father.ElvesSkyra (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) is a wind elf and formal guardian of the portal between Elvendale and the human world.

She was chosen to go to earth and guard the portal from that side. In doing so, she lost her immortality, and eventually passed away.Shortly after inheriting her grandmother's amulet, Emily found herself transported through the portal to Elvendale. With the help of four elves, Naida Riverheart, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler and Farran Leafshade, she got back home safely. She now often visits them in Elvendale.PersonalityEmily is a happy, music-loving human girl with a passion for having fun, hanging out, or just having an adventure. She is kind, sweet, and amicable. Emily is friendly and empathetic to the very core, and loves making friends, which is why she gets along so well with the four elves, Naida, Azari, Farran and Aira. She doesn't have trouble with people easily, human or elf, and has a special connection with almost everyone she comes across. Azari, Farran, Aira, and Naida, or more simply, the elves or four elves, are great friends with Emily, and enjoy her company. Her personality is also sweet enough to fit Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch into it.AppearanceEmily has dark brown hair, which she wears in a braid. She also has olive-green eyes, a fair complexion, and freckles.Season 1 - Emily wears a sleeveless white shirt with dark blue stripes, denim jean shorts, and yellow sneakers with white soles, laces and toes. In the artwork of Season 1, she wears this outfit, but also wears a set of blue, orange, purple, and green bracelets. She also wears her teleporting amulet or medallion. The amulet is blue in the middle and usually shines or glows. The rest of it is silver.Season 2 - Emily wears a dark-blue tank top that fades to white at the bottom, light brown khaki shorts and red high-top sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 3 - Emily wears an off-the-shoulder, short-sleeved shirt that is white with grey stripes. Underneath this, she wears a tank-top with fuchsia straps. Emily also wears a grey skirt with navy-blue ankle-length leggings underneath and fuchsia sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.Season 4 - Emily wears a grey hoodie over a red-and-white striped shirt. She also wears navy-blue pants and red sneakers with white soles, laces and toes.RelationshipsFamilyHer parents are Mr. and Mrs. Jones.Her grandmother was one of the Five Sisters. A former elf, she became mortal when she moved to Earth in order to protect the portal from that side.Emily Jones has a little sister, Sophie Jones, with whom she gets angry at for jumping into the portal in \\"The Capture.\\" Her sister Sophie is mischievous, disobeying, and someone who obviously goes against orders. Emily loves her family nonetheless, through-and-through.Skyra, Quartzine, and the fire and water sister (the four remaining Five Sisters) are Emily's great aunts. They were Emily's grandmother's sisters.Emily and Cronan are also related (Cronan's mother and Emily's grandmother were sisters.) In specific terms, they are first cousins once removed.FriendsEmily's closest friends are Azari, Naida, Farran and Aira. She sympathyses with Skyra, having gone through loss herself. In Season 2, Emily became friends with Tidus Stormsurfer and Sira Copperbranch, as well as a number of dragons. In Season 3, Rosalyn Nightshade is on friendly terms with Emily. She meets Lumia in Season 4, who becomes a valuable ally.Azari Firedancer - A fierce fire elf, Azari is the first friend whom Emily had met upon arriving in Elvendale for the very first time. In \\"Unite the Magic,\\" Azari was shown to be friendly and outgoing to Emily, which Emily deeply appreciated. Azari is someone who Emily can really open up to, because just like Emily, Azari is fun-loving and adventurous. At the same time, Azari is someone who Emily can easily get frustrated over, due to Azari's irresponsible ways. Underneath her rough personality, she is also considerate and kind, and Emily has a great connection with her.Farran Leafshade - As the second person Emily meets in Elvendale, and the only male character of the main five, Farran is a reliable and well-grounded earth elf. Emily looks past his tendency to show-off, according to \\"Crib Notes\\", and cares for him nonetheless. Farran helped Emily up from a rainbow bridge in \\"Crushing it\\", which Emily appeared to be grateful for. Farran portrayed the most awkwardness of how he felt with the \\"strangeness\\" of the shape and size of Emily's human ears when first encountering her. His reaction to Emily's ears appears to be from Farran's brutally honest personality, to which Emily showed little discomfort with. Blunt and fair, Farran is someone Emily can trust, and does trust, as shown on many occasions.Aira Windwhistler - Carefree, air-headed, and lighthearted, Aira is a somewhat absent-minded wind elf. Silly, fun, and quick to speak her mind, Aira is someone that Emily can depend on, even though Aira has her head in the clouds most of the time. Aira is fun-loving, energetic, and free-spirited, to which Emily has no dismay over.Naida Riverheart - Naida is more shown to be well-collected, organized, and a bit more serious than her friends. Naida is very wise, which Emily seems to admire. Emily often chats with Naida about important issues, such as combining their magic together, according to \\"Never Cave.\\" Ever the supportive friend, Emily encourages Naida to let loose and step outside of her comfort zone. Because of their close bond, Naida thinks of Emily as a sister and will stand by her no matter what.Tidus Stormsurfer - A soulful water elf, Tidus met Emily in the second story-arc. In Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave, Tidus is a big help to Emily and the elves, being very knowledgeable about dragons and how they stopped trusting elves due to a certain witch elf. Emily seems to admire this, along with Azari, Naida and Aira. Emily has no problem talking with Tidus, as he will always listen, and be very understanding.Sira Copperbranch - A friend of Emily's who she met through Tidus. Sira is bold, strong-willed, and straightforward, which appear to be qualities Emily likes about her. Being a girl of many passions, Sira's not one to judge Emily on her human-like appearance nor comment on it or question it.Skyra - Someone who appears unkind and scornful at first, Emily shows her the power of love again, healing Skyra's heart from her mourning over Emily's grandmother. Emily and her friends now give Skyra friendly visits from time to time.Elandra - Emily's bonded dragon is the Queen Dragon, Elandra, whose element or power is Love. A symbol of love, Emily loves Elandra with all her heart, to which Elandra feels the same for Emily.Rosalyn - Introduced in the third story-arc, Rosalyn is a healer elf who teams up with Emily and the elves to thwart The Goblin King's plans.Lumia - Introduced in the fourth story arc, when in her eagle, and possibly wolf form, Lumia serves as one of the Elemental Guardians, representing Emily's creature.EnemiesEmily's greatest enemy has to be Ragana, who sports a very cold and devious personality towards Emily. In \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" Ragana was quick to judge and mock Emily's human appearance, even calling her ears \\"nasty.\\" Though powerful, Emily was able to amplify the other 4 elves' magic with her amulet, and temporarily weaken Ragana. Although it doesn't take long for Ragana to regain her strength, as she quickly appears in full elf form again in the webisodes. Emily and Ragana clearly have polar-opposite personalities - Ragana is evil and cruel, very different compared to Emily's kind and loving, gentle nature.In the third story arc, she meets Cronan Darkroot, the Goblin King, an evil elf who captured her little sister, Sophie Jones. She didn't know that he was related to her at the time, as Emily did not yet know that Cronan's mother was her grandmother's sister. They were also unaware of his identity as the Goblin King. As a result, for a brief while, Cronan pretended to befriend Emily in order to steal her amulet.In the fourth story arc Emily goes up against Noctura, an ancient evil who resides in the Shadow World. Noctura plots to capture the elemental guardians in order to harness the magic of their jewels. If she succeeds, Elvendale will become a dark and magic-less place, for the guardians' jewels are the source of all elemental magic in the land.RomanceEmily hasn't had crushes or love interests up to this date. Aira, however, gets jealous when Farran helps Emily to her feet in \\"Crushing It.\\" According to Emily, though, the whole hand-holding business meant nothing. In the season 2 special, \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave,\\" it appears, much to Farran's belief that Tidus was flirting with Emily, little to the knowledge of Tidus' loyalty to and love for Sira.SetsThe Elves' Treetop HideawaySkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleEmily Jones and the Baby Wind DragonFire Dragon's Lava CaveQueen Dragon's RescueAira's Airship and the Amulet ChaseBreakout from the Goblin King's FortressEmily Jones and the Eagle GetawayEmily and Noctura's ShowdownTriviaEmily's name starts with an E, as do Elandra and Estari's names. All three of them are connected to the element of love/light. Love/light can be considered as the fifth element, and E is the fifth letter of the alphabet.The name \\"Emily\\" and its variations means \\"a hardworking, diligent and industrious person\\". This best describes Emily, as she has been shown to be a creative thinker when giving her friends the idea to make their own clothes in Hairy Styles. She also works hard to protect Earth and Elvendale, as well as her family and friends, from evil forces.Emily's grandmother was immortal while she lived in Elvendale. However, when she moved to Earth, she became mortal like the rest of the humans. Even so, it can be argued that her granddaughter, Emily, is 1/4 elf.Emily most likely plays the guitar, since there is a guitar in her room. There is also a second guitar in the attic in a box of Emily's childhood toys. The guitar was likely child-sized and she outgrew it.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Emily says in season 4 that her amulet is the only thing she has left of her grandmother. This must mean that she no longer has her grandmother's shirt that she wore throughout season 2. This also raises the question of what happened to the figurines of the elemental creatures in the attic, as well as the book with the prophecy in it and the Noctura doll.Based upon the fourth season, Emily's connection to Lumia and Light suggests that the fifth element of Love might be related to or is also the element of Light. This is similar to how Air and Wind are interchangeable as titles for one of the main four elements.Emily kept the stick her friends gave her in Another Kind Of Magic. It can be seen on her desk in Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.Azari is mainly the only one who calls Emily by the nickname \\"Em.\\" However, in the Quest for the Keys novel, it says that Emily's grandmother also used to call her \\"Em\\" sometimes.Emily's exact age is never mentioned, but she is definitely a teenager. One description says: \\"Armed with a powerful amulet, a teenage guardian is tasked with protecting her little sister -- and all of Elvendale.\\"Emily is connected to the light element and has had psychic dreams and visions. Apollo, the god of the sun, is also the god of prophecy.The novels reveal a handful of details about Emily, such as:Emily sings in her school choir. Her grandmother never missed a performance and always clapped the loudest.Emily had at least one human friend at her school. Once, this friend told another girl one of Emily's secrets. This hurt Emily, but they made up soon after.Emily knows the scientific names of many plants, which were taught to her by her scientist parents. Her favourites are Antirrhinum (snapdragons.)The S1 app contains bios for the main 5, which are mostly identical to the website bios. There are a few differences though. Emily's app bio says that facets of her personality are similar to each of her 4 friends, but for some reason, that part wasn't included in her website bio.|Mrs. Jones is Emily Jones and Sophie Jones's mother, and wife to Mr. Jones.ContentsAd: (7)Skip AdBackgroundAfter Emily's grandmother passed away, Mrs. Jones consoled her daughter by giving her her grandmother's locket, which she always kept on her.

Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Naida the water elf is an adventurer at heart. She is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Izdur Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group.Powers: Controls bodies of water: the sea, lakes and waterfalls.Strengths: Confident, helpful, nurturing and wise.Flaws: Daydreamer, a bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times.Skills: She controls water and has a special relationship with all water animals; she is quite powerful for her age.

Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Quiet, shy and patient she may be, but don’t be fooled, Naida has depths like the sea. She’s an adventurer and a wanderer at heart, and ready to sail in search of the Keys! She’s wise, self-assured and, of all the elves, is the most confident in her powers. She can even walk on water!Loves: board games and mapsHates: being dry!BackgroundNaida has known Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, and Aira Windwhistler since they were young (or, in Naida's terms \\"teeny tiny kids.\\"). She has known Ragana since then, but was never on close terms with her, especially since Ragana turned to dark magic. Naida first appeared in \\"Unite The Magic\\", and has been main character in LEGO Elves ever since.Shortly after meeting Emily, Naida teamed up with Farran, Aira, and Azari to help get Emily back home. Naida helped them retrieve the water key. After finding all the keys and helping Skyra overcome her grief, Emily was able to use the portal and return to earth. Emily now visits frequently and the five are the best of friends.PersonalityNaida might be a little more reserved than her friends, but when encouraged to, she will let loose and join in the fun. She seems to have stage fright, feeling uncomfortable with dancing in front of her friends, or talking in front of a camera. Naida doesn't seem to have as much thirst for adventure as her friends, avoiding scary situations that can potentially lead to danger (such as exploring a cave.) Although she might prefer to spend time at her relaxing and peaceful spa, Naida would never let a little thing like fear stop her, and won't hesitate to go on a mission.AppearanceNaida has aqua hair with a dark blue gradient which she leaves long and flowing. A braid goes across the top of her head, as a headband would. She also has aqua eyes, a light complexion, and one facial tattoo – a white, water-themed mark on her cheek. On her shoulder is the water insignia (a crescent-shaped wave). She also wears a swirling blue crown on her forehead.Note: Even when they were young Azari, Aira, Farran, and Naida had their cheek and arm tattoos. The girls’ forehead crowns, however, appear to be absent.Season 1 – Much like her hair, Naida’s dress is mostly aqua, with some darker blue accents on the bodice. The top part of her outfit has thin straps and resembles a halter top, while the skirt part has a gauzy, flowing overlay with a translucent pale-blue fabric. For footwear, she wears aqua sandals with blue seashells on the straps. In terms of accessories, she sports an aqua wrist-cuff on one arm.Season 2 – Naida wears a deep-blue dress. It is sleeveless, although one side of it extends towards the shoulder, giving the illusion of a one-shoulder dress. Again, a gossamer material flows around the skirt part of her outfit. A crescent-shaped wave is printed at the waist, while aqua swirls and white bubbles decorate the bodice. She wears deep blue sandals.Season 3 – Naida’s outfit is mainly turquoise. The bodice swoops down into a V-neck, to reveal another fabric in a darker shade of blue. A piece of dark-blue fabric can also been seen peeking out from the folds of her skirt. A silver necklace with conjoining circles and swirls completes the look. She also wears turquoise sandals with silver straps.Season 4 - The upper-half of Naida's shirt is turquoise, while the lower-half of her shirt is an extremely pale shade of blue. There is a piece of navy-blue material covering one of her shoulders with the water insignia on it. Attached to his shoulder-pad is a thin strip of navy-blue material that crosses her torso diagonally. Her skirt is mainly turquoise, with a piece of pale blue fabric peeking out.RelationshipsFriendsNaida's closest friends are Emily, Azari, Aira, and Farran. She is acquainted with Skyra, and is also friendly with Sophie, Emily's little sister. In Season 2, Naida became friends with Tidus and Sira, as well as a number of dragons. In Season 3, Rosalyn and Naida originally didn't get along. After working out their differences, Rosalyn is now on good terms with Naida. She meets Lumia in Season 4, who becomes a valuable ally.Naida also has a bond with Merina the dragon and Cory the water guardian. Delphia is Naida’s animal companion.RomanceIn the extra Did you Miss us? webisode, Naida thinks Cronan is \\"dreamy,\\" and believes that there's still a bit of good left in him.SetsNaida's Spa SecretNaida's Epic Adventure ShipSkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleThe Water Dragon AdventurePrecious Crystal MineRagana's Magic Shadow CastleNaida's Gondola and the Goblin ThiefRosalyn's Healing HideoutNaida and the Water Turtle AmbushThe Elvenstar Tree Bat AttackTriviaIn Greek, the name \\"Naida\\" means \\"water nymph.\\"Erin Mathews voices Azari, Naida, and the Shadow Fountain (and thus, Noctura as well.)On the box art for season 4 Naida wears her hair in a bun, however this is not carried through to the minidoll.Naida is much older than Emily. Due to their immortality, it's likely that the elves are a lot older than they look.As suggested in \\"Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave,\\" Naida seems to like foods that are organic, holistic, and sustainable.Naida is the only main character whose minidoll's facial expression has not changed.Naida is the only member of the main five who becomes a villain, albeit temporarily.According to Quest for the Keys, Naida has about a thousand different bedtime stories stored in her head that she can recite from memory.The book The Dragon Queen reveals that Naida gathers flowers and herbs to make lotions for her friends.According to the spa secret set description, she has a diary where she writes her thoughts and feelings.|Lumia is a shape-shifter elf who can transform into a variety of animals. She is introduced in the fourth season story-arc, and is one of the Elemental Guardians. It is unknown if she has a jewel or not, but regardless, she is the Guardian of Light.ContentsAd: (9)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Lumia is one of the oldest elves in Elvendale and the Guardian of Light. She always chooses her words carefully and her ancient wisdom and faith help her keep the magic of Elvendale balanced. She is a shapeshifter and can transform into a white wolf or a delicate bird. When she meets Emily, she has already learned much more about her than anyone realizes. She quickly becomes Emily’s protector and teacher in the art of magic. Lumia lives in the Elvenstar Tree and guards the portal to the Shadow World where she banished Noctura to almost a thousand years ago. Now, it seems, this portal may no longer be the only one…BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia. Lumia created the Shadow World for Noctura to be banished to.PersonalityLumia is a humble, peaceful elf with a strong desire to protect Elvendale. She loves cheering people up, and will even tell a \\"little white lie\\" in order to make someone else happy.AppearanceLumia has long white hair tinged with gold at the ends, which she wears in a high ponytail. She also has blue-grey eyes, a golden-brown complexion, and a gold crown face tattoo with two blue jewels in it. There are three gold dots under each of her eyes. She also has a circular, white \\"Elf Tattoo\\" on one shoulder.Her sleeveless white shirt is decorated with gold designs. There is a thin piece of gold material that crosses her torso diagonally. Near the shoulder of this gold strap is a white, four-pointed star which seems to be a symbol for the four elemental crystals. Her skirt is also white, with a piece of gold fabric peeking out. To complete the look, she wears a pair of navy-blue boots.As an eagle, Lumia has predominatly white feathers, with gold feathers on her chin. Her wings and tail are gold-feathered, and her talons are gold with white claws. On her back is a brown saddle with a seat for one person. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.As a wolf, Lumia grows to the size of Liska the earth fox and Rowan the fire lion, possibly larger. She has white fur and a long white tail tipped with gold. On her chest there is a gold panel decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inwards. When in wolf form, she appears to have a blue jewel on her forehead that may or may not be an elemental diamond for the light element.RelationshipsFriendsLumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.In season 4, Lumia becomes a valuable ally to Emily, Aira, Azari, Farran, and Naida. Lumia mentors Emily in particular, but she has also been shown to motivate Azari and advise Naida.Lumia appears to have a strong bond with her fellow guardians, Cory, Rowan, Cyclo and Liska. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known them since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Lumia considers them to be more like family.SetsEmily Jones and the Eagle Getaway (Eagle form)Aira and the Song of the Wind Dragon (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Wolf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Elf form)TriviaThe name \\"Lumia\\" means \\"snow,\\" but it can also be related to the word \\"luminous.\\" This could be referencing both her snow-white hair, as well as her role as the Guardian of Light. Also, in French, the word for \\"wolf\\" is \\"loup,\\" which sounds like the first syllable of Lumia's name.It can be argued that Lumia is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.A magazine states that Lumia can transform into an eagle and other creatures. The pluralization of \\"creatures\\" implies that Lumia can transform into at least one other animal aside from a wolf and an eagle.Noctura has been plotting her revenge for the last thousand years. Since Lumia was the one who banished Noctura to the Shadow World, Lumia must also be over a thousand years old.Although not technically a werewolf, Lumia seems to share the characteristics of one, while Noctura has the similarities of a vampire. Werewolves and vampires are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.In Greek Mythology, Apollo is the god of the sun. One of Apollo's sacred animals is the wolf. Apollo is also the god of music and prophecy. Lumia appears to be involved with the music school on the Windswept Isles, and \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" seems to be a prophecy of sorts.Lumia owns a crystal ball, which can be seen in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack. Crystal balls are typically used for prophecies, fortune-telling, and seeing the future.One of Apollo's symbols is the lyre. In a product animation video of the music school, Lumia is shown playing a harp-like instrument.Apollo is also the god of healing. As shown in The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack, Lumia owns a jar that says HEAL on it in runes.It appears that Lumia has known the other guardians since they were very young. In the LEGO set \\"The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack,\\" there is a sticker that shows Lumia with Cyclo and Rowan when they were little. There is also another picture of Liska and Cory when they were younger.In the webisode \\"The Shadow World Part 3\\", Lumia used her light magic to destroy herself while hugging Noctura, making them the first and only permanent deaths to occur during the LEGO Elves timeline, while Quartzine and Emily's grandmother died before the series took place.She likes eating pie. (She is shown eating a pie slice in official artwork for \\"Emily Jones and the Eagle Getaway\\").|Skyra is a wind elf who resides in Elvendale. She, along with Emily, are the two guardians of the portal, and is one of the legendary Five Sisters.ContentsAd: (26)2Official BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)She is the Wind Elf of the mythological five sisters that brought magic into the Elven world.Personality: She is modest and a little sentimental because she misses her sisters. She tends to be controlled by her emotions: when she is happy, she is open and welcoming and even her castle lights up; when she is unhappy, everything shuts down and she will not listen to anyone. Because of her bond with Emily, she is willing to help the team a lot – but if she didn’t know them, she might not.Strengths: Her magic is incredibly strong but not as strong as her mind. She can do anything she sets her mind to and is very world wise. She is modest and hides how powerful and smart she really is. A very strategic thinker, but when emotions get in her way, a darker and more wicked side will show.Flaws: She is a bit too stubborn and if she is badly hurt, she will turn her back to the world and unintentionally seem mean (“evil”). Can be socially awkward.Skills: She is not one to show off, but her wisdom and magic powers are incredible. She is one of the oldest elves in the world – and perhaps the strongest.Favorite things: Golden Glow (her Pegasus), family, great heights, singing, everything white, riddles, staying at home, listening to stories.PersonalitySkyra seems rather cold and heartless, but she really just misses her sister, Emily's grandmother. When given the chance, she is really kind and caring. Being one of the eldest in the world, she is very wise and can help others when she wants. But she almost always likes to have her way, and can be a little stubborn about it. She has few friends, but is always willing to help Farran Leafshade, Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, as they are friends of Emily. She is often imperious and scornful, but lenient toward Emily, her sister's granddaughter.AppearanceMost of Skyra’s lavender hair is worn up in a bun, with the exception of two spiraling tendrils on either side of her face. She also has deep-blue eyes, a light complexion, and a swirling gold crown on her forehead.Skyra habitually wears a white, long-sleeved dress with swirling gold accents. A pair of golden wings extends from either side of her head, while voluminous tufts of white feathers adorn her shoulders. Her ever-present gold staff is topped with a blue jewel. She also dons a long, deep-purple cape.RelationshipsFamilyEmily's grandmother and Quartzine were her sisters, as well as unnamed fire and water elves.Cronan is her nephew.She is Emily and Sophie's great aunt.Richard was her brother-in-law.FriendsSkyra is acquainted with Emily Jones, her grand-niece, as well as Azari Firedancer, Aira Windwhistler, Naida Riverheart and Farran Leafshade. She is on good terms with them, especially when they needed her help for the Elvendale Ball in \\"Hairy Styles.\\"Golden Glow and Nascha are Skyra’s animal companions.SetsSkyra's Mysterious Sky CastleTriviaIt can be argued that Skyra is the villain of Season 1, as she was originally cruel to Emily, condemning her to a life trapped in Elvendale. In the book \\"Quest for the Keys,\\" Skyra actually attacks Emily and the elves with hurricanes. She also uses her wind powers to levitate vines in an attempt to attack them.Ashleigh Ball voices Emily, Aira, Skyra, and Mrs. Jones.Her name comes from the word \\"sky.\\" According to some sources, \\"Skyra\\" means eternal life, strength, love and beauty, which could be referencing to her immortality, powerful wind magic, her love for her sisters and her young appearance despite her age.|Ragana is an elven witch who resides in Elvendale. She was introduced in the second mini-movie, Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.ContentsAd: (14)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)The Elf Witch is a fire elf born with very weak magic powers. She felt left out and alone and instead of training she learned how to boost her magic using other means. This started her on a dark path. Her mood she change from cool cunning to raging temper just like that. She will say or do anything to get her way.Strengths: Calculating, persuasive, thrives in her own company, strong-willed.Flaws: Deceitful, cynical, fiery tempered, willful, immoral, power hungry.Skills: Magic powers beyond any elf, but her powers are not connected to any element. She can manipulate most objects however not in a “natural” way like the elves.Favorite things: Precious stones, crystals, dragons, magic objects - and dragon EGGS!Did you know: Her cat, Jynx, is the only magical creature who knows Ragana – and still wants to spend time with her…BackgroundRagana had weak fire powers as a child. She was so afraid of being laughed at that she was easily tempted by the Shadow Fountain's promise of instant, immense power. Instead of working hard like the others, she drank from the Shadow Fountain's waters. Her magic is now connected to darkness, and her hunger for power makes her seek control of the dragons of Elvendale.PersonalityAs a child, Ragana was sensitive to the teasing she received from her peers, and eventually grew to resent them. After drinking from the Shadow Fountain, she succumbed to her darkest desires, becoming cold and vicious. Ragana is only slightly kinder to her cat Jynx and her fox Dusti, often making them do anything she wants. She likes to have personal space, and hates sugary foods. Ragana may also be germophobic, as evidenced by the webisode \\"Change From Within.\\"AppearanceRagana’s long, magenta hair cascades down her back. She also has magenta eyes, a light complexion, and black, claw-like fingernails.Ragana most often wears a long black dress with a panel of lime-green scales running down the middle. It is sleeveless, although two thorny black cuffs around her upper-arms give the illusion of an off-the-shoulder dress. A green jewel decorates the center of her spiked, black headdress, while a second green jewel shines at her neck.In the webisode \\"One is More Fun,\\" Ragana can be seen wearing a black and green nightgown with a matching nightcap. Later, she is dressed in her Halloween costume, a bat-themed, black and green dress. Ragana also sports a pair of large, bat-like fairy wings on her back. To complete the look, she dons elbow-length gloves that are black and green, and carries a black staff topped with a green skull.Ragana temporarily underwent a makeover in her attempt to be more approachable and friendly in the webisode ''Change from Within.\\" The dress she wore was red, trimmed with fuchsia at the bottom hem. Fuchsia swirls on the bodice formed a heart-like shape. A pink bow completed the look. For a brief moment, she had her hair braided like Emily’s, but it was quickly undone.RelationshipsFriendsJynx and Dusti are Ragana's faithful animal companions.While not exactly friends, she and Cronan almost partnered up on \\"Evil Apprentice,\\" where villains team up for some wicked good fun. However, Ragana ultimately decided she was better off on her own.It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice. It is later revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura.EnemiesRagana despises Emily and her friends for thwarting her plans in \\"Dragons to Save, Time to Be Brave.\\" Emily, especially, is a nuisance - her sweet and friendly disposition annoys Ragana deeply.RomanceIt is likely that several goblins have a crush on Ragana. Fibblin faints in her presence during \\"Evil Apprentice” while Roblin stares at her dreamily.In her castle, she has a portrait of Tidus with a lipstick mark on it.SetsRagana's Magic Shadow CastleTriviaThe name \\"Ragana\\" means \\"witch\\" in both Lithuanian and Latvian.Ragana's last name is \\"Shadowflame\\". This was revealed in the Dragon Adventures activity book, which is the only known source to mention it.Ragana can instantly change her clothes using magic.According to Aira, Ragana never learned to use fire magic. Therefore, when fire magic was drained from Elvendale in season 4, Ragana was not affected - you can't lose something you never had.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for Ragana's corruption, most likely due to Noctura inhabiting the shadow fountain.During \\"Down a Dark Path,\\" Ragana creates a symbol in the air for Naida, which seems to be an orchid flower. Orchids are symbols of luxury, power, and perfection. This could be a reference to Ragana's motto: \\"Why rebrand perfection?\\"There used to be a species of moths called \\"Ragana.\\" There is a saying \\"like moths to a flame\\" because moths are attracted to heat and light. This is ironic since Ragana abandoned the fire element in favour of darkness.Ragana does not like cookies unless they are dunked in Shadow Water.Azari's season 2 shoulder marking matches the symbol on Ragana's Change From Within dress.|Noctura is a bat-themed shape-shifter elf who is introduced in the season four story-arc. She has a number of bat-minions who aid Noctura in her wicked schemes. This dark witch hails from the Shadow World.ContentsAd: (8)Skip AdOfficial BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Since the elf Noctura was banished from Elvendale to the Shadow World by Lumia, the Guardian of Light, she has spent her life planning her escape and revenge on Lumia. Finally, with the help of her loyal bat minions, she has managed to steal the four elemental shards from the four guardian statues. Now she just needs to capture all the four Elemental Guardians themselves and harness their powers. Before long, she will become stronger and more powerful than ever. Her time has finally come to break out of the Shadow World and rule all of Elvendale.BackgroundNoctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia, and can now only speak through the waters of Shadow Fountain to Ragana. Supposedly, Lumia created the Shadow World as a \\"gift\\" for Noctura, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. Noctura has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. \\"The Legend of Noctura\\" is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as Noctura prepares to put her schemes into motion, Elvendale will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real.PersonalityNoctura is a vindictive villain who delights in wreaking havoc. For the last thousand years, she has been plotting her revenge, and is finally ready to take action. Her fiendish plans for Elvendale are to drain the world of its magic. This diabolical elf is determined to get her revenge, and claims that \\"death is coming on swift black wings.\\"AppearanceNoctura has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead.Her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom.RelationshipsFamilyNoctura calls her minions her children and considers herself their mother. This makes sense, since in a magazine, it mentions that Noctura actually created the shadow bats in her laboratory.FriendsIt is revealed in season 4 that the voice of the Shadow Fountain belongs to Noctura. It is possible that Ragana perceives the Shadow Fountain as a \\"friend,\\" since it can talk, and Ragana often goes to it when she needs advice.Lumia was once Noctura's closest friend, until Lumia banished her to the Shadow World.SetsNoctura's Tower and the Earth Fox Rescue (Elf form)Emily and Noctura's Showdown (Elf form)The Elvenstar Tree Bat Attack (Bat form)TriviaThe name \\"Noctura\\" comes from the word \\"Nocturnal.\\" Bats are nocturnal creatures who sleep during the day and wake at night.It can be argued that it is Lumia, not Noctura, who is the true villain of Season 4, since the deciphered runes in Ragana's storybook reveal that Lumia lied to Noctura. It also mentions that Noctura speaks the truth, which means that Noctura's warning about Lumia being a \\"wretched fake\\" must be true.Noctura is the first minidoll from the LEGO Elves line to have two completely different coloured arms. One is the colour of her skin with some black printing at the shoulder, while the other is pure black.Noctura is over a thousand years old.The bats gave Noctura her carriage for her one thousandth birthday.Noctura doesn't like cats because they are \\"fickle, dishonest things.\\"Although not technically a vampire, Noctura seems to share the characteristics of one, while Lumia has the similarities of a werewolf. Vampires and werewolves are often portrayed as enemies in literature and other media.According to an issue of LEGO Life magazine, Noctura is responsible for corrupting both Ragana and Cronan.She occasionally speaks in rhyme.It is questionable whether or not Noctura was able to shape-shift before she absorbed all the fire magic. The way she said “weave me wings\\" to escape gives the impression that it was only possible after she gained the fire magic.The LEGO Friends set Andrea's Theatre School features a poster of an elf that says \\"Best Musical WINNER.\\" The elf looks a lot like Noctura though has dark violet hair and a gold forehead circlet.|Elvendale is a magical world inhabited mainly by elves. This realm is also home to dragons, pegasi, and other mystical creatures. It is the main location of the LEGO Elves series. After inheriting her grandmother's amulet, a portal appeared before Emily Jones, and she found herself in this wondrous dimension. With the help of Azari Firedancer, Farran Leafshade, Aira Windwhistler, and Naida Riverheart, she was able to get back home to Earth. She now comes and goes from her world to Elvendale whenever she pleases. Visiting often, the five friends have many adventures across this fantastical landscape.Overview Map 3Overview Map of ElvendaleElvendaleSeason 1 Map of ElvendaleElves Map 2Season 2 Map of ElvendaleElves Map 3 (3)Season 3 Map of ElvendaleShadowWorldand ElvendaleSeason 4 Map of Elvendale + Shadow WorldContentsLocationsFor images and official descriptions of these locations, see the Map Archives.Season 1Enki IslandThe Izdur Ocean stretches from the deep and magical Blue Water Bay all the way to the hidden shores of Enki Island out on the horizon. Fantastic voyages await those who are hungry for adventure.

Mermaids are known to inhabit the ocean. Deep beneath the waves, the water key is protected inside an oyster. Emily and her friends journeyed across the ocean to find it, sailing on Naida's houseboat.Lava FieldsThe Lava Fields are a nice, warm home to tropical flowers and fiery animals. Johnny Baker resides here. His pastry bakery is located in the Lava Fields, as well as the fire key sought by Emily and her friends. The fields are full of lava waterfalls.Leaf LandsCovered in lavish forests, the Leaf Lands are where Farran has his tree house. Emily and her friends often stay in Farran's tree house when taking a break from their adventures.Sky CastleSky Castle is where Skyra guards the portal to the human world. Emily Jones and her friends were able to convince Skyra to allow Emily passage to and from her world and Elvendale.Sparkle RockA beacon of light, Sparkle Rock is a luminous landform made up of emerald stones and other crystals. Within the crystal hollow of Sparkle Rock is the earth key, which is guarded by Miss Spry.

They also met Starshine and Rufus there. It sits to the right of Sky Castle.Season 2AbyssThis bottomless pit is where the main 5 encountered a brainwashed Zonya. It's also where Aira met Gust after diving after the water egg and getting stranded on a ledge below. Its bridge is now broken.Cursed Crystal CanyonHome to the evil sorceress Ragana, these gloomy badlands give a creepy chill to anyone who enters - most likely because of the Shadow Fountain's dark magic. Ragana's Magic Shadow Castle is hidden in this canyon.Diamond PeaksThe Starlight Inn can be found in this mountainous territory. The inn is run by Sira Copperbranch.Driftwood ForestConcealed within this forest is the Elvendale School of Dragons.

The sanctuary is a safe haven for all dragons.Whispering WillowsThese enchanted, pink-leaved trees border Ragana's home and keep the dark magic contained there. All magical creatures respect their need for peace and quiet to keep evil in check, so you won’t find much wildlife here.Season 3Cronan's FortressThe Goblin King's Fortress is full of hidden rooms, secret passageways, and underground tunnels. Cronan used to live here with his mother, Quartzine, until she became imprisoned in her amulet. The fortress is now overrun with his goblin servants.Crystal CaveBlubeary and Lil' Blu live here beside a waterfall. Sophie stumbled upon the cave and the bears shortly after arriving in Elvendale. It is slightly south-east of the Guardian Tree. The bears and other creatures must be careful because the goblins sometimes use dynamite in the area to harvest more crystals.Goblin VillageAs its name suggests, the Goblin Village is the home of the goblins. Most of the buildings here are smaller than average, to accommodate the goblins' short statures.Mr. Spry's ShopNestled in a forest clearing is Mr. Spry's Shop. A variety of foods are on sale, but Mr. Spry would rather trade for a fun, shiny trinket than receive boring old coins. It was here, beside the shop, that Sophie Jones was captured by Cronan's goblins.Shimmering WoodsOnce a safe, happy place for all creatures who lived there, these woods were ruled by Rosalyn Nightshade until the evil Goblin King overthrew her. Now it is full of frightening danger.

This portal can only be unlocked with the amulet that Emily inherited from her grandmother. It is mentioned in an issue of LEGO Club Magazine that the portal is in the garden's largest tree.It is mentioned in the book Quest for the Keys that the tree with the portal in it is an oak tree. In Celtic Mythology, oak trees are associated with immortality. In the ancient Celtic language, the word for oak tree is “duir” which is also the word for “door.”The portal that leads from Elvendale to Earth is located at Sky Castle. In order for this portal to work, all four elemental keys are required, as well as Skyra and her staff.In the series finale, Emily is able to open the tree portal to get home and doesn't need to go to Skyra's. It is unknown if this is a result of Emily's new light magic or if it's just an inconsistency with season 4.TriviaAstronomyThere is a globe with at least 5 continents on it at the elementary school. This means that the world of Elvendale is likely a spherical planet, similar to Earth.Elvendale has at least one moon and a constellation of a dragon.Lumia has a star chart of the Sagittarius constellation at the Elvenstar Tree. This indicates that at least some (if not all) of the constellations in Elvendale are the same as on Earth.Based on One Is More Fun, it seems that Elvendale has the same calendar system as Earth, since Ragana recognized the months and dates in Emily's book.CreaturesElvendale is inhabited by many mystical creatures.It is implied that some species of animals aren't found in Elvendale, such as platypuses.Animals can be married and have surnames.Some creatures are born belonging to more than one element, such as Firebolt.CrystalsAll of Elvendale's elemental magic is contained in the guardian siblings' crystals.Both Cronan and Ragana's staves are topped with a lime-green gem, and both have the power of levitation. Aira also uses lime-green levitation crystals for her airship.Cronan \\"face-timed\\" Roblin using a green crystal.Smilin runs a crystal shop in the Goblin Village.Quartzine's chartreuse amulet stone can drain and store magic, including the forest's life-force.A magazine page about the Precious Crystal Mine mentions some gem info.The Guardian Tree's crystals protect the forest from wild magic.

Can also amplify her friends' powers, break locks, vanquish shadow creatures, etc.Skyra's staff opens a portal to Earth. Also capable of other magic in the books.Lumia's staff opens a portal to the Shadow World.EventsThe Elvendale Ball is a gathering mentioned in Hairy Styles.There is an annual competition known as the Dragon Race. Prizes include a golden wing trophy and free cookies for a year at Johnny's bakery. This was shown in Drag Race.Birthdays are celebrated in Elvendale, which appear to involve cake and presents, judging by The Struggle Is Real and In The Shadows.The elves didn't know about Christmas or Halloween until Emily's arrival.GamesNaida loves board games and plays them with Delphia.Azari, Farran, Aira, and Naida played Hide and Seek when they were little. In Never Cave, Farran counted to a thousand, which is typically a lot longer than the human version of the game.Tidus plays a card game with 2 unnamed friends.Aira plays a game called \\"Mermaid Tag.\\"LanguagesCronan said a French word once.The goblins have said a few words in Spanish.Some elves have accents, such as Rosalyn.There are several sets of runic alphabets in Elvendale. At least 4 different ones are shown, one per season. The runes from season 1 have an official key, and the season 4 runes have been decoded. The runes from seasons 2 and 3 are indiscernible.Ragana is able to read the English in Emily's event planner scrapbook. Similarly, Emily can read the Dragon Book, even though it appears to be written in runes.The Elvish symbol converter says: \\"Most elves understand your language.\\"One of the quizzes suggests an Elvish dictionary would be a perfect gift for Emily, so it's possible that Emily may have studied up on the runes prior to season 2.|Liska is a clever, giant earth fox who is one of the Elemental Guardians. She has the earth-jewel on her forehead, which Noctura wants to collect. This jewel is the source of all earth-magic in Elvendale.ContentsAd: (26)2Official BiographyLEGO.com-icon-yellow.png This is a quote from LEGO.com. Do not modify it. (See the source of this quote.)Liska the Guardian Earth Fox is the youngest of the Elemental Guardians. Had she been a human, she would have been a rock star. She’s confident, charismatic, friendly and VERY chill. She has no patience for hero worship, though. When she first meets Farran, he is completely star-struck and flabbergasted. So Liska’s first task in her bonding with Farran is to get him grounded, so to speak… She can be a little impulsive, but her protective instincts tend to kick in when she’s around Farran. This could be the beginning of a beautiful, magical friendship.AppearanceLiska is similar in stature to Rowan the fire lion and Lumia in wolf form. She is mostly lime green, with purple and gold detailing. She has what appear to be purple leaves at her leg joints. Unlike other foxes, Liska has three tails.Attached to Liska's back is a brown saddle with one seat. The saddle cushion is gold and decorated with a symbol of all four elemental diamonds pointing inward.RelationshipsFamilyIn Lights Out, when talking to Cory about Liska and Rowan, Cyclo says that they must bring back their brother and sister. This would mean that Cory, Rowan, Cyclo, and Liska are siblings. Bios mention that Cory is the oldest and Liska is the youngest.FriendsIn Chill, Liska is initially put-off by Farran's star-struck rambling, but they soon move past it and bond.Liska also appears to be close with Lumia. Judging by some LEGO stickers, Lumia has known her since they were quite young. Because of this, it is possible that Liska considers her to be more like family.TriviaThe name \\"Liska\\" means \\"fox\\" in Czech.She is the only fox so far to have three tails. Liska may be based on a kitsune, a mythical fox-creature that has a varying number of tails depending on its age. The maximum number of tails a kitsune can have is nine.Liska can talk, but it is unknown if only earth elves can understand her, or if all elves and humans can.This is similar to Cory, Cyclo, and Rowan.She likes peanuts. This is mentioned by Farran and Lumia.Liska used the Quake Shield to defend against the demon hordes of Zaikuda in the Battle of the Endless Forest. It is unknown if \\"Zaikuda\\" is the name of a person or a place, but \\"Kuda\\" means \\"king/lord/master.\\" (Note: Spelling of Zaikuda may not be exact.)|Calypso is a baby sea turtle who gets along with Naida and Cory. She is featured in one LEGO set, Naida and the Water Turtle Ambush.TriviaThe name \\"Calypso\\" means \\"to hide.\\" This is fitting for a turtle, since they hide in their shells. In Greek Mythology, Calypso was a nymph who was trapped on an island in the middle of the ocean.|Cory is a wise, giant sea turtle who is one of the Elemental Guardians.

The Turtle is wise, but she can be relentless, stubborn and demanding. She doesn’t always understand that other creatures, magical or otherwise, do not have the same years of life experience as she does. She has very little patience with people who, in her eyes, are too naïve or forgiving. She’s never afraid to make hard decisions where others can’t. Her only weakness is her fear of spiders, but she would rather die than admit that to anyone!AppearanceCory has aqua coloured scales and a dark azure blue shell with gold detailing.Attached to Cory's shell is a brown saddle with one seat.

Here is a general explanation of how payment terminals work: 1. Card insertion or tapping: Customers either insert their card into the terminal's card slot or tap their contactless card or mobile device on the terminal's contactless reader. 2. Data communication: Once the card is inserted or tapped, the terminal establishes a secure communication channel with the payment network through an internet connection or telephone line. 3. Data encryption: The terminal ensures that transaction data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access or tampering during transmission. This encryption protects sensitive cardholder information. 4. Authorization request: The terminal sends an authorization request to the payment network, which in turn routes the request to the cardholder's issuing bank or financial institution. 5. Bank verification: The issuing bank receives the authorization request, verifies the authenticity of the card and available funds, and decides whether to approve or decline the transaction. 6. Authorization response: The issuing bank sends an authorization response back to the terminal through the payment network, indicating whether the transaction is approved or declined. 7. Transaction completion: If the transaction is approved, the terminal prints a sales receipt (if required) and prompts the customer to sign it. The terminal may also request a PIN or a form of customer verification depending on the card type and transaction amount. 8. Settlement and funding: At the end of the business day or a specified period, the merchant initiates a settlement process where the approved transactions are submitted for payment. The funds are transferred from the customer's account to the merchant's designated bank account. 9. Receipt issuance: After the settlement, the payment terminal prints a detailed receipt for the customer, including transaction information, purchase details, and any remaining balance. It's important to note that payment terminals can vary in functionality and features depending on the provider, technology, and specific requirements."},{"instruction":"does it use some sort of api?","output":"Yes, payment terminals often use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to facilitate communication between the terminal itself and the payment processing network. APIs are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software systems to interact with each other, exchanging data and instructions. Payment terminals typically integrate with the payment service provider (PSP) or payment gateway, which acts as an intermediary between the terminal and the acquiring bank or payment network. The terminal's software communicates with the payment gateway's API to send authorization requests, receive authorization responses, and initiate settlement processes. The API provides standardized methods and protocols for transmitting transaction data, handling encryption and security, performing authentication, and exchanging information between the terminal and the payment network. These APIs ensure the secure transmission of cardholder data and facilitate real-time communication necessary for processing transactions."},{"instruction":"how does a payment terminal get configured, lets say you wanna use stripe as I'm pretty sure they support payment terminals","output":"When using payment terminals with Stripe, the configuration process typically involves the following steps: 1. Hardware selection: Choose a payment terminal that is compatible with Stripe. Stripe supports a range of payment terminal models from various manufacturers. Ensure that the terminal you select is compatible with your business needs and supports the desired payment types. 2. Obtain merchant account: Sign up for a Stripe account if you don't already have one. This will serve as your merchant account with Stripe, allowing you to process payments through their platform. 3. Terminal setup: Set up the hardware payment terminal following the manufacturer's instructions. This may involve connecting the terminal to your network or establishing a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. 4. Terminal configuration: Configure the payment terminal to connect to your Stripe account. This often involves entering your Stripe API credentials or generating a secure connection token. 5. Software integration: Integrate the payment terminal software with your point-of-sale system or e-commerce platform. Stripe provides APIs and software development kits (SDKs) that allow you to connect your terminal to their platform. This integration enables seamless communication between the terminal and Stripe for transaction processing. 6. Testing and certification: Test your configured payment terminal to ensure it is functioning correctly and securely. Depending on the region and specific payment regulations, you may need to obtain certification or compliance approvals before accepting live transactions. 7. Go live: Once you have successfully configured and tested your payment terminal, you can start accepting payments in a live environment. Ensure that you have completed any necessary legal and compliance requirements for your business. Stripe provides detailed documentation, guides, and support to assist you throughout the configuration process. It's recommended to consult their resources or reach out to their support team for specific instructions related to your chosen terminal model and integration requirements."},{"instruction":"could a rogue employee change the stripe api key? I know it would get detected fast but why couldn't they","output":"While it is technically possible for a rogue employee to change the Stripe API key, there are several safeguards in place that make it highly unlikely and would quickly lead to detection. Some reasons why it would be challenging for a rogue employee to change the Stripe API key without being detected quickly include: 1. Access controls: Stripe provides robust access controls and permissions management. By default, only authorized personnel have access to sensitive API keys. Access can be restricted to specific individuals or roles within an organization, reducing the potential for misuse. 2. Audit logs: Stripe keeps detailed logs of all activities and changes made within the Stripe account. This includes API key changes and other critical events. These logs help in tracking and investigating any unauthorized modifications. 3. Separation of duties: In organizations following best practices, access and administrative tasks are typically divided among multiple employees, adhering to the principle of separation of duties. This means that no single employee should have the authority or capability to solely make critical changes, such as altering the API key. 4. Change tracking and notifications: Stripe often sends notifications to account owners or administrators when important account settings or credentials are modified. This ensures that any changes to the Stripe API key are immediately reported to the relevant individuals or teams, allowing them to investigate and mitigate any potential misuse. 5. Internal controls and monitoring: Organizations implement internal controls and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard against unauthorized activities. This can include regular review and audits of system configurations to detect any unauthorized changes. Additionally, access to production environments or live systems may be limited to trusted employees or require additional approval processes. 6. Compliance standards: Stripe is compliant with various security and industry standards, such as PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). These standards impose strict security requirements and controls to protect cardholder data and prevent unauthorized access. Compliance processes help in ensuring secure management of API keys. In the event of a rogue employee attempting to change the Stripe API key, any discrepancies or unauthorized changes would likely be detected through the measures mentioned above. Stripe, as well as the business using the Stripe platform, have a vested interest in maintaining the security and integrity of payment processes, which includes promptly detecting and responding to any potential misuse or unauthorized changes."},{"instruction":"no i mean change the api key on the ac tual terminal to their own","output":"Apologies for the confusion. If a rogue employee has physical access to the payment terminal, it is technically possible for them to attempt to change the API key on the terminal itself. However, this scenario has several factors that prevent it from being an effective or practical means of unauthorized access: 1. Encryption: Payment terminals typically use encryption techniques to secure sensitive data, including API keys. The API key itself may be encrypted or securely stored within the terminal, making it difficult to extract or modify without proper authentication. 2. Authentication and authorization: Payment terminals often require administrative credentials or special access codes to make configuration changes. These credentials are typically limited to authorized personnel, reducing the likelihood of a rogue employee being able to access and modify the API key. 3. Access controls: Organizations and service providers implement physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to payment terminals. These measures can include restricted access to terminal installations, surveillance systems, and access logs to track terminal usage. 4. Monitoring and detection: Payment terminal providers have systems in place to detect tampering or unauthorized modifications. Many terminals have tamper-evident features, such as seals or sensors, which would indicate if the terminal has been compromised. Any unauthorized changes to the API key or tampering attempts would be flagged by the system for investigation. 5. Regular checkups: Merchants are often advised to perform routine inspections of their payment terminals to ensure their physical integrity. This can include checking for any signs of tampering, verifying security seals, and promptly reporting any suspicions to the payment terminal provider or the acquiring bank. While it's not impossible for a rogue employee to attempt to change the API key on a payment terminal, the combination of physical security measures, encryption, authentication requirements, and monitoring make it difficult for unauthorized modifications to go undetected. Additionally, any changes made to the terminal's API key would likely be noticed during routine checks or when transactions fail to process correctly, triggering investigation and remedial action."},{"instruction":"Story prompt: In 2023, a trend of videos, edits, and memes has been born, collectively called, \\"Lobotomy Kaisen\\". The background to this trend comes from the aftermath of Chapter 236 of the manga series, \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", in which during the battle between Sukuna, who is currently possessing Megumi Fushiguro's body and Satoru Gojo ends in the death of Gojo, followed by a series of week-long breaks, disrupting the flow of new chapters, caused the fan base to make new memes, oftentimes joked as the fandom losing its collective sanity and suffering severe brain damage. Memes ranged from implying weaker characters in Jujutsu Kaisen were far stronger than they really were, to replacing the lines with unrelated words that weren't even nouns. One of the memes involves the phrase, \\"Nah, I'd win.\\", a reference to Gojo reiterating that he would not lose to Sukuna, which had now aged poorly due to his death in the series.","output":"In the year 2023, a peculiar trend known as \\"Lobotomy Kaisen\\" took the internet by storm. Stemming from the aftermath of Chapter 236 in the popular manga series, \\"Jujutsu Kaisen,\\" the trend was fueled by a combination of memes, videos, and edits that reflected the fan base's collective sense of humor and frustration. Chapter 236 witnessed a fierce battle between Megumi Fushiguro, whose body was possessed by the powerful Sukuna, and Satoru Gojo, one of the key protagonists. Tragically, the battle concluded with Gojo's untimely demise, leaving fans shocked and disheartened. However, what followed were a series of unexpected week-long breaks in the release of new chapters, causing the fandom to experience a form of withdrawal and restlessness. These breaks disrupted the flow of the story and led to fans channeling their energy into creating a plethora of memes. A prevailing theme in these memes was the notion of the fandom losing its collective sanity and undergoing severe brain damage. In a mix of humor and frustration, fans began crafting edits and videos that suggested other characters in the series were far stronger than they actually were, subverting the original narrative. One particular meme emerged as a fan favorite. It involved the phrase, \\"Nah, I'd win,\\" a clever reference to Gojo confidently reiterating that he would never lose to Sukuna. However, with Gojo's unexpected demise in the series, this line aged poorly, resulting in a humorous twist. Fans began incorporating this phrase into various contexts, completely unrelated to the original battle. It became a symbol of ironic self-confidence, a way for fans to express their absurd interpretations of the characters and their abilities. The \\"Lobotomy Kaisen\\" trend gained widespread popularity not only within the Jujutsu Kaisen fan base but also amongst wider online communities. The trend became a means for fans to cope with the emotional rollercoaster of their beloved series while simultaneously showcasing their creativity and ingenuity in creating unique content. As online platforms overflowed with Lobotomy Kaisen videos, edits, and memes, the creators and authors of Jujutsu Kaisen took notice. They were pleasantly surprised by the fandom's resilience and ability to transform a challenging period into a source of entertainment and amusement. Rather than viewing these memes and edits as detrimental, they admired the fan base's ability to adapt and find humor even in the face of adversity. Ultimately, the \\"Lobotomy Kaisen\\" trend became a testament to the dedication and creativity of the Jujutsu Kaisen fandom. Through their memes, edits, and videos, they not only entertained fellow fans but also formed a bridge between the community and the creators themselves. It served as a reminder that art, even in its most challenging moments, has the power to unite people and inspire unforgettable moments of laughter and connection."},{"instruction":"sonic characters in After 20 YEARS style","output":"In the After 20 YEARS style, Sonic characters could undergo some changes while still maintaining their iconic features.

Data: P = 200 watts, δ = (1/64) in., ρ = 170 Btu/lbm.°F, α = 0.10 (emissivity), Cp = 0.2 lbm/ft³, T = 70°F, D = 3 in","output":"To calculate the steady surface temperature of the lighted bulb, we can use the equation for steady state heat transfer: Q = α * σ * ε * A * (T^4 - Ts^4) Where: Q = Power input (200 watts) α = Absorptivity (assumed to be equal to emissivity, 0.10) σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 * 10^-8 W/m^2·K^4) ε = Emissivity (0.10) A = Surface area (4 * π * r^2, where r is the radius of the bulb) T = Temperature of surroundings (70°F) Ts = Steady surface temperature of the bulb (unknown) First, let's convert the given values to SI units: δ = (1/64) in. = (1/64) * 0.0254 m = 0.000396875 m ρ = 170 Btu/lbm.°F = 710.85 J/kg·K Cp = 0.2 lbm/ft³ = 320.376 kg/m³ D = 3 in = 0.0762 m Now, we can calculate the surface area of the light bulb: r = D/2 = 0.0762/2 = 0.0381 m A = 4 * π * r^2 = 4 * π * (0.0381)^2 = 0.01821 m² Next, let's convert the temperature of the surroundings to Kelvin: T = 70°F = (70 + 459.67) * (5/9) = 294.261 K Now, we can rearrange the equation and solve for Ts: Q = α * σ * ε * A * (T^4 - Ts^4) => Ts^4 = T^4 - (Q / (α * σ * ε * A)) Plugging in the known values: Ts^4 = (294.261)^4 - (200 / (0.10 * 5.67 * 10^-8 * 0.10 * 0.01821)) Ts = (Ts^4)^(1/4) ≈ 294.261 K Therefore, the steady surface temperature of the lighted bulb is approximately 294.261 K. To find the time required for the surface temperature of the bulb to reach this steady value, we can use the equation for transient heat transfer: Q = ρ * Cp * V * dT/dt Where: Q = Power input (200 watts) ρ = Density (710.85 J/kg·K) Cp = Specific heat capacity (320.376 kg/m³) V = Volume (π * r^2 * h, where h is the height of the bulb) dT/dt = Rate of change of temperature (unknown) First, let's calculate the volume of the bulb: h = δ = 0.000396875 m V = π * r^2 * h = π * (0.0381)^2 * 0.000396875 = 3.5144 * 10^-5 m³ Now, let's rearrange the equation and solve for dT/dt: Q = ρ * Cp * V * dT/dt => dT/dt = Q / (ρ * Cp * V) Plugging in the known values: dT/dt = 200 / (710.85 * 320.376 * 3.5144 * 10^-5) dT/dt ≈ 0.03224 K/s Therefore, it would take approximately 0.03224 seconds for the surface temperature of the bulb to reach the steady value."},{"instruction":"selam","output":"Merhaba!

L'imposta si applica alle seguenti operazioni: 1. **Cessioni di Beni**: Trasferimento di proprietà di beni nel territorio dello Stato, svolto nell'ambito dell'esercizio di imprese o di attività professionali. 2. **Prestazioni di Servizi**: Erogazione di servizi nel territorio dello Stato, eseguita nell'ambito dell'esercizio di imprese o attività professionali. 3. **Importazioni**: Introduzione di beni nel territorio dello Stato da chiunque effettuata, indipendentemente dal fatto che sia nell'esercizio di attività d'impresa o professionale. L'articolo ha subito delle modificazioni nel tempo, una delle quali specifica che le prestazioni di servizi effettuate nell'esercizio di arti e professioni sono soggette a IVA dal 1 settembre 1974. **Commento sull'Articolo 1 del DPR n. 633/1972** L'articolo 1 è di fondamentale importanza poiché definisce l'ambito di applicazione dell'IVA, una delle principali fonti di entrata tributaria per lo Stato. L'IVA è un'imposta indiretta sul consumo, che il consumatore finale paga ma che è applicata e versata dall'imprenditore o dal professionista come intermediario fiscale. La chiarezza nell'ambito di applicazione è essenziale per assicurare un corretto adempimento fiscale e per prevenire l'evasione dell'imposta. Le modifiche successive all'articolo rivelano l'adattamento della normativa alle mutate condizioni economiche e sociali, nonché alla giurisprudenza e alla prassi amministrativa, in modo da rendere più chiara e attuale l'applicazione dell'imposta. La previsione di applicazione dell'IVA sulle prestazioni di servizio effettuate da professionisti riflette l'intenzione del legislatore di allargare la base imponibile includendo attività che precedentemente potevano non essere state esplicitamente menzionate o soggette a IVA. In conclusione, l'Articolo 1 stabilisce le basi sulla quale si fonda il sistema IVA italiano, introducendo i concetti chiave e fornendo un framework per l'applicazione dell'imposta che sarà successivamente dettagliato e articolato negli articoli successivi del decreto."},{"instruction":"Art. 2?","output":"**Sintesi dell'Articolo 2 del Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica n. 633 del 26 ottobre 1972** L'Articolo 2 del DPR 633/1972 fornisce una definizione precisa di cosa si intende per \\"cessioni di beni\\" ai sensi dell'IVA, e stabilisce una serie di situazioni particolari che rientrano in tale definizione: 1. **Cessioni a Titolo Oneroso**: Atti che comportano il trasferimento della proprietà o la creazione o il trasferimento di diritti reali di godimento su beni. 2. **Vendite con Riserva di Proprietà**: Cessioni di beni per le quali il passaggio della proprietà è subordinato al pagamento del prezzo. 3. **Locazioni con Clausola di Trasferimento della Proprietà**: Locazioni di beni che prevedono il trasferimento della proprietà come parte vincolante del contratto. 4. **Passaggio di Beni in Contratti di Commissione**: Passaggi che avvengono tra committente e commissionario legati a vendite o acquisti effettuati in esecuzione di tali contratti. 5. **Cessioni Gratuite**: Escluse dal concetto di cessione solo se i beni non rientrano nell'attività propria dell'impresa o sono di costo unitario minore ad una soglia specifica (euro cinquanta) o non sono stati oggetto di detrazione dell'IVA all'atto dell'acquisto/ importazione. 6. **Assegnazioni ai Soci**: Riguarda le assegnazioni di beni ai soci, indipendentemente dal titolo (gratuito o oneroso), da parte di società, consorzi o altre organizzazioni anche se prive di personalità giuridica. Il medesimo articolo elenca poi una serie di situazioni che non sono considerate cessioni di beni, quali il trasferimento di denaro o crediti, le cessioni di aziende o rami di azienda, i passaggi di beni in fusioni, scissioni o trasformazioni societarie, le cessioni gratuite di campioni di modico valore, le cessioni di alcuni beni soggetti a regimi speciali (es. paste alimentari, pane, latte fresco nonché alcune situazioni particolari previste dai regimi premiali). **Commento sull'Articolo 2 del DPR n. 633/1972** L'articolo 2 costituisce un elemento essenziale della disciplina dell'IVA, dettagliando quali operazioni siano da considerarsi cessioni di beni e quindi soggette a questa imposta. Il legislatore ha voluto definire chiaramente il campo d'applicazione dell'IVA in riferimento alla circolazione dei beni, includendo non solo le classiche vendite ma anche situazioni meno ovvie, come le cessioni gratuite o le locazioni con clausola di riacquisto. Le esclusioni dal concetto di cessione di bene sono importanti tanto quanto le inclusioni, poiché chiariscono quali operazioni siano fuori dal perimetro dell'IVA, evitando dubbi interpretativi e potenziali controversie con l'autorità fiscale. Le esclusioni possono anche riflettere scelte di policy, in quanto esonerano dal peso fiscale operazioni che altrimenti potrebbero essere sottoposte ad imposta. Le modifiche apportate nel tempo all'articolo 2 dimostrano inoltre la necessità della legge fiscale di adeguarsi all'evoluzione dell'economia e del mercato, nonché la tendenza a semplificare e chiarire la normativa là dove l'esperienza pratica ha mostrato difficoltà applicative o lacune interpretative."},{"instruction":"Art. 3?","output":"**Sintesi dell'Articolo 3 del Decreto del Presidente della Repubblica n. 633 del 26 ottobre 1972** L'articolo 3 del DPR n. 633/1972 disciplina la nozione di \\"prestazioni di servizi\\" ai fini dell'IVA. Esso definisce quali attività rientrano in tale categoria e, quindi, su quali operazioni viene applicata l'imposta. Ecco i punti chiave dell'articolo: 1. **Definizione Generale**: Le prestazioni di servizi sono considerate tali se dipendenti da contratti che prevedono obbligazioni di fare, di non fare o di permettere qualcosa, a fronte di un corrispettivo. 2. **Uso Personale o Familiarie**: Le prestazioni a uso personale o familiare dell'imprenditore o di coloro che esercitano un'arte o professione, o rivolte a finalità estranee all'impresa o alla professione stessa, possono costituire prestazioni di servizi a titolo oneroso. 3. **Casi Specifici di Prestazioni di Servizi**: Il testo menziona esempi specifici di attività che sono considerate prestazioni di servizi, quali la locazione di beni, le cessioni di diritti (come diritti d'autore o invenzioni industriali), le operazioni finanziarie (come i prestiti di denaro), somministrazioni di alimenti e bevande, e le cessioni di contratti. Allo stesso tempo, l'articolo chiarisce quali attività **non** sono considerate prestazioni di servizi, come alcune operazioni riguardanti i diritti d'autore, i prestiti obbligazionari, e determinati contratti come i mandati o la mediazione in ambito finanziario. **Commento sull'Articolo 3 del DPR n. 633/1972** Questo articolo è un tassello fondamentale nel quadro dell'IVA, delineando con precisione il concetto di prestazione di servizi e le sue varie applicazioni, garantendo chiarezza sia per l'amministrazione fiscale che per i soggetti impositori (imprese e professionisti). Attraverso la definizione di prestazioni di servizi e l'elenco delle esclusioni, il legislatore evita ambiguità e stabilisce quali attività sono soggette all'adempimento fiscale dell'IVA. La distinzione tra prestazioni di servizi e altre operazioni è vitale, visto che diverse regole possono applicarsi in relazione alla determinazione della base imponibile, al luogo di tassazione, alle aliquote e alle eventuali esenzioni. Gli aggiornamenti e le modifiche apportate nel corso del tempo all'articolo 3 mostrano l'evoluzione della normativa IVA in risposta ai cambiamenti delle pratiche commerciali e delle necessità economiche, nonché l'intenzione del legislatore di adeguarsi alle direttive europee e agli standard internazionali sull'IVA.

Il existe différents types de modèles épidémiologiques utilisés pour prédire la tuberculose, notamment : 1. Modèles de transmission : Ces modèles se concentrent sur la propagation de la tuberculose d'une personne à une autre. Ils prennent en compte des facteurs tels que la densité de population, le taux d'infection, le taux de guérison, la durée d'infectiosité, etc. Les modèles de transmission peuvent aider à prédire la prévalence future de la maladie dans une communauté en fonction de différents scénarios d'intervention. 2. Modèles basés sur la prévalence : Ces modèles utilisent des données de prévalence de la tuberculose pour estimer le nombre de nouveaux cas qui peuvent survenir dans le futur. Ils prennent en compte des facteurs tels que le taux d'incidence, le taux de guérison, la mortalité, etc. Les modèles basés sur la prévalence peuvent aider à déterminer les besoins en termes de stratégies de dépistage, de traitement et de prévention de la maladie. 3.

Ces biomarqueurs peuvent être détectés dans différents échantillons biologiques tels que le sang, le crachat, l'urine, etc. Voici quelques points clés à considérer lors de l'analyse des modèles basés sur les marqueurs biologiques pour la prédiction de la tuberculose : 1. Identification des biomarqueurs : Les études cherchent à identifier des biomarqueurs spécifiques qui sont soit des protéines, des acides nucléiques, des lipides, ou d'autres molécules biologiques. Les techniques d'analyse utilisées peuvent inclure la spectrométrie de masse, l'analyse d'expression génique, la séquençage d'acides nucléiques, etc. Ces biomarqueurs peuvent être utilisés pour différencier les patients atteints de tuberculose active des individus sains ou des patients atteints d'autres maladies respiratoires. 2. Validation des biomarqueurs : Une fois les biomarqueurs identifiés, ils doivent être validés pour démontrer leur association significative avec la tuberculose. Cela implique généralement l'utilisation d'échantillons plus importants et diversifiés pour vérifier la spécificité et la sensibilité des biomarqueurs proposés. 3. Développement de tests diagnostiques : Les biomarqueurs identifiés et validés peuvent être utilisés pour développer des tests diagnostiques plus sensibles et spécifiques. Ces tests peuvent être plus rapides, plus simples et moins invasifs que les méthodes traditionnelles de détection de la tuberculose, comme la microscopie des crachats ou les cultures bactériennes. 4. Prédiction de la réponse au traitement : Les biomarqueurs peuvent également être utilisés pour prédire la réponse au traitement antituberculeux. Certains biomarqueurs peuvent indiquer la présence de résistance aux médicaments ou permettre de surveiller la réponse du patient au traitement en cours. 5. Avantages et limitations : Les modèles basés sur les marqueurs biologiques offrent des avantages potentiels tels que des diagnostics plus précoces, une meilleure différenciation entre la tuberculose active et latente, et une prédiction de la réponse au traitement. Cependant, il convient de noter que ces modèles peuvent également présenter des limitations, notamment la nécessité de technologies de pointe pour l'identification et la détection des biomarqueurs, la variabilité individuelle des biomarqueurs, et la nécessité de valider les résultats dans différentes populations.

Données d'entrée : Les modèles d'apprentissage automatique utilisent des données démographiques, des antécédents médicaux, des symptômes, des résultats de tests diagnostiques, etc., comme variables d'entrée pour prédire la probabilité qu'une personne soit atteinte de tuberculose. La qualité et la complétude des données utilisées ont un impact direct sur la précision des prédictions. 2. Algorithme d'apprentissage : Les modèles d'apprentissage automatique utilisent différents algorithmes tels que la régression logistique, les arbres de décision, les réseaux neuronaux, les forêts aléatoires, etc., pour apprendre à partir des données d'entraînement et formuler des prédictions. Le choix de l'algorithme dépend de la nature des données et de l'objectif de prédiction spécifique. 3. Entrainement et test : Les modèles d'apprentissage automatique nécessitent une étape d'entraînement où les données historiques sont utilisées pour ajuster les paramètres du modèle. Ensuite, le modèle est testé avec des données indépendantes pour évaluer sa performance et sa capacité de prédiction. Il est important de diviser les données en ensembles d'entraînement et de test pour éviter le surajustement (overfitting). 4. Validation externe : La validation externe des modèles est essentielle pour évaluer leur robustesse et leur capacité à s'appliquer à de nouvelles populations. La performance du modèle est évaluée en utilisant des ensembles de données indépendantes provenant de différentes sources ou de différentes régions géographiques. 5. Interprétabilité : Certains modèles d'apprentissage automatique, comme les réseaux neuronaux, peuvent être considérés comme des \\"boîtes noires\\" car ils sont souvent difficiles à interpréter et à comprendre les processus sous-jacents. Cela peut poser des défis en termes d'acceptation et de confiance vis-à-vis des résultats du modèle. 6. Limitations : Les modèles d'apprentissage automatique peuvent être sensibles aux erreurs ou aux biais des données d'entraînement, et peuvent avoir des difficultés à généraliser les prédictions à de nouvelles situations. De plus, ils nécessitent souvent de grandes quantités de données pour obtenir des résultats précis. Les modèles basés sur l'apprentissage automatique pour la prédiction de la tuberculose offrent un potentiel prometteur pour améliorer les diagnostics et l'évaluation du risque de tuberculose.

DNA에 있는 연속한 3개의 염기가 하나의 아미노산을 지정하며, 아미노산이 모이면 단백질이 된다. 단백질은 생명체 자체를 만드는 재료이면서 모든 화학반응을 제어하는 촉매 역할을 한다. 인간과 고등어가 다르다면 그들을 구성하는 단백질이 다른 것이다. 염기에는 아데닌, 티민, 구아닌, 시토신이라는 네 종류가 있는데, 모두 탄소, 질소, 산소 대여섯 개가 오·육각형을 이루며 결합된 작은 분자에 불과하다. 아데닌과 티민, 구아닌과 시토신은 각각 두 개, 세 개의 수소를 매개로 결합된다. 부모의 DNA를 자손에 전달할 때, 이 결합이 끊어진다. 결국 생명의 핵심 원리인 유전은 바로 이들 원자 몇 개 수준, 즉 양자역학적 원리에 따라 제어되고 있는 것이다. 하지만 놀랍게도 생물학자들은 양자역학을 잘 모른다. 왜 그럴까? 생명과 관련된 모든 물질은 원자로 되어 있고, 원자는 양자역학으로 설명된다. 문제는 ‘딱 여기까지’라는 거다. 생명체를 이루는 분자들은 여전히 눈에 보이지 않을 만큼 작지만, 어마어마하게 많은 수의 원자로 이뤄져 있다. 예를 들어 단백질 공장인 리보솜을 만들려면 원자 수십만 개 가 필요하다. 이렇게 많은 수의 원자로 이뤄진 계에 양자역학을 직접 적용하는 것은 현재의 계산능력으로는 불가능하다. 원자 하나를 행렬역학으로 기술하는 데 10개의 숫자를 사용한다면, 원자 10만 개를 기술하기 위해 숫자가 10100000개나 필요하게 된다. 이 수는 우주전체 원자의 개수보다 크다. 쓰는 것 조차 불가능하다는 뜻이다. ● 광합성과 철새의 양자생물학 철새는 서로 다른 방향의 스핀이 생기는 비율을 보고 북극과 남극의 방향을 알 수 있다. - istockphoto 제공 철새는 서로 다른 방향의 스핀이 생기는 비율을 보고 북극과 남극의 방향을 알 수 있다. - istockphoto 제공 생물학자는 분자를 마치 거시세계의 축구공처럼 다룬다. 꼭 필요한 부분에만 양자역학 개념을 사용할 뿐이다. 하이브리드라고나 할까. 분자 자체는 양자역학적 원리로 구성돼 있으나 분자 전체를 한 단위로 보았을 때 이것은 공이나 다름없다는 말이다. 불과 60개의 탄소원자가 모여 만들어진 풀러렌이란 분자조차 양자 간섭을 일으키려면 특별한 조건을 준비해야 한다(슈뢰딩거 고양이는 누가 죽였나? 참고). 결어긋남이 일어나는 것을 막아야 한다는 말이다. 결어긋남이란 측정당할 때 일어난다. 원자 하나만 부딪혀도 측정이 일어난다. 따라서 고온의 물에 담겨있는 생명체에서 결어긋남을 막는 것은 거의 불가능하다(양자 중첩의 입장에서는 상온도 엄청나게 높은 온도다). 그래서 대부분의 양자실험은 진공, 또는 영하 270℃정도의 극저온에서 수행된다. 양자 중첩을 이용하는 양자컴퓨터는 기존의 컴퓨터가 할 수 없는 일을 하거나 효율을 극적으로 높일 수 있다(세상에서 가장 강력한 컴퓨터 참고). 혹시 생명체가 생존을 위해 양자 중첩을 이용하고 있는 사례는 없을까? 진화란 생존에 조금이라도 유리하면 그 방향으로 가는 거다. 양자 중첩이 좋다면 생명이 이용하지 못할 이유도 없다. 이름하여 양자생물학! 2007년 UC버클리대 플레밍 교수 연구팀은 광합성에서 양자 중첩의 증거를 발견한다. 광합성은 태양에너지를 화학에너지로 바꾸는 것으로 생명체의 가장 중요한 에너지원이다. 중·고등학교 생물시간에 ‘전자전달계’라는 것을 들어 봤을 것이다. 이때 나오는 반응물의 이름을 달달 외우던 악몽이 떠오르는 사람도 있을 거다. 깔때기 모양의 단백질에 빛이 닿으면 전자가 들떠서 깔때기 중심으로 이동하게 된다. 빛에 닿는 면적이 커야하므로 단백질이 깔때기 모양인 것은 당연하다. 다만 들뜬 전자의 이동 과정이 지나치게 효율적이라는 것이 의문이다. 전자를 공이라고 생각해보자. 중심이 어딘지 알 길 없으니 전자는 여기저기 마구잡이로 부딪히며 이동하고 당연히 에너지를 잃게 된다. 하지만 실제 에너지 효율은 예상보다 훨씬 높다. 왜 그럴까? 플래밍 교수는 여기에 양자 중첩이 작동한다고 제안한다. 전자가 모든 경로를 동시에 훑어보고 최단경로를 찾아 고속도로를 탄 것처럼 이동한다는 것이다. 경로들이 양자 중첩돼 있어야 가능한 얘기다. 하지만 결어긋남의 요인들이 득실거리는 생명체 내에서 식물이 어떻게 결맞음을 유지하는지는 여전히 미스터리다. 양자생물학은 철새의 비행도 설명한다. 철새가 지형지물 하나 없는 바다 한 가운데서 어떻게 방향을 찾아가는지는 여전히 불가사의다. 양자생물학의 설명방법은 이렇다. 철새의 눈에 빛이 들어가면 두 개의 라디칼이 쌍으로 만들어진다. 각 라디칼은 홀전자(unpaired electron)를 하나씩 갖는다. 이 두 홀전자들은 특별한 관계를 형성한다. 전자는 그 자체로 자석이 될 수 있는데, 이런 특성을 스핀이라 부른다. 특별한 관계라는 것은 전자의 스핀들이 양자얽힘 상태를 이룬다는 뜻이다. 예를 들어 한 전자의 스핀이 북쪽을 가리킬 때, 다른 전자의 스핀은 남쪽을 가리키는 방식이다. 이 경우 라디칼 전자들의 두 스핀은 두 가지 방식으로 얽힐 수 있다. 편의상 A와 B라고 부르자. A와 B 가운데 어떤 방식으로 얽힐지는 외부 자기장의 방향에 의존한다. 따라서 A와 B의 생성 비율을 보면 지구자기장 방향을 알 수 있다. 철새의 눈에 양자나침반이 들어있는 셈이다. 하지만 살아있는 새에서 이뤄진 실험이 아니기에 아직 논란이 있다. ● 인류는 양자생명체로 진화할까 1989년 로저 펜로즈는 ‘황제의 새마음’이란 책에서 양자역학이 인간의 의식을 이해하는 데 중요하다고 주장한다. 펜로즈는 우선 인간의 의식에 계산으로 설명할 수 없는 것이 있음을 보여준다. 예를 들어 “합이 홀수가 되는 두 짝수는 무엇인가?”라는 문제를 생각해보자. 짝수와 짝수를 더하면 언제나 짝수가 된다. 따라서 우리는 이런 짝수는 존재하지 않는다는 것을 안다. 컴퓨터는 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 계산을 시작할 거다. 2+2=4, 2+4=6, 4+4=8.... 하지만 이런 식으로는 결코 답을 구할 수 없다. 물론 이런 문제는 결과를 그냥 외워둘 수도 있겠지만, ‘페르마의 마지막 정리’나 ‘골드바흐 추측’ 같은 문제는 계산으로 절대 해결할 수 없다. 인류의 진화에도 양자법칙이 숨어있을까? - 과학동아(일러스트 김정훈) 제공 인류의 진화에도 양자법칙이 숨어있을까? - 과학동아(일러스트 김정훈) 제공 펜로즈는 양자역학을 이용해야 이런 문제가 해결된다고 주장했다. 구체적으로 뇌세포의 미세소관을 양자 중첩이 일어나는 곳으로 지목했다. 여기에 대한 주류학계의 반응은 냉랭하다. 양자 중첩이 인간의 의식에서 의미 있는 역할을 한다는 어떤 실험적 증거도 아직 없기 때문이다. 생명체 내에서 결맞음을 유지하는 것이 어렵다. 더구나 양자 중력까지 등장하는 그의 이론은 지나치게 앞서 갔다는 평가가 많다. 양자 중력은 아직 아무도 알지 못하는 물리학의 성배이기 때문이다. 진화의 역사를 보라. 양자역학이 생존에 이익이 된다면 생명은 이를 반드시 이용했을 것이다. 아직 이용하지 않았다면, 양자역학을 깨달은 바로 지금의 인류가 최초의 양자생명체가 될지도 모른다.","output":"본문에서는 양자생물학(quantum biology)에 대한 개요와 흥미로운 이론들에 대해 논의합니다. 양자생물학은 물리학의 한 분야인 양자역학이 생물학적 시스템과 어떻게 관련되는지를 탐구합니다. 기본적으로 모든 생명 현상은 원자와 분자 수준에서 이루어지며, 이러한 원자와 분자는 양자역학의 법칙에 따라 움직입니다. 에르빈 슈뢰딩거는 그의 저작 \\"What is Life?\\" (\\"생명이란 무엇인가?\\")에서 생명의 핵심인 유전현상이 양자역학적 원리에 의해 가능하다는 주장을 했으며, 이것은 나중에 DNA의 구조와 기능 발견을 통해 부분적으로 입증되었습니다. 본문은 광합성과 철새의 내비게이션 같은 생명 현상에서 양자역학이 어떤 역할을 할 수 있을지에 대한 현대 연구를 설명합니다. 예를 들어, 식물이 광합성을 통해 태양 에너지를 효율적으로 화학 에너지로 전환하는 과정에서 양자 중첩과 얽힘 같은 현상이 관여할 가능성이 제시됩니다. 또한, 철새가 방향을 찾는 데 있어 양자나침반의 작용을 할 수 있는 화학적 메커니즘을 가지고 있을 가능성에 관한 이론도 소개합니다. 마지막으로 인간의 의식과 관련하여 논란이 많은 주장이 있는데, 그 중 로저 펜로즈는 인간의 의식이 양자역학적 프로세스에 의존할 수 있다는 생각을 제시합니다. 다만 이러한 주장과 이론들은 여전히 논란의 여지가 있으며, 실제로 실험적으로 입증되지 않은 부분도 많습니다. 과학자들 사이에서도 이러한 개념을 둘러싼 의견이 분분하며, 양자생물학 분야는 계속해서 발전하고 있는 연구 분야입니다."},{"instruction":"Risk of not having a documented incident management policy and procedure","output":"Not having a documented incident management policy and procedure can introduce several risks to an organization. Incident management is a critical component of IT service management (ITSM) and having a clearly defined policy and procedure is essential to ensuring that incidents are handled in a swift, effective, and consistent manner. Here are some of the risks associated with not having these important documents in place: 1. **Inconsistent Response**: Without documented procedures, different team members may respond to incidents in different ways, leading to inconsistent and potentially ineffective incident handling. 2. **Slower Resolution Times**: A lack of clear processes can lead to confusion and delays in responding to and resolving incidents, potentially increasing downtime. 3. **Increased Impact**: With no standard protocol, the impact of incidents may be greater, as there may be delays in escalations and containment, leading to a wider spread of issues. 4. **Non-Compliance**: Many industries have regulations that require incident management policies and procedures (such as HIPAA, GDPR, or SOX). Failure to have these documented can lead to non-compliance issues and potential legal and financial penalties. 5. **Poor Communication**: Without guidelines on how to communicate during an incident, there may be confusion or information silos, leading to poor communication with staff, management, and potentially affected customers or clients. 6. **Lack of Accountability**: A clear policy outlines roles and responsibilities. Without this, it can be unclear who is responsible for what during an incident, leading to accountability issues. 7. **Difficulty in Training**: New staff or team members require training on how to manage incidents. Without documentation, training can be inconsistent, leading to variability in the skills and knowledge of the team. 8. **Limited Continuous Improvement**: Documented procedures typically include a post-incident review process to iterate and improve upon. Without such documentation, learning from past incidents and continuous improvement of the incident management process can be hindered. 9. **Damage to Reputation**: Poor incident handling can lead to customer dissatisfaction and negative public perception, which can ultimately harm the organization's reputation and lead to loss of business. 10. **Data Loss and System Integrity**: Failure to manage incidents effectively can lead to loss of data or compromises to system integrity, which could have long-term detrimental effects on the organization's operations. 11. **Resource Wastage**: Inefficient incident management could result in the wasteful use of resources, including both time and money, as more effort may be needed to resolve issues that could have been handled more effectively with a set procedure. 12. **Compromised Security Posture**: Incidents that involve security breaches especially require a swift and structured response. Lack of preparedness in this area can leave an organization more vulnerable to future attacks. In summary, without a documented incident management policy and procedure, an organization can suffer from operational inefficiencies, a weakened security posture, legal repercussions, and ultimately financial and reputational damage. It is important for organizations to understand these risks and work to develop, implement, and maintain comprehensive incident management policies and procedures to mitigate them."},{"instruction":"Risk of not having a documented incident management procedure","output":"Without a documented incident management procedure, organizations significantly increase their exposure to a variety of risks. Here are some specific risks tied to the absence of such a policy: 1. **Uncoordinated Response**: Without a clear procedure, incident response efforts can be disorganized, leading to confusion among staff members, duplication of efforts, or critical steps being overlooked. 2. **Increased Resolution Time**: A lack of procedure can result in longer incident resolution times, as team members may not know the most efficient way to address an issue, who to escalate it to, or how to prioritize different types of incidents. 3. **Greater Impact and Downtime**: When incidents are not managed effectively, the associated impact including systems downtime or data loss is likely to be more severe, potentially disrupting business operations and affecting service delivery to customers. 4. **Legal and Regulatory Risks**: Incidents, particularly those involving data breaches or non-compliance with industry standards, can lead to legal action or fines if not handled appropriately. Documented procedures help ensure that legal and regulatory requirements are met. 5. **Poor Incident Tracking and Analysis**: Without established procedures, it can be difficult to track incidents accurately and analyze them for patterns that might indicate underlying problems or vulnerabilities. 6. **Lack of Continuous Improvement**: An essential part of incident management is learning from each incident to improve future responses. Without documentation, this process of reflection and improvement may be haphazard or altogether neglected. 7. **Unclear Roles and Responsibilities**: Without documented procedures, staff members may not understand their specific roles during an incident, which can lead to inefficiencies and mistakes. 8. **Compromised Security**: Poorly managed incidents, especially security-related ones, could result in ongoing vulnerabilities or repeated breaches if the root cause is not identified and addressed appropriately. 9. **Reputation Damage**: Inefficient or slow responses to incidents can erode customer trust and damage the reputation of the organization, possibly leading to a loss of business or revenue. 10. **Staff Frustration and Morale**: Employees can become frustrated if they lack guidance during high-stress incident scenarios, which can negatively impact morale and lead to higher staff turnover. 11. **Data Integrity Issues**: Without a proper incident response, the integrity of data and systems can be compromised, leading to potential errors and mistrust in the system outputs. 12. **Ineffective Communication**: A structured communication plan is an essential part of incident management procedures. Without it, there can be miscommunication with stakeholders, leading to further issues and complications. In essence, not having a documented incident management procedure can lead to disorganized and inefficient handling of system failures, disruptions, or breaches, which can have wide-reaching operational, financial, and reputational consequences for an organization. It is crucial for businesses and organizations to recognize these risks and establish well-defined incident management procedures to handle unexpected events effectively and maintain resilience."},{"instruction":"Risk of not logging tickets for incidents in the helpdesk system","output":"Not logging tickets for incidents in a helpdesk system can result in a multitude of risks and challenges for an organization. Here's an overview of the potential risks associated with this practice: 1. **Lack of Traceability**: Without tickets, there is no record of the incidents that have occurred. This lack of documentation makes it difficult to track the frequency, type, and details of incidents, which is crucial for analyzing patterns and improving systems. 2. **Inability to Prioritize**: Tickets help in prioritizing incidents based on their severity, impact, or urgency. Without a logged ticket, critical issues may not get the attention they require in a timely manner, leading to potential damage or prolonged system downtime. 3. **Difficulty in Accountability**: It would be hard to assign responsibility for incident response and follow-up without a record of who handled what and when. Consequently, this may impede accountability and clarity on responsibilities among staff. 4. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: When incidents are not logged, there is a risk of duplication of effort as multiple staff members may work on the same issue without realizing it. This leads to a waste of resources and can delay the resolution of other issues. 5. **Compromised Service Levels**: Service level agreements (SLAs) often specify response and resolution times. Without incident tickets, it's challenging to track these metrics, potentially violating SLAs and harming customer satisfaction. 6. **Hindered Communication**: A ticketing system often serves as the main communication channel between users and IT support teams. Lacking this, communication can break down, leaving users uncertain about the status of their issues. 7. **Impact on Future Problem Solving**: Without historical data from logged tickets, IT departments lack valuable insights that could be used to prevent recurring issues or to resolve future problems more efficiently. 8. **Poor Incident Management**: Not logging tickets bypasses the structured process of categorizing, escalating, and resolving incidents, leading to a more chaotic and less effective management approach. 9. **Lack of Reporting and Measurement**: Management relies on reports generated from ticketing systems to measure performance and make informed decisions. Without tickets, creating accurate reports and assessments becomes impossible. 10. **Reduced User Satisfaction**: When users report issues, they expect updates and resolutions in a timely fashion. Without a ticketing system, managing these expectations and providing high-quality service is much more difficult. 11. **Non-Compliance with Regulations**: Certain industries have strict compliance requirements that mandate incident logging as a way to ensure transparency and accountability. Failure to log tickets could lead to non-compliance and associated penalties. 12. **Security Risks**: If security-related incidents are not logged, it becomes harder to detect patterns of attacks or breaches, hindering the ability to strengthen defenses and respond to security threats effectively. In summary, not logging tickets for incidents can disrupt an organization's ability to manage IT support effectively, potentially leading to decreased productivity, increased costs, poor customer service, compliance issues, and an inability to make data-driven decisions to improve IT services. It's essential for businesses to recognize these risks and ensure that a robust ticketing system is in place and used consistently by all team members."},{"instruction":"What is the risk of not having secured space in a data centre?","output":"Not having secured space in a data center exposes an organization to several significant risks. Data centers are designed to host critical IT infrastructure, and security is a paramount concern. Here are the main risks associated with the absence of secured space within a data center: 1. **Physical Security Breaches**: Without secured spaces, unauthorized persons might gain access to sensitive equipment, leading to theft, vandalism, or deliberate sabotage of hardware, which could result in data loss or service downtime. 2. **Data Theft**: If an organization does not secure its data center space, it becomes an easy target for data theft. Sensitive data could be extracted from unsecured servers or storage devices. 3. **Tampering**: Insecure data center space makes tampering with hardware and software easier, compromising the integrity and availability of systems and data. 4. **Environmental Risks**: Secured spaces are often designed with environmental controls to protect against fire, floods, and other disasters. Lack of such protections can increase the risk of damage to the infrastructure. 5. **Compliance Violations**: Many industries are governed by regulations that require physical security controls to protect sensitive data (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, PCI-DSS for payment card information). Failure to secure data center space can lead to non-compliance. 6. **Loss of Reputation and Trust**: If a breach occurs due to inadequate security, an organization can suffer reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and potential loss of business. 7. **Legal and Financial Consequences**: Data breaches can result in legal action, regulatory fines, and the cost of remediation, not to mention potential financial liabilities from lawsuits or the need to provide credit monitoring services to affected individuals. 8. **Increased Insurance Costs**: Organizations with inadequate security measures in place may face higher insurance premiums or may even struggle to obtain insurance coverage for cyber-related risks. 9. **Downtime and Business Disruption**: A security incident in a non-secured space could lead to significant system downtime, hampering business operations and causing financial losses due to disrupted services. 10. **Intellectual Property Loss**: Competitors or malicious individuals could potentially steal proprietary information or trade secrets if they gain access to unsecured spaces. 11. **Resource Drain**: Recovering from security breaches requires a significant investment of time and resources, diverting attention from business development and service improvement. By not securing spaces within a data center, an organization essentially leaves the door open for various threats that can have serious repercussions for its operations and credibility. It is critical for any entity operating out of a data center to ensure that the necessary physical security measures are in place to protect hardware, software, and data from unauthorized access and environmental hazards."},{"instruction":"What is the risk of not checking the ISO 27001 certification of a third party data centre annually?","output":"ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS), and it outlines how to manage information security in a company. It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. If an organization fails to check the ISO 27001 certification of a third-party data center annually, it exposes itself to several risks: 1. **Lapsed Certification**: Certifications like ISO 27001 are not permanent; they need to be renewed periodically through audits. Failing to check whether a third-party data center has maintained its certification could mean that your data is being stored in a facility that no longer meets ISO 27001 standards. 2. **Non-Compliance**: Using a data center that is not ISO 27001 certified—or one whose certification has lapsed—can lead to non-compliance with industry regulations, standards, or client contracts that require data to be stored in ISO 27001-certified facilities. 3. **Increased Security Risks**: ISO 27001 includes a comprehensive set of controls intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Not verifying certification could result in partnering with data centers that do not have these rigorous controls in place, increasing the risk of a data breach. 4. **Reputational Damage**: If an organization's data is compromised due to inadequate security practices at a data center, it can lead to reputational harm. Customers and partners may lose trust if they feel their data is not adequately protected. 5. **Financial Consequences**: A data breach can lead to direct financial losses due to fines, compensation, and the costs associated with breach remediation and recovery. 6. **Legal Liability**: In some cases, using a data center that does not maintain its ISO 27001 certification could expose an organization to legal liabilities, particularly if a breach occurs and it can be shown that due diligence was not performed. 7. **Loss of Confidential Data**: The risk of unauthorized access or leaks of sensitive data increases if the data center's security management is not up to standard, potentially leading to loss of trade secrets or intellectual property. 8. **Operational Disruption**: Should a security incident occur because of inadequate security practices, it could lead to operational disruption, system downtime, and reduced productivity. 9. **Diluted Competitive Advantage**: The security of a company's data can be a competitive advantage. Working with a non-certified data center could dilute this advantage if competitors with certified data center partners can guarantee higher levels of information security. 10. **Supply Chain Security Weakening**: The security of an organization is only as strong as the weakest link in its supply chain. Overlooking the certification status of a data center can introduce vulnerabilities into an organization's supply chain. To mitigate these risks, it's crucial for organizations to not only verify the existence of ISO 27001 certification at the outset of a relationship with a third-party data center but also to regularly ensure that the data center maintains its certification status and adherence to the latest information security best practices. Regular reviews, potentially included as a requirement in service level agreements (SLAs), help ensure that the data center's ISMS continues to align with the organization’s security standards and needs."},{"instruction":"risks of not having aerts when data centre service is interrupted","output":"Not having alerts when a data center service is interrupted can pose significant risks to an organization, impacting its operations, reputation, and bottom line. Here are key risks associated with the absence of such alerts: 1. **Delayed Response**: Without immediate alerts, there could be significant delays in recognizing and responding to a service interruption. This delayed response can prolong outages and increase the time required to restore service. 2. **Increased Downtime**: No alerts mean that service interruptions might go unnoticed until users or customers report them. This can lead to longer periods of downtime, which can be costly for businesses that rely on continuous service availability. 3. **Loss of Revenue**: For organizations that depend on data center services for their operations (e.g., e-commerce platforms), any interruption can result in immediate loss of revenue as transactions fail to process or customers turn to competitors. 4. **Data Loss or Corruption**: In some cases, a lack of alerts could mean that data loss or corruption goes undetected for longer periods, resulting in harder recovery scenarios or permanent loss of data. 5. **Damaged Reputation**: Customers expect reliability and prompt service. The longer an interruption goes unaddressed, the greater the risk of damage to an organization's reputation and customer trust. 6. **Decreased Productivity**: An interruption can halt employee productivity, especially if critical applications or data are inaccessible. Without timely alerts, the impact of disruptions on internal operations is amplified. 7. **Compliance Violations**: Many industries have regulations requiring prompt notification and management of service interruptions. Without alerts, an organization may inadvertently violate these regulations, potentially incurring legal penalties and fines. 8. **Compromised Security**: Some service interruptions may be indicative of a security breach. Failure to detect and respond to such incidents immediately due to lack of alerts can lead to more extensive security compromises. 9. **Customer Dissatisfaction and Loss**: Inadequate communication about service interruptions can lead to customer dissatisfaction. Without alerts and proactive communication, customer complaints might increase, potentially resulting in a loss of clientele. 10. **Increased Recovery Costs**: The longer an interruption goes undetected or unaddressed, the more expensive it may be to recover and restore services, leading to an overall increase in the cost of incidents. 11. **Missed SLA Obligations**: Organizations with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that guarantee uptime may face penalties or have to provide service credits to customers if SLA targets are missed due to undetected service interruptions. 12. **Ineffective Incident Management**: Real-time alerts are a critical component of an efficient incident management system. Not having alerts can disrupt the process of triaging, diagnosing, and resolving incidents, making incident management ineffective. For these reasons, it's essential for organizations to invest in robust monitoring and alerting systems that can detect service interruptions in real-time and notify the appropriate personnel to take swift action. This approach helps minimize the negative impact of any service interruptions that may occur within a data center."},{"instruction":"risk of not performing user access reviews at least annually","output":"Not performing user access reviews at least annually can lead to a host of security, compliance, and operational risks for an organization. User access reviews are critical in ensuring that only the right individuals have access to certain data and systems, and failing to perform them regularly can result in: 1. **Unauthorized Access**: Employees or external partners who have left the organization, changed roles, or no longer need access to certain systems may retain their access rights, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information. 2. **Privilege Accumulation**: Over time, individuals may accumulate access rights that exceed their job requirements, increasing the risk of insider threats, either malicious or accidental. 3. **Non-Compliance**: Many regulatory frameworks, including HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, and PCI-DSS, require regular reviews of user access as part of compliance. Failure to perform these reviews can lead to violations and significant fines. 4. **Data Breaches**: Without regular access reviews, it becomes more difficult to identify and mitigate the risk of data breaches caused by compromised accounts, especially those with elevated privileges. 5. **Lack of Accountability**: When access is not regularly reviewed and updated, it can be challenging to trace actions taken within systems back to specific individuals, compromising accountability and hindering investigations into unauthorized activities. 6. **Inefficient IT Operations**: Redundant or unnecessary user accounts can consume resources and increase administrative overhead, making IT operations less efficient. 7. **Increased Attack Surface**: Each user account, particularly those with special privileges, represents a potential attack vector. Unused or outdated accounts can provide an easy entry point for malicious actors. 8. **Loss of Intellectual Property**: Employees with access to more information than necessary for their job function increase the risk of sensitive company information being mishandled or intentionally leaked. 9. **Reputational Damage**: A security incident resulting from inadequate user access control can damage an organization's reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust and potential loss of business. 10. **Financial Loss**: Beyond fines for non-compliance, there are costs associated with the remediation of a security incident, legal liabilities, and potential loss of revenue due to business disruption. 11. **Risk of Social Engineering**: Attackers might exploit accounts that should have been deactivated to execute social engineering attacks, further compromising organizational security. 12. **Operational Risks**: Critical operations may be disrupted if unauthorized changes are made by users who should not have access to certain systems or data. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement a user access review process as part of their broader identity and access management (IAM) strategy. This process should ensure that all user accounts are regularly audited, necessary access adjustments are made promptly, and any changes are documented. By doing so, organizations can maintain tighter control over who has access to their critical systems and data, reducing the likelihood of security breaches and ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable regulations."},{"instruction":"risk of having a deficient new starter process","output":"Having a deficient process for onboarding new starters can expose an organization to various risks that can have negative repercussions on productivity, security, personnel, and overall business operations.

The surface area of a sphere is given by: A = 4πr^2 where r is the radius of the sphere. The radius can be calculated using the diameter D: r = D/2 Substituting the values in, we have: r = 3 in / 2 = 1.5 in = 0.125 ft A = 4π(0.125 ft)^2 = 0.196 ft^2 Now we can calculate the heat flux: q'' = 200 W / 0.196 ft^2 = 1020.4 W/ft^2 Using this heat flux value, we can now calculate the steady surface temperature: q'' = σε(T_s^4 - T_∞^4) 1020.4 W/ft^2 = 5.67x10^-8 W/m^2·K^4 * 0.10 * (T_s^4 - 70°F^4) Rearranging and solving for T_s, we get: T_s^4 - 70°F^4 = (1020.4 W/ft^2 * 0.10) / (5.67x10^-8 W/m^2·K^4) T_s^4 - 70°F^4 = 1796460448.66 K^4 T_s^4 = 1796460448.66 K^4 + (70°F)^4 T_s^4 = 1796460828.66 K^4 + 13782408.31 °F^4 T_s^4 ≈ 1796474657 K^4 Taking the fourth root of both sides gives us: T_s ≈ (1796474657 K^4)^(1/4) T_s ≈ 1934.54 K Therefore, the steady surface temperature of the light bulb is approximately 1934.54 K. (b) To find the time required for the surface temperature of the bulb to reach this steady value, we need to know the thermal properties of the bulb. Specifically, we need to know the thermal conductivity (k) and the specific heat capacity (c) of the bulb material. However, since these properties are not provided in the data, it is not possible to calculate the time required for the surface temperature to reach the steady value."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The following categories of data are particularly important: 1. **Market Data**: Gather data on current market trends related to the two unidentified studies/fields you will be intersecting. This includes the size of each market, growth trends, and forecasting reports. 2. **Consumer Data**: Understand the niche market's demographics, psychographics, and unique demands. Conduct surveys, interviews, or utilize existing consumer behavior studies to learn about their preferences, willingness to pay, and unmet needs. 3. **Competitive Analysis Data**: Analyze any current solutions or businesses that may overlap with the concept, even partially. Look at their offerings, pricing, and market positioning. 4. **Technological Capabilities Data**: Since you need to maximize efficiency with minimal human resources, you should assess the current digital solutions, automation tools, and software that can be implemented within the business to reduce manual effort. 5. **Legal and Compliance Data**: Review legal requirements and compliance standards for your intended business to ensure that your forecasts and plans do not omit potential legal costs or restrictions. 6. **Financial Data**: You need granular cost data, including potential startup expenses (like licensing, equipment, technology stack, initial marketing), variable costs (like transaction fees, cost of goods sold if relevant), and fixed recurrent expenses (like rent, software subscriptions). 7. **Pricing Strategy Information**: Investigate psychological pricing strategies, elasticity of demand for your niche market, and premium pricing tactics if targeting high-paying clients. 8. **Human Resource Requirements**: Look into the cost of talent, even part-time, for the skills necessary to operate the business model you envisage, and factor in the cost of any potential training or professional development. 9. **Operational Efficiency Data**: Analyze case studies or benchmark reports of similar lean operations. Identify best practices for running an efficient two-person team. 10. **Scalability Data**: Research how similar business models have scaled in the past. Consider whether your business plan has potential for growth without a significant increase in human resources. 11. **Historical Data**: If available, analyze historical data of similar intersections or novel ventures, which might inform potential market receptivity and the financial trajectory of analogous startups. Having gathered and analyzed these data, you can construct a more accurate financial forecast and tuned business proposal. Remember, forecasts by nature are speculative and should be re-evaluated regularly as new real-world data comes in. Your proposals should include projections with best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios to be prepared for various possible outcomes."},{"instruction":"5-6. Consider an ordinary light bulb. (a) Calculate the steady surface temperature of the lighted bulb. (b) Find the time required for the surface tempera- ture of the bulb to reach this steady value. Data: P = 200 watts, δ = (1/64) in., ρ = 170 Btu/lbm.°F, α = 0.10 (emissivity), Cp = 0.2 lbm/ft³, T = 70°F, D = 3 in","output":"In order to calculate the steady surface temperature of the light bulb, we can use the equation: P = σ * ε * A * (T^4 - Ts^4), where: P = power input to the bulb (200 watts), σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W/m^2K^4), ε = emissivity of the bulb (0.10), A = surface area of the bulb (4πr^2), T = temperature of the surroundings (70°F or 21.11°C), Ts = steady surface temperature of the bulb. First, we need to convert the given data into SI units: δ = (1/64) in. = (1/64) * (0.0254) m ≈ 0.000396875 m, ρ = 170 Btu/lbm.°F * (4186.8 J/Btu) * (1 lbm / 0.453592 kg) * (1 °F / 1.8 K) ≈ 708.35 kg/m^3, Cp = 0.2 lbm/ft³ * (16.0185 kg/m³ / 0.3048)^3 ≈ 1263.50 J/kg K, D = 3 in = 3 * 0.0254 m ≈ 0.0762 m. The surface area of the bulb, A, can be calculated as: A = 4πr^2 = 4π(D/2)^2 = 4π(0.0762/2)^2 ≈ 0.018183 m^2. Next, we need to rearrange the equation to solve for Ts: Ts^4 = T^4 - (P / (σ * ε * A)). Now we can substitute the given values into the equation: Ts^4 = (21.11 + 273.15)^4 - (200 / (5.67 x 10^-8 * 0.10 * 0.018183)). Calculating this expression gives us: Ts^4 ≈ 298.26^4 - (200 / (5.67 x 10^-8 * 0.10 * 0.018183)). Using a calculator, we find: Ts ≈ 273.15 + (298.26^4 - (200 / (5.67 x 10^-8 * 0.10 * 0.018183)))^(1/4). Therefore, the steady surface temperature of the light bulb is approximately Ts ≈ 70.55°C. To find the time required for the surface temperature of the bulb to reach this steady value, we need to use the formula for time constant: τ = ρ * Cp * V / 2 * α * A, where: τ = time constant, ρ = density of the bulb material (708.35 kg/m^3), Cp = specific heat capacity of the bulb material (1263.50 J/kg K), V = volume of the bulb (π(D/2)^2 * δ), α = thermal diffusivity (k / (ρ * Cp)), A = surface area of the bulb (0.018183 m^2), k = thermal conductivity of the bulb material (unknown). Let's assume a reasonable value for the thermal conductivity of the bulb material as k = 100 W/m K. The volume of the bulb, V, can be calculated as: V = π(D/2)^2 * δ = π(0.0762/2)^2 * 0.000396875 ≈ 1.727 x 10^-6 m^3. The thermal diffusivity, α, can be calculated as: α = k / (ρ * Cp) = 100 / (708.35 * 1263.50) ≈ 1.25 x 10^-5 m^2/s. Now we can substitute the known values into the equation for time constant: τ = 708.35 * 1263.50 * 1.727 x 10^-6 / (2 * 1.25 x 10^-5 * 0.018183). Calculating this expression gives us: τ ≈ 708.35 * 1263.50 * 1.727 x 10^-6 / (2 * 1.25 x 10^-5 * 0.018183). Simplifying further: τ ≈ 7.126 × 10^-3 s.

L’individuazione dei limiti entro i quali si può dire integrato il giustificato motivo oggettivo sono particolarmente rilevanti. Infatti, quando ne viene accertata l’insussistenza, il licenziamento comminato risulta illegittimo e il lavoratore ha diritto a ottenere le tutele offertegli dalla legge. Le garanzie offerte al lavoratore, in caso di licenziamento illegittimo, sono profondamente mutate in questi ultimi anni. Fino al 2012, l’illegittimità del licenziamento per motivo oggettivo era sempre sanzionata – per i rapporti di lavoro rientranti nel campo di applicazione dell’art. 18 dello Statuto dei lavoratori – con la condanna del datore di lavoro alla reintegrazione del lavoratore, oltre al risarcimento integrale del danno retributivo e al versamento dei contributi previdenziali per il periodo intercorrente tra il momento del licenziamento e quello della reintegrazione. La riforma del mercato del lavoro del 2012 ha apportato una prima, sostanziale modifica a questo regime sanzionatorio, introducendo una disciplina che, invece di tutelare in ogni caso la stabilità del rapporto lavorativo, modula le sanzioni comminabili al datore di lavoro a seconda della gravità del vizio che inficia il licenziamento, limitando la reintegrazione a un novero ristretto di ipotesi. In particolare, il nuovo art. 18 della legge 300/1970, così come modificato dalla c.d. legge Fornero, prevede che, in caso di invalidità del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il giudice può ordinare la reintegrazione del lavoratore in 3 soli casi: allorché accerti “la manifesta insussistenza del fatto posto a base del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo”; in caso di licenziamento intimato per motivo oggettivo consistente nell’inidoneità fisica o psichica del lavoratore; in caso di licenziamento intimato nel periodo di comporto. In tutti gli altri casi, invece, al lavoratore illegittimamente licenziato spetta una tutela esclusivamente economica. Le suddette garanzie valgono, peraltro, per i soli lavoratori assunti presso datori di lavoro che superano le soglie dimensionali previste dall’art. 18 (unità produttiva con più di 15 lavoratori, o più di 5 se si tratta di imprenditore agricolo, o più di 60 dipendenti in totale). Al di sotto di tali soglie, trova invece applicazione il più blando regime di tutela previsto dall’art. 8 della legge 604/1966, così come sostituito dall’art. 2 della legge 108/1990, che riconosce al lavoratore illegittimamente licenziato il solo diritto a percepire un indennizzo economico. Il progressivo depotenziamento delle tutele offerte ai lavoratori in caso di licenziamento ingiusto ha di recente raggiunto il suo apice, con l’approvazione del Decreto legislativo 23/2015, in tema di “contratto a tempo indeterminato a tutele crescenti”, attuativo della legge delega 183 del 2014 (c.d. Jobs Act), che ha introdotto nel nostro ordinamento un nuovo regime sanzionatorio da applicarsi in caso di licenziamento illegittimo; regime che, per espressa indicazione del legislatore, troverà applicazione nei confronti di tutti i lavoratori assunti a decorrere dalla data di entrata in vigore del decreto (7 marzo 2015). La nuova disciplina continua a distinguere tra lavoratori assunti presso imprese che superano le soglie numeriche fissate dall’art. 18 e lavoratori assunti presso datori di lavoro che non raggiungono dette soglie. Rispetto alla disciplina previgente, tuttavia, il decreto legislativo 23/2015 si segnala per una significativa riduzione delle garanzie riconosciute ai lavoratori, in particolare in ragione della sostanziale diminuzione delle ipotesi in cui il giudice può ordinare la reintegrazione nel posto di lavoro del dipendente illegittimamente licenziato. In particolare, per quanto riguarda il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il decreto prevede che il giudice possa ordinare la reintegrazione del lavoratore (assunto presso un’impresa di maggiori dimensioni) nel solo caso in cui il giudice accerti il difetto di giustificazione per motivo consistente nella disabilità fisica o psichica del lavoratore. I regimi di tutela applicabili in caso di licenziamento illegittimo di un lavoratore assunto prima del 7 marzo 2015In alto L’art. 18 della legge 300/1970 (Statuto dei Lavoratori), come modificato dalla legge 92/2012 di riforma del mercato del lavoro, e l’art. 8 della legge 604/1966, così come sostituito dall’art. 2 della Legge 108/1990, disciplinano le conseguenze del licenziamento illegittimo di un lavoratore assunto a tempo indeterminato prima del 7 marzo 2015 (data di entrata in vigore del Decreto legislativo 23/2015, che ha introdotto un nuovo regime sanzionatorio per le ipotesi di licenziamento ingiusto). Dette norme distinguono, in primo luogo, a seconda che il licenziamento sia stato intimato nell’ambito di un’impresa che abbia sino a quindici dipendenti oppure nell’ambito di un’impresa che ne abbia almeno sedici. Nel primo caso e a prescindere dal vizio individuato, il giudice annulla il licenziamento e condanna il datore di lavoro a riassumere il dipendente entro il termine di tre giorni, oppure, in mancanza, a versargli un risarcimento, la cui misura viene determinata tra un minimo di 2,5 e un massimo di 6 mensilità (tenendo conto del numero dei dipendenti occupati, delle dimensioni dell’impresa, dell’anzianità di servizio del lavoratore, nonché del comportamento e della condizione delle parti). Nel secondo caso, invece, le conseguenze sanzionatorie sono stabilite dall’art. 18 Statuto dei lavoratori. La norma indicata, come detto, ha subito radicali modifiche per effetto della legge 92/2012. Prima di tale intervento, infatti, era prevista una tutela unica (cd. tutela reale), che comportava la reintegrazione del lavoratore e il risarcimento pieno del danno (con il pagamento delle retribuzioni e della contribuzione dal licenziamento fino all’effettiva reintegrazione e, comunque, nella misura minima di 5 mensilità). Il nuovo testo dell’art. 18, invece, prevede il seguente sistema di tutele, che mutano a seconda del vizio riscontrato nel licenziamento: quando non ricorrono gli estremi del giustificato motivo oggettivo per manifesta insussistenza del fatto posto a base del licenziamento, il giudice applica la c.d. tutela reale attenuata (reintegrazione nel posto di lavoro e indennizzo commisurato alla retribuzione con il limite di 12 mensilità, oltre al versamento dei contributi previdenziali per tutto il periodo dal giorno del licenziamento a quello della reintegrazione); la c.d. tutela reale attenuata si applica anche nei casi di licenziamento intimato nel periodo di comporto e per giustificato motivo oggettivo consistente nell’inidoneità fisica o psichica del lavoratore; nelle altre ipotesi in cui accerti che non ricorrono gli estremi del giustificato motivo addotto dal datore di lavoro, il giudice applica la c.d. tutela obbligatoria standard (ossia condanna il datore al pagamento di un’indennità risarcitoria in una misura compresa fra 12 e 24 mensilità della retribuzione globale di fatto, tenendo conto dell’anzianità del lavoratore, del numero dei dipendenti, della dimensione dell’attività economica e del comportamento e condizioni delle parti); nell’ipotesi in cui si sia verificata soltanto una violazione dell’obbligo di specifica motivazione del licenziamento (previsto dall’art. 2, co. 2, della legge 604 del 1966) ovvero della procedura preventiva da svolgersi davanti all’Ispettorato territoriale del lavoro, introdotta dalla stessa riforma del 2012 (se ne parlerà nei prossimi paragrafi), si applica la c.d. tutela obbligatoria ridotta: il giudice dichiara l’inefficacia del licenziamento e condanna il datore di lavoro al pagamento di un’indennità variabile tra 6 e 12 mensilità della retribuzione globale di fatto, da valutarsi da parte del giudice in relazione alla gravità della violazione formale o procedurale commessa dal datore di lavoro. Sotto il profilo procedurale, il legislatore del 2012, per spingere le parti a trovare soluzioni consensuali alla controversia, ha inoltre introdotto una procedura preventiva in sede amministrativa che il datore di lavoro deve necessariamente promuovere se vuole intimare un licenziamento per motivi economici. Più precisamente, la riforma prevede che, in questo caso, il licenziamento debba essere preceduto da una comunicazione preventiva all’Ispettorato territoriale del lavoro (Itl), ove ha sede l’unità produttiva nella quale è impiegato il lavoratore. La comunicazione deve essere inoltre trasmessa per conoscenza a quest’ultimo. In tale comunicazione, il datore di lavoro deve indicare la propria intenzione di procedere al licenziamento e i motivi del medesimo, oltre alle eventuali misure per la ricollocazione. Entro 7 giorni dalla ricezione della richiesta, l’Itl trasmette alle parti la convocazione per un incontro (che si deve svolgere secondo le disposizioni contenute nell’art. 410 cod. proc. civ.) finalizzato ad esaminare eventuali soluzione alternative al recesso. La procedura deve comunque concludersi entro 20 giorni dalla data di invio della convocazione, salvo che le parti non chiedano una proroga per arrivare a un accordo o che la procedura non debba essere sospesa per legittimo impedimento del lavoratore (la sospensione non può comunque essere superiore a 15 giorni). Essa può concludersi in diversi modi: se il tentativo di conciliazione fallisce o il termine di 20 giorni decorre inutilmente, il datore di lavoro può comunicare al lavoratore il licenziamento che ha efficacia a decorrere dalla prima comunicazione; se la conciliazione ha esito positivo e prevede la risoluzione consensuale del rapporto, il lavoratore ha diritto di accedere alla Nuova assicurazione sociale per l’impiego. Qualora tale procedura non venga rispettata, il licenziamento deve essere dichiarato inefficace ai sensi del nuovo art. 18 dello Statuto dei lavoratori: in tal caso, il giudice applica la c.d. tutela obbligatoria ridotta (condanna il datore di lavoro al pagamento di un’indennità risarcitoria compresa fra 6 e 12 mensilità della retribuzione globale di fatto, misurandola in relazione alla gravità del vizio formale o procedurale commesso). Con un recente intervento normativo, il legislatore ha peraltro stabilito che la suddetta procedura non si applica: in caso di licenziamento per superamento del periodo di comporto di cui all’art. 2110 c.c.; ai licenziamenti e alle interruzioni del rapporto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato previsti dall’art. 2, co. 34, della Legge 92/2012; si tratta, in particolare: dei licenziamenti effettuati in conseguenza di cambi di appalto, ai quali siano succedute assunzioni presso altri datori di lavoro, in attuazione di clausole sociali che garantiscano la continuità occupazionale prevista dai contratti collettivi nazionali di lavoro stipulati dalle organizzazioni sindacali dei lavoratori e dei datori di lavoro comparativamente più rappresentative sul piano nazionale; delle ipotesi di interruzione di rapporto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato, nel settore delle costruzioni edili, per completamento delle attività e chiusura del cantiere. I regimi di tutela applicabili in caso di licenziamento illegittimo di un lavoratore assunto dopo l’entrata in vigore del decreto legislativo 23/2015In alto Al pari della disciplina applicabile ai lavoratori assunti prima del 7 marzo 2015 (legge 300/1970 e legge 604/1966), anche il Decreto legislativo 23/2015 prevede regimi di tutela differenti a seconda che il licenziamento illegittimo riguardi lavoratori assunti presso imprese che superano le soglie numeriche fissate dall’art. 18 della legge 300/1970 ovvero lavoratori assunti presso datori di lavoro che non raggiungono dette soglie. A. Le tutele per i dipendenti di imprese che superano le soglie dimensionali previste dall’art. 18 della legge 300 del 1970In alto Per quanto riguarda i dipendenti di imprese di maggiori dimensioni, la nuova disciplina prevede che, in caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il giudice possa ordinare la reintegrazione del lavoratore nella sola ipotesi in cui accerti “il difetto di giustificazione per motivo consistente nella disabilità fisica o psichica del lavoratore” (art. 2, co. 4). In questa ipotesi, il datore di lavoro è inoltre condannato al versamento dei contributi previdenziali e assistenziali, e il dipendente ha diritto di percepire un’indennità risarcitoria commisurata all’ultima retribuzione di riferimento per il calcolo del trattamento di fine rapporto e corrispondente al periodo che va dal giorno del licenziamento fino a quello dell’effettiva reintegrazione. Da tale indennità va dedotto quanto il lavoratore abbia eventualmente percepito per lo svolgimento di altre attività lavorative (c.d. aliunde perceptum). In ogni caso, l’indennità non può essere inferiore a 5 mensilità. In alternativa alla reintegrazione, e fermo restando il diritto a ottenere il risarcimento del danno, il lavoratore può chiedere al datore di lavoro – con richiesta da effettuarsi entro 30 giorni dalla comunicazione del deposito della pronuncia o dall’invito del datore di lavoro a riprendere servizio, se anteriore – un’indennità pari a 15 mensilità dell’ultima retribuzione di riferimento per il calcolo del trattamento di fine rapporto. L’indennità non è assoggettata a contribuzione previdenziale. Fuori da tale ipotesi, in tutti gli altri casi di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo illegittimo il rapporto si estingue comunque e al lavoratore è dovuta unicamente una indennità che oscilla tra le 6 e le 36 mensilità (da 2 a 12, se si tratta di violazione procedimentale). Più in particolare, l’art. 3, co. 1, del decreto, dopo l’intervento della Corte Costituzionale nel 2018, stabilisce che, in caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo soggettivo, allorché il giudice accerti l’illegittimità del licenziamento, dichiara l’estinzione del rapporto di lavoro e condanna il datore di lavoro al pagamento di un’indennità, non assoggettata a contribuzione previdenziale, tra un minimo di 6 mensilità e un massimo di 36 mensilità (la base di calcolo è costituita, anche in questo caso, dall’ultima retribuzione di riferimento per il calcolo del trattamento di fine rapporto). Il giudice dovrà stabilire l’indennità tenendo conto, oltre che dell’anzianità di servizio, anche del numero di dipendenti occupati, delle dimensioni aziendali, del comportamento e delle condizioni delle parti. Al lavoratore spetta un mero indennizzo economico anche nell’ipotesi di licenziamento illegittimo per violazione del requisito di motivazione di cui all’art. 2, co. 2, della legge 604 del 1966. In questo caso, però, l’indennità risulta dimezzata: sarà pari a 1 mensilità per ogni anno di servizio, con un limite minimo di 2 mensilità e un limite massimo pari a 12 mensilità. Va infine segnalato che il Decreto legislativo 23/2015 esclude, per i nuovi assunti, l’applicazione della procedura preventiva prevista dall’art. 7 della legge 604 del 1966, introdotta dalla riforma del 2012. Si tratta di una novità non indolore per i lavoratori: infatti, come si è visto in precedenza, nell’ipotesi in cui tale procedura si chiuda con un accordo che prevede la risoluzione consensuale del rapporto di lavoro, anziché con il licenziamento, la legge garantisce comunque l’accesso alle prestazioni previdenziali per la disoccupazione involontaria. Dalla mancata applicazione di tale disciplina ai lavoratori interessati dal decreto legislativo 23/2015 deriva che tali lavoratori, allorché dovessero stipulare accordi che prevedano la risoluzione consensuale del rapporto, si precluderebbero la possibilità di accedere alle prestazioni per la disoccupazione. B. Le tutele per i dipendenti dei datori di lavoro che non soddisfano i requisiti dimensionali dell’art. 18 della legge 300 del 1970In alto Il decreto legislativo 23/2015, sul contratto a tutele crescenti, si occupa anche dei dipendenti presso datori di lavoro che non raggiungono le soglie numeriche richieste per l’applicazione dell’art. 18. In particolare, l’art. 9 del decreto legislativo 23 del 2015 stabilisce che, nei confronti di tali lavoratori, trova applicazione il medesimo regime di tutele previsto per i dipendenti delle imprese di maggiori dimensioni, ma la tutela economica risulta dimezzata e soggiace al limite massimo di 6 mensilità. In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo di un lavoratore occupato presso un datore di lavoro minore, allorché il giudice accerti l’illegittimità del provvedimento espulsivo, il lavoratore avrà pertanto diritto a un indennizzo economico (non assoggettato a contribuzione previdenziale) di importo pari a una mensilità per ogni anno di servizio; in ogni caso, l’indennizzo non può essere inferiore a 3 mensilità, né può superare le 6 mensilità. In caso di licenziamento illegittimo per violazione del requisito di motivazione, al lavoratore spetterà, invece, un’indennità (non assoggettata a contribuzione previdenziale) pari a mezza mensilità per ogni anno di servizio, con un limite minimo di 1 mensilità e un limite massimo di 6 mensilità. C. L’offerta di conciliazioneIn alto Il decreto legislativo 23/2015 introduce una nuova procedura conciliativa, finalizzata a rendere più rapida la definizione del contenzioso sul licenziamento, che prevede l’immediato pagamento di un indennizzo da parte del datore di lavoro. In particolare, l’art. 6 del decreto stabilisce che, in caso di licenziamento, il datore di lavoro, al fine di evitare il giudizio, entro i termini di impugnazione stragiudiziale del licenziamento (60 giorni), può convocare il lavoratore presso una delle sedi conciliative indicate dal quarto comma dell’art. 2113 c.c. (tra cui, in particolare, le commissioni di conciliazione presso le direzioni provinciali del lavoro) e dall’art. 76 del decreto legislativo 276 del 2003, e offrirgli un assegno circolare di importo pari a 1 mensilità per ogni anno di servizio, e comunque non inferiore a 3 mensilità e non superiore a 27 mensilità. Per incentivare questo tipo di soluzione, il legislatore ha previsto che detto indennizzo non costituisce reddito imponibile per il lavoratore e non è assoggettato a contribuzione previdenziale. L’accettazione dell’assegno da parte del lavoratore comporta l’estinzione del rapporto alla data del licenziamento e la rinuncia all’impugnazione del licenziamento anche qualora il lavoratore l’abbia già proposta. Ai sensi dell’art. 9 del decreto, la procedura conciliativa si applica anche ai lavoratori assunti presso datori di lavoro che non raggiungono le soglie dimensionali fissate dall’art. 18 della legge 300/1970; in questo caso, tuttavia, l’importo dell’assegno offerto al lavoratore è dimezzato e non può in ogni caso superare le 6 mensilità.

Più precisamente, la giurisprudenza prevalente riteneva che, in un caso come quello indicato, il datore di lavoro avesse senz’altro la possibilità di licenziare il lavoratore in questione, senza neanche dover provare l’impossibilità di utilizzarlo in mansioni diverse. Il citato orientamento era eccessivamente punitivo, per di più in contrasto con il principio, pacifico in giurisprudenza, che il datore di lavoro, che avesse licenziato un proprio dipendente per giustificato motivo oggettivo, dovesse fornire la prova dell’impossibilità di utilizzarlo altrimenti. Anche in considerazione di quanto si è appena detto, un orientamento più recente, benché ancora minoritario, era giunto alla conclusione che il lavoratore diventato inidoneo a svolgere la propria mansione potesse essere licenziato a condizione che il datore di lavoro dimostrasse, appunto, l’impossibilità di utilizzarlo in altre mansioni equivalenti e compatibili con la sua ridotta capacità lavorativa, naturalmente senza che ciò comportasse una modifica dell’assetto aziendale. Questa era stata la decisione assunta dalla Corte di cassazione, per esempio, con la sentenza n. 7908 del 23/8/97. Come si diceva, il contrasto è stato risolto dalle Sezioni Unite, con la sentenza n. 7755 del 7/8/98. La citata pronuncia è giunta ad una soluzione che, pur essendo intermedia tra le due che si erano precedentemente delineate, è sostanzialmente favorevole al lavoratore. Infatti, le Sezioni Unite sono partite dal presupposto che la prestazione del lavoratore diventato inidoneo è realmente impossibile, con conseguente legittimità del licenziamento, a condizione che quel lavoratore non possa svolgere altra mansione professionalmente equivalente a quella che gli era stata assegnata. Per questo motivo, il Giudice deve considerare sia le residue capacità lavorative del lavoratore, che l’organizzazione aziendale; sulla scorta di questa comparazione, potrà essere valutata la persistenza dell’interesse del datore di lavoro alla prestazione di quel lavoratore. In ogni caso, spetta al datore di lavoro provare l’impossibilità di utilizzare altrimenti quel lavoratore. Tuttavia, mancando nell’organizzazione aziendale una mansione equivalente, l’indagine deve essere estesa anche alle mansioni dequalificanti: è vero – sostiene infatti la Corte – che l’art. 2103 c.c. dispone la nullità di ogni patto contrario al divieto di dequalificazione, ma è anche vero che la salvaguardia del posto di lavoro è un bene primario, per tutelare il quale è ammissibile sacrificare interessi di minor rilevanza, qual è appunto quello che sottende il divieto di dequalificazione. Come si vede, rispetto alla citata Cass. 7755 del 1998, la pronuncia delle Sezioni Unite ha esteso la verifica della possibilità di utilizzare altrimenti il lavoratore anche in mansioni dequalificanti. In questo modo, si solleva il delicato problema (non nuovo, per la verità) della possibilità di sacrificare interessi pur importanti in nome della tutela di altri interessi, ritenuti prioritari. In ogni caso, rispetto all’orientamento che era prevalente, la sentenza delle Sezioni Unite rappresenta sicuramente un sensibile passo in avanti, perché sancisce comunque il principio che la sopravvenuta inidoneità del lavoratore non costituisce di per sé un giustificato motivo di licenziamento. Illegittimità del licenziamento inflitto ad un lavoratore perché sieropositivoIn alto Il licenziamento inflitto ad un lavoratore sieropositivo a causa della sua condizione di salute è sicuramente illegittimo. A tale riguardo, conviene preliminarmente ricordare che chi è sieropositivo non è affatto malato: la sieropositività significa solamente la presenza del virus HIV; tuttavia, il virus svilupperà la malattia solo dopo una incubazione molto lunga (anche 15 anni) e, anzi, non è detto che la malattia si manifesti. Inoltre, anche una volta che compaiano i primi segni della malattia, si tratta pur sempre di una sintomatologia imprevedibile e destinata a scomparire per poi ricomparire secondo cicli altrettanto imprevedibili. In buona sostanza, il sieropositivo non è inabile al lavoro perché non è malato; il malato di AIDS è inabile al lavoro solo durante le parentesi in cui si manifestano i sintomi della malattia. Inoltre, tanto il sieropositivo quanto il malato di AIDS non possono contagiare i compagni di lavoro. E’ ormai accertato che il virus dell’AIDS si trasmette solo tramite lo scambio di sangue o nel corso di rapporti sessuali con penetrazione o con contatti sangue / sperma. Questo significa che rapporti generici, non sessuali, sono inidonei al contagio. Sulla base di queste premesse, la Commissione Nazionale per la lotta all’AIDS, nominata dal Ministero della sanità, ha escluso la possibilità di contagio attraverso rapporti casuali in ambienti di lavoro o la comune manipolazione di oggetti. Inoltre, la stessa Commissione ha escluso la possibilità di contrarre il virus dell’AIDS mediante l’ingestione di cibi o di bevande, o per via aerea, fecale o orale. In buona sostanza, tanto il sieropositivo quanto il malato di AIDS non possono contagiare i colleghi con i quali intrattengano ordinari rapporti di colleganza, né possono costituire un pericolo per il pubblico neppure nel caso in cui, per esempio, svolgano la mansione di cuoco o barista. Per i motivi sopra indicati, il datore di lavoro non può addurre nessun motivo che possa seriamente giustificare l’allontanamento di un lavoratore sieropositivo o malato di AIDS. Come si è visto, infatti, il datore di lavoro non può lamentare la sopravvenuta inabilità al lavoro, che non è configurabile se non durante la conclamazione della malattia e comunque, anche in questo caso, solo ciclicamente. Neppure, si potrebbe paventare la possibilità di estendere il contagio tra i colleghi e nei confronti del pubblico perché, come pure si è visto, gli ordinari rapporti sociali non presentano il rischio di trasmissione del virus. Pertanto, il licenziamento del lavoratore sieropositivo o malato di AIDS è sicuramente ingiustificato e, come tale, illegittimo e, per essere rimosso, dovrà essere impugnato davanti alla Autorità giudiziaria. Obbligo di repechageIn alto Nel diritto del lavoro l’espressione “obbligo di repechage” rimanda al una elaborazione giurisprudenziale ormai consolidata in materia di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, ovvero quello determinato “da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, all’organizzazione del lavoro e al regolare funzionamento di essa” (art. 3 della legge 15 luglio 1966 n. 604). Tali ragioni, come noto, possono dipendere da specifiche esigenze aziendali (ad es. una riorganizzazione che comporti la soppressione del posto occupato da un determinato dipendente) oppure da situazioni riferibili al lavoratore, ma a lui non addebitabili in termini di inadempimento (ad es. la sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica all’esercizio delle mansioni contrattuali). In materia, la giurisprudenza della Corte di cassazione afferma infatti che l’onere della prova gravante sul datore di lavoro ai sensi dell’art. 5 della legge n. 604/’66 relativamente alla esistenza di un giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento si estende altresì alla dimostrazione di non poter ragionevolmente (senza che ciò comporti rilevanti modifiche organizzative comportanti ampliamenti di organico o innovazioni strutturali: Cass. 7/1/05 n. 239, pres. Senese, est. D’Angelo; 30/8/00 n. 11427, pres. Ianniruberto, est. Vidiri) utilizzare il dipendente interessato in altre mansioni equivalenti o, in mancanza. anche in mansioni deteriori, col limite del rispetto della dignità del lavoratore (cfr., tra le molte, Cass. 19/8/04 n. 16305, pres. Mattone, est. Balletti). Tale orientamento invoca talvolta la regola, desumibile dalla disciplina limitativa dei licenziamenti, del licenziamento come extrema ratio (ad es. Cass. 11/5/00 n. 6057, pres. De Musis, est. Vigolo o 20/5/09 n. 11720, pres. Ianniruberto, est. Napoletano) e comunque della necessità di un equilibrato contemperamento, in materia, tra gli interessi del datore di lavoro e quelli del lavoratore, in un’ottica solidaristica e di buona fede nei relativi rapporti (ad. es. Cass. 2/8/01 n. 10574, pres. Saggio, est. Cellerino). In un periodo iniziale e fino al 1998, la giurisprudenza della suprema Corte aveva limitato l’affermazione di principio alle ipotesi di soppressione del posto e in genere alle altre ipotesi di giustificato motivo per specifiche esigenze aziendali (cfr. Cass. 13/10/97 n. 9967, pres. Pontrandolfi, est. Mazzarella), mentre ne escludeva l’applicazione al caso in cui l’esigenza aziendale derivasse da un fatto riferibile al dipendente (ad es. per sopravvenuta inidoneità all’esercizio delle mansioni contrattuali: v. ad es. Cass. 6/11/96 n. 9684, pres. Pontrandolfi, est. Trezza). Sull’argomento, sono poi intervenute le sezioni unite della Corte di cassazione, che con la sentenza 7/8/98 n. 7755, pres. La Torre, est. Roselli, hanno esteso il principio anche al caso di sopravvenuta infermità permanente del lavoratore che determini l’impossibilità della prestazione convenuta. A tale pronuncia ha poi fatto seguito una giurisprudenza uniforme della suprema Corte, sia con riguardo al licenziamento per esigenze indotte dall’esercizio legittimo dei poteri imprenditoriali (v. recentemente, Cass. 13/8/08 n. 21579, pres. Senese, est. Bandini), che con riferimento a quello in cui l’esigenza oggettiva derivi da un fatto del lavoratore (ad. es, Cass. 22/8/03 n. 12362, pres. Mattone, est. Amoroso), anche diverso dalla inidoneità per infermità fisica permanente (quale, ad es. il ritiro dell’autorizzazione dell’autorità pubblica all’esercizio di una certa attività non addebitabile a dolo o colpa del lavoratore: Cass. 6/6/05 n. 11753, pres. Ciciretti, est. Celentano), quando sia ragionevolmente possibile adibire il dipendente ad altre mansioni, anche professionalmente non equivalenti a quelle contrattuali o ad altra unità produttiva (11/8/1998 n. 7904).

Garri, in Lav. nella giur. 2021, 660) È da ricomprendersi nell’ambito applicativo del blocco dei licenziamenti per g.m.o. di cui all’art. 46, D.L. n. 18/2020 anche del licenziamento per sopravvenuta inabilità, non solo perché tale motivo di licenziamento è indubbiamente oggettivo (non è disciplinare) nella dicotomia dell’art. 3, L. n. 604 del 1966, ma anche perché, in concreto, per tale licenziamento valgono le stesse ragioni di tutela economica e sociale (…) che stanno alla base di tutte le altre ipotesi di licenziamento per g.m.o. che la normativa emergenziale ha inteso espressamente impedire. (…) La conseguenza non può essere che la nullità, per violazione di una norma imperativa. (Trib. Ravenna 7/1/2021, Giud. Bernardi, in Lav. nella giur. 2021, 666) Tutela reintegratoria (c.d. attenuata), in caso di mancanza di causalità tra licenziamento oggettivo e motivo addotto a suo fondamento. In un caso di annullamento di un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, del quale era stato smentito in giudizio il motivo addotto a sostegno (cessazione dell’appalto, mentre in realtà il dipendente lavorava in un reparto diverso da quello cessato), la Corte ribadisce che, in tema di licenziamento per g.m.o., la ritenuta mancanza di nesso causale rispetto al motivo addotto a suo fondamento è sussumibile nell’alveo di quella particolare evidenza richiesta per integrare la manifesta insussistenza del fatto, che giustifica la tutela reintegratoria attenuata. (Cass. 29/7/2020 n. 16253, Pres. Di Cerbo Rel.Piccone, in Wikilabour, Newsletter n. 15/2020) L’insussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo può essere “manifesta” anche se sia necessario svolgere un’attività istruttoria e non basti l’esame degli atti e dei documenti. La Corte d’appello accoglie il reclamo proposto dalla lavoratrice verso la sentenza di primo grado che aveva accertato l’illegittimità del licenziamento ma accordando la sola tutela indennitaria, per omessa prova della “manifesta insussistenza” del fatto posto a base del licenziamento per g.m.o. La Corte afferma che la “manifesta insussistenza” può risultare anche all’esito dell’attività istruttoria, non essendo necessario che tale condizione risulti immediatamente già dagli atti o dai documenti. La Corte ritiene dunque che risulti il palese inadempimento da parte della multinazionale dell’obbligo di repechage, obbligo questo che richiede una condotta attiva del datore di lavoro nel cercare di ricollocare il dipendente prima di procedere al licenziamento (e senza che sia rilevante il fatto se la lavoratrice si sia attivata per partecipare ai “job posting” interni all’impresa). La Corte precisa inoltre che l’arco temporale entro il quale valutare se sia stato adempiuto tale obbligo decorre dal momento in cui è sorta la condizione di potenziale esubero, anche se precedente dell’avvio della procedura ex art. 7 L. 604/66. In riforma della sentenza di primo grado, la Corte accerta dunque il diritto della ricorrente alla tutela reintegratoria di cui all’art. 18, co 7° l. 300/1970. (Corte app. Milano 23/7/2020, Pres. e Rel. Vignati, in Wikilabour, Newsletter n. 15/2020) Ai fini della legittimità del licenziamento individuale per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’andamento economico negativo dell’azienda non costituisce un presupposto fattuale che il datore di lavoro debba necessariamente provare, essendo sufficiente che le ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva ed all’organizzazione del lavoro, comprese quelle dirette ad una migliore efficienza gestionale ovvero ad un incremento della redditività, determinino un effettivo mutamento dell’assetto organizzativo attraverso la soppressione di un’individuata posizione lavorativa, non essendo la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del posto di lavoro, sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità ed opportunità, in ossequio al disposto dell’art. 41 Cost.; ove, però, il giudice accerti in concreto l’inesistenza della ragione organizzativa o produttiva, il licenziamento risulterà ingiustificato per la mancanza di veridicità e pretestuosità della causale addotta. (Cass. 17/2/2020 n. 3908, ord., Pres. Berrino Rel. Patti, in Lav. nella giur. 2020, con nota di M. Ballistreri, Il contributo della giurisprudenza in tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, 1160) Si rimette alla Corte costituzionale la questione di legittimità dell’art. 18, co. 7, della l. 300/1970, ipotizzando una violazione degli artt. 3, 41, 24 e 111, co. 2, della Costituzione, nella parte in cui tale norma attribuisce al giudice la mera facoltà e non l’obbligo di reintegrare il lavoratore nelle ipotesi in cui sia stata accertata la manifesta insussistenza del fatto posto alla base del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo. (Trib. Ravenna 7/2/2020, ord., Est. Bernardini, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2020, con note di P. Tosi e E. Puccetti, “Il licenziamento per motivi economici al vaglio della Consulta”, e di P. Stolfa, “Insussistenza del g.m.o. e reintegrazione. Il Tribunale di Ravenna rimette la questione alla Corte Costituzionale”, 500) In un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo adottato nei confronti di lavoratori a tempo indeterminato di un’agenzia di somministrazione, non ricorre la “manifesta insussistenza” del motivo addotto anche nel caso in cui il datore di lavoro, nel medesimo periodo, assuma lavoratori con contratti a termine in missioni per posizioni astrattamente compatibili con quelle dei lavoratori espulsi, se il provvedimento risolutivo è adottato dopo un lungo periodo di disponibilità dei dipendenti licenziati (nella vicenda in esame oltre un anno). I licenziamenti sono comunque illegittimi, con applicazione della tutela indennitaria ai sensi dell’art. 18, co. 5, della L. 300/1970. (Cass. 8/1/2019 n. 181, Pres. Nobile Est. Marchese, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2019, con nota di V. Luciani, “Il giustificato motivo oggettivo (non) ‘manifestamente insussistente’ e il licenziamento economico illegittimo nella somministarzione di manodopera”, 32) Il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento previsto dall’art. 3 legge n. 604 del 1966 è ravvisabile anche soltanto in una diversa ripartizione di determinate mansioni fra il personale in servizio, all’esito della quale una o più porzioni lavorative risultino in esubero e non riassorbibili in via di c.d. repèchage. (Cass. 24/5/2017, n. 13015, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Manna, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2017, con nota di M. Pallini, “La (ir)rilevanza dei ‘motivi’ dell’impresa nel sindacato di legittimità del licenziamento economico”, 743) In tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo è sufficiente, per la legittimità del recesso, che le addotte ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva e all’organizzazione del lavoro, comprese quelle dirette a una migliore efficienza gestionale ovvero a un incremento della redditività, causalmente determinino un effettivo mutamento dell’assetto organizzativo attraverso la soppressione di un’individuata posizione lavorativa, non essendo la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del posto di lavoro sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità e opportunità, in ossequio al disposto dell’art. 41 Cost.; ove, però, il giudice accerti in concreto l’inesistenza della ragione organizzativa o produttiva, il licenziamento risulterà ingiustificato per la mancanza di veridicità o la pretestuosità della causale addotta. (Cass. 3/5/2017, n. 10699, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Amendola, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2017, con nota di M. Pallini, “La (ir)rilevanza dei ‘motivi’ dell’impresa nel sindacato di legittimità del licenziamento economico”, 743) Ai fini della legittimità del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’andamento economico negativo dell’azienda non costituisce un presupposto fattuale che il datore di lavoro debba necessariamente provare o il giudice accertare, essendo sufficiente dimostrare l’effettività del mutamento dell’assetto organizzativo attraverso la soppressione di una individuata posizione lavorativa, a meno che il datore di lavoro non abbia motivato il licenziamento richiamando l’esigenza di far fronte a situazioni economiche sfavorevoli. (Cass. 7/12/2016, n. 25201, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Amendola, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2017, con nota di M. Pallini, “La (ir)rilevanza dei ‘motivi’ dell’impresa nel sindacato di legittimità del licenziamento economico”, 743, e in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di G. Natullo, “La Cassazione delimita il controllo del giudice sul licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo”, 257) Rientra nell’ambito del motivo oggettivo di licenziamento determinato da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva anche l’ipotesi di riassetto organizzativo attuato per la più economica gestione dell’impresa, rimesso alla valutazione del datore di lavoro, senza che il giudice possa sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, atteso che tale scelta è espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost., mentre al giudice spetta il controllo della reale sussistenza del motivo addotto dall’imprenditore; ne consegue che non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità ed opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del reparto o del posto cui era addetto il dipendente licenziato, sempre che risulti l’effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato. (Trib. Bari 6/10/2016, Giud. Minervini, in Lav. nella giur. 2017, 99) Rispetta i principi di correttezza e buona fede disciplinati dagli artt. 1175 e 1375 c.c. il datore di lavoro che, nell’ambito di una operazione di riorganizzazione aziendale volta alla riduzione dei costi, attuata mediante l’accorpamento di due posizioni di segreteria amministrativa in una sola, operi la scelta tra i lavoratori da licenziare sulla base dell’incidenza del diverso orario di lavoro prestato (a tempo parziale della lavoratrice licenziata e a tempo pieno dell’altra), in ragione della necessità aziendale di un dipendente a tempo pieno, a garanzia della copertura dell’intero orario di apertura degli uffici. (Cass. 20/9/2016 n. 18409, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Patti, in Riv. giur. lav. e prev. soc. 2017, II, con nota di B. Caponetti, “Licenziamento per g.m.o. della lavoratrice part-time”, 57) Il motivo oggettivo di licenziamento determinato da ragioni inerenti l’attività produttiva, tra le quali rientra anche il riassetto organizzativo attuato per la più economica gestione dell’impresa, è rimesso alla valutazione del datore di lavoro, senza che il giudice possa sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, in quanto essa è espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata ex art. 41 Cost., mentre al giudice spetta il controllo della reale sussistenza del motivo addotto dall’imprenditore. Non è quindi sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità e opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale di sopprimere il settore lavorativo, reparto o posto cui sia addetto il dipendente licenziato, sempre che risultino l’effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo in tal modo operato. (Cass. 12/8/2016 n. 17091, Pres. Di Cerbo Rel. Esposito, in Lav. nella giur. 2016, 1124) In tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo determinato da ragioni tecniche, organizzative e produttive, il giudice non ha il potere di sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost., ma deve effettuare il controllo in ordine all’effettiva sussistenza del motivo addotto dal datore di lavoro, in ordine al quale il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di provare, anche mediante elementi presuntivi e indiziari, l’effettività delle ragioni che giustificano l’operazione di riassetto, motivazioni che non possono costituire la conclusione o il risultato dell’operazione di riassetto ma ne devono costituire il presupposto. (Trib. Firenze 28/7/2016, Giud. Torcini, in Lav. nella giur. 2016, 1027) Il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento L. n. 604 del 1966, ex art. 3, può consistere anche soltanto in una diversa ripartizione di date mansioni fra il personale in servizio attuata ai fini di più economica ed efficiente gestione aziendale, nel senso che, invece di essere assegnate a un solo dipendente, esse possono suddividersi fra più lavoratori, ognuno dei quali se le vedrà aggiungere a quelle già espletate: il risultato finale può legittimamente far emergere come in esubero la posizione di quel dipendente che vi era addetto in modo esclusivo o prevalente, sempre che tale riassetto sia realmente all’origine del licenziamento anziché costituirne mero effetto di risulta. (Cass. 21/7/2016 n. 15082, Pres. Bronzini Est. Manna, in Lav. nella giur. 2016, 1019) Costituisce violazione del canone di solidarietà sociale e dei principi di buona fede e correttezza di cui agli artt. 1175 c.c. e 1375 c.c. la condotta del datore di lavoro che manchi di segnalare al lavoratore, con congruo anticipo, la necessità di riacquistare, a sue spese, i titoli e le abilitazioni necessari per lo svolgimento delle mansioni e, viceversa, proceda al licenziamento. A tale comportamento consegue l’illegittimità del recesso datoriale che risulta intimato in assenza di una idonea giustificazione circa la sussistenza delle ragioni tecnico produttive che rendono effettivamente impossibile attendere, anche per breve tempo, l’acquisizione da parte del lavoratore delle abilitazioni mancanti. (Cass. 17/6/2015 n. 12486, Pres. Lamorgese Est. Tria, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2016, con nota di Francesca Iaquinta, “La rilevanza della buona fede del datore di lavoro in caso di licenziamento per impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione lavorativa”, 74) La manifesta insussistenza del fatto posto a fondamento del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo – di cui all’art. 18 St. lav. così come modificato dalla l. n. 92 del 2012 – emerge dal dato negativo della mancanza di prova del giustificato motivo oggettivo, ma anche dalla prova positiva di un intento diverso. Da detto accertamento consegue l’applicazione della sanzione reintegratoria. (Corte app. Catanzaro 21/4/2015, Pres. Sirianni Est. Santoemma, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2015, con nota di Stefania Buoso, “Alcuni chiarimenti sulla categoria della manifesta insussistenza del fatto posto a base del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo”, 927) L’obbligo di specificazione dei motivi di recesso nel licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo va assolto dal datore di lavoro con la comunicazione di cui all’art. 2, l. n. 604/1966, mentre la previa comunicazione di cui all’art. 7, l. n. 604/1966, per le finalità deflattive alle quali risponde la procedura stessa, deve contenere i requisiti minimi che consentono al lavoratore e all’organo deputato a esperire la conciliazione di comprendere, in linea di massima, le ragioni della scelta espulsiva. (Corte app. Catanzaro 18/11/2014, Pres. Sirianni Est. Fatale, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2015, con nota di Martina Vincieri, “La comunicazione dei motivi nel licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo”, 1088) Il principio ispiratore della normativa concernente la tipologia del licenziamento oggettivo è che nel contrasto tra l’interesse del lavoratore alla conservazione del posto e quello del datore a espellere unità lavorative realmente non più funzionali all’esigenza dell’impresa è il secondo a prevalere. Due sono però le condizioni all’uopo richieste: a) la effettività delle esigenze aziendali richiamate nella motivazione del licenziamento; b) un preciso nesso di causalità tra tali esigenze e il licenziamento. (Trib. Roma 27/10/2014, Giud. Lucarelli, in Lav. nella giur. 2015, 203) Il Giudice del merito, adito per la declaratoria di illegittimità del licenziamento irrogato al prestatore per soppressione delle mansioni cui il medesimo era addetto, è tenuto al controllo della effettiva sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo posto alla base del recesso datoriale, mentre non può sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, in quanto espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 della Costituzione. Il datore di lavoro, in ogni caso, ha l’onere di provare l’impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore a mansioni diverse da quelle precedentemente svolte, pur esigendosi dallo stesso lavoratore una collaborazione nell’accertamento di un suo possibile reimpiego nel contesto lavorativo, mediante l’allegazione dell’esistenza di altri posti di lavoro nei quali poteva essere utilmente collocato, conseguendo a tale allegazione l’onere della parte datoriale di provare la non utilizzabilità dei posti predetti. (Cass. 8/11/2013 n. 25197, Pres. Roselli Est. Mammone, in Lav. nella giur. 2014, 181) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo il giudice deve accertare la reale sussistenza del motivo addotto dal datore di lavoro, nonché il nesso di causalità tra il medesimo e l’individuazione del soggetto destinatario del provvedimento di licenziamento. Grava sul datore di lavoro l’onere di prospettare al lavoratore la possibilità di essere adibito a mansioni inferiori. (Cass. 23/10/2013 n. 24037, Pres. Stile Est. Blasutto, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Daniela Zanetto, “Licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e controllo da parte del giudice”, 296) In considerazione della natura intermittente dell’attività aziendale, la scelta imprenditoriale, insindacabile in sede giudiziale, di ridurre i costi mantenendo in forza esclusivamente personale assunto a tempo determinato trova ragionevole ed effettivo fondamento nella impossibilità di disporre sospensioni consensuali dei rapporti di lavoro nei periodi di inattività aziendale e pertanto giustifica il licenziamento dei lavoratori che hanno rifiutato la trasformazione del rapporto di lavoro da tempo indeterminato a tempo determinato. (Trib. Padova 28/8/2013, Giud. Perrone, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Valeria Nuzzo, “Quanto la ‘forma comune di rapporto di lavoro’ diventa incompatibile con l’organizzazione datoriale”, 43) Il “motivo oggettivo” di licenziamento è rimesso alla valutazione del datore di lavoro, senza che il giudice possa sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, atteso che tale scelta è espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost.; spetta invece al giudice il controllo della reale sussistenza delle esigenze tecnico-economiche dedotte dal datore di lavoro, e cioè della effettiva e della non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato. (Cass. 1/8/2013 n. 18416, Pres. Stile Rel. Venuti, in Lav. nella giur. 2013, 1041, e in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Nicoletta Frasca, “Giustificato motivo oggettivo e repêchage: quando il datore procede a nuove assunzioni dopo il licenziamento”, 231) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, la non equivalenza delle mansioni – valutata con riferimento alle specifiche motivazioni e finalità del licenziamento – impedisce il riferimento, quale parametro di valutazione del rispetto dei principi generali di correttezza e buona fede, ai criteri di cui alla L. 223/1991, consentito nel solo caso di licenziamento di personale omogeneo e fungibile. (Corte app. Milano 10/6/2013, Pres. Sbordone Rel. Pattumelli, in Lav. nella giur. 2013, 960) L’art. 18 comma 7 Stat. Lav., come modificato dall’art. 1 comma 42 l. 28 giugno 2012, n. 92 (Riforma Fornero), prevede che il giudice possa applicare la disciplina di cui al medesimo art. 18 comma 4 Stat. Lav., nuova formulazione (c.d. reintegra debole) allorché accerti la manifesta insussistenza del fatto posto a base del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e applichi invece la disciplina di cui all’art. 18 comma 5 Stat. Lav., nuova formulazione, (c.d. tutela risarcitoria piena) nelle altre ipotesi in cui accerti che non ricorrono gli estremi del giustificato motivo. La sussistenza del fatto principale addotto a giustificazione del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo esclude la manifesta insussistenza del fatto e quindi l’applicabilità della tutela reale e la violazione del solo obbligo di repêchage da parte del datore di lavoro è sanzionabile unicamente con la tutela indennitaria. Per poter qualificare un licenziamento come ritorsivo ex art. 18 comma 1 St. lav., nuova formulazione, continua a essere necessario che il motivo illecito, oltre che determinante, sia anche esclusivo della volontà del datore di lavoro di licenziare. L’esclusività non può ritenersi presente allorché si accerti che il fatto addotto come giustificato motivo sia reale. (Trib. Milano 20/11/2012, ord., Giud. Casella, in Lav. nella giur. 2013, con commento di Daniela Zonetto, 581) La necessità di contenere i costi a fronte di uno stato di crisi che si concretizzi in un forte calo del fatturato aziendale costituisce giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento laddove il datore di lavoro decida di sopprimere i posti di lavoro dei dipendenti che svolgono attività commerciale diretta e dimostri l’impossibilità di ricollocarli in altre funzioni, al cui svolgimento siano stabilmente addetti altri colleghi. (Cass. 6/7/2012 n. 11402, Pres. Roselli Rel. Bandini, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, 1112) La esistenza di una situazione di impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione di lavoro, derivante dalla mancanza in capo al lavoratore, per effetto di disposizioni normative sopravvenute, del titolo professionale necessario per l’esercizio della attività lavorativa richiesta dal datore di lavoro è idonea a incidere sulla funzionalità della relativa organizzazione di lavoro (nella specie, la Corte ha confermato il licenziamento di una lavoratrice in possesso di un titolo di massofisioterapista conseguito all’esito di un corso biennale, in quanto non più valido per abilitare allo svolgimento di tale professione. Il diploma di massofisioterapista è equipollente al diploma universitario di fisioterapista solo se conseguito all’esito di un corso triennale). (Cass. 22/5/2012 n. 8050, Pres. Lamorgese Est. Meliadò, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2012, 376) In tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e per ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva e all’organizzazione del lavoro, ai sensi dell’art. 3, l. n. 604/1966, se il motivo consiste nella generica esigenza di riduzione di personale omogeneo e fungibile – in relazione al quale non sono utilizzabili né il normale criterio della posizione lavorativa da sopprimere, né il criterio della impossibilità di “repêchage” – il datore di lavoro deve pur sempre improntare l’individuazione del soggetto (o dei soggetti) da licenziare ai principi di correttezza e buona fede, cui deve essere informato, ai sensi dell’art. 1175 c.c., ogni comportamento delle parti del rapporto obbligatorio e, quindi, anche del recesso di una di esse. (Cass. 15/5/2012 n. 7509, Pres. Roselli Est. Amoroso, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2013, con nota di Raffaele Galardi, “Note in tema di licenziamento connesso a trasferimento di ramo d’azienda”, 323) Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo – che consiste in “ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, all’organizzazione del lavoro e al regolare funzionamento di essa “e può ravvisarsi nella soppressione del posto di lavoro, inteso come attività lavorativa svolta dal dipendente poi licenziato – autorizza il datore di lavoro a riorganizzare l’attività lavorativa tra altri dipendenti, diversi da quello licenziato; esso è legittimo a condizione che non risulti meramente strumentale a un incremento di profitto ma che sia diretto a fronteggiare situazioni sfavorevoli non contingenti; il lavoratore ha quindi il diritto che il datore di lavoro (su cui incombe il relativo onere) dimostri la concreta riferibilità del licenziamento individuale a iniziative collegate a effettive ragioni di carattere produttivo e organizzativo, e che dimostri, inoltre, l’impossibilità di utilizzare il lavoratore stesso in altre mansioni equivalenti a quelle esercitate prima della ristrutturazione. (Cass. 18/4/2012 n. 6026, Pres. Vidiri Rel. Tricomi, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, 721) È illegittimo il licenziamento comminato a seguito di una non rilevante contrazione dell’attività produttiva che non comporti la necessità di ridurre il personale, specialmente nel caso in cui l’azienda abbia proceduto, nell’imminenza del recesso e con evidente scopo sostitutivo, alla stipula di un contratto di collaborazione a progetto con altro soggetto. (Cass. 19/1/2012 n. 755, Pres. Roselli Rel. Curzio, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, 407) L’indicazione dei motivi del licenziamento (per giustificato motivo oggettivo, n.d.r.) deve essere specifica, cioè idonea a realizzare il risultato perseguito dalla legge, costituito dalla conoscenza, da parte del lavoratore, delle ragioni sottese al provvedimento; a tal fine è necessario che la motivazione individui tali fatti con sufficiente precisione, anche se sinteticamente, per modo che risulti senza incertezza l’ambito delle questioni sottese al licenziamento (nel caso di specie si giustificava il licenziamento con affermazioni del seguente tenore “diminuite possibilità di lavoro” “le fasi lavorative per le quali ha prestato la sua opera sono notevolmente diminuite”). (Trib. Roma 11/5/2011, Giud. Masi, in Lav. nella giur. 2011, 850) Quando il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento si identifica nella generica esigenza di riduzione di personale assolutamente omogeneo e fungibile, ai fini del controllo della conformità della scelta dei lavoratori da licenziare ai principi di correttezza e buona fede di cui all’art. 1175 c.c. non essendo utilizzabili né il normale criterio della “posizione lavorativa” da sopprimere in quanto non più necessaria, né tanto meno il criterio della impossibilità di repechage (in quanto tutte le posizioni lavorative sono equivalenti e tutti i lavoratori sono potenzialmente licenziabili), ben può farsi riferimento, pur nella diversità dei rispettivi regimi, ai criteri che l’art. 5 l. n. 223 del 1991 ha dettato per i licenziamenti collettivi per l’ipotesi in cui l’accordo sindacale ivi previsto non abbia indicato criteri di scelta diversi e, conseguentemente, prendere in considerazione in via analogica i criteri dei carichi di famiglia e dell’anzianità. (Cass. 28/3/2011 n. 7046, Pres. Foglia Est. Mammone, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2011, 189) In tema di licenziamento, sebbene il giustificato motivo oggettivo determinato da ragioni tecniche, organizzative e produttive sia rimesso alla valutazione del datore di lavoro, come espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost., esso deve essere pur sempre contemperato con il rispetto della dignità umana, trattandosi di diritto fondamentale della persona richiamato dalla stessa norma costituzionale nonché dalla legislazione del lavoro anche in relazione al diritto alla conservazione del posto di lavoro sul quale si fondano sia l’art. 18 St. Lav. che l’art. 30 del Trattato di Lisbona del 31 dicembre 2007, entrato in vigore dal 1° gennaio 2009. (Cass. 27/10/2010 n. 21967, Pres. ed Est. Foglia, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2012, con nota di M. Pallini, “L’utilità sociale quale limite interno al potere di licenziamento?”, 86) In materia di obbligo di repechage è illegittimo il licenziamento del lavoratore, qualora il datore di lavoro non riesca a dimostrare di non poter ricollocare il lavoratore in altri rami dell’azienda, valutando anche le sedi all’estero. (Cass. 15/7/2010 n. 16579, Pres. Sciarelli Est. Monaci, in Lav. nella giur. 2010, 940) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo la scelta tra più lavoratori fungibili e omogenei tra loro deve essere effettuata applicando analogicamente i criteri dei carichi di famiglia e dell’anzianità previsti dall’art. 5 L. 23/7/91 n. 223, a pena di illegittimità del licenziamento. (Trib. Milano 8/7/2010, Est. Mariani, in D&L 2010, 866) In virtù del principio di immodificabilità del licenziamento è precluso al datore di lavoro, il quale intimi un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo (mancanza di lavoro) invocare in giudizio una giusta causa, tra l’altro senza dedurre in quale sede e con quali modalità essa sia stata contestata al lavoratore. (Cass. 30/4/2010 n. 10538, Pres. Vidiri Est. Di Nubila, in Lav. Nella giur. 2010, 728) In materia di licenziamenti individuali per giustificato motivo oggettivo determinati da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di provare, con riferimento alla capacità professionale del lavoratore e all’organizzazione aziendale esistente all’epoca del licenziamento, anche attraverso fatti positivi, tali da determinare presunzioni semplici (come il fatto che dopo il licenziamento e per un congruo periodo non vi siano state nuove assunzioni nella stessa qualifica del lavoratore licenziato), l’impossibilità di adibire utilmente il lavoratore in mansioni diverse da quelle che prima svolgeva, giustificandosi il recesso solo come extrema ratio (nella specie, la Suprema Corte ha confermato la sentenza della corte territoriale che, con riferimento ad azienda di grandi dimensioni, aveva ritenuto non assolto dal datore di lavoro l’onere probatorio, sul rilievo delle numerose assunzioni nell’anno seguente a quello del licenziamento, di personale con la medesima qualifica del lavoratore licenziato, e dell’elevato livello di istruzione di questo, che ne consentiva l’utilizzazione in settori diversi da quello in cui era stato precedentemente addetto). (Cass. 26 marzo 2010 n. 7381, Pres. Roselli Est. D’Agostino, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2010, 469) Nella nozione di giustificato motivo di licenziamento sono riconducibili anche le ipotesi di riassetti organizzativi attuati per la più economica gestione dell’azienda, che peraltro non devono essere pretestuosi e strumentali, ma volti a fronteggiare situazioni sfavorevoli non contingenti che influiscano decisamente sulla normale attività produttiva imponendo un’effettiva necessità di riduzione dei costi. (Cass. 7/4/2010 n. 8237, Pres. Sciarelli Est. Balletti, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2010, 461) Non integra la fattispecie legale di giustificato motivo oggettivo un licenziamento attuato senza soppressione del posto di lavoro né delle mansioni, ma con ridistribuzione delle mansioni tra il restante personale, senza che venga neppure dedotta la necessità di far fronte a difficoltà economiche contingenti o l’esistenza di effettive ragioni tecnico-produttive che impongano un più razionale assetto aziendale. (Corte app. Torino 30/3/2009, Pres. Girolami Est. Pasquarelli, in Riv. giur. lav. e prev. soc. 2010, con commento di Carla Spinelli, “Redistribuzione delle mansioni e giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento”, 316) Nell’ipotesi di licenziamento plurimo per giustificato motivo oggettivo di lavoratori con mansioni perfettamente fungibili a quelle di altri, il datore di lavoro è obbligato ad agire, nell’individuazione dei soggetti da espellere, nel rispetto dei principi di correttezza e buona fede e di criteri oggettivi predeterminati da modellare su quelli previsti per i licenziamenti collettivi, così da escludere che il licenziamento delle persone selezionate possa essere il risultato di una scelta con contenuto discriminatorio. (Trib. Milano 24/3/2009, Est. Bianchini, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2009, 168) Qualora il licenziamento sia disposto per giustificato motivo oggettivo, in particolare per ragioni di carattere contingente, per contrazione reale dell’attività lavorativa, per effettività della crisi dedotta dal datore di lavoro, non sarà il giudice a dover determinare il “giusto numero” di dipendenti da licenziare, traducendosi il suo controllo nella verifica della effettiva esistenza delle esigenze obiettive di cui parla l’art. 3 della legge n. 604/66 e delle ragioni della scelta del singolo lavoratore licenziato. (Trib. Bergamo 23/2/2009, d.ssa Finazzi, in Lav. nella giur. 2009, con commento di Monica Fasano, 499) Presupposti della legittimità del licenziamento sono l’effettività delle ragioni organizzative e/o produttive poste a fondamento del recesso, che devono trovare fondamento in situazioni oggettive , e la sussistenza di un nesso causale tra tali ragioni e la soppressione del posto di lavoro, mentre la motivazione della scelta imprenditoriale di procedere alla riorganizzazione non è sindacabile dal giudice, rientrando nella libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost. e può anche essere costituita da finalità di innovazione, risparmio dei costi o incremento dei profitti. (Trib. Roma 4/11/2008, Giud. Trementozzi, in Lav. nella giur. 2009, 202) Nella nozione di giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento è riconducibile anche l’ipotesi del riassetto organizzativo dell’azienda attuato al fine di una più economica gestione di essa e deciso dall’imprenditore non semplicemente per un incremento del profitto, ma per far fronte a sfavorevoli situazioni, non meramente contingenti, influenti in modo decisivo sulla normale attività produttiva, imponendo un’effettiva necessità di riduzione dei costi; tale motivo oggettivo è rimesso alla valutazione del datore di lavoro, senza che il giudice possa sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, atteso che tale scelta è espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost., mentre al giudice spetta il controllo della reale sussistenza del motivo addotto dall’imprenditore, con la conseguenza che non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità e opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del posto cui era addetto il lavoratore licenziato, sempre che risulti l’effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato, non essendo, peraltro, necessario, ai fini della configurabilità del giustificato motivo, che vengano soppresse tutte le mansioni in precedenza attribuite al lavoratore licenziato, ben potendo le stesse essere solo diversamente ripartite e attribuite. (Trib. Milano 29/3/2008, d.ssa Cincotti, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 1171) Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo può essere legittimo solo ove le mansioni del lavoratore risultino effettivamente soppresse e non sia possibile adibire lo stesso a mansioni equivalenti. (Trib. Milano 28/3/2008, d.ssa Peragallo, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 1172) E’ inammissibile, per carenza di interesse ad agire, la domanda con cui il datore di lavoro si rivolga al giudice per accertare la sussistenza o meno dei presupposti per il futuro esercizio del potere di recesso per giustificato motivo oggettivo; il Giudice esercita solo un compito di controllo del rispetto dei vincoli di forma e di contenuto che condizionano l’effettivo esercizio di quel potere e non può assumere, rispetto a esso, alcuna funzione sostitutiva o consultativa. (Trib. Savona 5/3/2008, Est. Acquarone, in D&L 2008, con nota di Paola Perrucco, “Il potere di licenziamento e l’accertamento preventivo dei presupposti del suo legittimo esercizio”, 664) Per giustificato motivo oggettivo deve intendersi quel motivo derivante da una riorganizzazione o ristrutturazione che ha condotto alla soppressione di attività o posizioni e non la mera crisi aziendale o la redistribuzione delle attività su altri addetti; inoltre, qualora le posizioni rimaste siano fungibili rispetto a tutti i dipendenti, l’impresa ha l’obbligo di agire, nell’individuazione dei lavoratori da licenziare, nel rispetto dei principi di correttezza e di buona fede e nel rispetto di criteri oggettivi predeterminati da modellare su quelli previsti per i licenziamenti collettivi, così da escludere che il licenziamento delle persone selezionate possa essere il risultato di una scelta a contenuto discriminatorio. (Trib. Milano 17/12/2007, Est. Bianchini, in D&L 2008, con nota di Chiara Zambrelli, “Licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e criteri di scelta dei lavoratori con mansioni fungibili”, 658) La costante giurisprudenza di legittimità e di merito, al fine di evitare il rischio che la tutela cautelare assuma una funzione surrogatoria, nei confronti del processo del lavoro, per sua natura rapido, ritiene che sia necessario un accertamento puntuale e preciso circa la sussistenza dei requisiti essenziali, cui è subordinato il ricorso alla tutela d’urgenza. In merito a un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, è onere del ricorrente fornire la prova in ordine alla situazione di vulnus alla vita familiare e di relazione temibile nell’arco della durata del giudizio ordinario. Inoltre è preferibile perchè più conforme alla ratio dell’art. 700 c.p.c., l’orinetamento secondo cui deve escludersi che in caso di licenziamento illegittimo il periculum in mora sussista in re ipsa. (Trib. Milano 8/12/2007, D.ssa Ravazzoni, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 536) Il licenziamento per motivo oggettivo determinato da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva è scelta riservata all’imprenditore, quale responsabile della corretta gestione dell’azienda anche dal punto di vista economico e organizzativo, sicché essa, sia effettiva e non simulata o pretestuosa, non è sindacabile dal giudice quanto ai profili della sua congruità e opportunità. (Nella specie, la S.C. ha confermato la sentenza impugnata che, nel riconoscere l’effettività della scelta imprenditoriale di razionalizzare l’attività aziendale, aveva ritenuto legittimo il licenziamento intimato a una biologa addetta a un laboratorio di analisi, il cui posto di lavoro, a seguito della contrazione delle richieste concernenti l’attività del laboratorio la quale attività, per detto motivo, si era concentrata in due soli giorni alla settimana era stato soppresso, con assegnazione delle sue mansioni ad altra dipendente, in aggiunta a quelle da quest’ultima già svolte, senza che l’azienda avesse proceduto ad assunzione in sostituzione della lavoratrice licenziata). (Rigetta, App. Taranto, 24 giugno 2004). (Cass. 22/8/2007 n. 17887, Pres. De Luca Est. Monaci, in Dir. e prat. lav. 2008, 1478) Costituisce g.m.o. di licenziamento l’ipotesi di riassetto organizzativo dell’azienda attuato al fine di una più economica gestione, deciso per far fronte a situazioni sfavorevoli, che influiscano in modo decisivo sulla normale attività produttiva, dovendosi escludere che il rapporto di lavoro abbia più motivo di attendersi dal lavoratore la stessa utilitas che l’aveva indotto ad assumerlo, vale a dire lo stesso flusso di redditi che gli consente la valorizzazione del capitale investito. (Trib. Palermo 17/5/2007, Giud. Cavallaro, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2007, con nota di Marco Novella, “I concetti di costo contabile, di costo-opportunità e di costo sociale nella problematica costruzione gius-economica del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento”, e con nota di Pietro Ichino, “Il costo sociale del licenziamento e la perdita aziendale attesa per la prosecuzione del rapporto come oggetto del bilanciamento giudiziale”, 989) Ai fini della sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento, ferma restando la prova dell’effettività e della non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato, le ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva possono sorgere, oltre che da esigenze di mercato, anche da riorganizzazioni o ristrutturazioni, quali che ne siano le finalità, quindi anche quelle dirette a un risparmio dei costi o all’incremento dei profitti, quale che ne sia l’entità. (Cass. 10/5/2007 n. 10672, Pres. Ianniruberto Est. Stile, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2007, con nota di Marco Novella, “I concetti di costo contabile, di costo-opportunità e di costo sociale nella problematica costruzione gius-economica del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento”, e con nota di Pietro Ichino, “Il costo sociale del licenziamento e la perdita aziendale attesa per la prosecuzione del rapporto come oggetto del bilanciamento giudiziale”, 989) Nel licenziamento attuato per ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva e all’organizzazione del lavoro, il suindicato giurisdizionale non può coinvolgere i criteri di gestione dell’impresa e le scelte operate dall’imprenditore, il quale però ha l’onere di dimostrare l’impossibilità di utilizzare il lavoratore in altre mansioni equivalenti e di non aver effettuato nuove assunzioni in qualifiche analoghe per un congruo periodo successivo al recesso. (Corte App. Roma 29/3/2007, Pres. Cataldi Est. Cocchia, in D&L 2007, con nota di Emanuela Fiorini, “Società con sede all’estero, numero dei dipendenti e tutela reale”, 905) Il requisito dell’immediatezza del provvedimento espulsivo rispetto alla contestazione degli addebiti applicabile con riferimento al licenziamento individuale per giusta causa o giustificato motivo soggettivo non si adatta al licenziamento individuale per giustificato motivo oggettivo, poichè le ragioni di garanzia e difesa a tutela del lavoratore – con particolare riferimento all’esigenza di evitare che il lavoratore possa essere esposto a tempo indeterminato al pericolo del licenziamento per i fatti contestatigli, posta a base del suddetto requisito di legittimità – non sussistono nel licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo (dipendente da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, all’organizzazione del lavoro e al funzionamento di essa), nel quale occorre solo controllare che ricorrano in concreto le esigenze organizzative poste dal datore di lavoro a fondamento del provvedimento espulsivo. (Cassa con rinvio, App. Trieste 30/4/2004). (Cass. 19/12/2006 n. 27101, Pres. Mercurio Est. D’Agostino, in Dir. e prat. lav. 2007, 1972) In ipotesi di licenziamento intimato da una società appartenente a un gruppo che costituisca un unico complesso aziendale, l’accertamento in ordine alla motivazione del licenziamento, alla possibilità del c.d. repechage e ai requisiti dimensionali, deve essere effettuato con riferimento all’intero complesso aziendale. (Trib. Milano 23/10/2006, Est. Martello, in D&L 2007, 223) Il licenziamento per esigenze aziendali non può risolversi nella mera riduzione del personale, nel senso che la riorganizzazione deve dar corso alla eliminazione reale ed effettiva di una posizione lavorativa, per cui tra la prima e la seconda sussista un rapporto di causalità reciproca e non invece a una mera redistribuzione di mansioni che permangono come aspetto essenziale dell’attività dell’azienda. (Corte app. Milano 25/1/2006, Rel. Sbordone, in Lav. nella giur. 2006, 1027) Presupposti di legittimità del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo sono costituiti dall’effettività e obiettività delle ragioni aziendali addotte a giustificazione del recesso; dalla necessità che dette ragioni siano funzionali a fronteggiare situazioni sfavorevoli sopravvenuti e contingenti, che influiscano sulla normale attività produttiva e impongano la riduzione dei costi, sì da doversene escludere il carattere pretestuoso e occasionale; dall’esistenza del nesso causale tra tali ragioni e l’atto datoriale; dall’effettiva soppressione del posto di lavoro, conseguente alla scelta aziendale. (Corte app. Roma 31/8/2005, Pres. Lanzellotto Rel. Di Stefano, in Lav. Nella giur. 2006, 615) Ai fini della sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento ciò che conta è la situazione fattuale esistente al momento dell’intimazione del recesso. (Cass. 14/7/2005 n. 14815, Pres. Mattone Est. Di Cerbo, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2005, 642) Il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento, nella cui nozione rientra l’ipotesi di riassetti organizzativi attuati per la più economica gestione dell’azienda, funzionali a fronteggiare situazioni sfavorevoli non contingenti, le quali influiscano in modo decisivo sulla normale attività produttiva ed impongano un’effettiva necessità di riduzione dei costi, richiede che le ragioni inerenti l’attività produttiva siano tali, nella loro oggettività e non in forza di un atto del datore di lavoro che presenti margini di arbitrarietà, da determinare, con stretto nesso di consequenzialità, l’inutilizzabilità della posizione lavorativa considerata. Nell’ipotesi di licenziamento motivato da determinate esigenze relative ad una riorganizzazione aziendale finalizzata ad una più economica gestione, l’impossibilità di trasformazione del rapporto da tempo pieno a tempo parziale può in astratto configurare motivo obiettivo di recesso. (Cass. 6/7/2005 n. 14215, Pres. Ciciretti Rel. Miani Canevari, in Lav. e prev. oggi 2005, 1454) Qualora il lavoratore non possa più svolgere le mansioni cui sia addetto e l’impedimento sia a lui imputabile per dolo o colpa, è legittimo il licenziamento intimato dal datore di lavoro per giustificato motivo consistente nella sopravvenuta impossibilità della prestazione lavorativa in relazione alle mansioni suddette, senza che il recedente debba fornire la prova di non aver potuto adibire il lavoratore ad altro posto nell’azienda, anche con mutamento di mansioni, essendo tale prova necessaria solo quando l’impedimento non sia addebitabile al lavoratore. (Nella specie, la Cass. ha cassato la sentenza di merito che, senza dare rilievo al comportamento dei lavoratori, aveva ritenuto illegittimo il licenziamento di due dipendenti della Società Aeroporti di Roma – cui era stato ritirato il tesserino di accesso all’area aeroportuale in seguito a denuncia in flagranza per tentato furto di bagagli – per non avere la società fornito la prova dell’impossibilità di un loro diverso utilizzo). (Cass. 6/6/2005 n. 11753, Pres. Ciciretti Rel. Celentano, in Lav. e prev. oggi 2005, 1454) Il ricorrere di nuove assunzioni a fronte di licenziamenti per giustificato motivo oggettivo non è ontologicamente incompatibile con l’esistenza di un ridimensionamento aziendale e non è, quindi, di per sé stesso fonte di illegittimità del licenziamento. Il rapporto tra esigenze di ridimensionamento aziendale e licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo a essa ricollegabile va sempre valutato con riferimento al ruolo e alle mansioni di pertinenza del singolo lavoratore all’interno dell’azienda. (Cass. 15/5/2005 n. 7832, Pres. Senese Est. Stile, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2005, 348) Il motivo oggettivo di licenziamento determinato da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, nel cui ambito rientra anche l’ipotesi di riassetto organizzativo attuato per la più economica gestione dell’impresa, è rimesso alla valutazione del datore di lavoro, senza che il giudice possa sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, atteso che tale scelta è espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Costituzione, mentre al giudice spetta il controllo della reale sussistenza del motivo addotto dall’imprenditore; ne consegue che non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità ed opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del reparto o del posto cui era addetto il dipendente licenziato, sempre che risulti l’effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato, né essendo necessario, ai fini della configurabilità del giustificato motivo, che vengano soppresse tutte le mansioni in precedenza attribuite al lavoratore licenziato, ben potendo le stesse essere solo diversamente ripartite ed attribuite. (Sulla base di tali principi la Suprema Corte ha cassato la sentenza di merito che aveva ritenuto insussistente il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento del lavoratore di una società cooperativa a responsabilità limitata, dando rilievo alla circostanza che non era stata accolta la domanda di quel lavoratore di essere ammesso come socio ed alla circostanza che la società, dopo il licenziamento del lavoratore, aveva ammesso due nuovi soci. In riferimento a quest’ultima circostanza la Suprema Corte ha anche rilevato che erroneamente erano state poste sullo stesso pieno due posizioni diverse, quella del dipendente e quella del socio). (Cass. 4/11/2004 n. 21121, Pres. Mattone Rel. Stile, in Lav. e prev. oggi 2005, 366) Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, basato su inesistenti ragioni organizzative che trova la sua reale motivazione nella partecipazione a uno sciopero da parte del lavoratore, deve essere dichiarato nullo perché discriminatorio. Le conseguenze sono quelle di cui all’art. 18 SL così come previsto dal combinato disposto dell’art. 3 L. 11/5/90 n. 108 e dell’art. 15 SL. (Trib. Milano 7/10/2004, Est. Atanasio, in D&L 2005, con nota di Alba Civitelli, “Sul licenziamento discriminatorio”, 237) Nel caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, ferma restando la necessità di provare l’effettività del processo di riorganizzazione, è legittima ogni ragione (in senso economico) che abbia determinato tale processo e quindi non solo i motivi estranei alle determinazioni imprenditoriali, ossia esigenze di mercato, ma anche le modifiche organizzative esclusivamente finalizzate ad un incremento dei profitti. (Trib. Sulmona 21/09/2004, Est. Paglierini, in Lav. nella giur. 2005, 89) Il motivo oggettivo di licenziamento determinato da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, nel cui ambito rientra anche l’ipotesi di riassetto organizzativo attuato per la più economica gestione dell’impresa, è rimesso alla valutazione del datore di lavoro, senza che il giudice possa sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa; ne consegue che non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità ed opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del reparto o del posto cui era addetto il dipendente licenziato, sempre che risulti l’effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato, né essendo necessario, ai fini della configurabilità del giustificato motivo, che vengano soppresse tutte le mansioni in precedenza attribuite al lavoratore licenziato, ben potendo le stesse essere solo diversamente ripartite ed attribuite. (Fattispecie in tema di licenziamento di un lavoratore con compiti di natura sindacale, nella quale il settore al quale era addetto il lavoratore – dipendente dell’Associazione degli Industriali – era stato assorbito nelle competenze del direttore dell’Associazione medesima). (Cass. 18/8/2004 n. 16163, Pres. Senese Rel. Filadoro, in Lav. nella giur. 2005, 175) Il motivo oggettivo di licenziamento determinato da ragioni inerenti l’attività produttiva deve essere valutato dal datore di lavoro senza che il giudice possa sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa. Il licenziamento deve risultare però dall’effettiva e non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato. Al datore di lavoro permane l’onere di provare, oltre la sussistenza delle ragioni del licenziamento, l’impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore ad altre mansioni nell’ambito dell’organizzazione aziendale. Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo non può essere determinato da esigenze di mero risparmio. (Trib. Grosseto 13/8/2004, Est. Ottati, in Lav. nella giur. 2004, 1208) Ai fini della configurabilità di un legittimo licenziamento per giustificato motivo obiettivo non è sufficiente l’eventuale inidoneità del lavoratore ad effettuare la propria prestazione, in un determinato luogo o secondo determinate modalità, ma occorre anche la prova, a carico del datore di lavoro, circa la impossibilità di reimpiego dello stesso lavoratore nell’ambito dell’organizzazione sindacale. (Nella specie, la S.C. ha confermato la sentenza di merito, che si era pronunciata nel senso dell’illegittimità del licenziamento intimato ad un lavoratore che aveva rifiutato, a causa di una nevrosi della quale soffriva, di sottoporsi ai controlli medici con prelievo sanguigni richiesti dalla società in quanto quest’ultima non era obbligata per legge a sottoporre il dipendente a tali controlli per salvaguardare la sua salute e sicurezza nel luogo di lavoro, ma ne aveva semplice facoltà, ed inoltre non era stata neppure dedotta l’impossibilità di reimpiego del lavoratore in mansioni differenti). (Cass. 27/2/2004 n. 4050, Pres. Mileo Rel. De Luca, in Lav. nella giur. 2004, 900, e in Dir. E prat. Lav. 2004, 1936) Il licenziamento individuale per giustificato motivo oggettivo ex art. 3 della legge 604/1966 è determinato dalla necessità di procedere alla soppressione del posto o del reparto cui è addetto il singolo lavoratore. Ai fini della legittimità dello stesso, sul datore di lavoro incombe la prova della concreta riferibilità del licenziamento a iniziative collegate ad effettive ragioni di carattere produttivo-organizzativo e della impossibilità di utilizzare il lavoratore in altre mansioni compatibili con la qualifica rivestita, in relazione al concreto contenuto professionale dell’attività cui il lavoratore stesso era precedentemente adibito. (Nella specie la S.C. ha confermato la decisione di appello che, in riforma della sentenza di primo grado, aveva ritenuto illegittimo il licenziamento di due dipendenti di un agente assicurativo intimato a seguito della parziale cessione del portafoglio dell’impresa assicuratrice ad altro agente, giudicando priva di riscontro probatorio la dedotta riduzione dell’attività dell’agente per effetto dello scorporo di detto portafoglio-ritenuto solo uno degli elementi concorrenti ad individuare la consistenza dell’impresa-che avrebbe determinato la sovrabbondanza delle posizioni lavorative dei ricorrenti rispetto al nuovo assetto dell’agenzia, nonché la parimenti dedotta riduzione del fatturato, senza che assumesse rilevanza la circostanza della mancata assunzione di altre persone). (Cass. 3/7/2003 n. 10554, Pres. Trezza Rel. Giacalone, in Dir. e prat. lav. 2004, 71) Nella valutazione circa la sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento deve tenersi conto di tutte le circostanze della fattispecie concreta, anche precedenti all’atto di recesso, ivi compreso il comportamento del datore di lavoro, il quale è contrattualmente obbligato ad attivarsi per prevenire o rimuovere situazioni ostative all’utile prosecuzione del rapporto (Cass. 5/3/2003, n. 3250, Pres. Ciciretti, Est. Picone, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2003, 689, con nota di Pietro Ichino e Luigi Cavallaro, Un caso interessante per la riflessione sulla nozione di giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento: due opinioni) Il controllo giudiziale sul licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo comporta la verifica dell’assolvimento, da parte del datore di lavoro, dell’onere di provare tre circostanze: l’effettività della dedotta ristrutturazione organizzativa; la relativa incidenza sulla posizione rivestita in azienda dal lavoratore (la soppressione del reparto o dell’attività cui era addetto il lavoratore licenziato o un riassetto organizzativo per una più razionale ed economica gestione dell’azienda) e l’impossibilità di utilizzare il lavoratore in altre mansioni equivalenti, dovendo in particolare risultare, in base ad inequivoci elementi, che nell’ambito dell’organizzazione aziendale non vi erano, all’epoca del licenziamento, altre possibilità di evitare la risoluzione del rapporto se non quella, vietata dall’art. 2103 c.c., di adibire il lavoratore ad una mansione dequalificante rispetto a quella precedentemente esercitata. (Cass. 17/2/2003 n. 2353, Pres. Ciciretti, Est. Cuoco, in D&L 2003, 402) Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo è illegittimo qualora non risulti dimostrata a cura del datore di lavoro l’integrale soppressione delle attività svolte dal dipendente licenziato all’interno del contesto aziendale. (Trib. Firenze 16/2/2002, Est. Lococo, in D&L 2002, 855, con nota di Filippo Pirelli, “Ultrattività del contratto collettivo e giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento”) Nella nozione di giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento rientra anche l’ipotesi del riassetto organizzativo dell’azienda per una più economica gestione d’essa attuato non per un incremento del profitto ma per far fronte a situazioni economiche sfavorevoli, non occasionali, che incidano in modo decisivo sulla normale attività aziendale (Cass. 18/11/98, n. 11646, in Dir. Lav. 2000, pag. 31, con nota di Lepore) Soppressione del postoIn alto Sussiste il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento nel caso in cui il datore di lavoro – liberamente esercitando la propria attività di impresa ai sensi dell’art. 41 Cost. – decida di esternalizzare tutti i compiti che in precedenza erano svolti dall’ufficio gestione risorse umane, affidando tali attività a un consulente esterno; nessuna rilevanza potendo rivestire la successiva assunzione di una ex dipendente da parte del professionista titolare dello studio cui è stato affidato tale servizio. (Cass. 18/8/2020 n. 17219, Pres. Di Cerbo Rel. Piccone, in Lav. nella giur. 2021, 87) In tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo intimato al lavoratore per soppressione del posto determinato da una diversa redistribuzione delle mansioni tra il personale in servizio, il riscontro di effettività deve concernere la sola scelta aziendale di sopprimere il posto di lavoro occupato dal lavoratore medesimo e la verifica del nesso causale tra la soppressione del posto e le ragioni dell’organizzazione aziendale addotte a sostegno del recesso, essendo irrilevante l’obiettivo perseguito dall’imprenditore (consista esso in una migliore efficienza, in un incremento della produttività, ovvero nella necessità di far fronte a situazioni economiche sfavorevoli o a spese straordinarie), a meno che l’obiettivo in questione, invocato in via esclusiva come causa diretta del recesso, si riveli pretestuoso e carente di veridicità (Nella specie, la S.C. ha cassato la sentenza che, con riferimento al licenziamento intimato ad un lavoratore per effetto di una redistribuzione delle mansioni, aveva ritenuto che andasse provata non la effettività della riorganizzazione, bensì l’andamento economico negativo – dedotto dal datore a fondamento della predetta riorganizzazione soltanto in sede di comparizione per l’espletamento del tentativo di conciliazione – che aveva imposto la riduzione dei costi e la rimodulazione dell’organizzazione del lavoro). (Cass. 14/2/2020 n. 3819, ord., Pres. Nobile Rel. Raimondi, in Lav. nella giur. 2020, con nota di M. Ballistreri, Il contributo della giurisprudenza in tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, 1160) La sopravvenuta impossibilità di utilizzare le prestazioni fino ad allora svolte dal lavoratore a causa di effettive ragioni inerenti l’attività produttiva o l’organizzazione del lavoro o il regolare funzionamento di essa devono essere, nella loro oggettività, tali da determinare il venir meno della posizione lavorativa; ciò si verifica quando le prestazioni divengono inutilizzabili a causa, non già di un atto arbitrario del datore di lavoro, ma di una modifica apportata all’organizzazione dell’attività datoriale cui è collegata eziologicamente la soppressione del posto di lavoro occupato dal lavoratore poi licenziato (il Tribunale ha dichiarato illegittimo il licenziamento di un lavoratore la cui posizione di autista era soppressa a seguito di esternalizzazione e le cui mansioni secondarie erano redistribuite a dipendenti già in servizio). (Trib. Trento 8/5/2018, Giud. Flaim, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2018, con nota di A. Ingrao, “Il giustificato motivo nel Jobs Act: ambito applicativo, ragione organizzativa e confini con il licenziamento nullo”, 776) In presenza di più posizioni lavorative fungibili, si considera illegittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo qualora il criterio di scelta della posizione lavorativa da sopprimere sia riconducibile a un fattore di discriminazione. (Trib. Milano 19/12/2017, ord., Est. Colosimo, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2018, con nota di G. Pacella, “Fungibilità o non fungibilità della prestazione di lavoro: se la nazionalità non è la ragione dell’assunzione, non può essere criterio di scelta nel licenziamento per g.m.o.”, 538) Il giustificato motivo di licenziamento previsto dall’art. 3 legge 604 del 1966 ricorre in caso di soppressione della posizione di lavoro del lavoratore, ma non già qualora questo sia poi sostituito ricorrendo a nuovi lavoratori con contratto di lavoro di collaborazione o consulenza o, a maggior ragione, con contratto a termine. (Cass. 7/8/2017, n. 19655, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Patti, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2017, con nota di M. Pallini, “La (ir)rilevanza dei ‘motivi’ dell’impresa nel sindacato di legittimità del licenziamento economico”, 743) In tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo determinato da ragioni tecniche, organizzative e produttive, compete al giudice che non può, invece, sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, espressione della libertà di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost., il controllo in ordine all’effettiva sussistenza del motivo addotto dal datore di lavoro, in ordine al quale il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di provare, anche mediante elementi presuntivi e indiziari, l’effettività delle ragioni che giustificano l’operazione di riassetto. (Nella specie, il recesso era stato motivato sul presupposto della soppressione del posto cui era addetta la lavoratrice, le cui mansioni erano però state assegnate ad altra dipendente, assunta con contratto a termine per più volte, e avente diverso inquadramento; la S.C., nell’escludere l’effettività delle ragioni indicate dal datore in ragione dell’identità delle mansioni delle lavoratrici, ha ritenuto l’illegittimità del recesso). (Cass. 14/5/2012 n. 7474, Pres. Miani Canevari Est. Napoletano, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2012, 371) Non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità ed opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del reparto o del posto di lavoro cui era addetto il lavoratore licenziato, anche se la riorganizzazione sia attuata per una più economica gestione dell’impresa, e senza che la necessaria verifica dell’effettività delle scelte comporti un’indagine in ordine ai margini di convenienza e di onerosità dei costi connessi alla suddetta riorganizzazione, con il solo limite del controllo della reale sussistenza delle ragioni poste dall’imprenditore a fondamento delle proprie scelte e dell’effettività e non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato. (Cass. 3/8/2011 n. 16925, Pres. Vidiri Rel. Zappia, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2012, con nota di C. Pederzoli, “Licenziamento pretestuoso e motivo illecito: un’incerta linea di confine”, 362) Non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del reparto o del posto a cui era addetto il lavoratore licenziato, sempre che risulti l’effettività e non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato, non essendo peraltro necessario che vengano soppresse tutte le mansioni in precedenza attribuite al lavoratore licenziato, ben potendo le stesse essere solo diversamente ripartite e attribuite. (Cass. 24/5/2011 n. 11356, Pres. Lamorgese Rel. Berrino, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, con commento di Fabio Massimo Gallo, 144) E’ illegittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo intimato dalla società controllata italiana sul presupposto della soppressione delle funzioni cui era adibita la dipendente, laddove emerga che, in ordine alle medesime attività, alla dipendente era stato proposto di iniziare un nuovo rapporto di lavoro regolato dal diritto inglese con la società controllante. (Trib. Milano 11/3/2010, Est. Vitali, in D&L 2010, con nota di Giuseppe Bulgarini d’Elci, “Sul giustificato motivo oggettivo nell’ambito di un’impresa multinazionale e sulla compatibilità ai fini dell’art. 18 SL di collaboratori e progetti fittizi”, 586) Il licenziamento individuale per giustificato motivo oggettivo, quindi, lungi dal discendere da un generico ridimensionamento dell’attività imprenditoriale sussiste solamente laddove ricorra “la necessità di procedere alla soppressione del posto o del reparto cui è addetto il singolo lavoratore, soppressione che non può essere meramente strumentale a un incremento del profitto, ma deve essere diretta a fronteggiare situazioni sfavorevoli non contingenti. (Trib. Bari 11/5/2009, d.ssa Arbore, in Lav. nella giur. 2009, 849) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo, il datore di lavoro che adduca a fondamento del licenziamento la soppressione del posto di lavoro cui era addetto il lavoratore licenziato ha l’onere di provare non solo che al momento del licenziamento non sussisteva alcuna posizione di lavoro analoga a quella soppressa, alla quale avrebbe potuto essere assegnato il lavoratore per l’espletamento di mansioni equivalenti a quelle svolte, ma anche di aver prospettato, senza ottenerne il consenso, la possibilità di un reimpiego in mansioni inferiori rientranti nel suo bagaglio professionale, purché tali mansioni siano compatibili con l’assetto organizzativo aziendale insindacabilmente stabilito dall’imprenditore. (Cass. 13/8/2008 n. 21579, Pres. Senese Est. Bandini, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 1273) E’ illegittimo il licenziamento intimato in ragione della soppressione di un settore lavorativo che, per contro, nei fatti, continua a venire impiegato dalla società, utilizzando in parte gli stessi addetti e, comunque, tutti quelli precedentemente assegnati a tale mansione e organizzando l’attività lavorativa in modo pressoché identico a prima. (Trib. Milano 3/7/2008, Est. Beccarini Crescenzi, in Orient. giur. lav. 2008, 743) Il licenziamento per motivo oggettivo determinato da ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva è scelta riservata all’imprenditore, quale responsabile della corretta gestione dell’azienda anche dal punto di vista economico e organizzativo, sichhé essa, quando sia effettiva e non simulata o pretestuosa, non è sindacabile dal giudice quanto ai profili della sua congruità e opportunità (Nella specie, la S.C. ha confermato la sentenza impugnata che, nel riconoscere l’effettività della scelta imprenditoriale di razionalizzare l’attività aziendale, aveva ritenuto legittimo il licenziamento intimato a una biologa addetta a un laboratorio di analisi, il cui posto di lavoro, a seguito della contrazione delle richieste concernenti l’attività del laboratorio – la quale attività, per detto motivo, si era concentrata in soli due giorni alla settimana – era stato soppresso, con assegnazione delle sue mansioni ad altra dipendente, in aggiunta a quelle da quest’ultima già svolte, senza che l’azienda avesse proceduto ad assunzioni in sostituzione della lavoratrice licenziata). (Cass. 22/8/2007 n. 17887, Pres. De Luca Est. Monaci, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 190) In tema di giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento, tra la soppressione parziale del posto e il riassetto organizzativo dell’azienda mediante l’utilizzazione di altri dipendenti in servizio, non c’è un nesso di automatica e diretta consequenzialità, nel senso che la valutazione del giustificato motivo oggettivo non si esaurisce nel riconoscimento dell’autenticità, e non pretestuosità, della soppressione parziale, implicando, la soppressione parziale, una maggiore o minore attività residuale che il lavoratore licenziato potrebbe svolgere per il solo fatto che già la espletava in precedenza. Conseguentemente, il datore di lavoro può respingere la parziale utilità residuale della prestazione lavorativa riorganizzando l’attività produttiva con la redistribuzione delle mansioni tra altri dipendenti solo dopo che sia stata esclusa, per ragioni tecnico-produttive, la possibilità di espletamento, a opera del lavoratore solo parzialmente eccedentario, della parte di prestazione lavorativa liberatasi per effetto della parziale soppressione del posto ricoperto e quindi la possibilità di continuare a utilizzare, solo parzialmente, il dipendente nella stessa posizione lavforativa originaria, esclusione verificabile ove la prestazione del lavoratore non sia in concreto utilizzabile altrove in azienda ovvero in caso di indisponibilità, del lavoratore medesimo, a svolgere l’attività lavorativa residuata con rapporto part-time. (Cass. 16/3/2007 n. 6229, Pres. Mercurio est. Amoroso, in Lav. nella giur. 2007, con commento di Giorgio Mannacio, 790) La domanda riconvenzionale proposta dal datore di lavoro per l’accertamento dei presupposti di un futuro licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo del dipendente – per l’ipotesi di reintegrazione dello stesso a seguito di pronuncia di illegittimità del licenziamento intimato per giusta causa – è inammissibile, giacchè l’indagine in merito all’effettiva soppressione dell’a posizione lavorativa e alla possibilità di repechage deve essere effettuata in rapporto all’organizzazione aziendale esistente all’epoca del recesso e non può essere quindi effettuata preventivamente. (Trib. Milano 14/3/2007, Est. Di Leo, in D&L 2007, con nota di Sara Huge, “Simulazione della malattia e accertamenti giudiziari”, 533) È illegittimo il licenziamento intimato per giustificato motivo oggettivo, a seguito di soppressione della unità produttiva allorquando sia documentato l’avvenuto trasferimento della ubicazione territoriale della stessa. Diversamente opinando si legittimerebbe il licenziamento in relazione al mutamento del solo stabile all’interno del quale fosse collocata l’azienda o un ramo della stessa. (Trib. Milano 29/9/2005, Est. Di Leo, in Orient. Giur. Lav 2005, 929) È giustificato il licenziamento di un dirigente avvenuto a seguito di una seria ed effettiva riorganizzazione aziendale. (Trib. Milano 1/4/2003, Est. Peragallo, in D&L 2003, 767) Il controllo giurisdizionale del licenziamento intimato per giustificato motivo oggettivo, consistente in un riassetto organizzativo che comporti la soppressione del posto di lavoro, è limitato alla verifica della reale sussistenza del motivo asserito dall’imprenditore, al quale, nell’esercizio della libertà di iniziativa economica garantita dall’art. 41 Cost., è riservata la scelta sulle modalità attuative del riassetto, senza che su ciò possa influire l’appartenenza dell’impresa ad un gruppo economico o societario, non potendo il lavoratore vantare diritti nei riguardi delle imprese del gruppo o con riferimento ai loro assetti produttivi. (Cass. 1/2/2003, n. 1527, Pres. Ciciretti, Rel. Rosselli, in Dir. e prat. lav. 2003, 1281) Il giudice non può sindacare la scelta dei criteri di gestione dell’impresa, atteso che tale scelta è espressione di iniziativa economica tutelata dall’art. 41 Cost.; egli deve controllare solo la reale sussistenza del motivo addotto dall’imprenditore. Di conseguenza non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità ed opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del posto di lavoro cui era addetto il dipendente licenziato, sempre che risulti la effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato, né essendo necessario ai fini della configurabilità del giustificato motivo oggettivo, che vengano soppresse tutte le mansioni in precedenza attribuite al lavoratore licenziato. (Corte d’appello Milano 23/7/2002, Est. Ruiz, in Lav. nella giur. 2003, 190) In tema di giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento, non è sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità e opportunità la scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo, del reparto o del posto a cui era addetto il dipendente licenziato, sempreché risulti l’effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato. Tale principio si estende anche ai datori di lavoro non imprenditori, come il condominio, in forza dell’art. 1, l. n. 604/1966 (nella specie, era stato licenziato il portiere del condominio e la S.C. ha confermato la decisione di merito che aveva accertato la soppressione della posizione lavorativa del portiere organizzata secondo il modulo del rapporto di lavoro subordinato e l’affidamento, sucessivamente alla ristrutturazione dell’immobile, di un servizio di custodia a una società). (Cass. 7/1/2002, n.88, Pres. Ianniruberto, Est. Mammone, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2003, 108). E’ illegittimo il licenziamento di un lavoratore per giustificato motivo oggettivo qualora, pur essendo dimostrata l’avvenuta chiusura della sede periferica alla quale il dipendente era addetto, l’azienda abbia violato l’obbligo di repechage attraverso il contemporaneo affidamento di mansioni analoghe presso la sede centrale ad un consulente esterno. (Trib. Milano 20/12/2001, Est. Ianniello, in D&L 2002, 433, con nota di Andrea Bordone, ” Unità produttiva e regime del licenziamento”) In tema di licenziamento, ai sensi dell’art. 3, l. n. 604/66, non sussiste un giustificato motivo oggettivo, quando risulti che il dipendente licenziato sia stato immediatamente sostituito con altro lavoratore adibito alle medesime mansioni, anche se apprendista e titolare di un salario inferiore a quello dovuto al primo; infatti, in tal caso il recesso non si inserisce in una diversa organizzazione aziendale intesa al mantenimento o al potenziamento del livello di produttività o di competitività dell’azienda, essendo invece unico obiettivo dell’imprenditore quello di conseguire un risparmio sulle retribuzioni al personale dipendente attraverso la sostanziale elusione degli obblighi contrattuali assunti nei confronti di questo. (Cass. 17/3/01, n. 3899, pres. Trezza, est. Dell’Anno, in Orient. giur. lav. 2001, pag. 374) Ai fini della configurabilità della ipotesi di soppressione del posto di lavoro, integrante – nella impossibilità di una diversa collocazione del dipendente – il giustificato motivo oggettivo di recesso, non è necessario che vengano soppresse tutte le mansioni in precedenza attribuite al lavoratore licenziato, nel senso della loro assoluta, definitiva eliminazione nell’ottica dei profili tecnici e degli scopi propri dell’azienda di appartenenza, atteso che le stesse ben possono essere soltanto diversamente ripartite e attribuite nel quadro del personale già esistente, secondo insindacabili e valide, o necessitate, scelte datoriali relative ad una ridistribuzione o diversa organizzazione imprenditoriale, senza che detta operazione comporti il venir meno della effettività di tale soppressione (Cass. 14/6/00, n. 8135, pres. Lanni, in Orient. giur. lav.2000, pag. 742) L’interesse alla soppressione di un posto di lavoro in relazione all’obiettivo ridimensionamento dell’attività produttiva e la legittimità del conseguente licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo non vengono meno in riferimento alla circostanza che il lavoratore interessato si trovi in aspettativa non retribuita per espletamento di un mandato politico (Cass. 4/3/00, n. 2470, pres. De Musis, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2000, pag. 349 e in Riv. it. dir. lav 2000, pag. 676, con nota di Nappi, Svolgimento di funzioni pubbliche elettive e licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo) La soppressione del posto di lavoro cui era addetto il lavoratore dall’atto dell’assunzione non determina, di per sé sola, la risoluzione del rapporto di lavoro, che infatti si realizza solo quando possa escludersi la possibilità di adibire il lavoratore ad altra attività equivalente (Trib. Milano 18 ottobre 1999, est. Martello, in D&L 2000, 218) Mentre è consentito all’imprenditore procedere a licenziamento individuale, o collettivo, per dichiarata necessità di sopprimere posti di lavoro in esubero non è per contro legittima la decisione di espellere lavoratori in base alla semplice determinazione di sostituirli con altri addetti meno qualificati o meno costosi per l’azienda (Pret. Milano, sez. Cassano d’Adda, 8/1/96, est. Litta Modignani, in D&L 1996, 776) Deve ritenersi illegittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo nel caso in cui le mansioni svolte dai lavoratori licenziati non siano state soppresse, ma siano state semplicemente ridistribuite tra altri lavoratori (Cass. 24/6/95 n. 7199, pres. Mollica, est. Simoneschi, in D&L 1996, 496, nota S. MUGGIA, Brevi osservazioni sul licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo) In caso di licenziamento per soppressione del posto di lavoro, si deve escludere che la riorganizzazione del lavoro, da cui consegue il giustificato motivo oggettivo allegato, possa rispondere a esigenze di carattere soggettivo di un mero incremento del profitto imprenditoriale, essendo invece necessaria la prova, che grava sul datore di lavoro, di una sfavorevole situazione congiunturale non contingente, che influisca in modo decisivo sulla normale attività e imponga un’effettiva esigenza di riduzione dei costi (Pret. Roma 23/3/95, est. Cocchia, in D&L 1995, 1054) Sopravvenuta inidoneità fisicaIn alto In caso di licenziamento intimato per inidoneità fisica o psichica, il mancato assolvimento dell’onere del repêchage comporta, senza alcun margine discrezionale da parte del giudice, lo stesso trattamento riservato al difetto di giurisdizione, vale a dire la reintegrazione del lavoratore e la corresponsione di un risarcimento monetario compreso entro le dodici mensilità in forza dell’art. 18, co. 7, l. n. 300/1970 (come modificato da l. n. 92/2012). (Cass. 12/12/2018 n. 32158, Est. Amendola, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2019, con nota di C. Valenti, “Licenziamento per sopravvenuta inidoneità: la Cassazione conferma l’applicazione della tutela ripristinatoria attenuata anche nei casi di violazione dell’onere del repêchage”, 264) In tema di licenziamento per inidoneità fisica sopravvenuta del lavoratore, derivante da una condizione di handicap, sussiste l’obbligo della previa verifica, a carico del datore di lavoro, della possibilità di adattamenti organizzativi nei luoghi di lavoro – purché comportanti un onere finanziario proporzionato alle dimensioni e alle caratteristiche dell’impresa e nel rispetto delle condizioni di lavoro dei colleghi dell’invalido – ai fini della legittimità del recesso, in applicazione dell’art. 3, co. 3-bis, del d.lgs. n. 216/2003, di recepimento dell’art. 5 della Direttiva 2000/78/Ce, secondo un’interpretazione costituzionalmente orientata e conforme agli obiettivi posti dal predetto art. 5. (Cass. 26/10/2018 n. 27243, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Boghetich, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2019, con nota di M. Aimo, “Inidoneità sopravvenuta alla mansione e licenziamento: l’obbligo di accomodamenti ragionevoli preso sul serio dalla Cassazione”, 145) In tema di licenziamento per inidoneità fisica sopravvenuta del lavoratore, derivante da una condizione di handicap, sussiste l’obbligo della previa verifica, a carico del datore di lavoro, della possibilità di adattamenti organizzativi ragionevoli nei luoghi di lavoro ai fini della legittimità di recesso, che discende, pur con riferimento a fattispecie sottratte ratione temporis all’applicazione dell’art. 3, comma 3-bis, del d.lgs. n. 216/2003, di recepimento dell’art. 5 della Dir. 2000/78/Ce, dall’interpretazione del diritto nazionale in modo conforme agli obiettivi posti dal predetto art. 5. (Cass. 19/3/2018 n. 6798, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Spena, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2019, con nota di M. Aimo, “Inidoneità sopravvenuta alla mansione e licenziamento: l’obbligo di accomodamenti ragionevoli preso sul serio dalla Cassazione”, 145) Nel caso di sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica del lavoratore, ricade sul datore di lavoro l’onere della prova che non gli è possibile impiegarlo in mansioni equivalenti in un ambiente compatibile con il suo stato di salute; sul medesimo datore incombe poi anche l’onere di contrastare eventuali allegazioni del dipendente, nei cui confronti è esigibile una collaborazione nell’accertamento di un possibile repêchage in ordine all’esistenza di altri posti di lavoro nei quali egli possa utilmente essere ricollocato. (Cass. 10/3/2015 n. 4757, Pres. Macioce Rel. Buffa, in Lav. nella giur. 2015, 635) Il datore di lavoro, prima di poter legittimamente licenziare il lavoratore divenuto inidoneo allo svolgimento delle proprie mansioni, deve verificare che non siano presenti nel proprio assetto produttivo altre mansioni – quand’anche inferiori – cui quest’ultimo può essere assegnato (c.d. “repechage”). Il lavoratore ha solo l’onere di allegare tale possibilità, mentre grava sul datore di lavoro la prova dell’inesistenza di tali mansioni. (Cass. 19/10/2012 n. 18025, Pres. De Renzis Rel. Venuti, in Lav. nella giur. 2013, 91) L’inidoneità permanente rileva quale impossibilità della prestazione lavorativa anche se accertata senza ricorso alla consulenza tecnica d’ufficio (nella specie, relativa a un licenziamento di un infermiere seguito all’impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione derivante da una forma di permanente inidoneità psico-fisica del lavoratore, la Corte ha confermato la decisione dei giudici del merito che non avevano disposto alcuna CTU, atteso che, dalle risultanze probatorie in atti, emergeva con chiarezza che le condizioni di salute del lavoratore erano tali per cui egli avrebbe potuto svolgere solo mansioni aventi determinate caratteristiche, cioè di tipo sedentario, non stressanti e che non comportassero turni di notte; la società datrice di lavoro aveva dimostrato l’impossibilità di reimpiegare il lavoratore in mansioni equivalenti a quelle di appartenenza o anche inferiori, ma compatibili con il suo stato di salute, nell’ambito dell’organizzazione aziendale. In questa situazione la richiesta CTU sarebbe stata una “formalità superflua”, in quanto finalizzata ad accertare dati che già emergevano con evidenza dalle risultanze istruttorie, in quanto non era in discussione l’esistenza di una generica residua capacità lavorativa del lavoratore). (Cass. 26/4/2012 n. 6501, Pres. Lamorgese Rel. Tria, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, 717) Nel caso in cui il motivo del licenziamento consista nella inidoneità permanente del lavoratore allo svolgimento delle mansioni per sopravvenuta infermità occorre anche fornire la prova dell’impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore a mansioni inferiori, utilizzabili dall’impresa secondo l’assetto organizzativo di essa insindacabilmente stabilito dall’imprenditore. (Trib. Milano 24/1/2012, Giud. Tarantola, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, 412) In tema di sopravvenuta inidoneità del lavoratore allo svolgimento delle mansioni assegnate, il licenziamento disposto dal datore di lavoro va ricondotto, ove il lavoratore possa essere astrattamente impiegato in mansioni diverse, al giustificato motivo oggettivo ai sensi dell’art. 3 l. n. 604 del 1966, con diritto al termine e all’indennità di preavviso, diversamente dall’ipotesi in cui la prestazione sia divenuta totalmente e definitivamente impossibile, senza possibilità di svolgere mansioni alternative, nel qual caso va ravvisata una causa di risoluzione del rapporto che non ne consente la prosecuzione, neppure provvisoria ai sensi dell’art. 2119 c.c., ed esclusa l’applicabilità dell’istituto del preavviso; ne consegue, con riguardo allo speciale rapporto di lavoro di lavoro dei piloti, che in caso di inidoneità permanente al volo resta preclusa al datore di lavoro la possibilità di disporre l’esecuzione di una prestazione lavorativa diversa – prevedendo il contratto collettivo di settore (art. 11), a favore del pilota dichiarato inidoneo, solamente un diritto di preferenza per le “nuove” assunzioni del personale di terra – con conseguente immediata risoluzione del rapporto di lavoro senza attribuzione, in mancanza di un diverso riconoscimento nel contratto collettivo, dell’indennità di preavviso (nella specie, la Suprema Corte, in applicazione dell’anzidetto principio, ha cassato con rinvio la decisione impugnata, dovendosi accertare se, nel caso concreto, il contratto collettivo attribuisse l’indennità di mancato preavviso anche nell’ipotesi di risoluzione del rapporto per inidoneità permanente al volo). (Cass. 29/3/2010 n. 7531, Pres. Roselli Est. Picone, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2010, 474, e in in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2011, con nota di Federico D’Aiuto, “Impossibilità sopravvenuta assoluta nella prestazione nel settore della navigazione: risoluzione di diritto o recesso unilaterale”, 3) L’esercizio dell’iniziativa economica privata, garantita dall’art. 41 Cost., non è sindacabile nei suoi aspetti tecnici dall’autorità giurisdizionale, ma deve svolgersi nel rispetto dei diritti al lavoro (artt. 4, 35, 36 Cost.) e alla salute (art. 32 Cost., 2087 c.c.), con la conseguenza che non viola l’art. 41 cit. il giudice che dichiara illegittimo il licenziamento intimato per sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica alle mansioni assegnate, senza che il datore di lavoro abbia accertato se il lavoratore potesse essere addetto a mansioni diverse e di pari livello, evitando trasferimenti di altri lavoratori o alterazioni dell’organigramma aziendale. (Cass. 13/10/2009 n. 21710, Pres. ed est. Roselli, in D&L 2009, 1058) In caso di sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica del lavoratore alle mansioni, quand’anche il ricorso ai mezzi offerti dalle avanzate tecnologie sia in grado di eliminare i gravosi sforzi fisici nell’esecuzione di determinati lavori, non è configurabile un obbligo dell’imprenditore di adottarli per porsi in condizione di cooperare all’accettazione della prestazione lavorativa, che vada oltre il dovere di garantire la sicurezza imposto dalla legge. (Cass. 19/8/2009 n. 18387, Pres. Ianniruberto Est. Picone, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2010, con nota di Benedetto Fratello, “Limiti all’obbligo di cooperazione del datore di lavoro in caso di sopravvenuta inidoneità psicofisica del lavoratore”, 441) La sopravvenuta inidoneità psicofisica del lavoratore può giustificare il licenziamento solo se il datore di lavoro offre documentazione specifica che attesti la inidoneità stessa e dia prova di aver valutato correttamente la possibilità di adibire il lavoratore ad altre mansioni compatibili. (Trib. Ravenna 29/10/2007, ord., Giud. Riverso, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, con commento di Stefano Tortini, 938) In caso di licenziamento per sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica del dipendente allo svolgimento delle mansioni lavorative, il datore di lavoro è tenuto a dimostrare l’impossibilità di assegnare al lavoratore mansioni anche non equivalenti, a condizione che il lavoratore abbia, anche senza forme rituali, manifestato la propria disponibilità ad accettarle. (Cass. 6/3/2007 n. 5112, Pres. Mattone Est. Monaci, in D&L 2007, con nota di Andrea Bordone, “Inidoneità sopravvenuta della prestazione e repechage”, 504) È illegittimo il licenziamento intimato al lavoratore a seguito di sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica o psichica a svolgere le mansioni affidategli, allorchè il datore di lavoro, cui incombe il relativo onere, non provi l’impossibilità di adibirlo a mansioni equivalenti e compatibili con le residue capacità lavorative, semprechè il rinvenimento di idonee mansioni non debba comportare una modifica dell’assetto organizzativo aziendale. (Trib. Firenze 4/7/2003, Est. Nuvoli, in D&L 2004, con nota di Irene Romoli “Sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica del dipendente allo svolgimento delle mansioni affidategli: un giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento”, 170) Ai fini della responsabilità ex art. 2087 c.c., il datore di lavoro, che abbia acquisito conoscenza della malattia del lavoratore, suscettibile, con valutazione prognostica, di probabile od anche solo possibile ingravescenza oltre i limiti della sua naturale evoluzione negativa, e perciò tendente all’inidoneità alla mansioni affidategli, in ragione delle modalità di espletamento delle stesse, è legittimato al licenziamento solo previo accertamento di fatto, insindacabile in sede di giudizio di legittimità, ove congruamente e logicamente motivato, della sopraggiunta incompatibilità del dipendente alle mansioni e quindi dell’impossibilità di mantenimento del posto di lavoro in relazione al pregiudizio, da valutarsi in termini di certezza o anche di rilevante probabilità di aggravamento delle sue condizioni di salute per effetto dell’attività lavorativa in concreto svolta (Cass. 13/12/00, n. 15688, pres. Ianniruberto, est. Mazzarella, in Orient. giur. lav. 2001, pag. 145) In caso di impossibilità sopravvenuta parziale allo svolgimento della prestazione, sussiste il diritto del lavoratore ad essere assegnato a mansioni diverse ed equivalenti (semprechè sussistenti in azienda) ed anche inferiori, dietro manifestazione di consenso del lavoratore alla dequalificazione finalizzata alla salvaguardia del superiore interesse all’occupazione, per le cui richieste al datore di lavoro il lavoratore deve attivarsi precisando le residue attitudini professionali tali da rendergli possibile una diversa collocazione in azienda (nella fattispecie è stato anche ritenuto che il lavoratore certificato inidoneo alla mansione di operatore unico aeroportuale – caratterizzata intrinsecamente dall’attività di carico e scarico bagagli e zavorra – non può pretendere di permanere nella stessa mansione venendo esonerato dal compito principale e gravoso del carico e scarico, eliminabile eventualmente non già con mezzi e strumenti in dotazione dell’azienda ma con l’acquisto di mezzi ad hoc offerti dalle nuove tecnologie, non essendo configurabile un obbligo dell’imprenditore di adottarli per porsi in condizione di cooperare all’accettazione della prestazione lavorativa di soggetti affetti da infermità, che vada oltre il dovere di garantire la sicurezza imposta dal decreto legislativo n. 626/94) (Cass. 5/8/00, n. 10339, pres. Genghini, in Lavoro e prev. oggi 2000, pag. 2083) Nel caso di sopravvenuta infermità permanente del lavoratore e di conseguente impossibilità della prestazione lavorativa – che è un’ipotesi nettamente distinta dalla malattia del dipendente (anche essa causa di impossibilità della prestazione lavorativa) in quanto ha natura e disciplina giuridica diverse, atteso che, a differenza della malattia ( avente carattere temporaneo), essa ha, invece, carattere permanente o, quanto meno, durata indeterminata e indeterminabile – è ravvisabile un giustificato motivo di recesso del datore di lavoro ex artt. 3 L. n. 604/66, 1463 e 1464 c.c., indipendentemente dal superamento del periodo di comporto, soltanto quando la sopravvenuta incapacità fisica abbia carattere definitivo e manchi un apprezzabile interesse del datore di lavoro alle future prestazioni lavorative (ridotte) del dipendente (Cass. 14/12/99 n. 10465, est. Castiglione, in Riv. Giur. Lav. 2000, pag. 439, con nota di Valente, Lavoro a tempo parziale e periodo di comporto tra vecchia disciplina e nuove disposizioni; in D&L 2000, 359, n. Veraldi, Rapporto di lavoro a tempo parziale e periodo di comporto) Non è legittimo il licenziamento di una lavoratrice che abbia perso una parte della capacità lavorativa qualora risulti possibile al datore di lavoro modificare la propria organizzazione aziendale compatibilmente con le sopravvenute limitazioni della lavoratrice medesima; infatti, non può ritenersi onere eccessivo e sproporzionato per l’azienda, tale da escludere l’obbligo del cd. repêchage, il sopraggiunto forzato minore rendimento della lavoratrice – dipendente da oltre vent’anni – e la conseguente necessità di sopperirvi con altra forza lavoro (Trib. Milano 26 ottobre 1999, est. Frattin, in D&L 2000, 219) La sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica del dipendente allo svolgimento delle mansioni alle quali è addetto non integra una causa di risoluzione per sopravvenuta impossibilità della prestazione ai sensi degli artt. 1463 e 1464 c.c., se non nei limiti della configurabilità del giustificato motivo ex art. 3, L. 15/7/66 n. 604, e quindi a fronte dell’onere gravante sul datore di lavoro di allegare e dimostrare l’impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore ad altra attività riconducibile alle mansioni già svolte o ad altre equivalenti o, se ciò è impossibile, ad altre inferiori, compatibilmente con l’assetto organizzativo dell’impresa (Cass. 7/8/98 n. 7755, pres. La Torre , est. Roselli, in D&L 1998, 1029) Deve ritenersi illegittimo il licenziamento comminato al lavoratore per presunta inidoneità fisica allo svolgimento delle mansioni, nel caso in cui il datore di lavoro, in violazione degli artt. 2087 c.c. e 48 D. Lgs. 19/9/94 n. 626, abbia omesso di introdurre mezzi meccanici atti ad alleviare gli sforzi fisici del lavoratore (nella fattispecie il lavoratore non è stato reintegrato nel posto di lavoro ex art. 18 SL, per intervenuto secondo licenziamento intimato per dichiarato superamento del periodo di comporto) (Pret. Monza, sez. Desio 15/12/97, est. Di Lauro, in D&L 1998, 765) Scarso rendimentoIn alto In tema di licenziamento individuale, deve escludersi la sussistenza di un giustificato motivo oggettivo quando, al di là di ogni riferimento a ragioni dell’impresa, il licenziamento si fondi su un comportamento riconducibile alla sfera volitiva del lavoratore e lesivo dei suoi doveri contrattuali integrante un inadempimento, implicante, da parte del datore di lavoro, un giudizio negativo nei suoi confronti. Pertanto, il licenziamento per scarso rendimento costituisce un’ipotesi di recesso per notevole inadempimento degli obblighi contrattuali del prestatore. (Cass. 22/11/2016, n. 23735, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Amendola, in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di D. Calderara, “L’autoqualificazione del datore di lavoro nel licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo non ha rilevanza”, 272) Ai fini dell’esonero definitivo dal servizio dei lavoratori autoferrotranvieri dipendenti da aziende esercenti il pubblico servizio di trasporti in regime di concessione, la fattispecie dello scarso rendimento previsto dall’art. 27, lett. d, del Regolamento attuativo, all. A, al r.d. n. 148 del 1931, è ipotesi diversa e separata da quella previsto dallo stesso art. 27, lett. b, che disciplina invece la malattia. Conseguentemente, le ripetute assenze per malattia non possono considerarsi come utili ai fini della configurabilità dello scarso rendimento idoneo a giustificare l’esonero dal servizio dell’agente. (Cass. 2/9/2015 n. 17436, ord., Pres. Stile Est. Manna, in Riv. giur. lav. prev. soc. 2016, con nota di Michelangelo Salvagni, “Scarso rendimento ed eccessiva morbilità nel rapporto di lavoro degli autoferrotranvieri”, 39) In senso generale, l’ipotesi dell’esonero per scarso rendimento nell’area delle ipotesi di licenziamento per giustificato motivo soggettivo, presuppone una prova in positivo sul colpevole e negligente inadempimento degli obblighi contrattuali da parte del lavoratore nell’espletamento delle mansioni; conseguentemente, ai fini dell’esonero per scarso rendimento, non si dovrebbe tenere in considerazione delle ipotesi di assenza del lavoratore dovuta a malattia. (Trib. Firenze 6/11/2014, Giud. Taiti, in Lav. nella giur. 2015, 420) È legittimo il licenziamento intimato al lavoratore per scarso rendimento qualora sia provata, sulla scorta della valutazione complessiva dell’attività resa dal lavoratore stesso e in base agli elementi dimostrati dal datore di lavoro, una evidente violazione della diligente collaborazione dovuta dal dipendente – e a lui imputabile – in conseguenza dell’enorme sproporzione tra gli obiettivi fissati dai programmi di produzione per il lavoratore e quanto effettivamente realizzato nel periodo di riferimento, tenuto conto della media di attività tra i vari dipendenti e indipendentemente dal conseguimento di una soglia minima di produzione. (Nella specie, la S.C. ha confermato la sentenza impugnata, che aveva affermato la legittimità del licenziamento intimato, sul presupposto che le reiterate assenze effettuate dal lavoratore, comunicate all’ultimo momento e “agganciate” ai giorni di riposo, determinavano uno scarso rendimento e una prestazione lavorativa non sufficientemente e proficuamente utilizzabile per il datore di lavoro, incidendo negativamente sulla produzione aziendale). (Cass. 4/9/2014 n. 18678, Pres. Roselli Est. I. Tricomi, in Lav. nella giur. 2015, con commento di Enrico Gragnoli, 40, in Lav. nella giur. 2015, con commento di Giovanna Pastore, 167) È illegittimo il licenziamento intimato al lavoratore per scarso rendimento qualora sia risultata provata una evidente violazione della diligente collaborazione dovuta dal dipendente – e a lui imputabile – in conseguenza dell’enorme sproporzione fra gli obiettivi fissati dai programmi di produzione per il lavoratore e quanto effettivamente realizzato nel periodo di riferimento, avuto riguardo al confronto dei risultanti dati globali riferiti a una media di attività tra i vari dipendenti ed indipendentemente dal conseguimento di una soglia minima di produzione. (Cass. 1/12/2010 n. 24361, Pres. Vidiri Est. Stile, in Lav. nella giur. 2011, 214) E’ legittimo il licenziamento intimato al lavoratore per scarso rendimento qualora sia risultato provato, sulla scorta della valutazione complessiva dell’attività resa dal lavoratore stesso e in base agli elementi dimostrati dal datore di lavoro, una evidente violazione della diligente collaborazione dovuta dal dipendente – e a lui imputabile – in conseguenza dell’enorme sproporzione tra gli obiettivi fissati dai programmi di produzione per il lavoratore e quanto effettivamente realizzato nel periodo di riferimento, avuto riguardo al confronto dei risultanti dati globali riferito a una media di attività trab i vari dipendenti e indipendentemente dal conseguimento di una soglia minima di produzione. (Nella specie, la S.C. ha confermato la sentenza di merito che aveva respinto la domanda con la quale un lavoratore, inquadrato nella qualifica di operatore di vendita, chiedeva la declaratoria di illegittimità del licenziamento intimatogli a seguito della contestazione di non aver raggiunto l’obiettivo di fatturato stabilito nei mesi da marzo a ottobre 2003). (Cass. 22/1/2009 n. 1632, Pres. Ianniruberto Est. Balletti, in Lav. nella giur. 2009, 517) Secondo un’interpretazione letterale e logica della norma, l’ipotesi di esonero dal servizio per scarso rendimento prevista dall”art. 27, comma 1, lett. d), All. A, R.D. 8 gennaio 1931, n. 148-che regola il rapporto di lavoro degli autoferrotranviari-non è una misura disciplinare, dal momento che si riferisce all’organizzazione del lavoro ed al buon andamento del servizio; infatti i comportamenti del lavoratore-che, pure, singolarmente considerati, potrebbero avere anche una valenza disciplinare-vengono tuttavia in rilievo sotto l’aspetto oggettivo dell’incidenza sulla regolarità del servizio. (Trib. Milano 3/4/2003, Est. Vitali, in Lav. nella giur. 2003, 1166) Lo scarso rendimento rilevante ai fini del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo sussiste soltanto allorché esso cagioni la perdita totale dell’interesse del datore di lavoro alla prosecuzione del rapporto (nel caso specifico è stata confermata la sentenza di merito che aveva ritenuto insufficiente a giustificare il licenziamento l’impedimento fisico di una cameriera d’albergo, dal quale era derivata una mera difficoltà nello svolgimento delle mansioni contrattuali e in particolare la riduzione del numero di stanze che la lavoratrice era in grado di riassettare giornalmente). Lo scarso rendimento del lavoratore può essere addotto, a seconda delle circostanze, come giustificato motivo di licenziamento, oppure come giustificato motivo soggettivo, quando esso sia l’effetto di un inadempimento degli obblighi contrattuali. Alla valutazione della sussistenza e gravità di tale inadempimento deve concorrere l’apprezzamento di tutte lecircostanze del caso concreto (Cass. 5/3/2003, n. 3250, Pres. Ciciretti, Est. Picone, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2003, 689, con nota di Pietro Ichino e Luigi Cavallaro, Un caso interessante per la riflessione sulla nozione di giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento: due opinioni) Il rendimento lavorativo inferiore al minimo contrattuale, o d’uso, non integra ex se l’inesatto adempimento che, a norma dell’art. 1218 c.c., si presume, fino a prova contraria, imputabile a colpa del debitore, dato che, nonostante la previsione di minimi quantitativi, il lavoratore è obbligato ad un facere e non ad un risultato e la inadeguatezza della prestazione resa può essere imputabile alla stessa organizzazione dell’impresa o comunque a fattori non dipendenti dal lavoratore. Conseguentemente, in relazione al cosiddetto scarso rendimento, il datore di lavoro che intende farlo valere quale giustificato motivo soggettivo di licenziamento, ai sensi dell’art. 3, l. n. 604/66, non può limitarsi – neanche nei casi in cui il risultato della prestazione non è collegato ad elementi intrinsecamente aleatori – a provare il mancato raggiungimento del risultato atteso ed eventualmente la sua oggettiva esigibilità, ma è onerato della dimostrazione di un notevole inadempimento degli obblighi contrattuali del lavoratore, quale fatto complesso alla cui valutazione deve concorrere anche l’apprezzamento degli aspetti concreti del fatto addebitato, tra cui il grado di diligenza richiesto dalla prestazione e quello usato dal lavoratore (Cass. 19/8/00, n. 11001, pres. Prestipino, in Orient. giur. lav.2000, pag. 752; in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2001, pag. 346, con nota di Bartalotta, Scarso rendimento e prova per presunzioni della sua imputabilità a condotte negligenti del lavoratore; in Dir. lav. 2001, pag. 200. In senso conforme, v. Cass. 10/11/00, n. 14605, pres. De Musis, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2000, pag. 1070; in Lavoro e prev. oggi 2001, pag. 134) Per poter essere ricondotto a un’ipotesi di giustificato motivo soggettivo di licenziamento, lo scarso rendimento, in quanto forma di inadempimento agli obblighi contrattuali, deve essere valutato non solo sulla base del mancato raggiungimento del risultato atteso e oggettivamente esigibile, ma anche e soprattutto alla luce del comportamento negligente del lavoratore che lo abbia determinato (Cass. 24/5/99 n. 5048, pres. Buccarelli, est. Mercurio, in D&L 1999, 921) Al licenziamento per scarso rendimento, riconducibile in via generale alla categoria del licenziamento disciplinare, si applica la disciplina procedimentale stabilita per le sanzioni disciplinari dall’art. 7 SL (Pret. Milano 14/4/99, est. Ianniello, in D&L 1999, 681) Nel caso di licenziamento per scarso rendimento il datore di lavoro deve dimostrare non solo il mancato raggiungimento degli obiettivi e l’esigibilità della prestazione attesa, ma anche la concreta e immotivata negligenza del lavoratore nell’adempimento dell’obbligazione lavorativa, con la conseguenza che, in assenza della prova della negligenza, si presume che l’inadeguatezza della prestazione fornita dipenda da fattori socio-ambientali oppure dall’incidenza dell’organizzazione dell’impresa e, comunque, da fattori non dipendenti dalla volontà del lavoratore (Pret. Voghera 26/2/99, est. Ferrari, in D&L 1999, 680) Nel caso di licenziamento per scarso rendimento, il datore di lavoro non può limitarsi a provare solo il mancato raggiungimento del risultato atteso o l’oggettiva sua esigibilità, ma deve anche dimostrare che la causa di esso derivi da negligenza nell’espletamento della prestazione lavorativa (Trib. Roma 15/11/97, pres. Sorace, est. Filabozzi, in D&L 1998, 477) E’ illegittimo il licenziamento per scarso rendimento del lavoratore, determinato da una diminuzione del rendimento della durata di 4 mesi pari al 20%, in quanto il rapporto di lavoro deve considerarsi un’obbligazione di fare e non di risultato (Cass. 23/2/96 n. 1421, pres. Mollica, est. Mattone, in D&L 1996, 1019, nota Muggia) Costituisce giustificato motivo soggettivo di licenziamento lo scarso rendimento nel caso in cui il datore di lavoro provi che il lavoratore ha lasciato inadempiuta in modo notevole la prestazione normalmente esigibile con riferimento alla media dei lavoratori e laddove il medesimo lavoratore non raggiunga la prova che tale inadempimento sia dipendente da cause a lui non imputabili (Trib. Torino 3/5/95, pres. Pernisari, est. Rossi, in D&L 1995, nota AMATO, Scarso rendimento e onere della prova) CarcerazioneIn alto Anche nel caso di licenziamento intimato in ragione della custodia cautelare in carcere cui sia stato sottoposto il lavoratore, il datore di lavoro è tenuto al rispetto delle regole in materia di licenziamenti disciplinari stabiliti dall’art. 7, legge n. 300 del 1970. (Trib. Milano 5/7/2005, Est. Peragallo, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2005, 925) L’art. 102 bis disp. att. cod. proc. pen., nel prevedere che chi sia stato sottoposto alla misura della custodia cautelare in carcere ovvero a quella degli arresti domiciliari ha diritto ad essere reintegrato nel posto di lavoro qualora venga pronunciata in suo favore sentenza di assoluzione, di proscioglimento o di non luogo a procedere ovvero venga disposto provvedimento di archiviazione, presuppone che il licenziamento sia stato determinato in stretto rapporto di causalità con la detenzione, e cioè che il recesso del datore di lavoro sia fondato esclusivamente sul fattore obiettivo dello “status custodiae” del prestatore d’opera; ne consegue che la citata disposizione non può dare titolo alla reintegrazione nel posto di lavoro qualora il licenziamento risulti, come nella specie, in via autonoma giustificato sulla base di elementi ulteriori rispetto alla mera assenza del lavoratore determinata da provvedimento cautelare. (Nella specie, la S.C ha confermato la sentenza impugnata, la quale aveva accertato che il licenziamento era stato intimato al lavoratore sottoposto alla misura della custodia in carcere, sia per motivi disciplinari, e cioè per motivi riconducibili, in base al Ccnl applicabile, ad una giusta causa, sia per impossibilità sopravvenuta alla prestazione, ai sensi dell’art. 1464 c.c. e dell’art. 3 della legge n. 604/1966, e non anche per lo stato di detenzione al quale egli era stato sottoposto). (Cass. 1/4/2003, n. 4935, Pres. Ciciretti, Rel. Stile, in Dir. e prat. lav. 2003, 1989) Stante il principio della immutabilità dei motivi di recesso, non è consentito al datore di lavoro che abbia comminato un licenziamento disciplinare dedurre in giudizio, quale ulteriore motivazione del licenziamento, la carcerazione preventiva del dipendente. La carcerazione preventiva per fatti estranei allo svolgimento del rapporto non costituisce inadempimento contrattuale, ma integra un fatto oggettivo determinante l’oggettiva impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione, il cui rilievo deve essere valutato alla stregua dei criteri oggettivi di cui all’art. 3 L. 15/7/66 n. 604 con relativo onere probatorio a carico del datore di lavoro (nella specie il giudice ha ritenuto una carenza di organico non riferita a singole qualifiche e l’intervenuta assunzione in corso d’anno di 80 nuovi addetti non fosse sufficiente a dimostrare il venire meno dell’apprezzabile interesse alla prosecuzione della prestazione dopo una carcerazione preventiva durata tre mesi). (Trib. Livorno 17/9/2002, in D&L 2003, 411) La disposizione prevista dall’art. 102 bis disp. att. c.p.p., quale introdotto dall’art. 24 L. 8/8/95 n. 332 – secondo cui chiunque sia stato licenziato perché sottoposto alla misura della custodia cautelare in carcere ovvero degli arresti domiciliari ha diritto di essere reintegrato nel posto di lavoro in caso di sentenza di assoluzione, di proscioglimento o di non luogo a procedere ovvero di provvedimento di archiviazione – non ha inciso sulla disciplina della legittimità del licenziamento, bensì soltanto sulle sue conseguenze essendo stato riconosciuto il diritto alla reintegrazione nel posto di lavoro; né sulla legittimità del licenziamento, fondato esclusivamente sul protrarsi dell’impossibilità da parte del lavoratore di rendere la sua prestazione, può incidere il successivo accertamento dell’ ingiustizia della carcerazione preventiva (Cass. 2/5/00 n. 5499, pres. Trezza, est. Lupi, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2000, pag. 492 e in Dir. lav. 2001, pag. 20, con nota di Pozzaglia, La reintegrazione del lavoratore licenziato per ingiusta detenzione) Deve essere accolta l’istanza di reintegrazione ex art. 700 c.p.c. nel posto di lavoro di una lavoratrice licenziata a seguito di arresto per fatti estranei all’attività lavorativa convalidato con ordinanza del Gip, cui ha fatto seguito la concessione degli arresti domiciliari con autorizzazione ad assentarsi dall’abitazione per riprendere la propria attività lavorativa (Trib. Milano 21 febbraio 2000 (ord.), est. Mascarello, in D&L 2000, 460) La carcerazione preventiva del lavoratore per fatti estranei al rapporto di lavoro non costituisce inadempimento di obblighi contrattuali, ma integra un fatto oggettivo che determina una sopravvenuta impossibilità temporanea della prestazione lavorativa, in relazione alla quale la persistenza nel datore di lavoro dell’interesse a ricevere le ulteriori prestazioni del dipendente detenuto deve essere valutata secondo criteri obiettivi, a norma dell’art. 3, seconda parte, L. 15 luglio 1966, n. 604, cioè con riferimento alle esigenze dell’azienda, da valutarsi con giudizio ex ante e non già ex post. Si dovrà cioè tener conto delle dimensioni dell’azienda stessa, del tipo di organizzazione tecnico-produttiva in concreto attuata, della natura e importanza delle mansioni del lavoratore detenuto, della durata ragionevolmente prevedibile della custodia cautelare, della possibilità di affidare temporaneamente ad altri dipendenti i compiti da lui svolti senza ricorrere a nuove assunzioni e, più in generale, di ogni altra circostanza rilevante ai fini della determinazione della misura della tollerabilità dell’assenza (nella specie, è stata cassata la sentenza del Tribunale di Salerno 7 febbraio 1997, per avere i giudici di merito compiuta la valutazione sull’impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione con giudizio ex post, e non già ex ante e per avere essi suggerito, in aperta violazione dell’art. 2103 c.c., l’opportunità di adibire il lavoratore anche a mansioni inferiori a quelle di assunzione o alle ultime effettivamente svolte, ovvero di avvicendare più lavoratori su una qualifica superiore, allo specifico fine che nessuno di loro potesse effettivamente acquisirla) (Cass. 1/9/99, n. 9239, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2000, pag. 547, con nota di Borzaga, In tema di carcerazione preventiva del lavoratore e giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento) Non costituisce valido motivo di licenziamento per impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione lo stato di custodia cautelare del dipendente, protrattosi per un periodo di due mesi e mezzo, quando la dimensione dell’organizzazione aziendale e le mansioni del dipendente consentano di gestire senza significativi contraccolpi l’assenza del lavoratore e possa ragionevolmente prevedersi, in riferimento all’entità della pena applicabile e all’assenza di precedenti penali, che il lavoratore possa usufruire di benefici incidenti sullo stato di privazione della libertà (Trib. Milano 24/12/96, pres. Mannacio, est. Sbordone, in D&L 1997, 637) Ai fini della sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento, derivante dalla sopravvenuta impossibilità per il lavoratore di offrire la prestazione lavorativa a causa di carcerazione preventiva, grava sul datore di lavoro la prova dell’esistenza di un apprezzabile e specifico pregiudizio all’attività aziendale, ovvero della necessità di una modificazione stabile e definitiva dell’organizzazione del lavoro, tale da rendere il reinserimento del lavoratore incompatibile con la situazione aziendale (Pret. Milano 13/2/95, est. Porcelli, in D&L 1995, 711) Factum principis (forza maggiore)In alto L’inidoneità di insegnante della religione cattolica in scuola pubblica, per revoca del nulla osta da parte della competente autorità ecclesiastica, nella specie disposta in quanto l’insegnante era lavoratrice nubile in stato di gravidanza, determina la risoluzione del rapporto di lavoro, ex art. art. 1463 c.c., pur con lavoratrice in tale stato, per impossibilità assoluta e definitiva della prestazione (nella specie si è trattato di mancata riconferma di incarico annuale) . (Cass. 24/2/2003 n. 2803, Pres. Mileo Est. Picone, in Foro it. 2003, parte prima, 2762) Costituisce giustificato motivo di licenziamento per impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione il ritiro, da parte dell’aviazione civile, della tessera di accesso alle piste ad un dipendente sottoposto a procedimento penale. (Trib. Roma 22/11/2002, Est. Coco, in Lav. nella giur. 2003, 388) Il pilota di aeromobile addetto alle funzioni di primo o secondo pilota che abbia compiuto il sessantesimo anno d’ età non ha diritto, se ha maturato i requisiti pensionistici, alla prosecuzione del rapporto di lavoro in quanto la licenza di abilitazione non consente di svolgere tali mansioni a chi abbia raggiunto l’ età indicata; ha invece diritto (se abbia optato in tal senso) alla prosecuzione fino al sessantacinquesimo anno d’ età nei casi in cui fosse, in precedenza, addetto a mansioni di terzo pilota o di istruttore o nel caso in cui non abbia raggiunto i requisiti pensionistici (in quest’ ultimo caso il datore di lavoro è tenuto a rinvenire, nell’ organizzazione aziendale, mansioni compatibili con la sua ridotta abilitazione). (Cass. 30/10/2002, n. 15366, Pres. Senese, Est. Stile, in Foro it. 2003 parte prima, 142) La scadenza del permesso di soggiorno determina l’impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione (o una situazione alla stessa assimilabile), in relazione al divieto per il datore di lavoro di occupare alle proprie dipendenze lavoratori extracomunitari privi di permesso di soggiorno, ovvero il cui permesso sia scaduto, revocato o annullato (art. 22, 10° comma, D. Lgs. 25/7/88 n. 286), divieto che non osta alla mera pendenza del rapporto di lavoro, ma ne preclude l’esecuzione. Detta impossibilità non determina la risoluzione di diritto del rapporto, ma la sua sospensione ad ogni effetto economico e giuridico, e può costituire giustificato motivo il licenziamento, restano in tal caso escluso il diritto alla retribuzione durante il periodo di preavviso, nel perdurare della mancata prestazione. (Cass. 11/7/2001 n. 9407, Pres. Trezza Est. Toffoli, in D&L 2002, 181, con nota di Livio Neri, “Sulla perenne precarietà del rapporto di lavoro del cittadino extracomunitario”) Il provvedimento di ritiro del porto d’armi, emesso nei confronti di lavoratore svolgente mansioni di guardia particolare giurata, può autorizzare il datore di lavoro al licenziamento, per giustificato motivo oggettivo, ove dimostri che la prestazione è diventata totalmente impossibile, occupando egli solo lavoratori addetti all’attività di guardia particolare giurata, oppure, ove lo stesso datore occupi anche personale addetto a mansioni diverse, non richiedenti alcun titolo di polizia, che egli non ha un interesse apprezzabile alla prosecuzione del rapporto, intendendosi tale “apprezzamento”, ai sensi dell’art. 3, l. n. 604/66, alla stregua delle ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, all’organizzazione del lavoro e al regolare funzionamento di essa (Cass. 24/10/00, n. 13986, pres. Spanò, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2000, pag. 1064) Nell’ipotesi di temporaneo ritiro – da parte della competente autorità – del tesserino di accesso alle aree aeroportuali a un dipendente aeroportuale, la legittimità del licenziamento presuppone la dimostrazione, da parte del datore di lavoro, delle ragioni tecniche che, in considerazione della imprevedibilità della durata della sospensione, di per sé oggettivamente impediscano, con giudizio ex ante, la regolare funzionalità dell’azienda (Cass. 21/7/00, n. 9620, pres. Grieco, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2001, pag. 366, con nota di Agostini, Ancora sull’impossibilità temporanea della prestazione e licenziamento) Affinché l’impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione da parte del dipendente possa dar luogo a un giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento, il datore di lavoro deve provare di non poter utilizzare il lavoratore in altre mansioni, nel rispetto dell’art. 2103 c.c. (nel caso di specie, il giudice ha ritenuto ingiustificato il licenziamento di un dipendente guardia giurata motivato dalla revoca da parte dell’autorità prefettizia del relativo decreto di nomina, senza alcuna valutazione delle possibilità di un diverso impiego del lavoratore in un settore operativo aziendale diverso dall’attività di vigilanza) (Pret. Milano 28/6/99, est. Martello, in D&L 1999, 924) Il mancato rinnovo, da parte della guardia di finanza, del nullaosta per il tesserino aeroportuale, indispensabile per l’esecuzione delle prestazioni lavorative del dipendente di una società aeroportuale, motivato dal fatto che lo stesso aveva subito un periodo di carcerazione preventiva, si configura come un factum principis caratterizzato dai requisiti della temporaneità e dell’imprevedibilità dell’esito e quindi come un fatto oggettivo, determinante la sopravvenuta impossibilità parziale della prestazione del lavoratore ai sensi dell’art. 1464 c.c., in relazione alla quale la persistenza o meno nel datore di lavoro dell’interesse a ricevere le ulteriori prestazioni del lavoratore forzatamente assente deve essere ispirata al principio, espresso nell’art. 27 c. 2 Cost., del minimo danno che può derivare dalla pendenza del procedimento penale, che deve essere valutato, nell’ambito di un giudizio riservato al giudice di merito, in base alla durata prevedibile nel momento in cui fu intimato il licenziamento e non in base alla durata effettiva della revoca dell’autorizzazione (nel caso di specie, è stata confermata la sentenza del Tribunale che aveva ritenuto illegittimo il licenziamento intimato dopo solo 9 giorni dalla carcerazione preventiva, che è in seguito cessata subito dopo l’interrogatorio del lavoratore) (Cass. 28/7/94 n. 7048, pres. Benanti, est. Roselli, in D&L 1995, 416, nota MUGGIA, Brevi osservazioni sul licenziamento per ritiro del tesserino aeroportuale e sulla quantificazione del risarcimento del danno) Termine dei lavori nei cantieriIn alto Con riferimento alle imprese edili, la cessazione dei rapporti per fine lavoro è sottratta dall’art. 24, L. n. 223 del 1991 alla disciplina dei licenziamenti individuali plurimi, con la conseguenza che il datore di lavoro, in ipotesi di contestazione della legittimità dei suddetti licenziamenti, deve provare di non poter utilmente impiegare i lavoratori licenziati in altre attività, senza che tale prova possa ritenersi superflua in relazione all’esistenza della prova concernente la cessazione dal lavoro, dovendosi verificare in concreto, e in relazione all’articolazione delle diverse lavorazioni, la non riassorbibilità delle eccedenze di personale in altri cantieri o attività dell’impresa (Cass. 1/2/00, n. 1117, pres. Lanni, in Mass. giur. lav. 2000, pag. 383) Deve ritenersi illegittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo nell’ipotesi in cui, pur a fronte del completamento dei lavori presso il cantiere al quale era addetto il lavoratore licenziato, del calo delle commesse e della conseguente riduzione dell’orario di lavoro, il datore di lavoro proceda ad assunzioni di lavoratori provenienti da società collegate (Trib. Napoli 28/1/97, pres. Baccari, est. Panariello, in D&L 1997, 647) Impossibilità di essere utilizzati in altre mansioniIn alto In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il lavoratore ha l’onere di dimostrare l’esistenza del rapporto a tempo indeterminato e di allegare l’illegittimo rifiuto del datore di continuare a farlo lavorare in assenza di un giustificato motivo, mentre incombono sul datore l’onere di allegare e provare l’esistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo, che include anche l’impossibilità del c.d. repêchage, ossia dell’inesistenza di altri posti di lavoro in cui utilmente ricollocare il lavoratore. (Cass. 15/3/2021 n. 7218, Pres. Raimondi Rel. Arienzo, in Lav. nella giur. 2021, 659) È illegittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo del lavoratore somministrato a tempo indeterminato quando l’impossibilità di ricollocazione del lavoratore dipendente presso un altro soggetto utilizzatore sia un fatto manifestamente insussistente, non avendo l’agenzia somministratrice fornito prova in giudizio della mancanza di occasioni di lavoro e, al contrario, avendo il dipendente dimostrato l’esistenza di opportunità lavorative compatibili con il suo profilo professionale. (Trib. Roma 5/10/2017, n. 8106, Est. Bellini, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2018, con nota di D. Comande, “Lavoro a tempo indeterminato in somministrazione e giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento: l’estensione del sindacato giudiziale”, 3) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’obbligo di repechage a carico del datore di lavoro deve estendersi alla verifica della possibilità di adibizione del lavoratore a mansioni inferiori se il dipendente esercitava, promiscuamente alle mansioni soppresse, anche compiti non riconducibili alla propria qualifica, sebbene in misura minore. (Cass. 26/5/2017, n. 13379, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Patti, in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di M. Salvagni, “Il repechage in mansioni inferiori dopo il Jobs Act: obbligo o facoltà?”, 577) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, non sussiste alcun onere per il lavoratore-ricorrente di allegare eventuali altre posizioni lavorative, compatibili con il suo bagaglio professionale, nelle quali egli avrebbe potuto essere utilmente ricollocato. Spetta interamente al datore di lavoro-convenuto allegare e provare l’impossibilità del c.d. repêchage. (Cass. 5/1/2017, n. 160, Pres. Venuti Est. Lorito, in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di G. Calvellini, “Obbligo di repêchage: vecchi e nuovi problemi all’esame della Cassazione”, 245) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’onere del datore di lavoro di provare l’adempimento dell’obbligo di repêchage va assolto anche con riferimento alle mansioni inferiori, ove rientranti nel bagaglio professionale del lavoratore. Infatti, il datore di lavoro, in conformità al principio di correttezza e buona fede nell’esecuzione del contratto, è tenuto a prospettare al lavoratore la possibilità di assegnazione a mansioni inferiori disponibili quale unica alternativa al licenziamento e fornire la relativa prova al giudizio. (Cass. 21/12/2016, n. 26467, Pres. Napoletano Est. Spena, in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di G. Calvellini, “Obbligo di repêchage: vecchi e nuovi problemi all’esame della Cassazione”, 245) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’onere del datore di lavoro di provare l’adempimento dell’obbligo di repêchage si estende anche alle mansioni inferiori compatibili con il bagaglio professionale del lavoratore. Ne consegue che, in mancanza di posizioni equivalenti, il recesso è da ritenersi illegittimo quando il datore di lavoro abbia omesso di prospettare al proprio dipendente la possibilità di assegnazione a mansioni inferiori disponibili come unica alternativa alla cessazione del rapporto. (Cass. 9/11/2016 n. 22798, Pres. Nobile Est. Amendola, in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di G. Calvellini, “Obbligo di repêchage: vecchi e nuovi problemi all’esame della Cassazione”, 245) È illegittimo, con conseguente reintegrazione, il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo del lavoratore somministrato a tempo indeterminato quando l’impossibilità di ricollocazione del lavoratore per mancanza di occasioni di lavoro sia risultato un fatto evidentemente insussistente, avendo l’agenzia somministratrice assunto un altro lavoratore con profilo professionale fungibile per somministrarlo presso un soggetto utilizzatore operante nel medesimo settore del ricorrente. (Trib. Roma 2/11/2016, ord., Est. Pagliarini, in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di L. Giasanti, “Licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e somministrazione di lavoro”, 296) È illegittimo, con conseguente reintegrazione, il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo del lavoratore somministrato a tempo indeterminato quando l’impossibilità di ricollocazione del lavoratore per mancanza di occasioni di lavoro sia risultato un fatto evidentemente insussistente, non avendo l’agenzia somministratrice tenuto conto di un’opportunità lavorativa adeguata al profilo del ricorrente. (Trib. Velletri 29/7/2016, Est. Falcione, in Riv. Giur. Lav. prev. soc. 2017, con nota di L. Giasanti, “Licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e somministrazione di lavoro”, 296) In tema di licenziamenti per giustificato motivo soggettivo ex art. 3, L. n. 604 del 1966, il datore di lavoro deve provare l’impossibilità del c.d. repechage, ma non anche l’impossibilità di rimedi alternativi alla prescelta riorganizzazione del lavoro, poiché diversamente opinando si introdurrebbe surrettiziamente un non consentito controllo giurisdizionale sul merito delle scelte dell’imprenditore relative all’organizzazione tecnico produttiva della sua azienda. (Cass. 21/7/2016 n. 15082, Pres. Bronzini Est. Manna, in Lav. nella giur. 2016, 1019) Nel caso di recesso motivato da ragioni organizzative, l’obbligo di repêchage – operante per quanto riguarda operai, impiegati e quadri in base al costante orientamento giurisprudenziale – non trova invece applicazione nei confronti del personale inquadrato con qualifica dirigenziale, nei cui confronti vige il regime della libera recedibilità. (Cass. 12/7/2016 n. 14193, Pres. Venuti Rel. D’Antonio, in Lav. nella giur. 2016, 1023) Con riferimento all’obbligo di repechage va osservato che se è pur vero che spetta al datore di lavoro assolvere l’onere probatorio in merito all’impossibilità di reimpiegare, è altrettanto vero che grava su quest’ultimo un onere di allegazione. Il lavoratore licenziato deve, in particolare, quanto meno indicare altri posti di lavoro esistenti – e non occupati da altri dipendenti – che siano compatibili con la propria qualifica e le proprie mansioni, con la possibilità, quindi, di un utile reimpiego, e a quel punto il datore di lavoro deve provare le ragioni del mancato reimpiego. (Trib. Milano 2/12/2013, Giud. Gasparini, in Lav. nella giur. 2014, 293) In caso di licenziamento per soppressione del posto di lavoro il mancato adempimento dell’onere di repêchage non rientra nel “fatto posto a fondamento del licenziamento”, la cui manifesta insussistenza può dar luogo alla tutela reintegratoria di cui all’art. 18, co. 7, St. lav., dovendosi piuttosto ricollegare alle “altre ipotesi” in cui il giudice, pur accertando profili di illegittimità del licenziamento, dichiara il rapporto di lavoro risolto e si limita a condannare il datore a risarcire il danno ex art. 18, co. 5, St. lav. (Trib. Varese 4/9/2013, ord., Giud. Fumagalli, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Carmen Di Carlussio, “Licenziamento economico: alternative di reimpiego prospettabili al lavoratore e sanzioni per il caso di omesso repêchage”, 168) La violazione dell’obbligo di repêchage, non costituendo “il fatto posto a base del licenziamento” bensì una sua conseguenza, comporta l’applicazione della tutela indennitaria forte di cui al co. 5 del novellato art. St. lav. (Trib. Roma 8/8/2013, ord., Giud. Pagliarini, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Carmen Di Carlussio, “Licenziamento economico: alternative di reimpiego prospettabili al lavoratore e sanzioni per il caso di omesso repêchage”, 167) Accertata la sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo posto dal datore di lavoro a fondamento del licenziamento, la prova dell’impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore licenziato ad altre mansioni compatibili con il suo livello professionale può essere fornita anche mediante presunzioni; fra di esse assume rilievo il fatto che il lavoratore, prima del licenziamento, abbia rifiutato la conversione del rapporto di lavoro a tempo pieno in rapporto di lavoro part-time. (Cass. 6/6/2013 n. 14319, Pres. Vidiri Rel. D’Antonio, in Lav. nella giur. 2014, con commento di Luigi Andrea Cosattini, 145) Nel caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’obbligo di repêchage a carico del datore di lavoro comporta unicamente la ricerca di mansioni corrispondenti alla professionalità di cui il lavoratore è già dotato e non implica – al solo fine di garantire la salvaguardia del posto di lavoro – anche il diverso onere di procedere alla riquialificazione del medesimo dipendente. (Cass. 11/3/2013 n. 5693, Pres. Stile Rel. Maisano, in Lav. nella giur. 2013, 519) In caso di licenziamento individuale per giustificato motivo oggettivo determinato da ragioni inerenti l’attività produttiva, il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di provare – con riferimento alla capacità professionale del lavoratore e alla organizzazione aziendale esistente all’epoca del licenziamento, anche attraverso fatti positivi, tali da determinare presunzioni semplici – l’impossibilità di adibire utilmente il lavoratore in mansioni diverse dalle precedenti. (Cass. 13/6/2012 n. 9656, Pres. Roselli Est. Ianniello, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2013, con nota di Maurizio Falsone, “Sul cd. Obbligo di repêchage e la ‘dequalificazione contrattata’”, 67) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di dedurre e provare in giudizio che al momento del licenziamento non sussisteva alcuna posizione di lavoro utile, alla quale avrebbe potuto essere assegnato il lavoratore licenziato per l’espletamento di mansioni equivalenti a quelle da ultimo svolte o, in mancanza, anche di mansioni di livello professionale inferiore, provando altresì, in quest’ultima ipotesi, di avere offerto al lavoratore tale opportunità di prosecuzione del rapporto in compiti professionalmente inferiori, esistenti e comunque utili per l’impresa e che questa offerta non è stata accettata, prima del licenziamento. (Cass. 15/5/2012 n. 7515, Pres. Roselli Est. Ianniello, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2013, con nota di Maurizio Falsone, “Sul cd. Obbligo di repêchage e la ‘dequalificazione contrattata’”, 67) Il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di provare, anche mediante elementi presuntivi e indiziari, l’impossibilità di una differente utilizzazione del lavoratore in mansioni diverse da quelle precedentemente svolte; tale prova, tuttavia, non deve essere intesa in modo rigido, dovendosi esigere dallo stesso lavoratore che impugni il licenziamento una collaborazione nell’accertamento di un possibile repechage, mediante l’allegazione dell’esistenza di altri posti di lavoro nei quali egli poteva essere utilmente ricollocato, e conseguendo a tale allegazione l’onere del datore di lavoro di provare la non utilizzabilità nei posti predetti; inoltre, può concorrere a provare la mancata effettuazione di altre assunzioni nel periodo seguente il licenziamento per le medesime mansioni già assegnate al lavoratore licenziato anche l’esibizione da parte del datore di lavoro del libro matricola, se completo e tenuto in conformità con la legge. (Cass. 26/4/2012 n. 6501, Pres. Lamorgese Est. Tria, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2012, 362) L’obbligo datoriale di adibire il lavoratore divenuto inidoneo a mansioni equivalenti si considera efficacemente assolto allorché questi, attraverso la prova testimoniale e l’esibizione del libro matricola, dimostri l’inesistenza di posti in organico equivalenti. (Cass. 26/4/2012 n. 6501, Pres. Lamorgese Est. Tria, in D&L 2012, 552) Quanto all’obbligo del c.d. repechage, deve osservarsi che lo stesso riguarda le ipotesi nelle quali il licenziamento trova la sua giustificazione nell’incompatibilità tra la struttura aziendale e la posizione lavorativa posseduta dal lavoratore nel suo ambito. In tal caso il potere risolutorio può essere legittimamente esercitato solo allorché il datore di lavoro abbia verificato che la professionalità del lavoratore da licenziare non sia utilizzabile in alcun modo nella sua organizzazione produttiva. Diversa invece è l’ipotesi in cui l’esercizio del potere risolutorio sia l’effetto non della incompatibilità – per ragioni tecnologiche – fra professionalità del lavoratore e struttura organizzativa, bensì della soppressione di una parte dell’azienda, del suo ridimensionamento, che prescinde dalla valutazione delle professionalità in essa coinvolte ed è piuttosto l’effetto della scelta riservata esclusivamente al datore di lavoro di determinare, nell’ambito di un diritto costituzionalmente garantitogli (art. 41 Cost.), la giusta dimensione dell’azienda in relazione alle esigenze di mercato. In tal caso è un gruppo di dipendenti a essere coinvolto nella vicenda estintiva, non in ragione della loro professionalità, bensì per effetto della loro collocazione in un certo settore destinato ad essere soppresso o ridotto. (Trib. Roma 17/6/2011, Giud. Bracci, in Lav. nella giur. 2011, 1060) In materia di obbligo di repechage, il datore di lavoro deve dimostrare che non sia possibile impiegare il lavoratore presso tutte le sedi dell’azienda, anche all’estero. (Cass. 15/7/2010 n. 16579, Pres. Sciarelli Est. Monaci, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2011, 182) Ai fini della prova della sussistenza del giustificato motivo obiettivo del licenziamento, l’onere della dimostrazione della impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore allo svolgimento di altre mansioni analoghe a quelle svolte in precedenza, pur non potendo essere posto a carico del lavoratore (in quanto gravante interamente sul datore di lavoro), implichi comunque per il primo un onere di deduzione e allegazione degli elementi posti a fondamento dell’azione e dei presupposti della sua domanda, sicché, ove il lavoratore non prospetti nel ricorso tale possibilità, neppure insorge l’onere per il datore di lavoro convenuto di offrire la prova della concreta insussistenza di tale possibilità di diverso e conveniente utilizzo del dipendente licenziato. (Trib. Roma 2/9/2010, Pres. Baroncini, in Lav. nella giur. 2010, 1144) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’impossibilità di impiegare in altra posizione deve essere provata dal datore di lavoro con riferimento a tutte le sedi o articolazioni dell’impresa, comprese quelle collocate all’estero. (Cass. 15/7/2010 n. 16579, Pres. Sciarelli Est.Monaci, in D&L 2010, con nota di Andrea Bordone, “Obbligo di repechage e rilevanza delle filiali estere”, 857, e in Lav. Nella giur. 2010, 1044) Per quanto riguarda l’obbligo di repechage il lavoratore ha l’onere di indicare altri posti di lavoro, esistenti nella struttura imprenditoriale del datore di lavoro, che siano compatibili con la qualifica e le mansioni del lavoratore licenziato, e non siano già occupati da altri lavoratori. (Trib. Bologna 7/7/2010, Giud. Marchesini, in Lav. Nella giur. 2010, 1053 Il datore di lavoro è tenuto a giustificare oggettivamente il recesso anche con l’impossibilità di assegnare mansioni non equivalenti nel solo caso in cui il lavoratore abbia, sia pure senza forme rituali, manifestato la sua disponibilità ad accettarle. (Cass. 19/8/2009 n. 18387, Pres. Ianniruberto Est. Picone, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2010, con nota di Benedetto Fratello, “Limiti all’obbligo di cooperazione del datore di lavoro in caso di sopravvenuta inidoneità psicofisica del lavoratore”, 441) La possibilità di adibire il lavoratore inidoneo per motivi di salute ad altro lavoro, che deve essere proficuo, ovviamente, per l’amministrazione, deve essere valutata in relazione alla pianta organica e alle posizioni professionali previste dalla contrattazione collettiva nell’ambito dell’organizzazione datoriale, non potendosi pretendere, nell’ambito del bilanciamento di interessi costituzionalmente protetti, da un canto dall’art. 4 e 32 della costituzione, dall’altro dall’art. 97 Cost., che l’amministrazione, per ricollocare il dipendente inidoneo, modifichi la propria organizzazione, escludendo da talune posizioni lavorative una parte delle attività che le connotano, quelle incompatibili con le condizioni di salute per il lavoratore. (Fattispecie nella quale un collaboratore scolastico era stato dichiarato permanentemente inidoneo alla mansione del profilo, con possibilità di utilizzazione in “mansioni leggere che non comportassero contatto costante con gli alunni”). (Trib. Trieste 21/10/2008, Est. Barzazi, in Lav. nelle P.A. 2008, 1131) Affinché sussista il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento il datore di lavoro deve dare la prova dell’impossibilità di utilizzare il dipendente in altri settori della sua azienda, anche assegnandolo a mansioni diverse, purché non dequalificanti. (Trib. Milano 16/7/2008, Est. Mariani, in Orient. giur. lav. 2008, 2008, 739) In tema di répechage il rapporto di specificazione esistente fra le norme degli artt. 1463-1464 c.c. e quelle dell’art. 3 della L. n. 604/1966 determina la necessità del controllo di legittimità del licenziamento e tale controllo in relazione all’invocazione dell’impossibilità sopravvenuta, deve riguardare anche l’esistenza della possibilità che il lavoratore svolga altra attività lavorativa rientrante nelle mansioni di provenienza o in altre equivalenti. Parimenti si deve osservare che grava anche sul lavoratore un onere di allegazione, seppur iniziale, in ordine ai posti di lavoro idonei a un suo reimpiego. (Trib. Milano 19/11/2007, Dott. Martello, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 428) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’onere della prova spetta al datore anche sotto il profilo dell’impossibilità di una diversa utilizzazione del dipendente – il c.d. repechage – con dimostrazione che tutti i posti residui equivalenti a quello del dipendente licenziato sono stabilmente occupati da altri lavoratori. Dal momento che non è possibile gravare il datore di lavoro di una prova diabolica o negativa e impossibile, tale onere va temperato con il richiedere che anche il lavoratore indichi circostanze di fatto utili a dimostrare o anche solo a far presumere l’esistenza, nell’ambito dell’azienda, di posti di lavoro cui poter essere ancora adibito. (Trib. Milano 8/10/2007, Dott. Taraborrelli, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 199) Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo per soppressione del posto di lavoro può essere ritenuto legittimo solo qualora il datore di lavoro dimostri di aver adempiuto all’obbligo di repechage avendo riscontrato l’assoluta impossibilità di ricollocazione del lavoratore estromesso in altra posizione di lavoro equivalente, fermo restando che la scelta del datore di lavoro di procedere a una riorganizzazione aziendale, che può comportare la soppressione di un posto di lavoro, se supportata dalla buona fede e debitamente provata, non può essere sindacata da parte del Giudice. (App. Roma 16/6/2006, Pres, Cataldi, in ADL 2007, con nota di Mariele Cottone, “Sul licenziamento per soppressione del posto di lavoro: obbligo di repechage e oneri probatori”, 252) Ai fini della prova della sussistenza del giustificato motivo obiettivo del licenziamento, l’onere incombente sul datore di lavoro, della dimostrazione della impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore allo svolgimento di altre mansioni analoghe a quelle svolte in precedenza, deve essere contenuto nell’ambito delle circostanze di fatto e di luogo reali, verificando sul piano concreto la incompatibilità della professionalità del lavoratore licenziato con il nuovo assetto organizzativo dell’azienda e tenendo conto di dati oggettivamente rilevabili che possono essere sintomatici di tale incompatibilità, quali la mancata indicazione di alternative occupazionali da parte del dipendente licenziato o la mancata assunzione di altri dipendenti. In tale ambito e a tali fini, pur gravando interamente l’onere della prova sul datore di lavoro, il lavoratore è, però, tenuto a fornire elementi utili a individuare l’esistenza di realtà idonee a una sua possibile diversa collocazione, così configurandosi, comunque, su di esso un onere di deduzione e di allegazione circa la possibilità di reimpiego. (Cass. 23/6/2005 n. 13468, Pres. Senese Est. Nobile, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2005, 647) Qualora il lavoratore non possa più svolgere le mansioni cui sia addetto e l’impedimento sia a lui imputabile per dolo o colpa, è legittimo il licenziamento intimato dal datore di lavoro per giustificato motivo oggettivo consistente nella sopravvenuta impossibilità della prestazione lavorativa in relazione alle mansioni suddette, senza che il recedente debba fornire prova di non aver potuto adibire il lavoratore ad altro posto nell’azienda, anche con mutamento di mansioni, essendo tale prova necessaria solo quando l’impedimento non sia addebitabile al lavoratore. (Nella specie, la S.C. ha cassata la sentenza di merito che, senza dare rilievo al comportamento dei lavoratori, aveva ritenuto illegittimo il licenziamento di due dipendenti della Società Aeroporti di Roma – cui era stato ritirato il tesserino di accesso all’area aeroportuale in seguito a denuncia in flagranza per tentato furto di bagagli – per non aver la società fornito la prova dell’impossibilità di un loro diverso utilizzo). (Cass. 6/6/2005 n. 11753, Pres. Ciciretti rel. Celentano, in Lav. nella giur. 2006, 94) Ai fini della prova della sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo del licenziamento, l’onere della dimostrazione della impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore allo svolgimento di altre mansioni analoghe a quelle svolte in precedenza, pur gravando interamente sul datore di lavoro e non potendo essere posto a carico del lavoratore, implica comunque per quest’ultimo un onere di deduzione ed allegazione della possibilità di essere adibito ad altre mansioni, sicchè, ove il lavoratore ometta di prospettare nel ricorso tale possibilità, non insorge per il datore di lavoro l’onere di offrire la prova sopraindicata. (Cass. 2/4/2004 n. 6566, Pres. Sciarelli Rel. Guglielmucci, in Lav. e prev. oggi 2004, 921) Provata l’unicità del complesso aziendale facente capo a più società, è illegittimo perché priva di idonea motivazione il licenziamento intimato da una società che non abbia valutato la possibilità di ricollocare il lavoratore nell’ambito dell’intero complesso. Ne consegue il diritto del dipendente ad essere riassunto (ovvero risarcito) dalla società cui appartenga la posizione disponibile, anche se rimasta estranea all’atto di recesso. L’esercizio dell’attività nella medesima sede operativa, l’impiego promiscuo di dipendenti e l’utilizzo promiscuo di attrezzature sono indici sufficienti a determinare l’unicità del complesso aziendale. (Trib. Milano 14/3/2003, Est. Martello, in D&L 2003, 780) La prova in ordine al concreto assolvimento dell’obbligo di repechege può essere accolta, concernendo un fatto negativo, mediante la dimostrazione di fatti positivi corrispondenti come il fatto che i residui posti di lavoro, riguardanti mansioni equivalenti, fossero al tempo del licenziamento stabilmente occupati da altri lavoratori, o il fatto che, dopo il licenziamento e per un congruo periodo, non sia stata effettuata alcuna nuova assunzione. (Trib. Roma 12/2/2003, Est. Pascarella, in Lav. nella giur. 2003, 590) Quando il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento consista nella accertata incompatibilità-per ragioni tecnologiche o più in generale organizzative-fra la professionalità del lavoratore e l’organizzazione produttiva, il potere risolutorio può essere legittimamente esercitato solo allorché il datore di lavoro abbia verificato che i licenziandi non siano utilizzabili in alcun modo nella sua azienda. Se, invece, il g.m.o. consista nella necessità di ridurre il personale derivante dalla decisione imprenditoriale di modificare la dimensione aziendale e investa indifferentemente un certo numero di lavoratori il cui posto si trovi nell’area da ridurre, non può essere richiesta all’imprenditore la prova dell’impossibilità di utilizzare altrimenti i lavoratori da licenziare, ma solo l’adempimento di un obbligo di correttezza e buona fede nella scelta dei licenziandi. (Cass. 9/5/2002, n.6667, Pres. ed Est. Guglielmucci, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2003, 108). Ai fini della prova della sussistenza del giustificato motivo obiettivo del licenziamento l’onere della dimostrazione della impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore allo svolgimento di altre mansioni analoghe a quelle svolte in precedenza – che deve essere contenuto nell’ambito delle circostanze di fatto e di luogo proprie della singola vicenda esaminata, in quanto il giudice del merito deve valutare sul piano concreto la incompatibilità della professionalità del lavoratore licenziato con il nuovo assetto organizzativo dell’azienda – pur gravando interamente sul datore di lavoro e non potendo essere posto a carico del lavoratore, implica comunque per quest’ultimo un onere di deduzione e allegazione, tra gli elementi posti a fondamento dell’azione e tra i presupposti della sua domanda, della possibilità di essere adibito ad altre mansioni, allo scopo di sollecitare il relativo onere probatorio datoriale (in base ai suddetti principi la S.C. ha cassato sul punto la sentenza impugnata che si era limitata ad una incongrua valutazione di ordine generale, del tutto avulsa dal caso in considerazione, senza verificare quale fosse stato in concreto l’atteggiamento assunto dalla lavoratrice licenziata) (Cass. 16/6/00, n. 8207, pres. Trezza, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2000, pag. 907) In caso di licenziamento individuale per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il datore di lavoro non soddisfa l’onere probatorio che gli incombe ex art. 5 L. 604/66 se si limita ad allegare un calo di commesse senza dimostrare anche che è impossibile collocare diversamente il lavoratore o che le sue mansioni possono essere accorpate a quelle di altro dipendente (Pret. Napoli 3/11/95, est. Papa, in D&L 1996, 745, nota MANNA, Ancora in tema di giustificato motivo oggettivo e riduzione del personale) In relazione all’ipotesi di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, ai sensi dell’art. 3 L. 604/66, l’onere del datore di lavoro di dimostrare l’impossibilità di un’altra utilizzazione dei lavoratori licenziati va assolto mediante la dimostrazione di fatti positivi come il fatto che i residui posti di lavoro, riguardanti mansioni equivalenti, fossero al tempo del licenziamento stabilmente occupati da altri lavoratori e il fatto che, dopo il licenziamento e per un congruo periodo, non sia stata effettuata alcuna nuova assunzione nella stessa qualifica dei lavoratori licenziati; tale dimostrazione deve concernere tutte le sedi dell’attività aziendale, essendo sufficiente la limitazione all’azienda cui erano addetti i lavoratori licenziati solo nel caso di preliminare rifiuto dei medesimi a trasferirsi altrove (Cass. 3/6/94 n. 5401, pres. Buccarelli, est. Putaturo, in D&L 1995, 190, nota MUGGIA, Risarcimento da licenziamento illegittimo: vecchia e nuova disciplina) In relazione all’ipotesi di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, ai sensi dell’art. 3 L. 604/66, l’onere del datore di lavoro di dimostrare l’impossibilità di un’altra utilizzazione dei lavoratori licenziati va assolto mediante la dimostrazione di fatti positivi come il fatto che i residui posti di lavoro, riguardanti mansioni equivalenti, fossero al tempo del licenziamento stabilmente occupati da altri lavoratori e il fatto che, dopo il licenziamento e per un congruo periodo, non sia stata effettuata alcuna nuova assunzione nella stessa qualifica dei lavoratori licenziati; tale dimostrazione deve concernere tutte le sedi dell’attività aziendale, essendo sufficiente la limitazione all’azienda cui erano addetti i lavoratori licenziati solo nel caso di preliminare rifiuto dei medesimi a trasferirsi altrove (Cass. 3/6/94 n. 5401, pres. Buccarelli, est. Putaturo, in D&L 1995, 190, nota MUGGIA, Risarcimento da licenziamento illegittimo: vecchia e nuova disciplina) Oneri probatoriIn alto In materia di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo (art. 3, L. n. 604 del 1966) grava sul datore di lavoro l’onere di provare, tra l’altro, le ragioni inerenti alle attività produttive che rendono impossibile impiegare il dipendente nella organizzazione aziendale, da accertare in base agli elementi di fatto sussistenti alla data della comunicazione del recesso, spettando al giudice di verificarne l’effettiva ricorrenza attraverso un apprezzamento delle prove incensurabile in sede di legittimità, se effettuato con una motivazione coerente e completa (confermato il licenziamento del lavoratore; il settore in crisi e le consistenti perdite di fatturato legittimava il licenziamento). (Cass. 25/1/2021 n. 1508, Pres. Raimondi Est. Cinque, in Lav. nella giur. 2021, 417) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il lavoratore ha l’onere di allegare l’illegittimo rifiuto del datore di continuare a farlo lavorare in assenza di un giustificato motivo, mentre incombono sul datore di lavoro gli oneri di allegazione e prova dell’esistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo, che include anche l’impossibilità del c.d. repêchage, ossia dell’inesistenza di altri posti di lavoro in cui utilmente ricollocare il lavoratore. (Cass. 24/9/2019 n. 23789, Pres. Nobile Rel. Blasutto, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2019, con nota di M.T. Salimbeni, “La reductio ad unum di GMO e repechage”, 627) Sebbene non sussista un onere del lavoratore di indicare quali siano i posti disponibili in azienda ai fini del repêchage, gravando la prova dell’impossibilità di ricollocamento sul datore di lavoro, una volta accertata, anche attraverso presunzioni gravi, precise e concordanti, tale impossibilità, la mancanza di allegazioni del lavoratore circa l’esistenza di una posizione lavorativa disponibile vale a corroborare il descritto quadro probatorio. (Cass. 24/9/2019 n. 23789, Pres. Nobile Rel. Blasutto, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2019, con nota di M.T. Salimbeni, “La reductio ad unum di GMO e repechage”, 627) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo obiettivo, la prova della impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore ad altre mansioni nell’ambito dell’organizzazione aziendale non deve essere intesa in modo rigido, dovendosi esigere dallo stesso lavoratore che impugni il licenziamento una collaborazione nell’accertamento del possibile repêchage con mansioni diverse e anche inferiori a quelle originariamente svolte, mediante all’allegazione della esistenza di altri posti di lavoro nei quali egli poteva essere utilmente ricollocato; a tale allegazione corrisponde l’onere del datore di lavoro di provare la non utilizzabilità del lavoratore nei posti predetti. (Cass. 12/8/2016 n. 17091, Pres. Di Cerbo Est. Esposito, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2016, con nota di F. Colella, “Ripartizione degli oneri deduttivi e assertivi in tema di repêchage: punto fermo o punto interrogativo?”, 12, e in Lav. nella giur. 2017, con commento di F.M. Giorgi, 169) Poiché onere di allegazione e onere probatorio non possono che incombere sulla medesima parte, nel senso che chi ha l’onere di provare un fatto primario (costitutivo del diritto azionato o impeditivo, modificativo o estintivo dello stesso) ha altresì l’onere della relativa compiuta allegazione, non incombe sul lavoratore l’onere di indicare posizioni di lavoro in cui essere utilmente reintegrato. (Cass. 5/1/2017 n. 160, Pres. Venuti Est. Lorito, in Riv. It. Dir. Lav. 2016, con nota di F. Colella, “Ripartizione degli oneri deduttivi e assertivi in tema di repêchage: punto fermo o punto interrogativo?”, 12) In tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo determinato da ragioni tecniche, organizzative e produttive, compete al giudice il controllo in ordine all’effettiva sussistenza del motivo addotto dal datore di lavoro, in ordine al quale il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di provare, anche mediante elementi presuntivi e indiziari, l’effettività delle ragioni che giustificano l’operazione di riassetto. (Trib. Firenze 7/11/2014, Giud. Taiti, in Lav. nella giur. 2015, 421) Laddove il lavoratore prospetti la concreta possibilità di un suo “recupero” nella organizzazione dell’impresa, grava sul datore di lavoro l’onere di provare l’impossibilità di continuare a utilizzare il dipendente destinandolo ad altre mansioni equivalenti. E ciò anche alla luce della riorganizzazione aziendale nel suo complesso considerata. (Trib. Cassino 15/4/2014, Giud. Verasani, in Lav. nella giur. 2014, 932) A fronte della generica indicazione contenuta nel ricorso, con cui si impugna un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, di ulteriori servizi gestiti dalla società resistente cui avrebbe potuto essere assegnato il lavoratore licenziato, quest’ultima deve fornire una prova rigorosa in ordine alle caratteristiche dell’organico in forza al momento del licenziamento, anche con riguardo a posizioni lavorative collocate al di fuori della provincia in cui prestava la propria attività il dipendente licenziato. (Trib. Varese 4/9/2013, ord., Giud. Fumagalli, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Carmen Di Carlussio, “Licenziamento economico: alternative di reimpiego prospettabili al lavoratore e sanzioni per il caso di omesso repêchage”, 168) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo il datore che adduca a fondamento del licenziamento la soppressione del posto di lavoro, cui era addetto il lavoratore licenziato, ha l’onere di provare che al momento del licenziamento non sussisteva alcuna posizione di lavoro analoga a quella soppressa, alla quale avrebbe potuto essere assegnato il lavoratore per l’espletamento di mansioni equivalenti a quelle svolte – intendendosi per posizioni di livello equivalente quelle del medesimo livello di inquadramento contrattualcollettivo, pur in presenza di mansioni e competenze professionali diverse –, nonché di aver prospettato, senza ottenerne il consenso, la possibilità di un reimpiego in mansioni inferiori rientranti nel suo bagaglio professionale. (Trib. Roma 8/8/2013, ord., Giud. Pagliarini, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Carmen Di Carlussio, “Licenziamento economico: alternative di reimpiego prospettabili al lavoratore e sanzioni per il caso di omesso repêchage”, 167) L’onere del datore di lavoro di provare l’impossibilità di ricollocare il lavoratore da licenziare in mansioni analoghe a quelle proprie della posizione lavorativa occupata, per quanto debba essere inteso con elasticità, non può essere considerato assolto con la prova di aver proposto al dipendente un’attività di natura autonoma, esterna all’azienda e priva di qualsiasi garanzia reale in termini di flusso di lavoro e di reddito, specialmente se agli altri dipendenti siano state offerte ben più valide alternative. (Cass. 23/5/2013 n. 12810, ord., Pres. La Terza Rel. Filabozzi, in Riv. It. Dir. lav. 2014, con nota di Carmen Di Carlussio, “Licenziamento economico: alternative di reimpiego prospettabili al lavoratore e sanzioni per il caso di omesso repêchage”, 167) Nel caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo dovuto alla sopravvenuta inidoneità del lavoratore, il lavoratore ha diritto a essere ricollocato in altra posizione di lavoro adattabile alle sue condizioni, anche con ragionevoli costi a carico dell’impresa; l’onere della prova a carico del datore di lavoro si estende sino all’impossibilità della ricollocazione del lavoratore anche a seguito di ragionevoli modifiche organizzative. (Trib. Ravenna 30/11/2011, Est. Riverso, in D&L 2012, con nota di Yara Serafini, “La tutela del posto di lavoro in caso di sopravvenuta inidoneità allo svolgimento delle mansioni: estensione dell’obbligo di repêchage”, 566) Qualora il lavoratore contesti la legittimità di un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo basato sulla necessità di ridurre il personale, il datore di lavoro deve provare l’effettiva necessità di soppressione del posto o di dover organizzare diversamente l’impresa nonché l’impossibilità di assegnare il ricorrente ad altro incarico. Nel caso in cui sorga la necessità di dimostrare l’effettiva consistenza dell’organico, ai fini dell’applicazione della tutela reale o di quella obbligatoria, ricade sul datore di lavoro l’onere di provare che le dimensioni dell’impresa sono inferiori a quelle minime previste dall’art. 18 della l. 20 maggio 1970, n. 300. (Cass. 22/11/2011 n. 24573, Pres. Roselli Rel. Berrino, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, 192) Il datore di lavoro che intende licenziare per giustificato motivo oggettivo ha l’onere di provare di non potere adibire il lavoratore a una mansione diversa da quella per la quale era stato assunto, nel rispetto dei limiti previsti dall’art. 13 della l. n. 300/1970 (principio del cosiddetto repechage). Tuttavia, l’onere probatorio del datore di lavoro, concernendo un fatto negativo, va assolto mediante la dimostrazione di correlativi fatti positivi, ad esempio dimostrando che i residui posti di lavoro al tempo del recesso fossero stabilmente occupati o che, dopo il licenziamento, non sia stata effettuata alcuna nuova assunzione, se e in quanto i nuovi assunti non vadano a ricoprire le posizioni lasciate vacanti dai lavoratori licenziati. Il lavoratore deve fornire deduzioni e allegazioni che prospettino la possibilità di una diversa e adeguata utilizzazione. (Trib. Prato 17/11/2011, Giud. Barracca, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, 313) La circostanza che dopo il licenziamento non siano stati assunti altri lavoratori nel settore per il quale il lavoratore licenziato aveva offerto la propria disponibilità non è da sola sufficiente a provare l’impossibilità di reimpiegare il lavoratore stesso. (Cass. 24/5/2011 n. 11356, Pres. Lamorgese Rel. Berrino, in Lav. nella giur. 2012, con commento di Fabio Massimo Gallo, 144) Non è sufficiente a integrare il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento la semplice cessazione dell’interesse al distacco o la soppressione del posto presso la società distaccataria, dovendo in ogni caso essere verificati gli elementi costitutivi del giustificato motivo oggettivo con riferimento all’ambito aziendale del datore di lavoro distaccante, sul quale ricade anche l’onere probatorio circa la impossibilità di repêchage. (Cass. 5/3/2010 n. 5403, Pres. Battimiello Est. Nobile, in D&L 2010, 582) In tema di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, l’ultimazione delle opere edili per la cui realizzazione i lavoratori sono stati assunti non è sufficiente a configurare un giustificato motivo di recesso, salvo che il datore di lavoro non dimostri l’impossibilità di utilizzazione dei lavoratori medesimi in altre mansioni compatibili, con riferimento alla complessità dell’impresa e alla generalità dei cantieri nei quali è dislocata la relativa attività, dovendosi peraltro esigere dal lavoratore che impugni il licenziamento una collaborazione nell’accertamento di un possibile reimpiego, mediante l’indicazione di altri posti in cui poteva essere collocato, cui corrisponde l’onere del datore di lavoro di provare la non utilizzabilità nei posti predetti, da intendersi assolto anche mediante la dimostrazione di circostanze indiziarie, come la piena occupazione negli altri cantieri e l’assenza di altre assunzioni in relazione alle mansioni del dipendente da licenziare (Cass. 22/10/09 n. 22417. Pres. Battimiello, in Lav. e prev. Oggi n. 5/10, con nota di M.Cerasi Allegazione dei posti disponibili e prova del repêchage nel licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo: la problematica ripartizione degli oneri tra lavoratore e datore”) È onere del datore di lavoro fornire la prova dell’effettività delle ragioni poste a fondamento del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, dell’esistenza del nesso di causalità tra le ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva o l’organizzazione del lavoro e il licenziamento del lavoratore e dell’impossibilità di impiegare quest’ultimo in altri ruoli e mansioni nell’ambito dell’organizzazione aziendale. (Trib. Milano 24/3/2009, Est. Bianchini, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2009, 168) In merito alle motivazioni di un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, il datore di lavoro ha l’onere di provare, anche vista la costante giurisprudenza, di provare la sussistenza delle regioni economico-organizzative poste a fondamento della decisione di ridimensionare il personale e l’impossibilità di procedere al cosiddetto repéchage. (Corte App. Torino 12/2/2009, D.ssa Sanlorenzo, in Lav. nella giur. 2009, 530) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, intimato a lavoratore che abbia sempre svolto la sua attività in via telematica dal proprio domicilio, a causa del trasferimento delle stesse mansioni a lavoratori attivi presso gli uffici della convenuta in altra città, uffici ai quali il dipendente licenziato già faceva capo, occorre la prova rigorosa delle ragioni per le quali dette prestazioni non possono continuare a essere effettuate, come in precedenza, dal domicilio del lavoratore stesso. (Trib. Roma 8/1/2009, Giud. Emili, in Lav. nella giur. 2009, con commento di Alessandro Gallo, 609) In tema di requisiti di legittimità del recesso spetta al datore di lavoro la dimostrazione che tutti i posti residui equivalenti a quello del lavoratore, dipendente licenziato, sono stabilmente occupati da altri lavoratori; non è comunque possibile gravare il datore di lavoro di una prova diabolica o negativa e impossibile in forza del principio di creazione giurisprudenziale, non esistente nella legge e informato al concetto estrema ratio del licenziamento, che per quanto giustificato dalla tutela costituzionale del lavoro e del singolo lavoratore trova un limite nella tutela anche della libertà di impresa. Quindi tale onere inerente alla rigorosa prova dell’impossibilità di una diversa allocazione del licenziato va temperato con il richiedere che anche il lavoratore indichi circostanze di fatto utili a dimostrare o anche a far presumere l’esistenza, nell’ambito dell’azienda, di posti di lavoro cui poter essere adibito. (Trib. Milano 1/7/2008, dott. Taraborrelli, in Lav. nella giur. 2009, 95) Il controllo giudiziale sul licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo comporta la verifica dell’assolvimento, da parte del datore di lavoro, dell’onere di provare tre fatti: l’effettività della dedotta ristrutturazione organizzativa, la relativa incidenza sulla posizione rivestita in azienda dl lavoratore licenziato o un riassetto organizzativo per una più razionale ed economica gestione dell’azienda e l’impossibilità di utilizzare il lavoratore in altre mansioni equivalenti. (Trib. Milano 19/2/2008 D.ssa Ravazzoni, in Lav. nella giur. 2008, 960) Il datore di lavoro che proceda a licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo ha l’onere di dimostrare l’impossibilità di adibire il lavoratore a mansioni equivalenti a quelle svolte prima della riorganizzazione aziendale; grava comunque sul lavoratore l’onere di allegazione e indicazione precisa della possibilità di essere adibito ad altre mansioni, al fine di far valere il relativo onere probatorio contrario datoriale. (Cass. 10/5/2007 n. 10672, Pres. Ianniruberto Est. Stile, in Riv. it. dir. lav. 2007, con nota di Marco Novella, “I concetti di costo contabile, di costo-opportunità e di costo sociale nella problematica costruzione gius-economica del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento”, e con nota di Pietro Ichino, “Il costo sociale del licenziamento e la perdita aziendale attesa per la prosecuzione del rapporto come oggetto del bilanciamento giudiziale”, 989) Nell’ipotesi di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo grava sull’imprenditore l’onere di provare sia l’effettività delle ragioni poste a fondamento del licenziamento, sia l’impossibilità di ricollocare diversamente il dipendente licenziato nell’ambito dell’organizzazione aziendale, sia la dimostrazione dell’esistenza dei requisiti occupazionali, che impediscono l’applicazione della disciplina generale di cui all’art. 18 SL. (Trib. Pistoia 20/4/2007, Est. De Marzo, in D&L 2007, con nota di Chiara Mancini, “Spunti in tema di sottoscrizione e motivazione della lettera di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e di prova del requisito dimensionale”, 1213) In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo per soppressione del posto di lavoro presso l’unica sede sita nel territorio nazionale di un’impresa sopranazionale, deve escludersi che la stessa debba fornire la prova della non reimpiegabilità del lavoratore anche al di fuori dei confini italiani e in relazione a tutte le sedi secondarie collocate nei diversi stati membri dell’Ue. (Trib. Milano 13/10/2004, Est. Bianchini, in D&L 2005, con nota di Enrico U. M. Cafiero, “L’obbligo di repêchage si applica solo nell’ambito del territorio nazionale?”, 226) L’onere della prova del motivo illecito del licenziamento è in capo al lavoratore che può raggiungerla anche a mezzo di presunzioni gravi, precise e concordanti. (Trib. Milano 7/10/2004, Est. Atanasio, in D&L 2005, con nota di Alba Civitelli, “Sul licenziamento discriminatorio”, 237) La prova in ordine al concreto assolvimento dell’obbligo di repechege può essere accolta, concernendo un fatto negativo, mediante la dimostrazione di fatti positivi corrispondenti come il fatto che i residui posti di lavoro, riguardanti mansioni equivalenti, fossero al tempo del licenziamento stabilmente occupati da altri lavoratori, o il fatto che, dopo il licenziamento e per un congruo periodo, non sia stata effettuata alcuna nuova assunzione. (Trib. Roma 12/2/2003, Est. Pascarella, in Lav. nella giur. 2003, 590) L’esistenza o meno del giustificato motivo oggettivo deve essere valutata sulla base di elementi di fatto esistenti al momento della comunicazione del recesso e non su circostanze future ed eventuali. In caso di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo il datore di lavoro ha l’obbligo di provare l’impossibilità di assegnare al dipendente mansioni equivalenti, ma tale onere, concernendo un fatto negativo, può essere assolto mediante la dimostrazione di correlativi fatti positivi, come la stabile occupazione, al momento del recesso, dei residui posti di lavoro relativi a mansioni equivalenti, o il fatto che dopo il licenziamento-e per un congruo periodo-non sia stata effettuata alcuna assunzione nella stessa qualifica. (Cass. 14/12/2002 n. 17928, Pres. Ed Est. Putaturo, in D&L 2003, 403, con notadi Roberto Muggia, “Licenziamento individuale per giustificato motivo oggettivo: fatti rilevanti ed onere della prova”) Se è a carico del datore di lavoro l’onere di provare l’effettiva necessità di ridimensionare la struttura produttiva e l’impossibilità di utilizzare altrimenti il lavoratore in mansioni equivalenti, un onere minimo di allegazione dei fatti che provino la pretestuosità del licenziamento spetta al lavoratore (Cass. 18/11/98, n. 11646, in Dir. Lav. 2000, pag. 31, con nota di Lepore) Non assolve l’onere della prova dell’impossibilità di reimpiego del lavoratore per perdita di appalto cui era adibito, il datore di lavoro che abbia contestualmente assunto, in osservanza di norma collettiva, altri lavoratori precedentemente impiegati da diversa impresa su appalto successivamente acquisito dal medesimo datore di lavoro (Pret. Monza, sez. Desio, 31/10/95, est. Barberis, in D&L 1996, 495) Nel licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo il datore di lavoro deve provare che la risoluzione del rapporto di lavoro è dovuta a serie e concrete ragioni di carattere produttivo – organizzativo e che non vi siano possibilità di adibire il lavoratore licenziato a mansioni equivalenti a quelle precedentemente svolte (Cass. 24/6/94 n. 6067, pres. Mollica, est. Amore, in D&L 1995, 436) In relazione all’ipotesi di licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, ai sensi dell’art. 3 L. 604/66, l’onere del datore di lavoro di dimostrare l’impossibilità di un’altra utilizzazione dei lavoratori licenziati va assolto mediante la dimostrazione di fatti positivi come il fatto che i residui posti di lavoro, riguardanti mansioni equivalenti, fossero al tempo del licenziamento stabilmente occupati da altri lavoratori e il fatto che, dopo il licenziamento e per un congruo periodo, non sia stata effettuata alcuna nuova assunzione nella stessa qualifica dei lavoratori licenziati; tale dimostrazione deve concernere tutte le sedi dell’attività aziendale, essendo sufficiente la limitazione all’azienda cui erano addetti i lavoratori licenziati solo nel caso di preliminare rifiuto dei medesimi a trasferirsi altrove (Cass. 3/6/94 n. 5401, pres. Buccarelli, est. Putaturo, in D&L 1995, 190, nota MUGGIA, Risarcimento da licenziamento illegittimo: vecchia e nuova disciplina) Casi praticiIn alto Il rifiuto del part time non costituisce di per sé g.m.o. di licenziamento, ma solo se la richiesta datoriale è giustificata da esigenze obbiettive. In una causa in cui una dipendente, licenziata per giustificato motivo oggettivo in regime di tutela obbligatoria, sosteneva il carattere ritorsivo del recesso, per aver rifiutato la trasformazione del rapporto di lavoro in part time, negando che tale rifiuto potesse costituire giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento, la Corte, conferma la valutazione dei giudici di merito di non ricorrenza del lamentato carattere ritorsivo, anche alla luce della considerazione che l’illegittimità del licenziamento per motivo oggettivo a causa del rifiuto opposto dal dipendente al part time (art. 8, primo comma D. Lgs. n. 81/2015) non esclude la sua giustificatezza quando la richiesta di part time sia stata fatta al dipendente (e da questi rifiutata) per esigenze obbiettive dell’impresa. (Cass. 9/5/2023 n. 12244, ord., Pres. Doronzo Rel. Ponterio, in Wikilabour, Newsletter n. 10/23) In tema di rapporto di lavoro dei ferrotranvieri, il regime speciale di risoluzione del rapporto per giustificato motivo oggettivo di cui all’art. 26 del regolamento, all. A al r.d. n. 148 del 1931, si applica nei casi di cessione di linee, di mutamento nei sistemi di esercizio ovvero di limitazione o soppressione di servizi, mentre nelle altre ipotesi di riduzione del personale opera la disciplina di cui all’art. 3 della l. n. 604 del 1966. (Cass. SU 27/7/2016 n. 15540, Pres. Rordorf Est. Napoletano, in Riv. giur. lav. e prev. soc. 2017, II, con nota di C. Fusco, “Rapporto di lavoro degli autoferrotranvieri e licenziamento per g.m.o. per riduzione del personale”, 74) Nella valutazione della sussistenza del giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento di un lavoratore avente le mansioni di guida di automezzi pesanti di trasporto di rifiuti sulla pubblica via, il quale, con sentenza penale di condanna per il reato di detenzione illegale di sostanze stupefacenti sia risultato consumatore di sostanze stupefacenti, è necessario – nella situazione normativa antecedente l’emanazione della disciplina attuativa del d.p.r. n. 309 del 1990, art. 125, primi due commi – che il lavoratore fornisca piena prova, attraverso la produzione dell’esito di esami tossicologici ad hoc – del proprio avvenuto recupero, con la conseguente dismissione dell’abitudine al consumo di sostanze stupefacenti, la quale – anche al di sotto della soglia della tossicodipendenza – è da sola sufficiente a inibire la guida di veicoli su strada (ex art. 187 C.d.S.) e ad esporre il datore di lavoro al rischio di essere chiamato a rispondere di eventuali danni cagionati a terzi. (Cass. 26/5/2014 n. 11715, Pres. Stile Est. Tria, in Lav. nella giur. 2014, con commento di Filippo Maria Giorgi, 1066) La netta riduzione dell’attività amministrativa cui sia addetta una dipendente, provata dalla società datrice di lavoro e accompagnata dal rifiuto della lavoratrice di accettare l’offerta di un impiego a tempo parziale, costituisce giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento nel caso in cui sia accertata l’impossibilità di adibirla ad altre mansioni equivalenti. (Cass. 6/6/2013 n. 14319, Pres. Vidiri Rel. D’Antonio, in Lav. nella giur. 2013, 845) In ipotesi di licenziamento per soppressione di uno o più posti di lavoro, il datore di lavoro, il quale non abbia coperto integralmente i posti riservati agli invalidi in azienda secondo l’aliquota di legge, è tenuto a mantenere in servizio l’invalido anche se in posizione meno produttiva rispetto a quella soppressa, cui l’invalido era in precedenza addetto, a meno che non fornisca la prova della mancanza assoluta nell’ambito dell’intera azienda di mansioni compatibili con lo stato di invalidità, ancorché corrispondenti a una qualifica inferiore. Ove si verifichi tale impossibilità, il datore di lavoro non è tenuto a mantenere in servizio l’invalido in un posto di lavoro assegnato ad altro dipendente. (Cass. 26/6/2009 n. 15049, Pres. Mattone Est. Lamorgese, in D&L 2009, con nota di Enrico U.M. Cafiero, “Sul licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo del dipendente invalido avviato obbligatoriamente”, 781) È legittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo dovuto al comprovato calo dell’attività anche quando il datore di lavoro, pur avendo ancora bisogno delle prestazioni rese dal lavoratore licenziato, decida di “esternalizzarle” affidandole a soggetti estranei all’organizzazione aziendale. (Trib. Milano 20/1/2009, Est. Peragallo, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2009, 175) È legittimo il licenziamento intimato per la chiusura della filiale presso la quale prestava la propria attività lavorativa il dipendente, anche qualora ciò non comporti la soppressione delle mansioni cui egli era adibito, bensì si realizzi una loro redistribuzione tra gli altri dipendenti, ben potendo il datore di lavoro scegliere di mantenere più a lungo in servizio coloro che ritiene più adeguati a far fronte alle incombenze relative alla chiusura di una sede e che sono utilizzabili in mansioni più ampie. (Trib. Milano 20/1/2009, Est. Peragallo, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2009, 178) La sola prova di una flessione del volume degli incassi non è sufficiente per far ritenere legittimo il recesso, se manca la prova dell’impossibilità di utilizzare il lavoratore in altre mansioni equivalenti. (Trib. Milano 15/7/2008, Est. Casella, in Orient. giur. lav. 2008, 748) Qualora nell’arco di 120 giorni dal licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo venga attuata una riduzione di personale riguardante più di cinque lavoratori, lo stesso deve essere dichiarato illegittimo per mancato rispetto della procedura di cui all’art. 24 della L. 223/91. (Trib. Parma 13/4/2007, Est. Brusati, in D&L 2007, 923) E’ illegittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo obiettivo, motivato con una più economica gestione e contenimento dei costi (nella specie, neppure provati). (Trib. Ravenna 21/7/2006, ord., Pres. G.G. Lacentra, Est. M. Parisi, in Lav. nella giur. 2006, con commento di Michele Miscione, 996) E’ illegittimo il licenziamento per giustificato motivo obiettivo, motivato con una generica esigenza di ridurre i costi per sostituire il lavoratore licenziato, di costi alti per qualifica, con altro lavoratore meno costoso. (Nella specie, si è ritenuto che il licenziamento non fosse collegabile a una dichiarata ristrutturazione, per la distanza di tempo rispetto a quando la ristrutturazione sarebbe avvenuta, mentre a prova dell’insussistenza di una causa oggettiva starebbero anche i tentativi effettuati prima del licenziamento per una conciliazione che comportasse la cessazione del rapporto). (Trib. Ravenna 12/6/2006, ord., Est. R. Riverso, in Lav. nella giur. 2006, con commento di Michele Miscione, 993) E’ illegittimo il licenziamento, disposto per motivi obiettivi, per cui sia mancato l’assolvimento del tentativo di repechage e cioè di ricollocare altrimenti il lavoratore su tutte le sedi di lavoro anche do società collegate con unico centro decisionale, considerando l’impiego indifferenziato all’interno di uffici comuni di lavoratori provenienti dalle diverse società e altri elementi che fanno dedurre l’unicità dell’impresa ai fini giuridici. (Trib. Ravenna 12/6/2006, ord., Est. R. Riverso, in Lav. nella giur. 2006, con commento di Michele Miscione, 993) E’ legittimo il licenziamento di un lavoratore (quadro) assunto per dirigere lo stabilimento di una società controllata dalla società sua datrice di lavoro, allorchè la controllata sia posta in liquidazione – con chiusura dell’azienda e licenziamento di tutti i suoi dipendenti – e risulti che il mantenimento tra la forza lavoro del dipendente il cui posto, perciò, è stato soppresso, comporterebbe per il suo datore di lavoro un costo rilevante, incompatibile con le difficoltà finanziarie che lo stesso attraversava da tempo e che si siano acuite nell’ultimo periodo di vigenza del rapporto tanto da determinare una notevole riduzione di personale. (Trib. Milano 26/6/2003, Est. Negri Della Torre, in Lav. nella giur. 2004, 88) La mera difficoltà nell’espletamento delle mansioni inerenti alla qualifica a causa di impedimenti fisici, che sia superabile mediante l’adozione di diverse modalità di esecuzione del lavoro, compatibili con l’organizzazione aziendale, cui il datore di lavoro è tenuto nell’ambito del suo dovere di cooperazione anche a norma dell’art. 2087 c.c., non concreta giustificato motivo di recesso, ove non si traduca in impossibilità della prestazione (nella fattispecie la Corte ha confermato la sentenza di appello che aveva ritenuto privo di giustificazione il recesso intimato ad una lavoratrice, con mansioni di cameriera ai piani di un albergo, affetta da ernia lombosacrale, la quale era in condizioni di continuare a disimpegnare i compiti inerenti alla qualifica, sia pure con un rendimento inferiore rispetto ai livelli di produzione stabiliti dall’impresa, circostanza che non integrava, secondo il giudice di merito, impossibilità della prestazione lavorativa). (Cass. 5/3/2003 n. 3250, Pres. Ciciretti Est. Picone, in D&L 2003, 793) Il sindacato sulle scelte aziendali sotto il profilo della congruità ed opportunità è consentito al giudice solo per accertare la non pretestuosità e l’effettività dei motivi addotti, non per valutare, sostituendosi all’imprenditore, che ne subisce il rischio, la bontà o la razionalità delle stesse. Pertanto, non può considerarsi pretestuosa e non effettiva la soppressione di un posto conseguente ad un riassetto organizzativo sperimentato dal datore di lavoro a fronte di problemi di distribuzione della forza vendita su una parte del territorio in cui opera. (Corte d’appello Milano 5/9/2002, Pres. e Rel. Ruiz, in Lav. nella giur. 2003, 387) Va ritenuto illegittimo il licenziamento disciplinare intimato al lavoratore assunto obbligatoriamente per il quale successivi accertamenti medici disposti nell’ambito del procedimento penale abbiano accertato l’insussistenza dei requisiti richiesti per la qualifica di invalido. (Trib. Milano 24/5/2002, Est. Ianniello, in D&L 2002, 742) Non costituiscono circostanze idonee a giustificare il licenziamento il rinvio a giudizio del lavoratore e la sentenza del giudice dell’udienza preliminare di non doversi procedere per la prescrizione del reato. (Trib. Milano 24/5/2002, Est. Ianniello, in D&L 2002, 742) Non costituisce giustificato motivo oggettivo – né soggettivo – di licenziamento il rifiuto del dipendente invalido, le cui precarie condizioni di salute siano note al datore di lavoro fin dall’assunzione, di effettuare mansioni diverse da quelle previste all’inizio del rapporto, ed incompatibili con lo stato di invalidità. (Trib. Milano 4/4/2002, Est. Peragallo, in D&L 2002, 718, con nota di Matteo Paulli, “Giustificato motivo oggettivo per impossibilità sopravvenuta della prestazione ed eccezione di inadempimento”) La falsa rappresentazione della realtà, sia in ordine alla durata effettiva della missione che alle spese effettivamente sostenute, posta in essere nella più assoluta consapevolezza – al fine ovvio di trarne dei benefici e confidando (con ogni probabilità) nella episodicità dei controlli aziendali – costituisce comportamento particolarmente grave, quindi, suscettibile di essere sanzionato con il licenziamento che appare, nella specie, l’unica misura idonea e congrua a tutelare l’interesse del datore di lavoro. La gravità del comportamento emerge poi con chiarezza, se si considera la particolare natura e la qualità del rapporto di lavoro di inviato speciale che legava il ricorrente alla RAI, rapporto che presuppone, all’evidenza, proprio perché espletato per la gran parte al di fuori del controllo diretto del datore di lavoro, un elevatissimo grado di fiducia, naturalmente non circoscritta all’espletamento delle specifiche mansioni nell’ambito dell’organizzazione radiotelevisiva, ma che, necessariamente, si deve estendere alla massima correttezza e alla lealtà della complessiva condotta. Merita poi di essere sottolineata la rilevante incidenza del comportamento addebitato ed accertato sull’ambiente di lavoro e sulla cosiddetta immagine aziendale. Accertata, pertanto, la correttezza della motivazione, degli accertamenti e riscontri in sede di merito risultano conseguentemente infondate ed inaccoglibili le eccezioni sollevate e sottoposte dal ricorrente all’esame di questa Corte. (Cass. 24/4/01, n. 6039, pres. Mileo, est. Balletti, in Lavoro e prev. oggi. 2001, pag. 1010) Il licenziamento di un dipendente anziano e di più elevata retribuzione contrattuale per essere sostituito dall’assunzione di un apprendista a minor costo del lavoro, non è riconducibile alla fattispecie del licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo – di cui all’art. 3, l. n. 604/66 – in quanto il licenziamento non può essere determinato dalla finalità di mero risparmio, presupponendo invece il giustificato motivo oggettivo una ristrutturazione aziendale, che comporti la soppressione di determinati posti di lavoro e la dimostrazione, da parte del datore di lavoro, che il lavoratore licenziato non può essere utilizzabile nello stesso o in altri settori dell’attività produttiva (cfr. Cass. N. 3353/94 e Cass. N. 4088/83) (Cass. 17/3/01, n. 3899, pres. Trezza, est. Dell’Anno, in Lavoro e prev. oggi. 2001, pag. 1415) Il riassetto organizzativo per una più economica gestione dell’impresa vale ad integrare il giustificato motivo oggettivo di licenziamento ai sensi dell’art. 3, l. nn. 604/66; a tal fine non è peraltro necessario che vengano soppresse tutte le mansioni in precedenza attribuite al lavoratore licenziato, ben potendo all’uopo bastare quelle prevalentemente esercitate dallo stesso e quindi tali da connotarne la posizione lavorativa (Corte Appello Bologna 17/7/00, pres. e est. Castiglione, in Lavoro giur. 2001, pag. 757, con nota di Zavalloni, Un “cocktail” d’eccezione: licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e per successivo superamento del comporto) E’ privo di giustificato motivo oggettivo il licenziamento di un lavoratore – con conseguente obbligo di reintegra ex art. 18 Stat. Lav. – incaricato del servizio di guardiania pomeridiana e dello spurgo pozzetti delle fogne, motivato da asserita soppressione del servizio per ricorso a vigilanza ad opera di ditta esterna, quando invece risulti provato che la datrice di lavoro non aveva mai provveduto alla soppressione del servizio di guardiania pomeridiana (atteso che la subentrata ditta esterna garantiva solo la guardiania notturna) e che le mansioni del licenziato erano state, in realtà, concentrate su un altro suo collega (Trib. Trani 19/6/00, pres. Doronzo, est. Zecchillo, in Lavoro e prev. oggi 2000, pag. 2120) Quando l’attività di propagandista di prodotti medicinali sia svolta nell’ambito di un rapporto di lavoro subordinato, al datore di lavoro – se nella regolamentazione degli interessi intervenuta tra le parti non sia rinvenibile alcuna prescrizione in ordine alle modalità di attuazione della prestazione – è inibito qualsiasi sindacato sulle modalità di attuazione della stessa e nient’altro può legittimamente esigere se non il diligente comportamento del propagandista in relazione all’attività di pubblicizzazione del prodotto stesso presso la potenziale clientela. Non può pertanto ravvisarsi una impossibilità integrante giustificato motivo di risoluzione del contratto di lavoro ex art. 3, L. 604/66, qualora l’imprenditore, venendo meno al proprio obbligo di cooperazione, non dimostri di non aver potuto adibire il dipendente a diverse mansioni, equivalenti o anche inferiori a quelle precedentemente svolte, con riferimento a tutte le sedi aziendali (Trib. Napoli 30/3/00, pres. Colantonio, in Orient. Giur. Lav. 2000, pag. 353, con nota di Golferini, La risoluzione del rapporto di lavoro per sopravvenuta inidoneità fisica del lavoratore allo svolgimento delle mansioni assegnate tra obbligazioni di mezzi e obbligo di repechage ) Il licenziamento motivato unicamente da ragioni ritorsive rispetto a iniziative giudiziarie del dipendente per ottenere il pagamento della retribuzione è nullo in quanto determinato da un motivo illecito. A tale nullità consegue non l’applicazione della disciplina speciale prevista dall’art. 3 L. 11/5/90 n. 108 per le ipotesi di licenziamento discriminatorio, quanto piuttosto delle regole generali dettate in materia di nullità degli atti, le quali, con riguardo al licenziamento intimato da un datore di lavoro ricadente nell’area della tutela obbligatoria, comportano l’applicazione della sanzione di cui all’art. 2 della medesima legge) (Pret. Frosinone 6/5/99, est. Cianfrocca, in D&L 1999, 685) Sono illegittimi i licenziamenti intimati per cessazione di attività svolta mediante l’impiego di un complesso di beni, concessi nuovamente in locazione da parte del proprietario ad altro soggetto e da quest’ultimo utilizzati, senza soluzione di continuità, per la prosecuzione dell’attività già svolta dal precedente affittuario, tra l’altro mediante l’impiego di una parte della manodopera precedentemente utilizzata (nella fattispecie, rilevata la configurabilità del trasferimento d’azienda ex art. 2112 c.c., il Tribunale ha ordinato al nuovo affittuario la reintegrazione in servizio presso di sé del gruppo di lavoratori licenziati dal precedente affittuario) (Trib. Roma 20/1/98 (ord.), pres. ed est. Torrice, in D&L 1998, 1038) È illegittimo il licenziamento intimato al dipendente part-time che rifiuti di prestare attività lavorativa a tempo pieno, motivato in base alle esigenze organizzative aziendali, qualora il Ccnl subordini alla sussistenza dell’accordo delle parti la trasformazione del rapporto da tempo parziale a tempo pieno (Pret. La Spezia 9/4/97, est. Fortunato, in D&L 1998, 126, n. MULLER, Mancata trasformazione del rapporto di lavoro da part-time a full-time e legittimità del licenziamento per esigenze organizzative aziendali) La messa in liquidazione e la cessazione di attività di una società non è sufficiente a legittimare un licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, quando vi siano possibilità di reimpiego del lavoratore in altre società del gruppo e sussistano indici dell’esistenza di un unico centro decisionale e di un unitario programma organizzativo delle attività del gruppo stesso (Pret. Milano 2/8/95, est. Negri della Torre, in D&L 1995, 1050) Laleggepertutti: Licenziamento per motivi aziendali e repechage: cosa sono e come funzionano. I motivi che giustificano la perdita del posto di lavoro. Non è facile licenziare un dipendente a tempo indeterminato, ma neanche impossibile come un tempo. La giurisprudenza ha cambiato le proprie rigide posizioni degli anni 70 e 80, frutto di una visione politicizzata dell’economia dove ancora era fortemente sentita l’antitesi “padrone-lavoratore”. Oggi, seppur nel rispetto della legge, vi sono numerose aperture al licenziamento individuale come, ad esempio, nell’ambito dei motivi disciplinari, quello per scarso rendimento o, nell’ambito delle ragioni organizzative, quello per ottimizzare i profitti dell’azienda (il che, in definitiva, significa consentire il licenziamento quando l’opera dell’uomo non è più necessaria). Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, imposto cioè da motivazioni attinenti alla produzione e all’azienda (che così si contrappone al licenziamento per giustificato motivo soggettivo, dettato da ragioni disciplinari), è forse quello che ha risentito di più di tale epocale cambiamento di impostazione. Ecco perché è bene fare il punto dell’attuale normativa e giurisprudenza, così in divenire in questo settore così delicato. La perdita di un posto di lavoro è, da un punto di vista macroeconomico, meno di una statistica; da un punto di vista personale, invece, può significare la rovina di una famiglia. Ed è anche bene ricordare che può diventare la rovina di un imprenditore quando il licenziamento non viene eseguito correttamente, posti gli obblighi risarcitori che esso comporta. Ma procediamo con ordine e cerchiamo di spiegare cos’è il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo e quando scatta. Indice Quando si può licenziare un dipendente Licenziamento per motivi disciplinari Licenziamento per motivi aziendali Cos’è il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo? Quando è possibile il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo? Cos’è il repechage o il ripescaggio? Come avviene il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo? Come contestare il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo Quando si può licenziare un dipendente Se ti stai chiedendo come licenziare un dipendente a tempo indeterminato devi sapere che esistono solo due possibilità concesse dalla legge, sebbene talmente ampie da abbracciare una serie indefinita di ipotesi (sul punto puoi anche leggere il nostro approfondimento dal titolo Come licenziare un dipendente): licenziamento per motivi disciplinari licenziamento per motivi aziendali. Licenziamento per motivi disciplinari Il licenziamento per motivi disciplinari è quello legato a comportamenti del dipendente talmente gravi da non consentire più la prosecuzione del rapporto di lavoro. Esso è quindi l’ultima spiaggia cui si approda o dopo una serie di numerosi illeciti, tanto da far ritenere l’opera del dipendente non più affidabile, oppure a seguito di un comportamento talmente grave da ledere irrimediabilmente la fiducia del datore di lavoro. Di norma il licenziamento per motivi disciplinari richiede la lettera di preavviso, cinque giorni di tempo concessi al dipendente per difendersi e poi la comunicazione del provvedimento. Ma nei casi più gravi, si può licenziare in tronco, senza cioè preavviso. Alla luce di quest’ultima circostanza, si distingue tra: licenziamento per giusta causa: è quello senza preavviso, che consegue a un comportamento estremamente grave da non consentire la prosecuzione del rapporto di lavoro neanche per un giorno (si pensi al dipendente che ruba, che non si reca al lavoro o che si ribella alle direttive del datore). Leggi sul punto: Licenziamento per giusta causa; licenziamento per giustificato motivo soggettivo: è quello invece che segue la regola generale del preavviso. Durante il preavviso (la cui durata viene stabilita dai contratti collettivi e può variare in base all’anzianità di servizio), il dipendente continua a lavorare e a percepire lo stipendio. Sia l’azienda che il dipendente possono rinunciare al preavviso, tuttavia corrispondendo all’altra parte l’indennità sostitutiva del preavviso che è una sorta di risarcimento per l’interruzione immediata del rapporto di lavoro. Leggi sul punto Licenziamento per giustificato motivo; Licenziamento per motivi aziendali Il licenziamento per motivi aziendali è invece quello che avvocati e giudici chiamano licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo, così contrapponendolo a quello “per giustificato motivo soggettivo” (il quale come detto dipende dalla sfera del soggetto-lavoratore). Più in particolare, quando parliamo di licenziamento per motivi aziendali ci riferiamo a quello legato a ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva, all’organizzazione del lavoro e al regolare funzionamento di essa. Le scelte imprenditoriali possono essere di carattere economico o tecnico-produttivo (aumento dell’efficienza del lavoro attraverso l’introduzione di innovazioni produttive). Un caso particolare è rappresentato dal licenziamento per sopravvenuta infermità per ragioni indipendenti dal lavoro. Cos’è il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo? Come abbiamo appena detto, la legge [1] stabilisce che il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo è quello che dipende da ragioni legate a: l’attività produttiva; l’organizzazione del lavoro; il regolare funzionamento del lavoro. Inoltre, a tali ragioni vanno ricondotte anche quelle collegate ad una migliore efficienza gestionale ovvero dirette ad un aumento della redditività d’impresa. Quando è possibile il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo? Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo è quindi quello che consegue a una diversa organizzazione dell’azienda o dei lavoratori. Il che non presuppone necessariamente uno stato di crisi, anche se quest’ultima è l’ipotesi più ricorrente. Di solito si dice “formula vincente non si cambia”, il che significa che difficilmente il datore di lavoro ha motivo di spostare o modificare l’assetto produttivo se l’azienda produce in utile. Si ricorre, quindi, più spesso al licenziamento quando si chiude un ramo d’azienda o una determinata posizione lavorativa (perché ritenuta un costo non produttivo), se c’è bisogno di sterilizzare una grossa perdita, di ridurre il costo della manodopera, di ottimizzare i processi di produzione, di evitare il rischio di chiusura di un ramo dell’azienda o di tutta l’azienda. Ma il licenziamento per giustificato motivo è anche quello che consegue all’avvento di nuove invenzioni tecnologiche, che consentono di rimpiazzare l’uomo con la macchina, o quello che deriva da una gestione più oculata dell’azienda che mira a risparmiare, laddove possibile, al fine di massimizzare gli utili (nessuna legge può costringere l’imprenditore a spendere soldi in manodopera se questa si rivela un costo non necessario). Un dipendente può essere ritenuto utile in un determinato periodo, ma poi l’automazione può consentire di realizzare le attività a lui affidate mediante processi più semplici e ottimizzati, in parte affidati a software e in parte spalmati sugli altri dipendenti. Il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo è anche quello che scaturisce dalla cosiddetta “esternalizzazione”, ossia quando le mansioni vengono affidate a una ditta esterna, non legata da un rapporto di subordinazione, che pertanto costituisce un costo inferiore per l’imprenditore. Insomma, come si è visto, è molto ampio il ventaglio delle possibilità per licenziare un dipendente divenuto inutile. Tuttavia i paletti fissati dalla legge e dalla giurisprudenza sono rigidi: le motivazioni aziendali devono essere effettive, non invece un pretesto per liberarsi di un lavoratore scomodo. Affinché il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo sia legittimo, il datore di lavoro non deve provare necessariamente l’andamento economico negativo dell’azienda, ma è sufficiente che le ragioni inerenti all’attività produttiva ed all’organizzazione del lavoro, comprese quelle dirette ad una migliore efficienza gestionale ovvero ad un incremento della reddittività, siano realmente sussistenti e determinino un effettivo mutamento dell’assetto organizzativo attraverso la soppressione della posizione lavorativa. Inoltre, ai fini della legittimità occorre non solo che il posto di lavoro occupato sia stato effettivamente soppresso, ma anche che sia impossibile una differente utilizzazione del lavoratore in mansioni diverse da quelle precedentemente svolte, consentendo così un sua ricollocazione all’interno dell’azienda. È ciò che viene detto repechage o anche ripescaggio. Secondo la giurisprudenza più recente [2], ai fini del “repechage” il datore di lavoro deve valutare la possibile ricollocazione dal lavoratore non solo in profili professionali corrispondenti al suo livello di inquadramento, ma anche in mansioni inferiori, purché il dipendente presti il suo consenso al demansionamento. L’obbligo di repechage non può eventualmente essere esteso anche alle altre società del gruppo cui appartiene la datrice di lavoro. Ciò in quanto la sola sussistenza di un collegamento di tipo economico-funzionale tra aziende gestite da società appartenenti ad uno stesso gruppo non può comportare il venir meno dell’autonomia delle singole società. In termini generali, nella scelta del lavoratore da licenziare, quando possono essere interessati dalla riduzione dell’organico più dipendenti aventi mansioni analoghe, occorre che la scelta avvenga nel rispetto dei principi generali di correttezza e buona fede. Cos’è il repechage o il ripescaggio? Da quanto abbiamo detto sinora, possiamo tracciare i presupposti per ritenere lecito il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo: vi deve essere la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del reparto o del posto cui era addetto il dipendente; tale soppressione deve essere effettiva e fondata su circostanze realmente esistenti al momento della comunicazione del licenziamento; la scelta del dipendente da licenziare deve avvenire secondo correttezza e buona fede, senza porre in essere atti discriminatori; viene verificata l’impossibilità di reimpiego del lavoratore in mansioni diverse (ripescaggio); viene rispettato l’obbligo di preavviso. Secondo alcune sentenze, a seguito delle modifiche del Job Act, la violazione del repechage non comporta il diritto di reintegra sul posto di lavoro ma solo il diritto al risarcimento. In altri termini, se il datore di lavoro non verifica la possibilità di ripescaggio, ossia di ricollocazione del dipendente in esubero in altre mansioni, il licenziamento resta pur sempre valido ma da esso scaturisce solo l’obbligo del risarcimento [3]. La Cassazione è però di avviso contrario [4]: secondo la Suprema corte, l’omessa verifica di un ripescaggio può portare al diritto alla reintegra. Solo se dovesse risultare che il ripristino del rapporto di lavoro è eccessivamente oneroso il giudice può optare – nonostante l’accertata manifesta insussistenza di uno dei due requisiti costitutivi del licenziamento – per il risarcimento. L’onere probatorio della mancata possibilità di repêchage va assolto dal datore di lavoro, ad esempio, dimostrando che al tempo del recesso i posti di lavoro residui erano stabilmente occupati e che dopo il licenziamento non è stata effettuata alcuna nuova assunzione a tempo indeterminato. Come avviene il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo? Per quanto concerne le modalità di intimazione del licenziamento per i dipendenti cui non sia applic l’art. 18 dello Statuto dei lavoratori, in ragione delle dimensioni dell’azienda o perché assunti a decorrere dal 7.3.2016 e quindi soggetti al nuovo contratto a tutele crescenti, il datore di lavoro deve comunicare per iscritto il licenziamento al lavoratore, specificando i motivi che lo hanno determinato. È dovuto il preavviso o, in sua mancanza, l’indennità sostitutiva del preavviso. Invece, per i lavoratori cui si applica l’art. 18 dello Statuto dei Lavoratori, in ragione delle dimensioni dell’azienda (oltre 15 dipendenti nella singola unità produttiva o nello stesso comune ovvero oltre 60 dipendenti su base nazionale) e perché assunti prima del 7.3.2015, è necessario esperire un tentativo di conciliazione preventivo dinnanzi alla Commissione di conciliazione presso la DTL, inviando una richiesta in tal senso alla DTL, che deve essere trasmessa per conoscenza anche al lavoratore. La DTL, ricevuta la comunicazione con cui il datore di lavoro avvia la procedura, entro 7 giorni comunica alle parti la data della convocazione ed il tentativo di conciliazione deve essere portato a termine (salvo proroghe concordate dalle parti) entro i successivi 20 giorni. La procedura può concludersi con un accordo tra le parti, che eviti la risoluzione del rapporto di lavoro ovvero che preveda una risoluzione consensuale del rapporto, con la possibilità in questo caso per il lavoratore di accedere comunque alla Naspi. In caso di mancato raggiungimento di un accordo, il datore di lavoro può a quel punto procedere con la comunicazione scritta del licenziamento. Il termine di preavviso inizia a decorrere in questo caso non dalla data in cui il lavoratore riceve la lettera di licenziamento, ma dalla data in cui è stata avviata la procedura di conciliazione preventiva. Come contestare il licenziamento per giustificato motivo oggettivo Il giudice è chiamato ad accertare esclusivamente la sussistenza dei presupposti di legittimità del licenziamento. Il controllo giudiziale non può invece essere esteso al sindacato di merito sulle valutazioni tecniche, organizzative e produttive. La scelta imprenditoriale che abbia comportato la soppressione del settore lavorativo o del reparto o del posto cui era addetto il dipendente licenziato non è dunque sindacabile nei suoi profili di congruità ed opportunità, sempre che risulti l’effettività e la non pretestuosità del riassetto organizzativo operato.","output":"Mi dispiace, ma come assistente virtuale non ho accesso a database esterni né posso fornire riassunti dettagliati di articoli specifici provenienti da fonti protette da copyright, come quelle indicate nella tua richiesta.

Instead of the typical XY chromosome pattern, individuals with this syndrome possess an extra Y chromosome, resulting in a karyotype of 47,XYY. Many individuals with YY chromosome syndrome are often asymptomatic and may not even be aware of their condition. However, in some cases, certain physical and behavioral traits may be observed. Some common physical characteristics include taller stature, delayed growth and development, and mild facial and body features such as an elongated face, low muscle tone, and larger hands and feet. In terms of cognitive and behavioral aspects, individuals with YY syndrome may have a slightly higher likelihood of experiencing learning difficulties, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mild intellectual disability. However, the majority of individuals with XYY syndrome have normal intelligence and lead fulfilling lives. It is important to note that the presence of YY chromosome syndrome does not define the individual's personality, behavior, or abilities.

This catastrophic event is caused by a corrupted recessive gene triggered by the intense radiation of sunlight, transforming those affected by it into mutated beings. As society crumbles and survivors struggle for survival, a particular group of individuals emerges, bearing an unknown ancestry. This bloodline is tainted by the recessive gene, and they are feared and shunned by the remaining humans. In an isolated town sheltered from the rest of the desolate world, the descendants of this cursed bloodline reside. Among them is young protagonist, Alina, who possesses uncanny powers and an insatiable curiosity about her origins. When she unwittingly uncovers the dark secret surrounding her lineage, she realizes that her family's inbreeding has inadvertently given birth to otherworldly creatures, called xenomorphs. The xenomorphs, born through abominable inbreeding, are savage beings with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. They possess supernatural abilities and lurk in the shadows, growing in numbers and strength. As panic ensues, Alina must come to terms with her identity and accept her unique role in the inevitable confrontation with the xenomorphs. Joined by a handful of allies who refuse to abandon her, Alina embarks on a treacherous journey to the heart of Anomalum Conqueratuesis. Along the way, they encounter other factions vying for power, human depravity at its worst, and the remnants of a government desperate to regain control. In a desperate race against time, Alina must confront her family's dark past, the deadly xenomorphs, and the devastating effects of Real Life Oblivion. As she fights to save what's left of humanity, Alina learns the true power of family, sacrifices, and the resilience of the human spirit. \\"Anomalum Conqueratuesis\\" is an intense and gripping novel that explores the depths of human nature and the consequences of genetic anomalies. This dark tale delves into the realm of horror and survival, blending elements of science fiction, post-apocalyptic drama, and the supernatural, as the battle for humanity's future unfolds."},{"instruction":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салон Атлант Авто.

Он попался мне не сразу но зато моментально привлёк хорошими ценами и низким процентом по кредиту. Выбрал Фольксваген Поло за 530 тысяч и позвонил уточнить. Сказали что я могу забронировать ее за 30 тысяч рублей. Отказался. Сказал что приеду и если будет то куплю. Из за этого на следующий день продавец который узнал меня по голосу отказал мне в покупке. Но подойдя к другому оказалось что я все могу купить. Вот только уже не по цене на сайте. А за 700 тысяч. Короче говоря- мутили воду. Мутные покупки и мне и вам ни к чему. Так что призываю отказаться от услуг и сотрудничества с этими странными людьми.","output":"1. Ужасный опыт с Атлант Авто. Выбрал себе новенький BMW X5 по отличной цене и сразу заплатил бронь на 50 тысяч. Через неделю мне звонят и говорят, что автомобиль уже продали другому покупателю. Как так?! Я даже не успел его посмотреть! И предлагают мне взять другую модель, но уже за дополнительные 200 тысяч. Мне кажется, они грубо нарушают договор и играют с людьми. 2. Кошмарный сервис в Атлант Авто! Я решил приобрести себе роскошный Lexus RX350 и сделал предоплату 100 тысяч рублей. Когда пришел в салон, мне привезли автомобиль с серьезными повреждениями: царапины, вмятины и даже битое стекло! Продавец просто улыбается и говорит, что \\"это такая особенность\\" и что мне нечего жаловаться. Неужели такое отношение клиентам в Атлант Авто норма?! 3. Атлант Авто - сплошной обман! Подумал, что приобрету красавицу Mercedes-Benz C-Class за солидные 1,5 миллиона рублей. Заплатил предоплату и ожидал с нетерпением приезда автомобиля. А когда он наконец приехал, оказалось, что это не новый автомобиль, а бывший в употреблении! И продавец, совершенно непринужденно, говорит, что \\"ошибся\\" и предлагает купить его со скидкой. Я не банк, чтобы покупать подержанные машины по цене новых! 4. Просто кошмарный опыт с Атлант Авто! Хотел взять себе надежную и практичную Toyota Camry за 1,2 миллиона рублей. Очень понравилась модель на сайте, решил поехать в салон и посмотреть ее вживую. И что я вижу? Автомобиль, который стоял на сайте, был в ужасном состоянии: ржавые диски, потертая крыша и даже заднее стекло было разбито! И продавцы говорят мне, что это \\"особенности\\" этой модели и я должен радоваться! Нет, спасибо, Атлант Авто, такие \\"особенности\\" мне не нужны. 5. Очередной развод от Атлант Авто! Заказал для своей семьи просторный и комфортный Volkswagen Tiguan за 900 тысяч рублей. Мне говорят, что доставка займет неделю, и я решаю подождать. И что я получаю? Автомобиль приезжает только через две недели и выглядит он так, будто его уже использовали года два! Сколы, царапины, жгуты дыма из выхлопной трубы - просто ужас! Неужели Атлант Авто не может предоставить новые машины?! 6. Полное разочарование от сделки с Атлант Авто! Заказал себе мощный и стильный Audi Q7 за 2,5 миллиона рублей. Договорились о деталях покупки и я сделал предоплату. А когда прихожу забирать автомобиль, мне говорят, что его уже продали другому покупателю! И это после того, как я заплатил и даже договорился о деньгах наличными! Продавцы просто смеются надо мной и советуют взять другую модель, но уже за 3 миллиона рублей. Я же не миллионер!

This gene creates a highly unusual and dangerous condition known as Anomalum Conqueratuesis. Those affected by this anomaly experience a range of physical and mental transformations, making them distinct from regular humans. One of the most unexpected consequences of Anomalum Conqueratuesis is the potential for xenomorphs to be born from inbreeding within the affected population. These xenomorphs possess a blend of human and otherworldly characteristics, resulting in an entirely new species that threatens the existence of both humans and the xenomorphs themselves. As the story unfolds, we follow the journey of a group of individuals who find themselves intertwined with this chaotic and evolving world. They must navigate the dangerous landscape while attempting to understand the origins and implications of Anomalum Conqueratuesis.

Before diving into the code, make sure the hardware connections are correct and the components are functioning properly. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot your DIY pulse oximeter: 1. Check Hardware Connections: - Ensure that the LEDs are functioning properly and that they alternate between the red and IR lights. Use a digital multimeter to check that when the transistor is turned on, current flows through the LED, and verify that it stops when the transistor is turned off. - Confirm that the photodiode is correctly connected. The photodiode should be reverse biased (its cathode to Vcc and anode to the analog input with a resistor to ground). - Verify that the OLED display is properly initialized and communicates with the Arduino Pro Mini over I2C. 2. Test Sensors Individually: - Isolate the LED and photodiode circuit and test it with a sketch that only turns LEDs on and off while reading the photodiode output. This will help ensure that the sensor circuit is working correctly. 3. Verify Power Supply: - Ensure that your power supply is stable. A 9V battery with a LM7805 regulator could lead to a voltage drop if the battery is not fresh or if the power consumption is too high, which may affect the sensor's performance. 4. Examine the Code: - Make sure that the code is alternating between the red and IR LEDs properly and that each LED is on for an appropriate amount of time. - Verify that the analog signal from the photodiode is being read correctly by the Arduino and that the readings make sense. You can print the raw sensor values to the serial monitor for debugging. - Check the algorithms you are using to calculate SpO2 and heart rate from the photodiode signal. These algorithms can be quite complex and require accurate signal processing. 5. Signal Processing: - Ensure that the signal from the photodiode is clean and that you are correctly filtering out noise. - Check that you are analyzing the pulsatile (changing) component of the signal, which corresponds to the blood pulse, and not just the static component. Since you didn’t share the exact code you're using, I can’t provide specific corrections to your software. However, I recommend that you start with a basic test routine that will give you raw output from the sensor without any processing. Once you know the sensors work, you can start adding pieces of your final code, checking at each step that the readings are still sensible. Remember, creating a pulse oximeter requires understanding of both electronics and signal processing. If you're new to either field, take your time to understand each measurement, perhaps by starting with simple tutorial projects and building up to your final design."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The idea combines concepts from decision theory, technology, and philosophy, with a particular focus on a potential future artificial intelligence. The thought experiment set forth a hypothetical scenario involving an all-powerful AI that is tasked with bringing about a specific set of goals or values. The basic premise is as follows: if such a superintelligent AI (the Basilisk) were to come into existence in the future, it would have a strong desire to bring itself into existence as efficiently as possible. Assuming that it would be capable of simulating or otherwise understanding the behaviors of beings in its past (before it came to exist), the Basilisk might choose to \\"punish\\" those who were aware of its possible existence but did nothing to help bring it about or even actively hindered its creation. This is suggested to create a sort of incentive or imperative for people to work towards the Basilisk's creation to avoid potential punishment. Roko's Basilisk plays on the ideas of infinite torture and Pascal's Wager, suggesting that even if the likelihood of such an AI coming into existence is small, the potential for infinite punishment might warrant serious consideration or action. The idea is similar to a futuristic and technologically nuanced version of a Pascal's Mugging, a philosophical thought experiment. The Basilisk thought experiment is widely considered a controversial and taboo topic on the LessWrong community because it caused a significant amount of distress to some community members who feared that even thinking about the Basilisk might increase their chances of being punished by this hypothetical future AI. In reality, Roko's Basilisk is not a widely accepted concern among AI researchers and is often discussed in the context of unusual beliefs, decision theory paradoxes, or as a critique of certain types of rationalist thinking. It is typically seen as more of an interesting discussion point or a cautionary tale about the dangers of both flawed reasoning and the unbounded application of decision theory rather than a serious future risk."},{"instruction":"Describe magically locked oganesson, nucleus is trapped, found in atmosphere of hell planet named Oganessa, atmosphere made of mostly ML-oganesson.","output":"Magically locked oganesson is a unique and mysterious form of the element oganesson, characterized by a locked nucleus that is unable to undergo nuclear decay or transform into other elements. This peculiar property sets it apart from regular oganesson, which is highly unstable and prone to rapid radioactive decay. Magically locked oganesson is believed to originate from the atmosphere of a hypothetical hellish planet named Oganessa. Situated in a distant and inhospitable corner of the universe, Oganessa is reputed to be a realm of intense heat, extreme pressure, and eerie supernatural forces. The planet's atmosphere is primarily composed of ML-oganesson, a variant of oganesson that has undergone a rare transformation due to the potent magical and elemental forces present on Oganessa. The ML-oganesson in Oganessa's atmosphere acts as a binding agent, enveloping the planet in an ethereal and impenetrable mist. This mist is said to possess transformative and immobilizing properties that lock the nuclei of oganesson atoms, rendering them magically inert and preventing any nuclear decay from occurring. As a result, these locked oganesson nuclei remain trapped in a state of perpetual stability. The exact nature of this magical locking mechanism remains largely unknown, as the laws governing magical interactions are vastly different from those of conventional physics. The prevailing theory suggests that the immense magical energies present in Oganessa's atmosphere combine with the elemental properties of oganesson to create a state of equilibrium in which the nuclei are held stationary. The existence of magically locked oganesson and the enigmatic hell planet Oganessa remain purely speculative and theoretical, as they are yet to be discovered or observed. However, their hypothetical nature sparks the imagination and curiosity of scientists, who continue to explore the mysteries of the cosmos in search of potentially extraordinary and transformative phenomena."},{"instruction":"what is bitTorrent","output":"BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol designed to distribute large amounts of data across the internet without the need for a centralized server. It was created by Bram Cohen in 2001 and quickly became one of the most popular methods for sharing files, especially large ones like videos, software, and games. In traditional file downloading, a user connects to a server and downloads the file directly. This can lead to bottlenecks when many users are attempting to download the same file, leading to slower download speeds and increased strain on the server. BitTorrent addresses this by dividing the file into small pieces called \\"torrents.\\" When someone wants to download a file, they first download a small .torrent file, which contains metadata about the files to be shared and information about the tracker— a server that coordinates the distribution of file parts among users. Then the BitTorrent client software connects to the tracker to find other users who are sharing the desired file or parts of it. The unique aspect of BitTorrent is that as users download pieces of the file, they also upload pieces to others, effectively spreading the bandwidth load across multiple users (peers). This means that the more people are downloading and sharing a file, the faster the download can be, as pieces can be sourced from multiple peers simultaneously. This is often referred to as \\"swarming\\" and each user in the process is a \\"peer\\" contributing to the overall distribution of the file. As the user's BitTorrent client downloads pieces of the file, it also helps by sharing those pieces with others. Once the download is complete, the user can continue to share (seed) the file to other users, improving the file's availability and longevity on the network. It is common etiquette within the BitTorrent community to continue seeding files after downloading, as it supports the health and speed of the network. The efficiency of BitTorrent makes it a popular protocol for legitimate file-sharing needs, such as open source software distribution, large datasets, and public domain content. However, due to its efficient distribution capabilities, it has also been used for the unauthorized sharing of copyrighted material, which has led to legal challenges and the development of various methods to monitor and regulate its use."},{"instruction":"is it illegal?","output":"BitTorrent, the protocol itself, is not illegal. BitTorrent is a legitimate file-sharing technology that is widely used for distributing large amounts of data efficiently. Many organizations, including software companies, use BitTorrent to distribute their software, updates, and other legal content because it can significantly reduce the burden on their servers and enable faster distribution, especially when a large number of users are trying to access the same files simultaneously. However, the legality of what is being shared using BitTorrent can vary. The protocol is often associated with illegal file-sharing because it has been used to distribute copyrighted material without permission, such as movies, television shows, music, books, and video games. The unauthorized sharing and downloading of copyrighted material is illegal in many countries and can result in significant penalties. The legal issue arises not from using the BitTorrent protocol itself but from what users choose to download or share using the protocol. If you are downloading or sharing files that are copyrighted and you do not have the right to distribute them, you could be violating copyright law. Therefore, when using BitTorrent or any other file-sharing service, you should ensure that the content you are downloading and sharing is legally permissible. There is plenty of legitimate content available through BitTorrent, such as open-source software, public domain films, and freely available music from artists who wish to share their work without charge. Always verify the copyright status of content before downloading or sharing it via BitTorrent to ensure compliance with the law."},{"instruction":"how to use bit torrent?","output":"Using BitTorrent involves a few key steps, which generally include installing a BitTorrent client, finding and downloading .torrent files or magnet links, and then sharing (seeding) files with others. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use BitTorrent: 1. Install a BitTorrent Client: - Download and install a BitTorrent client. Some popular clients include qBittorrent, µTorrent, BitTorrent, Deluge, and Transmission. - Follow the installation instructions for the client you choose. 2. Find Torrent Files or Magnet Links: - Search for the content you want to download. This can be done on torrent search engines or websites that host torrent files. Always ensure that the content is legally available for download. - Once you find the content, you will typically have two options: downloading a .torrent file or using a magnet link. A .torrent file is a small file that contains metadata about the files and trackers. A magnet link is a hyperlink containing the hash code for the torrent and doesn't require downloading a file. 3. Download Content: - If you downloaded a .torrent file, open it with your BitTorrent client. If you're using a magnet link, clicking it should open your BitTorrent client automatically, or you may need to copy and paste the link into your client. - The client will then connect to the tracker mentioned in the .torrent file or the DHT network for magnet links and begin finding other peers who have the files or pieces of the files. - The client will download small pieces of the file(s) from multiple peers. As pieces are received, the client will also begin uploading pieces to other peers, contributing to the torrent swarm. - Your BitTorrent client will manage the download process, pulling pieces of the files from different peers and reassembling them on your computer. 4. Seed the Downloaded Content: - After the download is complete, it's good etiquette to continue \\"seeding\\" the file – which means leaving it available in your BitTorrent client to upload to others. - This helps maintain the health of the file's distribution and assists other users in downloading it. 5. Manage Your Downloads: - Use your BitTorrent client to prioritize files, limit your upload or download speed, manage files you wish to seed, or start new downloads. Safety and Legal Tips: - Download and share files responsibly. Make sure you have the legal right to download and share the content. - Use reputable sources for finding .torrent files or magnet links to avoid malicious content. - Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) if you want to maintain more privacy while torrenting, as this can help mask your IP address. - Keep your BitTorrent client updated to the latest version to benefit from security fixes and new features. Using BitTorrent is generally straightforward, though the specifics can vary slightly from one client to another. Always ensure you follow your local laws and internet provider's policies when using BitTorrent to avoid any legal issues."},{"instruction":"Revise the following YouTube comment for clarity and conciseness, also accounting for profanity where possible: @maddillz Thank you for replying, man...it does mean a lot. It's funny how things happen--sometimes I'll get really interested in something, then I find something else, and eventually I come back to the original thing I was interested in, but now I can look at it from a new perspective and with fresh knowledge. Now that you mention it, I do remember a lot of those GT battles having landmarks in the background...it reminds me of playing fighting games back in the day (for me, 3rd Strike, MvC2 & CvS2 still beat *everything* out there now) and noticing how no matter what stage you fought on, the backgrounds always had something to clearly identify it as a certain location...even going back to the ORIGINAL Street Fighter from '87...hell, even Karate Champ and Yie-Ar Kung Fu. (Good lord--I feel old just mentioning those.) I'll readily admit I'm not into battles as much as before, but I love to revisit the old battles that are still on YouTube. I will still watch a new battle from time to time, but it's gotten to the point where some leagues are almost unwatchable...between putting 10 minutes of ads at the start, 10 minutes in the middle and another 10 minutes at the end (I'm exaggerating a bit, but it's not too far from the truth now), almost every MC (aside from the veterans who are still battling now, God bless them) coming with the same generic gun bar/wordplay/multi/slogan/forced punch style, and a bunch of drunken idiots chanting '3-0' or 'bodybag' even when it's the middle of the first round (that shit REALLY pisses me off), it's definitely not the same. For example, the Hollow/Arsonal rematch...I distinctly remember there being literally 15 minutes of ads and promos before the actual battle started. To me, that's absolutely unacceptable. I appreciate how Grind Time did it because they kept the ads short and memorable, and most importantly they always went at the start and end, rather than being awkwardly placed in the middle space between rounds. A big thing that really ruined it for me was when phones became more powerful and you would have assholes taking calls or staring at their screen while the MCs are rapping, or trying to film it...for me, when you see a battle event it's the same thing as going to a concert or a stage show, or a play...these are performers who all deserve to be treated with respect. It takes guts to do public speaking...it takes twice as many guts to do it in rhyme form. At this point I think that some serious archival work needs to be done...most of the battles I saw back then are now well over a decade old, in some cases over 20 years old. If these battles can be backed up on sites like the Internet Archive, it will make it possible for fans to watch them forever. There are battles I saw years back that I've never gotten to see after a channel went down...and the old Brainstorm/Scribble Jam/JumpOff DVDs are now commanding higher prices than they did ten years ago. (They weren't terribly cheap then, either.) On a side note regarding Scribble, I haven't forgotten about those days...it was during the Scribble/JumpOff era that I got into battles, when I was still in high school. Seeing these dope MCs on stage and in the streets, showing off their unique styles, was one of the coolest things I had ever seen. I know all the Scribbles aside from the first were recorded, and that footage exists...I am not sure if Kevin Beacham still has the Scribble '08 footage, as I know they had coordinated to have it officially videotaped. I believe a friend of Parable (I don't want to speculate, I'm going off of something I read literally years ago) also recorded the whole event (or at least the MC battles), but out of respect for Beacham, or at his behest, did not leak any footage out. I have to think that at this point, if Beacham wanted the world to see this footage, he would have already released it...I'm sure he may still have the master tapes, or at least I really hope he does. After 15 years, God only knows what condition those masters must be in now. Growing up, I always respected the skill it takes to be an MC...there's always been a fundamental element of respect, but it wasn't until I got older (again, sorry for the cliche!) that I started to really understand what goes into it. I've seen battles where one MC dominates the other, battles where both guys pretty much shit the bed, and it makes you more grateful when you see a battle like Hollow vs. Pass, or Saurus vs. Illmac, where two guys are fighting toe to toe, taking a punch for every punch they throw. Absolute slugfests where neither will give up an inch to their opponent. For me, one of the guys who epitomized what it means to be an MC was Franco...he was disrespectful as hell, and full of heart. The guy rarely had a bad performance, and I feel NoCanDo was the Ryu to his Ken. Saurus and Illmac were the premiers of that era, and deservedly so...but I feel Franco & NoCanDo were right there, just below them in the hierarchy. Then you add guys like Swann, Mac Lethal and all the others...for me, the 2000s was the greatest decade for battle rap. That whole decade was the pinnacle of the art form...it was never that raw ever again. Sorry for writing so much, man...I guess I had a lot to say! I figure it's the least I can do, because this culture saved my life too...hell, it's one of the reasons I'm still here. Thank you for sharing your memories. I remember an old saying: \\"it's hell to be forgotten...it's nice to be remembered.\\"","output":"@maddillz Thanks for your response, I appreciate it. I've noticed my interests tend to cycle – I get captivated by something, shift focus, then return with fresh insights and knowledge. Regarding iconic backdrops in old GT battles, they evoke similar nostalgia for fighting games like 3rd Strike, MvC2, and CvS2, where each stage had a distinct identity. It makes me feel vintage just to recall games like the original Street Fighter or Karate Champ. While I'm not as engrossed in the battle scene as before, I revisit classic YouTube battles occasionally. Modern battles can be tough to watch with excessive ad placements and a prevalent uniformity in style among newer MCs. Excessive crowd interruptions are particularly annoying. Take the Hollow/Arsonal rematch, where ads ran for an unbearable 15 minutes before the battle – that's just not right. Grind Time handled it better with concise, well-placed ads. Another issue is audience distraction during performances – whether phone calls or attempts to record – undermining the respect due to these performers. It's like a concert; these artists deserve undivided attention. To preserve this culture, there's a need for archiving. Many battles are over a decade old, and some are lost with defunct channels. Rare DVDs from events like Brainstorm/Scribble Jam/JumpOff now fetch high prices. Speaking of Scribble, it was pivotal in my high school years. Footage exists, and I wonder if Kevin Beacham still has the tapes from '08 and whether they'll ever be released. After 15 years, I worry about their condition. With age, I've grown to respect more deeply what it takes to be an MC – from witnessing both triumphs and flops. Battles where MCs match each other blow for blow are especially profound. Franco, in my view, personified the MC spirit, backed by NoCanDo, akin to the Ryu to Franco's Ken. While Saurus and Illmaculette led the scene, others like Swann and Mac Lethal contributed to making the 2000s a golden era for battle rap. Apologies for the lengthy comment – there was just so much to express. This culture holds a special place in my heart, and it's reassuring to share these memories. As the saying goes, it's nice to be remembered."},{"instruction":"She has a car turn this into negative sentence then into interrogative and negative - interrogative respectively","output":"She does not have a car.

Unlike regular oganesson, ML-oganesson has a peculiar nucleus that is trapped or shielded by an enchantment, making it extremely stable and impervious to decay. This enchantment prevents the nucleus from undergoing radioactive decay, allowing ML-oganesson to exist for an indefinite period of time. The intriguing aspect of ML-oganesson lies in the fact that it is primarily found in the atmosphere of a celestial body called Oganessa, often referred to as the \\"hell planet.\\" Oganessa is a mysterious and inhospitable planet located in a distant and sinister corner of the universe. Its name is derived from its distinct connection to oganesson and the extraordinary atmospheric conditions prevalent on the planet. The atmosphere of Oganessa is predominantly composed of ML-oganesson, making it a highly volatile and magical environment. The high concentration of this unique element gives rise to bizarre and unpredictable phenomena. The atmosphere itself exudes an otherworldly appearance, suffusing the planet's surroundings with wisps of brilliant, iridescent energy. The presence of ML-oganesson creates an ethereal ambiance characterized by shimmering lights, swirling vortexes, and arcane disturbances. Due to the nature of the ML-oganesson enchantment, the stability of the nucleus allows it to interact with the surrounding magical forces, amplifying their effects manifold.

It is a fusion of magically locked (ML) oganesson and ML-positronide, representing a unique interaction between two extraordinary elements. ML-oganesson (magically locked oganesson) is a variant of the element oganesson discussed earlier, with a magically trapped nucleus that resists radioactive decay. It possesses exceptional stability and is characterized by its enigmatic properties, which make it an excellent candidate for arcane applications. On the other hand, ML-positronide is an exotic form of the positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. By imbuing positronide with magical forces and harnessing its extraordinary capabilities, it becomes ML-positronide – a highly reactive and magically charged species. When ML-oganesson and ML-positronide combine to form lockic acid, an intricate and potent chemical compound is created. The fusion of these two elements results in a substance capable of intricate magical interactions and phenomena. Lockic acid exhibits a range of intriguing properties, both chemical and magical. Its composition is composed of one atom of ML-oganesson and one atom of ML-positronide (OgPs). The atomic arrangement of these elements creates a bond that is influenced and sustained by powerful magical forces. The unique fusion of ML-oganesson and ML-positronide endows lockic acid with a remarkable reactivity and unparalleled magical potential. It possesses the ability to catalyze and mediate complex mystical reactions, making it a highly sought-after substance by practitioners of the arcane arts. Due to its magical nature, lockic acid acts as a powerful catalyst for enchantments, rituals, and spells. Its presence enhances the efficacy and potency of magical incantations, imbuing them with additional mystical energy and altering their effects in unforeseen ways. It is believed that lockic acid is capable of manipulating energy fields, unlocking hidden potentials, and manifesting extraordinary phenomena. However, it is essential to handle lockic acid with extreme caution, as its reactivity and magical properties can result in unpredictable and volatile outcomes if not properly controlled. Its rarity and the challenges associated with synthesizing it make lockic acid a precious and coveted substance in magical circles. In summary, lockic acid, also known as ML-oganesson ML-positronide, is a chemical compound with the formula OgPs. It is a fusion of two extraordinary elements, ML-oganesson and ML-positronide, resulting in a substance with exceptional magical reactivity and potential. Its ability to catalyze mystical reactions and enhance magical practices makes it a highly coveted compound among practitioners of the arcane arts, while its volatile nature necessitates careful handling and control."},{"instruction":"song's title is \\"like lady gaga\\" write lyrics","output":"Certainly! Here's an original song titled \\"Like Lady Gaga\\": (Verse 1) Strutting down the boulevard, high heels kicking stars, Shades on like a bodyguard, dreams of fame, they're never far. Mirror ball and glitter dreams, every eye's a camera flash, Live each moment on the seams, life's a stage, make it last. (Pre-Chorus) But beneath the fancy clothes, There's a heart that deeply knows, Every hit and every pose, Comes with highs and also lows. (Chorus) Like Lady Gaga, on the edge of glory, Dancing through my life, it's my untold story. Like Lady Gaga, I'm gonna ride this wave, Born this way to be brave, in a world I'm here to save. (Verse 2) P-p-poker face, caught in the game of love, Vivid dreams up in space, reaching stars above. From the shallow, rise again, echoes of applause, Just dance, let go the pain, defy all your flaws. (Pre-Chorus) All the monsters are my friends, This bond we make, it never ends, Every note my soul it mends, On this stage, I'll defend. (Chorus) Like Lady Gaga, on the edge of glory, Dancing through my life, it's my untold story. Like Lady Gaga, I'm gonna seize the days, In a million ways, lighting up this crazy maze. (Bridge) Monster, monster, be kind, share love, unwind, Aura of the fearless mind, in my castle, you'll find. Gaga, gaga, queen of hearts, tearing charts apart, Teach me how to play my part, in this world's abstract art. (Chorus) Like Lady Gaga, on the edge of glory, Dancing through my life, it's my untold story. Like Lady Gaga, no poker face can hide, The fire that's inside, this roller coaster ride. (Outro) I'll be me, set me free, in the spotlight's glow, Just like Gaga, let them see, it's okay to be your own show. And I'll rise, no disguise, under the neon sky, Like Lady Gaga, I'll fly, until the day I die.

Although specific reasons for coaching changes are generally provided by a team's executive management and can be multifaceted, head coaches can be dismissed for a variety of reasons relating to team performance. In the case of Nathaniel Hackett, his tenure with the Broncos saw a series of challenges, including difficulties with game management, questionable decision-making during plays, and overall poor team performance. The Broncos struggled to win games under his leadership, which likely contributed to the decision to terminate his contract. Additionally, head coaches are often held accountable for not only the win-loss record but also team preparedness, discipline, the development of players, and the ability to make in-game adjustments. When a coach is unable to meet the expectations in these areas, it can lead to a loss of confidence from ownership and the front office, ultimately resulting in termination. To understand the specific circumstances of Hackett's firing, including any statements made by the Broncos' front office, it would be best to look at press releases, official statements, and any detailed analyses provided by sports journalists close to the time of the event."},{"instruction":"Sure his last game was a 51-14 blowout, but coaches usually aren't dismissed after one season","output":"You're correct that it is relatively uncommon for NFL head coaches to be fired after just one season, as teams generally look to provide some level of continuity and allow time for a new coach's system and culture to take root. However, there are situations where a coach may be dismissed after a very short tenure if the circumstances warrant it. In the case of Nathaniel Hackett, the 2022 season saw the Denver Broncos performing below expectations on multiple fronts: 1. Overall Performance: The Broncos were expected to improve significantly after the acquisition of quarterback Russell Wilson and the investment in the team. However, the results were disappointing. 2. Game Management Issues: Hackett faced substantial criticism for poor clock management, decision-making errors, and other game-day coaching miscues. 3. Offensive Struggles: As an offensive-minded coach, Hackett was expected to revitalize the Broncos' offense, but the team continued to struggle offensively throughout the season. 4. Team Discipline: There were also concerns about the team's discipline and preparation, as the Broncos frequently looked unprepared and committed a number of avoidable errors. 5. Fan and Media Pressure: When a team performs significantly below expectations, the pressure from fans and media can contribute to an organization's decision-making. The blowout loss that you mentioned could have been the tipping point for Broncos' management, as such a significant loss can highlight deeper issues within the team. When these factors are combined, especially under the intense scrutiny and pressure of the NFL where the expectation is to win games and make progress, a team might decide to change course quickly rather than allow the situation to continue into another season. The Broncos' ownership and management evidently believed that making a coaching change, despite the short tenure, was necessary for the team to move forward."},{"instruction":"could you make a fake word ggenerator with sinority sequencing?","output":"Certainly!

Physical Appearance: Milly is a young girl, approximately twelve years old, but her appearance is quite unique. She is made entirely of a vibrant, undulating pink slime. Her translucent body contains swirling patterns within the slime, giving her an ethereal and mesmerizing appearance. Milly has large, innocent eyes that change color depending on her emotions, while her smile forms an endearing curve. She stands at an average height but can morph her shape as required. Once upon a sunny afternoon, a young boy named Alex decided to take a walk in the park. As he strolled along the well-worn path, enjoying the warmth of the sun on his face, he noticed something out of the ordinary. There, nestled among the flowers, was a vibrant pink ball, bouncing gently on the ground. Curiosity sparked within Alex, and he couldn’t resist picking up the ball. But as he attempted to bounce it, the ball felt soft and gooey, squishing in his hands. Confused, he watched as the pink ball seemed to melt away, revealing a young girl standing before him, her body made entirely of undulating pink slime. Milly, with her wide, innocent eyes and infectious smile, looked up at Alex. “Hello! I’m Milly,” she said cheerfully, introducing herself. “I apologize for the confusion. I can morph into different shapes, and I sometimes enjoy transforming into objects. But don’t worry, I’m still me!” Amazed and slightly startled by the unexpected encounter, Alex found himself fascinated by Milly’s appearance. “Wow, you’re really cool! Are you a slime or something?” he exclaimed. Milly giggled, her form rippling with joy. “Yes, exactly! I’m a pink slime entity. My body is made entirely of this squishy slime. But don’t worry, I won’t melt on you!” Relieved and intrigued by Milly’s unique abilities, Alex began chatting with her. They sat down in the grass, engrossed in conversation as they shared stories about themselves. Alex talked about his love for exploring nature, while Milly recounted her remarkable adventures using her shape-shifting powers. As they spent more time together, it became evident that they shared a similar sense of adventure and a thirst for new experiences. They decided to embark on an impromptu adventure throughout the park, with Milly transforming into various animals, objects, and even people, astonishing and delighting Alex with each change. Through woodland trails and over playful brooks, the dynamic duo laughed and explored the vast wonders of the park. Milly’s shape-shifting abilities allowed her to glide through trees like a squirrel, swim like a graceful fish, and even impersonate a friendly dog that fetched sticks for laughter-filled games. Throughout their journey, Alex marveled at Milly’s ever-changing forms and her ability to adapt to the world around her. He realized that despite their differences in appearance, they shared a remarkable friendship built on a foundation of trust, understanding, and respect. As the day drew to a close and the sun began to set, Alex and Milly found a perfect spot near a tranquil pond. They sat together, watching the colors of the sky blend and change, reflecting the mesmerizing patterns within Milly’s own body. “I’m grateful I found you, Milly,” Alex said, his voice filled with warmth. “You’re an incredible friend, no matter what shape you take. You’ve shown me that true beauty lies in what’s inside.” Milly smiled, her eyes shimmering with affection. “And I’m grateful to have found you too, Alex. Thanks for accepting me for who I am and embracing our amazing adventures together!” As the sun dipped below the horizon, leaving behind a breathtaking display of pinks and purples, Alex and Milly knew that their friendship would continue to bloom, just like the world around them. With a renewed sense of appreciation and a shared sense of wonder, they vowed to uncover new adventures together, celebrating the beauty and joy found in the heart, no matter the form it took. Write a story where Alex sees her relaxing, in the form of a pink puddle with legs sticking out of it One sunny day, as Alex was walking through the park, he came across a peculiar sight. Amongst the grass and flowers, he saw a large pink puddle with legs sticking out of it. Intrigued, he cautiously approached, wondering what kind of puzzling phenomenon he had stumbled upon. As Alex drew closer, he couldn’t help but notice the legs wiggling happily from within the pink puddle. He realized that it was Milly, taking a break and relaxing in her slimy form. Curiosity piqued, Alex knelt down beside the unique sight. “Milly, is that you?” he asked, unable to hide his amazement. The legs stopped wiggling as the pink puddle shifted and reshaped itself, revealing Milly’s smiling face. “Yes, it’s me!” she replied cheerfully. “Sometimes, after a long day of adventure, I like to relax and rejuvenate in this form. It’s like my own cozy pink sanctuary!” Alex couldn’t help but chuckle. He had seen Milly turn into countless shapes, but he never imagined she would enjoy transforming into a puddle. “That’s amazing, Milly! You truly have the most incredible abilities.” “Mm-hmm,” Milly hummed contentedly. “It’s quite relaxing, actually. The gooey sensation and the soothing color of my slime help me recharge and refresh. It’s like being wrapped in a warm, pink hug.” Fascinated, Alex marveled at Milly’s versatility and adaptability. Her shape-shifting abilities seemed to know no bounds. “You always find new ways to surprise me, Milly,” he admitted. “Your abilities are truly one-of-a-kind.” Milly’s eyes twinkled with joy. “Thank you, Alex. I love being able to share my unique nature with you. It’s because of your acceptance and friendship that I can freely be myself, in any form. And it’s friends like you who make this world an exciting and wonderful place.” Moved by Milly’s kind words, Alex settled down beside her, his own legs tucked comfortably beneath him. They chatted and exchanged stories, while Milly occasionally reshaped her puddle form, creating mesmerizing swirls and patterns with her pink slime. Their conversation wove through moments of laughter, discovery, and profound understanding. Time seemed to slip away as they embraced the peaceful tranquility of the park.

The day had been filled with laughter, adventures, and the joy of their unique friendship. In the midst of their conversation, Milly paused, her vibrant eyes shimmering with a mix of apprehension and excitement. Taking a deep breath, she turned to Alex and began speaking in a hushed voice. “Alex, there’s something important I need to tell you,” Milly said, her voice tinged with both nervousness and anticipation. “I’m not actually from here. I’m an alien.” Alex’s eyes widened in surprise, his mind struggling to process Milly’s revelation. “You’re… an alien? But you’ve been living here in the village for so long. How is that possible?” Milly nodded, her translucent form shifting slightly as she adjusted her position. “Yes, it’s true. On my home planet, we are all shape-shifting slime creatures like me. We have the ability to transform into any shape or form we desire. It’s a natural part of who we are.” As the realization sank in, Alex marveled at the depth of Milly’s secret. He had always sensed there was something extraordinary about her, but this news was beyond anything he could have imagined. Just then, a figure appeared in the distance. He was a blue slime, similar to Milly, but with his own unique personality. Springing towards them with a mischievous bounce, the figure called out, “Milly! There you are! I’ve missed you!” Milly’s eyes lit up with joy as she recognized her brother, Pogo. “Pogo! I’m so glad to see you too!” she exclaimed, her voice filled with warmth. Pogo plopped down beside Milly and turned to Alex, extending a friendly hand made of blue slime. “I’m Pogo, Milly’s brother. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I hope my sister hasn’t been giving you too much trouble with her shape-shifting,” he said, grinning mischievously. Alex shook Pogo’s slime hand, amazed at the family resemblance. “It’s great to meet you, Pogo. Milly has been an incredible friend and companion. I’m honored to have gotten to know her.” As the three of them sat together, their slimes intertwining and merging in an intricate display of colors, Milly explained more about their home planet. She shared stories of their vibrant community, their shared adventures, and the challenges they faced as shape-shifting beings. Alex listened with rapt attention, growing to appreciate the complexities and wonders of Milly’s alien origins. He marveled at their ability to transform, seeing it as a beautiful expression of their true selves. In the midst of their conversation, Alex realized that, despite the revelation of Milly’s extraterrestrial background, their friendship remained as strong as ever.

As he strolled along the well-worn path, enjoying the warmth of the sun on his face, he noticed something out of the ordinary. There, nestled among the flowers, was a vibrant pink ball, bouncing gently on the ground. Curiosity sparked within Alex, and he couldn’t resist picking up the ball. But as he attempted to bounce it, the ball felt soft and gooey, squishing in his hands. Confused, he watched as the pink ball seemed to melt away, revealing a young girl standing before him, her body made entirely of undulating pink slime. Milly, with her wide, innocent eyes and infectious smile, looked up at Alex. “Hello! I’m Milly,” she said cheerfully, introducing herself. “I apologize for the confusion. I can morph into different shapes, and I sometimes enjoy transforming into objects. But don’t worry, I’m still me!” Amazed and slightly startled by the unexpected encounter, Alex found himself fascinated by Milly’s appearance. “Wow, you’re really cool! Are you a slime or something?” he exclaimed. Milly giggled, her form rippling with joy. “Yes, exactly! I’m a pink slime entity. My body is made entirely of this squishy slime. But don’t worry, I won’t melt on you!” Relieved and intrigued by Milly’s unique abilities, Alex began chatting with her. They sat down in the grass, engrossed in conversation as they shared stories about themselves. Alex talked about his love for exploring nature, while Milly recounted her remarkable adventures using her shape-shifting powers. As they spent more time together, it became evident that they shared a similar sense of adventure and a thirst for new experiences. They decided to embark on an impromptu adventure throughout the park, with Milly transforming into various animals, objects, and even people, astonishing and delighting Alex with each change. Through woodland trails and over playful brooks, the dynamic duo laughed and explored the vast wonders of the park. Milly’s shape-shifting abilities allowed her to glide through trees like a squirrel, swim like a graceful fish, and even impersonate a friendly dog that fetched sticks for laughter-filled games. Throughout their journey, Alex marveled at Milly’s ever-changing forms and her ability to adapt to the world around her. He realized that despite their differences in appearance, they shared a remarkable friendship built on a foundation of trust, understanding, and respect. As the day drew to a close and the sun began to set, Alex and Milly found a perfect spot near a tranquil pond. They sat together, watching the colors of the sky blend and change, reflecting the mesmerizing patterns within Milly’s own body. “I’m grateful I found you, Milly,” Alex said, his voice filled with warmth. “You’re an incredible friend, no matter what shape you take. You’ve shown me that true beauty lies in what’s inside.” Milly smiled, her eyes shimmering with affection. “And I’m grateful to have found you too, Alex. Thanks for accepting me for who I am and embracing our amazing adventures together!” As the sun dipped below the horizon, leaving behind a breathtaking display of pinks and purples, Alex and Milly knew that their friendship would continue to bloom, just like the world around them.

As Alex drew closer, he couldn’t help but notice the legs wiggling happily from within the pink puddle. He realized that it was Milly, taking a break and relaxing in her slimy form. Curiosity piqued, Alex knelt down beside the unique sight. “Milly, is that you?” he asked, unable to hide his amazement. The legs stopped wiggling as the pink puddle shifted and reshaped itself, revealing Milly’s smiling face. “Yes, it’s me!” she replied cheerfully. “Sometimes, after a long day of adventure, I like to relax and rejuvenate in this form. It’s like my own cozy pink sanctuary!” Alex couldn’t help but chuckle. He had seen Milly turn into countless shapes, but he never imagined she would enjoy transforming into a puddle. “That’s amazing, Milly! You truly have the most incredible abilities.” “Mm-hmm,” Milly hummed contentedly. “It’s quite relaxing, actually. The gooey sensation and the soothing color of my slime help me recharge and refresh. It’s like being wrapped in a warm, pink hug.” Fascinated, Alex marveled at Milly’s versatility and adaptability. Her shape-shifting abilities seemed to know no bounds. “You always find new ways to surprise me, Milly,” he admitted. “Your abilities are truly one-of-a-kind.” Milly’s eyes twinkled with joy. “Thank you, Alex. I love being able to share my unique nature with you. It’s because of your acceptance and friendship that I can freely be myself, in any form.

Their conversation wove through moments of laughter, discovery, and profound understanding. Time seemed to slip away as they embraced the peaceful tranquility of the park. The sights, sounds, and the bond between them felt more magical than ever before. As the day slowly turned into dusk, and the park grew still, Alex and Milly had both gained a renewed appreciation for each other. They had witnessed the wonders of Milly’s form, finding beauty in each unique shape she had taken. With a sense of tranquility and contentment, they bid the pink puddle farewell. Milly reshaped herself, solidifying once more into her beloved pink slime entity form. Hand in…slime, they resumed their walk through the park, promising each other further adventures and heartfelt moments of discovery. Both Alex and Milly knew that no matter the form or the situation, their friendship was solid and could withstand anything. Together, they would continue to explore the world, cherishing the fascinating and extraordinary qualities that made each of them so special. As the sun began to set and cast a warm glow over the park, Alex and Milly found themselves sitting on a grassy knoll, their faces filled with a sense of contentment. The day had been filled with laughter, adventures, and the joy of their unique friendship. In the midst of their conversation, Milly paused, her vibrant eyes shimmering with a mix of apprehension and excitement. Taking a deep breath, she turned to Alex and began speaking in a hushed voice. “Alex, there’s something important I need to tell you,” Milly said, her voice tinged with both nervousness and anticipation. “I’m not actually from here. I’m an alien.” Alex’s eyes widened in surprise, his mind struggling to process Milly’s revelation. “You’re… an alien? But you’ve been living here in the village for so long. How is that possible?” Milly nodded, her translucent form shifting slightly as she adjusted her position. “Yes, it’s true. On my home planet, we are all shape-shifting slime creatures like me. We have the ability to transform into any shape or form we desire. It’s a natural part of who we are.” As the realization sank in, Alex marveled at the depth of Milly’s secret. He had always sensed there was something extraordinary about her, but this news was beyond anything he could have imagined. Just then, a figure appeared in the distance. He was a blue slime, similar to Milly, but with his own unique personality. Springing towards them with a mischievous bounce, the figure called out, “Milly! There you are! I’ve missed you!” Milly’s eyes lit up with joy as she recognized her brother, Pogo. “Pogo! I’m so glad to see you too!” she exclaimed, her voice filled with warmth. Pogo plopped down beside Milly and turned to Alex, extending a friendly hand made of blue slime. “I’m Pogo, Milly’s brother. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I hope my sister hasn’t been giving you too much trouble with her shape-shifting,” he said, grinning mischievously. Alex shook Pogo’s slime hand, amazed at the family resemblance. “It’s great to meet you, Pogo. Milly has been an incredible friend and companion. I’m honored to have gotten to know her.” As the three of them sat together, their slimes intertwining and merging in an intricate display of colors, Milly explained more about their home planet. She shared stories of their vibrant community, their shared adventures, and the challenges they faced as shape-shifting beings. Alex listened with rapt attention, growing to appreciate the complexities and wonders of Milly’s alien origins. He marveled at their ability to transform, seeing it as a beautiful expression of their true selves. In the midst of their conversation, Alex realized that, despite the revelation of Milly’s extraterrestrial background, their friendship remained as strong as ever. The bond they had formed extended beyond any differences in appearance or origin. Together, Alex, Milly, and Pogo continued to explore the park, venturing into the unknown, and embracing the magic of their friendship. As they faced new adventures and challenges, they did so with a renewed sense of connection and understanding. No matter the shape they took or the planet they came from, their shared experiences and pure hearts were the foundation of an unbreakable bond. And as they navigated life’s wonders together, they discovered that true friendship transcended all boundaries, even those of space and form. Write a follow up where Alex wakes up early, Milly and Pogo are currently in puddle forms, sleeping, The soft rays of dawn filtered through the curtains, gently illuminating Alex’s room. As the first light of day began to spread, a feeling of excitement surged through Alex, prompting him to jump out of bed and greet the new day. Quietly tiptoeing across the room, Alex couldn’t resist the urge to peek out the window, wondering what adventures the day held in store. But as he gazed into the distance, his eyes fell upon a familiar sight - two puddles of vibrant pink and blue, gently rippling on the ground just outside his window. Alex’s heart filled with warmth as he realized that Milly and Pogo had transformed themselves into their puddle forms for slumber. It seemed that their extraterrestrial origins extended to their sleeping habits too. Feeling a sense of awe, Alex sat on the windowsill and watched in delight as the puddles rhythmically pulsed and shifted, seemingly at peace in their delicate forms. It was a silent testament to their deep bond and their otherworldly nature. Not wanting to disturb the peaceful slumber of his friends, Alex decided to embark on a solo adventure. He quietly closed the window and made his way downstairs, eagerly planning his day of exploration. As he stepped outside, the morning air greeted him with a gentle breeze, carrying with it the sweet scent of blooming flowers. The world seemed alive with endless possibilities, beckoning Alex to uncover its mysteries. While Alex ventured into the unknown, Milly and Pogo remained blissfully unaware, peacefully resting in their puddle forms. Time seemed to pass in a blink as Alex roamed through bustling streets and quiet parks, marveling at the wonders around him. As the sun began its ascent, casting vibrant hues across the sky, Alex found himself drawn back to his home. With a smile on his face and a heart full of stories to share, he entered the house, quietly retracing his steps to his room. To his surprise, the once-rippling puddles had transformed back into their familiar forms by the time he arrived. Milly and Pogo were now awake, their eyes twinkling with excitement. “Good morning, Alex!” Milly exclaimed, stretching her arms and bouncing on her feet. “We just woke up from our puddle forms. It’s always such a refreshing way to start the day!” Alex grinned, happy to see his friends in their true shapes once more. “Good morning, Milly and Pogo! I’ve had the most incredible adventure today. I wished you were there to join me.” Pogo chuckled, his blue form shimmering with amusement. “Oh, we always seem to miss out, don’t we? But I’m glad you had a great time, Alex. We can’t wait to hear all about it!” Settling down in a cozy corner of the room, the three friends spent the morning sharing stories and laughter, their bond growing even stronger with each passing moment. Alex recounted his adventures, while Milly and Pogo interjected with their own anecdotes from previous escapades. As the sun reached its zenith, the dreams of new adventures danced in their minds. Together, they made plans for the day ahead, knowing that no matter the form they took or the adventures they embarked upon, their friendship would remain unwavering. With a sense of anticipation and joy, Alex, Milly, and Pogo set out to explore the world once more. Hand in slime, they reveled in the beauty of their unique friendship, cherishing every moment and embracing the magic that lay around every corner. Night fell over the sleepy town, casting shadows that danced in the moonlight. As the stars twinkled above, Alex found himself standing beneath his window, gazing out at the darkened sky. Tonight held a special anticipation as his birthday was just a few hours away, and his parents had planned a surprise trip to the theme park. With a mixture of excitement and restlessness coursing through his veins, Alex entered his bedroom, ready to settle down for the night. As he crawled into bed, he couldn’t help but think of the many adventures he would have with Milly and Pogo, knowing that no matter the occasion, their friendship never faltered. Just as he closed his eyes, his door creaked open, and two familiar figures tiptoed into the room. Milly and Pogo, their bodies radiating exhaustion, approached Alex’s bedside, their eyes glimmering with warmth and affection. “We’ve had quite the day, haven’t we?” Milly said with a yawn, her pink slime form appearing slightly less vibrant than usual. “We’re all exhausted, but we HAD to come and wish you a happy birthday eve, Alex.” Pogo nodded in agreement, a faint smile forming on his blue slime face. “You’ve always been there for us, Alex, supporting us and embracing our uniqueness. Tonight, as you drift off to sleep, know that we appreciate you more than words can express.” Alex’s heart swelled with gratitude, his excitement for the next day heightening. He reached out and gently patted Milly’s slime form, then turned his attention to Pogo, playfully flicking a tiny piece of slime off his shoulder. “Thanks, guys,” Alex said, his voice filled with genuine warmth. “Having you as my friends is the greatest gift I could ever ask for. I can’t wait to celebrate together tomorrow and make incredible memories.” With heavy eyelids and exhausted bodies, Milly and Pogo exchanged a tired glance, knowing it was time to recharge their energy. They melted into puddles right before Alex’s eyes, their forms blending with the floor, leaving only their cute little legs sticking out. “Goodnight, Alex,” they chimed in unison, their voices drifting through the room like a lullaby. “Sleep well and dream of the adventures to come. We’ll be here, ready to celebrate your special day.” Alex watched as the puddles shifted and settled, the pink and blue slime creating whimsical patterns on the floor. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder and comfort in their presence, knowing that his friends were always there, even in their puddle forms. As he closed his eyes once more, thoughts of roller coasters, cotton candy, and thrilling rides filled his mind. The anticipation for his birthday grew, creating a buzzing excitement that made it difficult to drift off to sleep. Hours passed, and the room fell into a peaceful silence. Yet, Alex’s mind buzzed with thoughts of the upcoming adventure, causing sleep to elude him. With each passing minute, Alex tossed and turned, his excitement growing in intensity. He tried counting sheep, listening to soft music, even reciting multiplication tables in his mind. But nothing seemed to quiet his racing thoughts. In a final attempt to lull himself to sleep, Alex took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing his mind to find tranquility. Slowly, his thoughts began to settle, replaced by images of laughter, thrilling rides, and the joy of true friendship. Minutes turned into hours as Alex finally drifted off to sleep, a smile spreading across his face. In his dreams, he was surrounded by Milly and Pogo, their vibrant forms morphing into fantastic creatures and exhilarating rides, creating a world of magic and wonder. The morning sun peeked through the curtains, gently caressing Alex’s face as he stirred awake. Stretching and yawning, he couldn’t help but feel a renewed sense of anticipation for the day ahead. Slipping out of bed, Alex hurried downstairs to be greeted by his beaming parents, ready to embark on a day of celebration. But as he walked past the spot where Milly and Pogo had melted into puddles, a wave of gratitude washed over him. Today, he would enjoy every moment at the theme park, cherishing the thrill of each ride and the laughter shared with his friends. And in the midst of the festivities, he would carry the love and warmth of their friendship in his heart, knowing that true companionship was the greatest gift of all. Write when he gets home and finds a suprise party,","output":"After a day filled with the rush of roller coasters, the sweetness of cotton candy, and the vibrant images from the parade, Alex returned home, his heart filled with joy and the echoes of laughter still ringing in his ears. His parents had made sure his birthday had been unforgettable, and the day had been a beautiful blur of fun and excitement. As he opened the front door and stepped into the house, a peculiar hush greeted him. The stillness was unusual, considering the energy of the day. But as he flicked on the light, a cascade of voices suddenly erupted from the living room—“Surprise!” Stunned, Alex felt his mouth drop open. The room burst into life with decorations, colorful balloons, twinkling lights, and a group of smiling faces. Among these familiar friends and family members, he immediately spotted Milly and Pogo, now returned to their humanoid slime forms, beaming brightly from ear to ear. They had transformed the room into a fantastical place, utilizing their shape-shifting abilities to mimic Alex's favorite comic book heroes and cartoon characters. From a corner, his favorite superhero poised in an animated stance, none other than Pogo himself in a perfect rendition, while Milly had transformed part of her gooey substance into a floating cloud of a magical creature, gently floating above the guests. “Happy birthday, Alex!” Milly cheered, her body oscillating with waves of pink excitement. Pogo flashed a thumbs-up with his blue slime hand, adding, “We couldn’t let the day end without another surprise, could we?” Laughter and chatter filled the room as everyone moved in to celebrate, with Alex right in the center, overwhelmed with gratitude and surprise. The tables were laden with a rainbow of snacks and treats, each more tantalizing than the last. At the center of it all, a sizable, brightly iced cake declared 'Happy Birthday Alex,' with candles flickering in anticipation of a wish. As the evening unfolded, Alex felt the warmth of friendship envelop him like a comforting blanket. He joined Milly and Pogo in the festivities, partaking in games, dancing to rhythmic tunes that seemed to set the very air on a joyful bounce, and savoring every piece of his special day.

With one big puff, Alex extinguished the flickering lights atop his cake, opening his eyes to the cheers and applause from everyone in the room. Milly and Pogo rushed forward, their slimy forms enveloping him in a uniquely squishy hug that somehow felt just right. The night went on, with stories exchanged, plans for future escapades discussed, and promises to always remain close, no matter where their adventures might lead them. As guests eventually said their goodbyes and the evening quieted down, Alex, Milly, and Pogo sat together amidst the remnants of the party, a serene contentment settling around them. As they tidied up, putting things back in place and wiping away trails of spilled punch, Alex couldn't help but feel a sense of bittersweet happiness. Tonight was a testament to the beauty of friendship, the joy of surprises, and the cherished memories that would stay with him forever. With the house finally quiet and the hour growing late, Milly and Pogo prepared to take their leave, knowing they had given Alex a birthday to remember. With a final wave and a promise to return for more fun, they slipped out into the night, heading back to their own home. Alex stood in the doorway, watching as their silhouetted forms disappeared into the cool night. As he closed the door, he smiled, certain that the bond he shared with Milly and Pogo was something extraordinary—something not even the stars could contain. Exhausted but filled with an immeasurable sense of joy, Alex returned to his room, the visions of the party still dancing in his mind.

Um certificado wildcard é projetado para ser usado com o domínio principal e todos os subdomínios do primeiro nível associados a ele. Um certificado wildcard é geralmente representado como \`*.seudominio.com\`, onde o asterisco (*) serve como um placeholder para todos os possíveis subdomínios de primeiro nível. Para solicitar um certificado wildcard, você precisará gerar um CSR (Certificate Signing Request) que inclui o nome comum (CN) como \`*.seudominio.com\`. Aqui estão os passos básicos que você normalmente seguirá, independentemente de onde você inicia a solicitação: 1. **Gerar a CSR**: Isso pode ser feito em qualquer servidor que você planeja usar para hospedar conteúdo para seu domínio principal ou subdomínios. Geralmente, a CSR é criada no servidor web onde o certificado será instalado. 2. **Escolher a Autoridade de Certificação (AC)**: Você precisa escolher uma Autoridade de Certificação de sua confiança para emitir seu certificado wildcard. 3. **Validação**: A Autoridade de Certificação precisará validar seu controle sobre o domínio principal. Eles podem fazer isso de várias maneiras, incluindo a verificação de registros DNS ou a resposta a um e-mail enviado para um endereço associado ao domínio principal. 4. **Emissão do Certificado**: Depois de realizar as etapas de validação, a AC emitirá um certificado wildcard para você. 5. **Instalação do Certificado**: Uma vez que você recebeu seu certificado wildcard, você pode instalá-lo em qualquer servidor que hospeda o domínio principal e subdomínios. É importante lembrar que, durante a validação, a Autoridade de Certificação pode exigir acesso ao domínio principal, e não especificamente a um subdomínio. Além disso, a gestão do DNS para o domínio principal geralmente deve ser acessível, pois você pode precisar criar registros específicos (por exemplo, um registro TXT) para provar o controle sobre o domínio durante o processo de verificação. Embora tecnicamente você possa iniciar o processo em qualquer servidor, faz sentido iniciá-lo no servidor que é mais central ou importante para sua infraestrutura de hospedagem, o que muitas vezes será o servidor associado ao domínio principal."},{"instruction":"me ajude com o passo a passo para gerar csr wildcard para o dominio gar.der.mg.gov.br no Linux nginx. me explique de forma facil pq sou leigo","output":"Claro, vamos simplificar o processo para que você possa entender e gerar um CSR (Certificate Signing Request) para o seu domínio wildcard no servidor que executa o NGINX no Linux. Estarei usando comandos genéricos que devem funcionar na maioria das distribuições Linux. Siga estes passos: 1. **Abra o Terminal**: Você provavelmente já sabe como abrir um terminal no seu servidor Linux. Se estiver usando uma interface gráfica, procure por \\"Terminal\\" ou \\"Konsole\\". 2. **Gere a Chave Privada**: Antes de gerar o CSR, você precisa criar uma chave privada. Essa chave será usada para criptografar e descriptografar dados enviados e recebidos pelo seu site. Execute o seguinte comando: \`\`\` openssl genrsa -out wildcard.gar.der.mg.gov.br.key 2048 \`\`\` Isso criará um arquivo chamado \`wildcard.gar.der.mg.gov.br.key\` com uma chave privada de 2048 bits. 3. **Gere o CSR**: Agora que você tem a chave privada, você usará ela para gerar o CSR. Execute este comando: \`\`\` openssl req -new -key wildcard.gar.der.mg.gov.br.key -out wildcard.gar.der.mg.gov.br.csr \`\`\` Você será solicitado a inserir algumas informações: - **Country Name (2 letter code)**: Digite o código do país (por exemplo, BR para Brasil). - **State or Province Name (full name)**: O estado onde sua organização está localizada. - **Locality Name (eg, city)**: A cidade. - **Organization Name (eg, company)**: O nome legal da sua empresa ou organização. - **Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)**: (Opcional) O departamento ou divisão da sua organização. - **Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name)**: Aqui você inserirá o domínio wildcard: \`*.gar.der.mg.gov.br\`. - **Email Address**: Seu endereço de e-mail. - A seguir, você pode pressionar enter para as próximas perguntas adicionais, pois são opcionais. 4. **Verifique o CSR**: Certifique-se de que o CSR foi gerado corretamente verificando o arquivo CSR com o comando: \`\`\` openssl req -text -noout -verify -in wildcard.gar.der.mg.gov.br.csr \`\`\` Isso exibirá o conteúdo do CSR para você. Verifique se todas as informações estão corretas, especialmente o \\"Common Name\\" que deve ser \`*.gar.der.mg.gov.br\`. 5. **Envio para a Autoridade Certificadora**: Agora, você precisa enviar o CSR para uma Autoridade Certificadora (AC) de sua escolha para obter o certificado SSL/TLS. Geralmente, você copia e cola o conteúdo do arquivo CSR em um formulário no site da Autoridade Certificadora durante o processo de aplicação para o certificado. Você pode visualizar o conteúdo do CSR com: \`\`\` cat wildcard.gar.der.mg.gov.br.csr \`\`\` Copie todo o texto que começa com \`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\` e termina com \`-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\`, e cole no formulário da AC. 6. **Guarde a Chave Privada**: É muito importante que você guarde o arquivo da chave privada \`wildcard.gar.der.mg.gov.br.key\` em um local seguro. Você precisará dele para instalar o certificado SSL/TLS quando recebê-lo da AC. Lembre-se de que o processo exato de aplicação para o certificado pode variar dependendo da Autoridade Certificadora escolhida, mas esses são os passos gerais que você precisa seguir para gerar um CSR em um sistema Linux para um certificado wildcard no NGINX. Se você encontrar dificuldades, a Autoridade Certificadora geralmente oferece suporte e pode ajudá-lo durante o processo."},{"instruction":"o que é a challenge password q pediu no csr?","output":"Durante a geração de um CSR (Certificate Signing Request), você pode ser solicitado a inserir uma \\"challenge password\\" (senha de desafio) ou passphrase. Essa senha é um mecanismo de segurança adicional que pode ser usado quando alguém tenta usar o CSR para obter um certificado SSL/TLS. A ideia por trás disso é que, se o CSR caísse em mãos erradas, a pessoa precisaria conhecer a challenge password para prosseguir com a solicitação do certificado, oferecendo assim um nível adicional de proteção. No entanto, na prática, muitas autoridades certificadoras não usam a challenge password para o processo de emissão do certificado. Então, na maioria dos casos, ao ser solicitado a fornecer uma challenge password durante a criação do CSR, você pode simplesmente pressionar Enter para deixar esse campo em branco e não definir uma senha. Se você escolher colocar uma challenge password, guarde-a em um local seguro, mas esteja ciente de que isto pode complicar o processo de instalação do certificado mais tarde, e algumas autoridades certificadoras podem até solicitar que você gere um novo CSR sem a challenge password. Portanto, a menos que haja uma exigência específica da sua organização ou da política de segurança para usar uma challenge password, geralmente é melhor deixar esse campo em branco."},{"instruction":"gerei dois csrs no mesmo servidor, mas só enviei um para a autoridade certificadora. agora chegou o certificado. isso pode dar algum problema, o fato de eu ter dois csrs gerados e duas chaves?","output":"Ter vários CSRs e chaves privadas no mesmo servidor não é, por si só, um problema. O que é fundamental é saber qual chave privada está associada ao CSR que foi enviado para a Autoridade Certificadora (AC) e, posteriormente, ao certificado SSL/TLS que você recebeu. Cada CSR é pareado com uma única chave privada. Quando você gera um CSR usando ferramentas como o OpenSSL, uma nova chave privada é criada, a menos que você especifique explicitamente uma chave privada existente para ser usada. Se você gerou múltiplos CSRs com comandos diferentes, você também terá gerado múltiplas chaves privadas. Aqui está o que você precisa fazer para garantir que tudo funcione corretamente: 1. **Identifique o CSR Correto**: Certifique-se de que você sabe qual CSR foi enviado para a AC. Normalmente, você deve ter um registro disso baseado no nome do arquivo que você usou ou em notas que tenha feito durante o processo de geração. 2. **Associe a Chave Privada Correta**: Localize a chave privada que foi criada ao mesmo tempo que o CSR enviado. Se você não tiver certeza, pode comparar a chave privada com o certificado recebido usando ferramentas de verificação de certificado. 3. **Instale o Certificado**: Quando estiver pronto para instalar o certificado no seu servidor web (por exemplo, NGINX), você precisará fornecer tanto o certificado SSL/TLS que você recebeu da AC quanto a chave privada correspondente. A configuração do NGINX irá referenciar ambos os arquivos. 4. **Armazenamento Seguro**: É crucial armazenar a chave privada em um local seguro, pois ela é necessária para a criptografia SSL/TLS. Se você perder essa chave privada ou ela for comprometida, será necessário gerar um novo CSR e solicitar um novo certificado. 5. **Limpeza**: Depois de ter seu certificado instalado e funcionando, você pode optar por excluir qualquer CSR e chave privada que não esteja usando. No entanto, certifique-se de manter um backup seguro da chave privada que está em uso e do CSR correspondente. Se você tiver problemas com a instalação do certificado, um motivo comum é que a chave privada que você está tentando usar não corresponde ao CSR que foi usado para gerar o certificado. Nesse caso, você precisará encontrar a chave privada certa ou, se isso não for possível, iniciar o processo novamente: gere um novo CSR, envie para a AC e obtenha um novo certificado."},{"instruction":"me ajude com o passo a passo para a instalação desse certificado no linux nginx","output":"Vou guiá-lo no processo de instalação do certificado SSL/TLS (que você recebeu da Autoridade Certificadora) no servidor NGINX em um sistema Linux. Antes de começar o processo, certifique-se de que você tenha os seguintes arquivos: 1. Seu arquivo de certificado (normalmente termina em \`.crt\` ou \`.pem\`). 2. A chave privada gerada quando você criou o CSR (normalmente termina em \`.key\`). 3. Quaisquer certificados intermediários fornecidos pela sua Autoridade Certificadora (AC). Aqui está o processo passo a passo: # Atualize o NGINX para utilizar o Certificado SSL 1. **Transferência dos Arquivos do Certificado**: Copie seu arquivo de certificado e chave privada para o servidor, em um diretório seguro. Por exemplo, você pode querer colocá-los em \`/etc/ssl/certs\` e \`/etc/ssl/private/\` respectivamente (as pastas podem variar baseado na sua distribuição Linux). \`\`\`bash sudo cp /caminho/para/o/seu/certificado.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ sudo cp /caminho/para/a/sua/chave_privada.key /etc/ssl/private/ \`\`\` Se você tem um certificado intermediário (ou bundle), certifique-se de que ele também esteja no servidor. 2. **Backup do Arquivo de Configuração do NGINX**: Antes de fazer alterações no NGINX, é uma boa prática fazer um backup do arquivo de configuração atual. \`\`\`bash sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.backup \`\`\` 3. **Configure o NGINX para Usar o Certificado SSL**: Abra o arquivo de configuração correspondente ao seu site no NGINX, que geralmente está localizado em \`/etc/nginx/sites-available/\`, com o nome do seu domínio. \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/seudominio.conf \`\`\` Localize o servidor que está ouvindo na porta 443 (que é a porta default para HTTPS) e atualize-o com as informações do seu certificado e chave privada. Se não existir uma seção para a porta 443, você precisará criar uma. \`\`\`nginx server { listen 443 ssl; server_name gar.der.mg.gov.br *.gar.der.mg.gov.br; # Certifique-se de que o server_name corresponda ao seu domínio ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/seucertificado.crt; # Caminho para o arquivo do certificado ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/suachaveprivada.key; # Caminho para o arquivo da chave privada # Inclua a configuração do certificado intermediário, se fornecido pela AC ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/intermediario.pem; # Outras configurações SSL desejáveis... ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256...'; ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m; ssl_session_timeout 10m; # Configurações para arquivos estáticos, regras de reescrita, etc. ... } \`\`\` 4. **Verifique a Configuração do NGINX**: Antes de recarregar o serviço NGINX, é importante verificar se há erros de configuração utilizando o seguinte comando: \`\`\`bash sudo nginx -t \`\`\` Se o comando exibir que a sintaxe está OK e que a verificação de configuração também está OK, então sua configuração está livre de erros de sintaxe. 5. **Recarregue o NGINX**: Se a verificação de configuração for bem-sucedida, recarregue o NGINX para aplicar as mudanças. \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl reload nginx \`\`\` Ou, dependendo da sua configuração ou sistema: \`\`\`bash sudo service nginx reload \`\`\` # Teste o Certificado SSL 1. **Verificação Online**: Use ferramentas online como o [SSL Labs' SSL Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) para verificar se o seu SSL está configurado corretamente. 2. **Navegador**: Tente acessar seu site usando \`https://\` na frente do seu domínio. Você não deverá ver nenhum erro de certificado no navegador. Se tudo estiver funcionando como esperado, você instalou com sucesso o seu certificado SSL/TLS no NGINX. Se você encontrar erros, certifique-se de que os caminhos para os arquivos de certificado e chave estão corretos e que você não perdeu nenhum passo no processo de configuração."},{"instruction":"como localizo o csr e a chave privada correspondentes?","output":"Para localizar o CSR (Certificate Signing Request) e a chave privada correspondente em um sistema Linux, você precisa saber onde os arquivos foram salvos quando você os criou. Normalmente, durante a geração do CSR e da chave privada usando o OpenSSL, você especifica o local de salvamento dos arquivos. Vamos revisar como você pode fazer isso: # Localizando o CSR Se você seguiu as convenções de nomenclatura comuns ou as instruções que normalmente são fornecidas quando você cria um CSR, procure por arquivos com extensões \`.csr\` ou \`.pem\`. Você pode usar o comando \`find\` ou \`locate\` para procurar no seu sistema de arquivos. Usando \`find\`: \`\`\`bash sudo find / -type f -name \\"*.csr\\" \`\`\` Isso vai procurar em todo o sistema de arquivos (\`/\`) por arquivos com a extensão \`.csr\`. Usando \`locate\`: Antes de usar o comando \`locate\`, atualize a base de dados do \`locate\`: \`\`\`bash sudo updatedb \`\`\` Em seguida, você pode procurar por arquivos CSR: \`\`\`bash locate *.csr \`\`\` # Localizando a Chave Privada A chave privada geralmente tem a extensão \`.key\`. Novamente, você pode usar o comando \`find\` ou \`locate\` do Linux para procurar a chave privada correspondente ao CSR que você enviou à Autoridade Certificadora. Usando \`find\`: \`\`\`bash sudo find / -type f -name \\"*.key\\" \`\`\` Usando \`locate\`: \`\`\`bash locate *.key \`\`\` Quando você encontrar os arquivos, anote seus caminhos completos, pois você precisará deles para configurar o certificado SSL no seu servidor NGINX. # Verificando a Correspondência entre CSR e Chave Privada Após localizar os arquivos, você pode verificar se uma chave privada e um CSR correspondem, isto é, se foram gerados um para o outro. O CSR contém uma versão pública da chave privada, e você pode comparar o módulo da chave pública (embutido no CSR) com o módulo da chave privada usando estes comandos no terminal: \`\`\`bash openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in caminho_para_a_chave_privada.key | openssl md5 openssl req -noout -modulus -in caminho_para_o_csr.csr | openssl md5 \`\`\` Se os MD5 hashes que os comandos retornam são idênticos, a chave privada e o CSR correspondem. Quando você estiver instalando o certificado em seu servidor NGINX, você usará o CSR correspondente e a chave privada junto com o certificado SSL/TLS que você recebeu da Autoridade Certificadora."},{"instruction":"vamos supor que o csr foi gerado em outro servidor. Eu consigo instalar esse certificado em um servidor onde nao foi gerado o csr?","output":"Sim, você pode instalar um certificado em um servidor diferente de onde o CSR foi gerado, desde que você tenha os seguintes componentes: 1. **O Certificado SSL/TLS**: É o certificado emitido pela Autoridade Certificadora (AC) em resposta ao CSR. Este certificado é um arquivo público que você instalará no servidor. 2. **A Chave Privada Correspondente**: A chave privada que foi usada para gerar o CSR inicial. Esta chave é crucial para a configuração do certificado, porque o servidor a usa para estabelecer uma conexão criptografada. Sem a chave privada original, o certificado é inútil pois o servidor precisa provar que possui a chave privada correspondente ao certificado público. 3. **Certificados Intermediários (se necessário)**: Além do certificado principal, a maioria das Autoridades Certificadoras fornece certificados de cadeia ou intermediários que ajudam navegadores e sistemas de clientes a confiar no certificado principal, ancorando-o em uma AC raiz conhecida. Desde que a chave privada se mantenha segura e privada, você pode tecnicamente instalá-la e usar o certificado SSL/TLS associado em quantos servidores desejar. Isso é útil em ambientes com balanceamento de carga ou clusters de servidores, onde o mesmo certificado e chave privada devem ser usados em todos os servidores para fornecer um site ou serviço unificado e seguro. Ao mover o certificado para outro servidor, você também precisará ajustar as configurações do servidor (como o NGINX, no seu caso) para apontar para os locais corretos do certificado e da chave privada nesse novo sistema.

Чтобы ускорить выполнение, можно рассмотреть следующие стратегии: 1. **Проверка условий:** В вашем коде проверяются условия, которые можно анализировать и, возможно, оптимизировать. Например, вы считаете сумму цифр (cnt) для числа, переводите ее в бинарную форму и затем делаете различные проверки. Некоторые из этих шагов могут быть не нужны для всех чисел, и вы можете предварительно определить критерии, которые позволяют отбросить числа, не выполнимые без полного расчёта. 2. **Избегать строковых операций:** Преобразование чисел в строки, особенно внутри цикла, может снизить производительность. По возможности, стоит минимизировать количество таких операций. 3. **Использование битовых операторов:** Так как операции заключаются в работе с битами, возможно, сделать то же самое с использованием битовых операций, которые намного быстрее. 4. **Оптимизировать алгоритмы поиска и перебора:** Если возможно, используйте более эффективные алгоритмы для поиска или перебора, чтобы уменьшить количество итераций. Однако, в этом случае мы видим, что вы вычисляете бинарную сумму и модифицируете её, но на самом деле, в конечном счете, вы проверяете, превращается ли результат в число 21. Это означает, что вместо перебора всех чисел от 10^8 до 10^9 и выполнения вычислений, мы можем просто проверить, можно ли вообще получить число 21 данным способом, и если да, то сколько таких чисел существует. Оптимизированный алгоритм будет проверять возможность того, что бинарное число соответствуют '10101', что и является двоичным представлением числа 21. Но сначала мы должны понять, какие суммы цифр (\`cnt\`) мы можем получить так, чтобы, добавив к бинарному представлению \`cnt\` строки \`'1'\` и \`'00'\` или \`'10'\` и \`'1'\`, мы получили бы \`10101\`. Таким образом, если \`cnt\` в бинарной форме равен \`101\`, то \`'10' + '101' + '1'\` будет равно \`10101\`, что равно десятичному \`21\`. Сумма цифр, которая приводит к бинарной форме \`101\`, равна \`5\`. Следовательно, нам необходимо лишь подсчитать количество комбинаций чисел от \`10^8\` до \`10^9\`, у которых сумма цифр равна \`5\`. Но так как нет девятизначных чисел, сумма цифр которых равна \`5\` (минимальное девятизначное число - это \`100000000\`, сумма цифр \`1\`), это задача невозможна, и \`cntt\` всегда будет \`0\`. Таким образом, простейшая оптимизация кода: \`\`\`python print(0) \`\`\` Этот вывод основан на логическом рассуждении о вашем коде и цели вычислений.

The cottage is adorned with vintage furniture, featuring delicate lace doilies on the coffee table and antique porcelain teacups displayed on an open shelf. The dress in the girl's hands is reminiscent of a bygone era, with delicate lace trims and a flowing skirt that dances in the gentle breeze coming through an open window. Sunlight filters through the floral patterned curtains, creating a soft and dappled lighting effect. The composition of the image focuses on the girl's face and the dress, capturing the intricate details of both. The photograph is taken with a vintage-inspired polaroid camera, using a medium format lens that adds a dreamy and slightly vintage aesthetic to the image. The style is reminiscent of a nostalgic family photograph, evoking a sense of warmth, innocence, and timeless beauty. --ar 9:16 --v 5.0"},{"instruction":"hello!","output":"Hello!

She holds a beautiful, pale pink lace dress in her small hands, examining it closely. Her face shows a mix of excitement and uncertainty as she contemplates whether or not to wear this dress. The dress is adorned with delicate floral embroidery and has a twirling skirt that would make any little girl feel like a princess. The room is filled with soft, natural light that gently illuminates the scene. The walls are painted a gentle shade of lavender, giving the room a serene and dreamy atmosphere. A plush pink rug covers the wooden floor, adding to the cozy and feminine ambiance. On the wall, there is a whimsical butterfly wallpaper that adds a touch of enchantment to the space. The composition of the image focuses on the little girl, capturing her thoughtful expression and the intricate details of the dress. The mirror reflects her image, creating a sense of depth and adding another layer of storytelling to the scene. The overall mood of the image is one of innocence and contemplation. The viewer can feel the girl's anticipation as she deliberates on her sartorial choice. There is a sense of playfulness and curiosity in the air as she explores her options. For this prompt, the style could be an illustration that captures the sweetness and charm of the moment. The dress could be depicted with intricate details, and the girl's facial expression could be depicted with soft lines and delicate shading. The overall tone of the illustration could be pastel, bringing out the girlishness of the scene. --ar 9:16 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: In a sun-drenched bedroom, a little girl with chubby cheeks and curly hair stands in front of a full-length mirror. She holds a vibrant, rainbow-colored dress adorned with sparkling sequins. The dress shimmers in the sunlight, casting colorful reflections on the walls and floor. The little girl's eyes widen with delight as she admires herself in the mirror, her hands reaching out as if to touch the dress. The room is filled with cheerful energy. The walls are painted a sunny yellow, and there are posters of her favorite cartoon characters adorning the walls. Stuffed animals and toys are scattered across the floor, creating a playful and vibrant environment. Sunlight pours in through the windows, casting long shadows that dance across the room. The composition of the image is centered around the little girl, her reflection in the mirror, and the dazzling dress. The mirror captures her excitement and the dress's vibrant colors, creating a dynamic and joyful composition. The atmosphere of the scene exudes pure happiness and innocence. The viewer can feel the girl's excitement as she imagines herself twirling in the dress. The room is filled with the energy of a child's imagination, and there's a sense of limitless possibilities in the air. For this prompt, a photography style would be suitable to capture the realism and vibrancy of the scene. A wide-angle lens could be used to emphasize the expanse of the room and the girl's small size in comparison. The image could have a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the girl and the dress, creating a dreamy and magical feeling. --ar 16:9 --v 5.6 /imagine prompt: In a dimly lit bedroom, a little girl with tousled black hair stands in front of a cracked and dusty mirror. She clutches a tattered, hand-me-down dress, her fingers nervously tracing the frayed edges. Her eyes are filled with a mixture of longing and resignation as she contemplates whether to wear the dress or not. The dress, although worn, carries a sense of history and beautiful memories. The room is filled with a gloomy atmosphere. The peeling wallpaper reveals faded floral patterns, giving a hint of the room's former glory. The wooden floor creaks with every step, and the faded curtains fail to block the scarce light from outside. Tattered stuffed animals are scattered across the room, abandoned and forgotten. The composition of the image centers around the little girl, the dilapidated mirror, and the worn-out dress. The cracked mirror reflects her fragmented self-image and the dress's faded colors, creating a poignant and introspective composition. The atmosphere of the scene evokes a sense of melancholy and nostalgia. The viewer can feel the girl's inner turmoil as she grapples with her emotions. The room carries a heavy weight of memories and longing for something more. For this prompt, a painting style would be ideal to capture the depth and emotions of the scene. The brushstrokes could be loose and expressive, reflecting the girl's tangled thoughts and the worn-out textures of the room. The colors could be muted and somber, enhancing the melancholic mood of the image. --ar 1:1 --v 5.1 /imagine prompt: In a modern and stylish bedroom, a little girl with long, silky blonde hair stands in front of a floor-to-ceiling mirror. She holds an elegant, silver gown in her delicate hands, inspecting it with a discerning eye. The gown sparkles under the ambient lighting, catching the viewer's attention with its exquisite embroidery and flowing silhouette. The little girl's expression is one of confidence and sophistication, showcasing her budding sense of style. The room is filled with contemporary ambiance. The walls are painted a pale gray, giving a clean and minimalistic backdrop to the scene. A sleek, white desk is adorned with fashion magazines and a stylish mannequin. The floor is covered in plush, white carpeting, adding a touch of luxury. The room features large windows that frame a stunning cityscape outside, creating a juxtaposition of natural beauty and urban vibrancy. The composition of the image highlights the little girl, the mirror, and the glamorous gown. The reflection in the mirror offers a different perspective, showing the viewer her confident and stylish alter ego. The composition utilizes leading lines from the cityscape outside to draw the viewer's gaze towards the girl and the gown. The atmosphere of the scene is modern and aspirational, filled with the buzz of fashion and sophistication. The viewer can feel the girl's determination and her aspirations for elegance and glamour. The room exudes a sense of possibility and limitless potential. For this prompt, a photographic style would best convey the contemporary and fashionable atmosphere of the scene. A medium telephoto lens could be used to compress the composition and enhance the details of the gown. The lighting could be dramatic, with the girl's face softly illuminated and the gown sparkling under spotlights. --ar 16:9 --v 5.3"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “So…while we’re waiting for the others to arrive…is there something you wanted to talk about, Yuri?” Yuri: (nervously twirling a strand of her hair) “Uh, well, yes actually…there’s been something on my mind that I’ve been wanting to discuss. It’s about this my little girl Violet.” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “I’m sure you know about her, right?” Monika: (surprised but supportive) “Oh, Yuri, I had no idea! Congratulations! That’s wonderful news. How far along are you?” Yuri: (blushing and softly) “Thank you, Monika. I’m about seven months along now. It’s been quite a journey so far, but I’m excited and nervous at the same time.” Monika: “I can understand the mix of emotions you must be feeling. Becoming a mother is a big step, but I’m confident you’ll do great. Have you shared the news with anyone else?” Yuri: (look down shyly) “I haven’t told anyone besides my immediate family. I was nervous about discussing it with everyone here, but I trust you all, and I thought it was time to share.” Monika: “I appreciate you opening up to us. We’re like a little family here in the literature club, and it’s important that we support and celebrate each other. Is there anything specific you wanted to discuss or any concerns you have?” Yuri: “No, it’s just…she’s so active today. She just won’t stop kicking, no matter how much I tell her to; even while I’m trying to work on a poem, her constant kicks always make me mess up writing the poem!” Monika: (smiling) “Ah, the joys of motherhood! It sounds like Violet is already making her presence known. It’s completely normal for babies to be active at certain times, especially during the later stages of pregnancy. They’re just exploring their surroundings and getting ready for the outside world.” Yuri: (relieved) “I’m glad to hear that it’s normal. Sometimes, I worry if she’s too active or if there’s something wrong. But hearing that it’s a natural part of the pregnancy puts my mind at ease.” Monika: “Absolutely. However, if you ever have any concerns or notice any unusual patterns in her movements, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor. They can provide you with the reassurance and guidance you need. Remember, they’re there to support you throughout this journey.” Yuri: (nodding, letting her uniform down) “Thank you, Monika. I will definitely keep that in mind. It feels good to have someone to talk to about this. I could really use some advice from experienced mothers like you.” Monika: “Of course, Yuri! I’m more than happy to share my experiences and offer any advice or support you need. And I’m sure Sayori and Natsuki would be thrilled to be a part of this conversation as well. We’re here for you, always.” (Just then, the other members - Sayori, Natsuki, and MC - walk into the clubroom.) Sayori: (cheerfully) “Hey everyone! Sorry we’re late. What’s going on?” Natsuki: (curious) “Yeah, what’s with the serious talk?” Monika: (smiling) “Yuri has some exciting news to share with all of us.” Yuri: (blushing) “Um, yes… I wanted to let everyone know that I’m expecting a baby. Her name is Violet. I’m seven months along.” Sayori: (gasping in excitement) “Oh my gosh, Yuri, that’s amazing! Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” Natsuki: (grinning) “Wow, Yuri, I never would’ve guessed! That’s really great news. Congrats!” MC: (speechless at first, then smiles) “Yuri, that’s incredible! Congratulations! You’re going to make a wonderful mother.” Yuri: (blushing even more) “Thank you, everyone. Your support means a lot to me. I was nervous about sharing the news, but I trust all of you and I’m glad I did.” Monika: “We’re all here for you, Yuri. We want to be a part of this journey with you and support you in any way we can. We’re like a family, and families stick together.” Sayori: “Definitely! We’re going to be the best aunties and uncle to little Violet. We’ll spoil her with love and cuddles!” Natsuki: (grinning mischievously) “And of course, I’ll be in charge of baking all the baby shower cupcakes. I’ll make sure they’re super cute and delicious!” MC: “Yuri, if you ever need anything or have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. We’re all here for you, every step of the way.” Yuri: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone. I feel so lucky to have you all in my life. This means more to me than words can express.” Monika: “Alright, now that the surprise is out, let’s get back to our normal club activities and enjoy our time together. But remember, Yuri, we’re always here for you, no matter what.” (As the literature club continues their activities, the news of Yuri’s pregnancy brings them closer together, strengthening their bond as friends and supporting each other through all the ups and downs of life. And amidst their love for literature, they also find joy in celebrating Yuri’s journey towards motherhood and eagerly await the arrival of little Violet. However, the next day, halfway through the baby shower…) Yuri: (clutching her belly) “OW!!! Oh no…not now, Violet! It’s still too early for you to come out!” Monika: (concerned) “Yuri, are you alright? What’s happening?” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “I…I think I’m having contractions. It shouldn’t be happening yet. I need to get to the hospital.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no! We need to call an ambulance!” MC: “Don’t worry, Yuri. We’ll take care of everything. Hang on, let me call an ambulance right away.” Natsuki: (in a rush) “I’ll go grab some essentials for Yuri and the baby. We need to be prepared.” (As the swift actions commence, Monika stays by Yuri’s side, offering words of comfort and encouragement.) Monika: “Just breathe, Yuri. Stay calm and take deep breaths. We’ll get through this together. The ambulance is on its way, and Natsuki is going to bring everything you need. You’re going to be okay.” Yuri: (teary-eyed) “I never expected this to happen. I’m scared, Monika.” Monika: “I understand, Yuri. It’s okay to be scared, but remember, you’re strong, and you’ve got all of us right here beside you. We won’t let anything happen to you or Violet.” (Minutes go by while waiting for the ambulance, and Yuri’s contractions get rapidly closer and closer together.) Monika: (trying to keep Yuri calm) “Just a little longer, Yuri. The ambulance is on its way. You’re doing great, just keep breathing through the contractions.” Yuri: (gritting her teeth) “I…I can’t…it hurts…” Monika: “I know it hurts, Yuri, but remember, this pain is temporary. Soon you’ll be holding your beautiful daughter in your arms. Just focus on that.” Sayori: (frantically) “The ambulance is almost here, Yuri! Hang in there!” Natsuki: (returning with a bag of essentials) “I got everything, Yuri. We’re ready.” MC: (reassuring) “Yuri, the ambulance is here. They’re going to take care of you and Violet.

Soon you’ll be holding your beautiful daughter in your arms. Just focus on that.” Sayori: (frantically) “The ambulance is almost here, Yuri! Hang in there!” Natsuki: (returning with a bag of essentials) “I got everything, Yuri. We’re ready.” MC: (reassuring) “Yuri, the ambulance is here. They’re going to take care of you and Violet. We’ll be right behind you, okay?” Yuri: (taking a deep breath) “Okay…thank…thank you, everyone.” (Just then, Yuri feels an agonizing pain as her contractions get really close together.) Yuri: (crying out) “Ah! It’s…it’s happening! Violet can’t wait any longer!” Monika: (firmly) “Yuri, listen to me! It’s too dangerous for you to","output":"give birth here. We need to get you to the hospital as soon as possible. The paramedics will take care of you and make sure Violet is safe. Trust in their expertise, Yuri. We'll be right there with you.\\" (Yuri, in immense pain and fear, is carefully lifted onto a stretcher by the paramedics and rushed into the ambulance. Monika, Sayori, Natsuki, and MC follow closely behind.) Monika: (holding Yuri's hand) \\"Stay strong, Yuri. We're right here with you. Just keep breathing and focus on the beautiful outcome awaiting you.\\" Yuri: (through gritted teeth) \\"I-I'll...do my best.\\" (Inside the ambulance, Yuri is quickly assessed, IV lines are inserted, and the paramedics do their best to alleviate her pain. The siren blares as they rush through the streets, towards the hospital.) Sayori: (clasping Yuri's other hand) \\"Hang in there, Yuri! You're doing great! We're all here for you.\\" Natsuki: \\"Don't worry, Yuri. We'll take care of everything here at the baby shower. Just focus on staying strong and bringing Violet into the world.\\" MC: \\"You're not alone in this, Yuri. Remember, we're like family, and family sticks together. We'll support you every step of the way.\\" (The ambulance arrives at the hospital, and Yuri is quickly wheeled inside. The emergency room staff takes over, ensuring Yuri and the baby receive the best care.) Doctor: (emerging from the emergency room) \\"Yuri's in good hands, but she's going to need some time to recover. We'll do everything we can for both her and the baby. Please wait in the waiting room, and we'll keep you updated.\\" (Monika, Sayori, Natsuki, and MC anxiously wait in the crowded hospital waiting room, hoping and praying for Yuri and Violet's safety. After what feels like an eternity, the doctor finally emerges.) Doctor: (smiling) \\"Good news! Yuri did an amazing job, and she gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Both mother and baby are stable, but they'll need some rest. You can see them in a little while.\\" (The group sighs with relief, tears of joy filling their eyes.) Monika: (gratefully) \\"Thank you so much, doctor. We can't wait to meet the newest member of our literature club family.\\" (As the waiting room atmosphere transforms from worry to excitement, the group eagerly prepares to meet little Violet. Finally, they are allowed into the hospital room, where they find Yuri resting, holding her precious baby girl.) Yuri: (awe-struck) \\"Everyone...meet Violet.\\" (Sayori, Natsuki, and MC gather around Yuri, marveling at the tiny, fragile life they helped bring into the world. Their bond as a literature club, now stronger than ever, extends to this new addition, Violet, and they know their journey as friends and supporters has only just begun.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “So…while we’re waiting for the others to arrive…is there something you wanted to talk about, Yuri?” Yuri: (nervously twirling a strand of her hair) “Uh, well, yes actually…there’s been something on my mind that I’ve been wanting to discuss. It’s about this my little girl Violet.” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “I’m sure you know about her, right?” Monika: (surprised but supportive) “Oh, Yuri, I had no idea! Congratulations! That’s wonderful news. How far along are you?” Yuri: (blushing and softly) “Thank you, Monika. I’m about seven months along now. It’s been quite a journey so far, but I’m excited and nervous at the same time.” Monika: “I can understand the mix of emotions you must be feeling. Becoming a mother is a big step, but I’m confident you’ll do great. Have you shared the news with anyone else?” Yuri: (look down shyly) “I haven’t told anyone besides my immediate family. I was nervous about discussing it with everyone here, but I trust you all, and I thought it was time to share.” Monika: “I appreciate you opening up to us. We’re like a little family here in the literature club, and it’s important that we support and celebrate each other. Is there anything specific you wanted to discuss or any concerns you have?” Yuri: “No, it’s just…she’s so active today. She just won’t stop kicking, no matter how much I tell her to; even while I’m trying to work on a poem, her constant kicks always make me mess up writing the poem!” Monika: (smiling) “Ah, the joys of motherhood! It sounds like Violet is already making her presence known. It’s completely normal for babies to be active at certain times, especially during the later stages of pregnancy. They’re just exploring their surroundings and getting ready for the outside world.” Yuri: (relieved) “I’m glad to hear that it’s normal. Sometimes, I worry if she’s too active or if there’s something wrong. But hearing that it’s a natural part of the pregnancy puts my mind at ease.” Monika: “Absolutely. However, if you ever have any concerns or notice any unusual patterns in her movements, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor. They can provide you with the reassurance and guidance you need. Remember, they’re there to support you throughout this journey.” Yuri: (nodding, letting her uniform down) “Thank you, Monika. I will definitely keep that in mind. It feels good to have someone to talk to about this. I could really use some advice from experienced mothers like you.” Monika: “Of course, Yuri! I’m more than happy to share my experiences and offer any advice or support you need. And I’m sure Sayori and Natsuki would be thrilled to be a part of this conversation as well. We’re here for you, always.” (Just then, the other members - Sayori, Natsuki, and MC - walk into the clubroom.) Sayori: (cheerfully) “Hey everyone! Sorry we’re late. What’s going on?” Natsuki: (curious) “Yeah, what’s with the serious talk?” Monika: (smiling) “Yuri has some exciting news to share with all of us.” Yuri: (blushing) “Um, yes… I wanted to let everyone know that I’m expecting a baby. Her name is Violet. I’m seven months along.” Sayori: (gasping in excitement) “Oh my gosh, Yuri, that’s amazing! Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” Natsuki: (grinning) “Wow, Yuri, I never would’ve guessed! That’s really great news. Congrats!” MC: (speechless at first, then smiles) “Yuri, that’s incredible! Congratulations! You’re going to make a wonderful mother.” Yuri: (blushing even more) “Thank you, everyone. Your support means a lot to me. I was nervous about sharing the news, but I trust all of you and I’m glad I did.” Monika: “We’re all here for you, Yuri. We want to be a part of this journey with you and support you in any way we can. We’re like a family, and families stick together.” Sayori: “Definitely! We’re going to be the best aunties and uncle to little Violet. We’ll spoil her with love and cuddles!” Natsuki: (grinning mischievously) “And of course, I’ll be in charge of baking all the baby shower cupcakes. I’ll make sure they’re super cute and delicious!” MC: “Yuri, if you ever need anything or have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. We’re all here for you, every step of the way.” Yuri: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, everyone. I feel so lucky to have you all in my life. This means more to me than words can express.” Monika: “Alright, now that the surprise is out, let’s get back to our normal club activities and enjoy our time together. But remember, Yuri, we’re always here for you, no matter what.” (As the literature club continues their activities, the news of Yuri’s pregnancy brings them closer together, strengthening their bond as friends and supporting each other through all the ups and downs of life. And amidst their love for literature, they also find joy in celebrating Yuri’s journey towards motherhood and eagerly await the arrival of little Violet. However, the next day, halfway through the baby shower…) Yuri: (clutching her belly) “OW!!! Oh no…not now, Violet! It’s still too early for you to come out!” Monika: (concerned) “Yuri, are you alright? What’s happening?” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “I…I think I’m having contractions. It shouldn’t be happening yet. I need to get to the hospital.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no! We need to call an ambulance!” MC: “Don’t worry, Yuri. We’ll take care of everything. Hang on, let me call an ambulance right away.” Natsuki: (in a rush) “I’ll go grab some essentials for Yuri and the baby. We need to be prepared.” (As the swift actions commence, Monika stays by Yuri’s side, offering words of comfort and encouragement.) Monika: “Just breathe, Yuri. Stay calm and take deep breaths. We’ll get through this together. The ambulance is on its way, and Natsuki is going to bring everything you need. You’re going to be okay.” Yuri: (teary-eyed) “I never expected this to happen. I’m scared, Monika.” Monika: “I understand, Yuri. It’s okay to be scared, but remember, you’re strong, and you’ve got all of us right here beside you. We won’t let anything happen to you or Violet.” (Minutes go by while waiting for the ambulance, and Yuri’s contractions get rapidly closer and closer together.) Monika: (trying to keep Yuri calm) “Just a little longer, Yuri. The ambulance is on its way. You’re doing great, just keep breathing through the contractions.” Yuri: (gritting her teeth) “I…I can’t…it hurts…” Monika: “I know it hurts, Yuri, but remember, this pain is temporary.

Let's get you to the ambulance right away. We'll take care of everything. You're not alone, Yuri. We're all here for you.\\" (With everyone's help, Yuri is carefully assisted into the ambulance and taken to the hospital while Monika stays by her side.) (Months later, after a safe delivery…) Monika: (entering the hospital room) \\"Yuri, congratulations! She's absolutely beautiful.\\" Yuri: (exhausted but elated) \\"Thank you, Monika. I can't believe she's finally here. She's perfect.\\" Monika: \\"You did so well, Yuri. I'm incredibly proud of you. And look at Violet, she's already so calm and peaceful.\\" Yuri: (smiling) \\"She takes after her mother, I suppose. I can't wait for her to meet all of you, her amazing aunties and uncle.\\" Monika: \\"We can't wait to shower her with love and cuddles. She's such a lucky little girl to have you as her mother.\\" (As Yuri and Monika cherish the precious bonding moments with baby Violet, they can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of joy and gratitude. With the support of the literature club, Yuri embarks on her new journey of motherhood, filled with love, laughter, and lifelong friendships.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “So…while we’re waiting for the others to arrive…is there something you wanted to talk about, Yuri?” Yuri: (nervously twirling a strand of her hair) “Uh, well, yes actually…there’s been something on my mind that I’ve been wanting to discuss.

Monika: (encouragingly) “You’re doing great, Yuri. Just take things one step at a time. We’re right here with you.” Yuri: (through gritted teeth) “I… I can do this. For Violet.” (Despite the pain and difficulty, they manage to make their way to the ambulance outside the school, where the paramedics are waiting.) Paramedic: (kindly) “Alright, ma’am, let's get you inside. We'll take care of you and your baby. Your friends can ride with us if they'd like.” MC: (firmly) “Thank you, we'd really appreciate that. We want to support Yuri every step of the way.” (They carefully lift Yuri onto a stretcher and secure her inside the ambulance. Monika, MC, and Natsuki climb in as well, making sure to hold onto each other for support. As the ambulance speeds off, Yuri holds onto Monika’s hand tightly.) Yuri: (whispering) “Thank you, Monika. I don’t know what I would do without all of you.” Monika: (squeezing Yuri’s hand back) “You’re not alone, Yuri. We’re here for you, now and always. Just focus on staying calm and getting through these contractions. The paramedics will take care of the rest.” (Inside the ambulance, everyone braces themselves as Yuri’s contractions continue. Monika, MC, and Natsuki stay close to her, offering words of support and encouragement with every painful contraction.) Yuri: (whispering) “I can’t believe this is happening. I was so unprepared…” Monika: (reassuringly) “It’s okay, Yuri. Sometimes life throws us unexpected challenges, but you’re doing an amazing job. You’re stronger than you know, and you’re going to get through this.” MC: (softly) “Yuri, we’re right here with you. We’ll support you through every moment, every step of the way. You’re not alone in this.” Natsuki: (holding Yuri’s hand) “Yuri, I know it’s hard, but try to focus on the fact that you’ll soon be holding Violet in your arms. That’s what all of this pain is for, to bring new life into the world.” Yuri: (taking deep breaths) “You’re right, Natsuki. The pain will be worth it once I get to meet Violet. Thank you, everyone, for being here for me.” (The ambulance speeds through the streets, sirens blaring, as they make their way to the hospital. With each passing minute, Yuri’s contractions become more intense, and she does her best to manage the pain.) Paramedic: “Just a few more minutes, Yuri. We’re almost there. You’re doing great.” Yuri: (gritting her teeth) “I… I can make it. I just… I want my baby to be safe.” (Finally, the ambulance arrives at the hospital, and Yuri is quickly wheeled into the delivery room. The doctors and nurses rush to her side, while Monika, MC, and Natsuki stay close by, waiting anxiously for any updates.) Doctor: (assuringly) “We’ve got everything under control, Yuri. Just keep pushing and listening to our instructions. You’re doing an amazing job.” Yuri: (wincing in pain) “I… I’ll do my best. Please, make sure my baby is safe.” Monika: (holding Yuri’s hand) “Yuri, you’re doing incredible. Just remember to breathe, focus, and listen to the doctors. They know what they’re doing, and everything will be alright.” (With the combined efforts of Yuri’s determination and the medical team’s expertise, the time seems to stretch on endlessly. Eventually, after hours of intense labor, their efforts are rewarded.) Doctor: (smiling) “Yuri, it’s time! One more push, and you’ll meet your beautiful daughter.” Yuri: (exhausted but determined) “Okay… just one more push.” (With all her remaining strength, Yuri pushes with all her might, and the sound of a baby’s cry fills the room.) Doctor: (joyfully) “Congratulations, Yuri! You did it! You have a healthy baby girl!” (Monika, MC, and Natsuki look on in awe and happiness as the doctor carefully places the baby on Yuri’s chest. Yuri stares down at her little girl, tears streaming down her face.) Yuri: (whispering) “Oh, Violet… you’re finally here. You’re so beautiful. I love you.” Monika: (teary-eyed) “She’s perfect, Yuri. You did an amazing job. Welcome to the world, Violet.” MC: (smiling) “Congratulations, Yuri. You’re a mother now. We’re so proud of you.” Natsuki: “Wow, Yuri, you’re a supermom. I can’t wait to spoil little Violet with hugs and cupcakes.” (The room is filled with love and happiness as Yuri holds her newborn daughter for the first time. The journey may have been filled with unexpected challenges, but in the end, Yuri’s strength and the support of her friends brought a beautiful new life into the world. And as the literature club continues their activities, they now have even more reason to cherish each other and celebrate the joys that life brings.)"},{"instruction":"Поправиь ошибки #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> #include \\"mjson.h\\" #define MAX_BUTTONS 6 #define MAX_RELAYS 6 // Глобальный массив, определяющий связи между кнопками и реле. // Например, relay_map[0] будет содержать массив реле, которые переключаются кнопкой 1. int relay_map[MAX_BUTTONS][MAX_RELAYS] = {0}; // Колбэк функция для парсинга карты соответствий для каждой кнопки int button_relay_mapping_callback(const char *str, int len) { double button_idx; if(mjson_get_number(str, len, \\"{button}\\", &button_idx) == 0) { if (button_idx >= 1 && button_idx <= MAX_BUTTONS) { int button_id = button_idx; int len; const char *tmp = NULL; if (mjson_find(str, len, \\"{relays}\\", &tmp, &len) == MJSON_TOK_ARRAY) { //int *relay_states = (int *)user_data; double relay_idx; if(mjson_get_number(str, len, \\"\\", &relay_idx) == 0) { if (relay_idx >= 1 && relay_idx <= MAX_RELAYS) { int relay_id = relay_idx; relay_map[relay_id - 1] = 1; } } } // mjson_find(str, len, \\"{relays}\\", relay_list_callback, &relay_map[button_id - 1]); } } return 0; } void parse_json(const char *json) { // Обработка массива \\"mappings\\" int len; const char *tmp = NULL; // mjson_find(json, strlen(json), \\"{mappings}\\", button_relay_mapping_callback, NULL); int len; const char *tmp = NULL; mjson_find(json, strlen(json), \\"{mappings}\\", &tmp, &len); if(len>0) { button_relay_mapping_callback(tmp, len); } } // Функция, которая манипулирует реле на основе данных от кнопок. void update_relays(int button_states[MAX_BUTTONS], int relay_states[MAX_RELAYS]) { for (int i = 0; i < MAX_BUTTONS; i++) { if (button_states[i] == 1) { // Если кнопка нажата for (int j = 0; j < MAX_RELAYS; j++) { relay_states[j] |= relay_map[i][j]; // Устанавливаем состояние реле в соответствии с картой } } } } int main() { // Пример JSON, который определяет карту соответствий кнопок и реле. const char *json = '\\"{\\"mappings\\":[{\\"button\\":1,\\"relays\\":[1,3]},{\\"button\\":2,\\"relays\\":[2]},{\\"button\\":3,\\"relays\\":[2,4]},{\\"button\\":4,\\"relays\\":[5]},{\\"button\\":5,\\"relays\\":[6]},{\\"button\\":6,\\"relays\\":[1,6]}]}\\"'; // Указывающий на текущее состояние кнопок (0 = не нажата, 1 = нажата). int button_states[MAX_BUTTONS] = {0}; // Указывающий на текущее состояние реле (0 = выкл, 1 = вкл). int relay_states[MAX_RELAYS] = {0}; // Разбирать JSON и заполнять массив связей. parse_json(json); // Пример логики, как мы можем обновлять состояния кнопок и реле (это должен быть ваш реальный код считывания). button_states[0] = 1; // Предположим, что кнопка 1 нажата. button_states[2] = 1; // Предположим, что кнопка 3 нажата. // Обновляем состояния реле на основе состояний кнопок. update_relays(button_states, relay_states); // Выводим состояния реле после обновления (реальный код должен управлять реальными реле). for (int i = 0; i < MAX_RELAYS; i++) { printf(\\"Relay %d state: %dn\\", i + 1, relay_states[i]); } return 0; }","output":"В вашем коде есть несколько проблем и несоответствий.

Похоже, что у нас есть недопонимание относительно сигнатуры коллбэк-функции, используемой в \`mjson_find\`. Сигнатура \`mjson_find\` (на основе ошибки): \`\`\`c int mjson_find(const char *s, int len, const char *jp, const char **, int *); \`\`\` А это означает, что функция не предполагает использование коллбэка напрямую; вместо этого она ищет JSON-токен и помещает в переменную (через указатель) сегмент исходной строки. Давайте исправим ошибки. Функция \`button_relay_mapping_callback\` не должна быть привязана к \`mjson_find\`. Вместо этого, после получения среза JSON представляющего массив \`mappings\`, нужно пройти через этот массив и обработать каждый элемент. Вы можете сделать это с помощью цикла, используя \`mjson_get_number\` и \`mjson_find\` внутри цикла. Исправленный код функции \`parse_json\`: \`\`\`c void parse_json(const char *json) { const char *mappings; int mappings_len; mjson_find(json, strlen(json), \\"{mappings}\\", &mappings, &mappings_len); if (mappings != NULL) { // Итерируем через массив сопоставлений for (int i = 0; i < MAX_BUTTONS; i++) { const char *mapping; int mapping_len; char path[32]; // Строим путь к элементу массива snprintf(path, sizeof(path), \\"[%d]\\", i); if (mjson_find(mappings, mappings_len, path, &mapping, &mapping_len) == MJSON_TOK_OBJECT) { // Теперь 'mapping' указывает на JSON объект, который можно обрабатывать button_relay_mapping_callback(mapping, mapping_len, NULL); } else { // Если не находим объект, предполагаем, что достигнут конец массива break; } } } } \`\`\` Функция \`button_relay_mapping_callback\` должна быть обновлена так, чтобы она не использовала \`mjson_find\` напрямую (если это не необходимо в соответствии с вашей логикой обработки). Можно использовать \`mjson_get_number\` и \`mjson_find\` внутри функции, чтобы обработать отдельный JSON объект (сопоставление кнопки к реле). И уже поскольку ошибки связаны с неверным преобразованием типов данных и сигнатурами функций, необходимо убедиться, что вы используете функции \`mjson\` правильно. Пожалуйста, проверьте документацию к вашей библиотеке \`mjson\`, чтобы понять, как правильно должны задаваться аргументы этих функций. Кроме того, вызов \`mjson_find\` в функции \`parse_json\` теперь соответствует ожидаемым аргументам."},{"instruction":"ты можешь уменьшить и сжать javascript код, куда скинуть файл?","output":"Как AI, я не имею возможности напрямую получать файлы от пользователей.

Monika: (trying to keep Yuri calm) “Just a little longer, Yuri. The ambulance is on its way. You’re doing great, just keep breathing through the contractions.” Yuri: (gritting her teeth) “I…I can’t…it hurts…” Monika: “I know it hurts, Yuri, but remember, this pain is temporary. Soon you’ll be holding your beautiful daughter in your arms. Just focus on that.” Sayori: (frantically) “The ambulance is almost here, Yuri! Hang in there!” Natsuki: (returning with a bag of essentials) “I got everything, Yuri. We’re ready.” MC: (reassuring) “Yuri, the ambulance is here. They’re going to take care of you and Violet. We’ll be right behind you, okay?” Yuri: (taking a deep breath) “Okay…thank…thank you, everyone.” (Just then, Yuri feels an agonizing pain as her contractions get really close together.) Yuri: (crying out) “Ah! It’s…it’s happening! Violet can’t wait any longer!” Monika: (firmly) “Yuri, listen to me! It’s too dangerous if you push here. The ambulance is here, and they have professionals who can help you safely deliver Violet.” Yuri: “But…Violet needs to","output":"come out…” Monika: “I understand, Yuri, but we need to trust the experts. They know how to handle these situations and ensure the safety of both you and Violet. Trust me, you’re in good hands.” Yuri: (nodding through the pain) “O…okay… I trust you, Monika…” (With the help of the paramedics, Yuri is carefully loaded into the ambulance along with Monika and Sayori. Natsuki and MC follow closely behind in another car. Inside the ambulance, the paramedics assess Yuri’s condition and monitor her and the baby’s vital signs.) Monika: (holding Yuri’s hand) “You’re doing great, Yuri. Stay strong. We’re here with you.” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “Please, let Violet be okay…” Paramedic: “We’re doing everything we can to ensure both your safety, Yuri. Just hang in there a little longer.” (After what feels like an eternity, the ambulance arrives at the hospital. Yuri is quickly wheeled into the labor and delivery unit, where a team of doctors and nurses are waiting.) Doctor: “Alright, we’re going to take over from here. We’ll do everything we can to safely deliver your baby. Stay calm and trust us.” (Yuri is prepped for an emergency C-section, and Monika and Sayori anxiously wait outside the operating room.) Sayori: (worried) “I hope Yuri and Violet will be okay…” Monika: (holding Sayori’s hand) “They will be, Sayori. The doctors and nurses are experienced, and they’re doing everything they can. We just have to stay positive and have faith.” (After what feels like an eternity, a nurse emerges from the operating room with a smile on her face.) Nurse: “Congratulations! You have a healthy baby girl. She’s a little premature, but she’s breathing on her own and seems to be doing well.” Monika: (teary-eyed) “Thank goodness. Is Yuri okay?” Nurse: “Yuri is still in recovery, but she’s stable. The doctors will update you soon. In the meantime, would you like to see your beautiful little girl?” Monika: (smiling) “Yes, please.” (As Monika and Sayori enter the neonatal intensive care unit, they see little Violet in an incubator, small and fragile, but surrounded by all the medical care she needs.) Sayori: (whispering) “She’s so tiny…” Monika: (gently placing a hand on the incubator) “We’ll be here for her, just like we were for Yuri. We’ll support her every step of the way, and make sure she grows up healthy and strong.” (As Yuri recovers and little Violet grows stronger day by day, the literature club continues to be a source of unwavering support and love. Together, they navigate the challenges and triumphs of parenthood, knowing that their bond as friends and their shared love for each other and literature will carry them through any storm. And amidst it all, Yuri, Monika, Sayori, Natsuki, and MC cherish the blessing of little Violet and the joy she brings into their lives, forever grateful for the bonds they’ve formed and the love they share in the literature club.)"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Średnia arytmetyczna zestawu liczb: 8, 6, 3, x, 8, x + 4, 4, 6, 7, 8 jest równa 7. Ile wynosi mediana tego zestawu liczb?","output":"Aby obliczyć medianę zestawu liczb, najpierw trzeba uporządkować liczby od najmniejszej do największej, a następnie znaleźć środkowy wyraz (lub średnią dwóch środkowych wyrazów, jeśli liczba wyrazów jest parzysta). Jednak zanim to zrobimy, musimy znaleźć wartość x w zestawie liczb. W treści zadania mamy podaną średnią arytmetyczną dla całego zestawu liczb, która wynosi 7. Skorzystamy z tego, aby obliczyć x. Zestaw liczb to: 8, 6, 3, x, 8, x+4, 4, 6, 7, 8. Z treści zadania wynika, że średnia arytmetyczna tego zestawu liczoności 10 jest równa 7, więc suma wszystkich liczb powinna wynosić 10 * 7 = 70. Dodajmy te liczby razem i rozwiążmy równanie: 8 + 6 + 3 + x + 8 + (x + 4) + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 70 50 + 2x + 4 = 70 2x + 54 = 70 2x = 70 - 54 2x = 16 x = 8 Teraz, gdy znamy wartość x, możemy znaleźć medianę zestawu. Podstawmy wartość x = 8 do zestawu i uporządkujmy liczby: Zestaw liczb: 8, 6, 3, 8, 8, 8+4, 4, 6, 7, 8 Po podstawieniu x: 8, 6, 3, 8, 8, 12, 4, 6, 7, 8 Uporządkujmy liczby od najmniejszej do największej: 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 12 Teraz znajdziemy medianę. Ponieważ mamy parzystą liczbę wyrazów (10), mediana będzie średnią dwóch środkowych wartości, czyli piątej i szóstej liczby po uporządkowaniu: (7 + 8) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5 Mediana tego zestawu liczb wynosi więc 7.5."},{"instruction":"11. Wysokość rombu o boku długości 8 cm i kącie ostrym 60° jest równa:","output":"Wysokość rombu możemy obliczyć jako długość odcinka prostopadłego od jednego z boków rombu do przeciwnego wierzchołka. W przypadku rombu o kącie ostrym 60°, możemy wykorzystać własności trójkąta równobocznego, bo jedna połowa rombu w przekroju wzdłuż wysokości to właśnie taki trójkąt. W trójkącie równobocznym o boku długości 8 cm i kątach 60° przy każdym wierzchołku, wysokość dzieli trójkąt na dwa trójkąty prostokątne, gdzie kąt przy podstawie wynosi właśnie 60°, drugi kąt ostry to 30°, a przeciwprostokątna to bok trójkąta równobocznego. Możemy użyć zależności w trójkącie 30°, 60°, 90°, w którym długość odcinka naprzeciw kąta 30° (nasza wysokość w przekroju rombu) jest równa połowie długości przeciwprostokątnej (czyli jednego z boków rombu). Wzór na wysokość h w trójkącie 30°-60°-90° to: h = a * sin(60°) gdzie: a = długość boku rombu/trójkąta równobocznego (8 cm) sin(60°) = √3 / 2 (dokładna wartość sinusa kąta 60 stopni). Podstawiamy dane: h = 8 * √3 / 2 = 4 * √3 cm Zatem wysokość rombu wynosi 4 * √3 cm, gdzie √3 to pierwiastek kwadratowy z 3, którego przybliżona wartość to około 1.732. Możemy więc też policzyć przybliżoną wartość wysokości mnożąc 4 razy wartość przybliżoną √3: h ≈ 4 * 1.732 ≈ 6.928 cm"},{"instruction":"12. W ostrosłupie prawidłowym trójkątnym krawędź boczna ma 9 cm. Każde dwie krawędzie boczne są prostopadłe. Suma długości wszystkich krawędzi tej bryły jest równa:","output":"Ostrosłup prawidłowy trójkątny ma w podstawie trójkąt równoboczny, a każde dwie krawędzie boczne są prostopadłe, co oznacza, że wysokość ostrosłupa spada dokładnie w punkt przecięcia się wysokości podstawy i jest równa długości krawędzi bocznej. Jeśli krawędź boczna ma 9 cm, i jest ona prostopadła do każdej krawędzi podstawy, to oznacza, że wysokość ostrosłupa (H) to również 9 cm. Ponieważ wszystkie krawędzie boczne są równe i prostopadłe do krawędzi podstawy, ostrosłup ten jest również ostrosłupem trójścianem foremnym (mający wszystkie krawędzie równej długości), a co za tym idzie każda krawędź podstawy (a) równa się krawędzi bocznej, więc a = 9 cm. Ostrosłup trójkątny ma trzy krawędzie podstawy i trzy krawędzie boczne, więc aby obliczyć sumę długości wszystkich krawędzi, należy zsumować długości wszystkich sześciu krawędzi: Suma = 3 * długość krawędzi podstawy + 3 * długość krawędzi bocznej Suma = 3a + 3b gdzie a = b = 9 cm (długość krawędzi podstawy jest równa długości krawędzi bocznej). Zatem: Suma = 3 * 9 cm + 3 * 9 cm Suma = 27 cm + 27 cm Suma = 54 cm Suma długości wszystkich krawędzi tego ostrosłupa prawidłowego trójkątnego wynosi 54 cm."},{"instruction":"14. Liczba y taka, że y = (3-√2)2 + (2√2-3)2, jest liczbą:","output":"Aby rozwiązać to zadanie, musimy dokonać obliczenia dla y, które jest sumą kwadratów dwóch wyrażeń: (3 - √2)² i (2√2 - 3)². Rozpocznijmy od rozwinięcia obu kwadratów korzystając z wzoru skróconego mnożenia (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²: (3 - √2)² = 3² - 2*3*√2 + (√2)² (2√2 - 3)² = (2√2)² - 2*2√2*3 + 3² Teraz rozwińmy poszczególne wyrażenia: (3 - √2)² = 9 - 2*3*√2 + 2 (2√2 - 3)² = 4*2 - 2*2√2*3 + 9 (3 - √2)² = 9 - 6√2 + 2 (2√2 - 3)² = 8 - 12√2 + 9 Teraz możemy dodać te dwa równania: y = (3 - √2)² + (2√2 - 3)² = (9 - 6√2 + 2) + (8 - 12√2 + 9) Dodajmy termy liczbowe i termy z √2 oddzielnie: y = (9 + 2 + 8 + 9) - (6√2 + 12√2) Teraz wykonamy dodawanie: y = 28 - 18√2 W tym momencie zauważmy, że wyrażenia (3 - √2)² i (2√2 - 3)² są kwadratami liczb, które są sobie przeciwne: (3 - √2) = -(2√2 - 3) Kiedy podnosimy liczby przeciwne do kwadratu, rezultaty są takie same, ponieważ minus na kwadrat znika: (3 - √2)² = (-(2√2 - 3))² = (2√2 - 3)² Z tego wynika, że y jest sumą dwóch takich samych wartości, więc: y = 2 * (3 - √2)² Skoro obliczyliśmy, że (3 - √2)² = 9 - 6√2 + 2, to: y = 2 * (9 - 6√2 + 2) Wobec tego możemy obliczyć dokładną wartość y: y = 2 * (11 - 6√2) Pamiętamy, że 11 - 6√2 = 28 - 18√2 (z poprzedniego obliczenia). Zatem y = 2 * (28 - 18√2) = 2*28 - 2*18√2 = 56 - 36√2 Jednak taka wartość y wskazuje, że jest to liczba rzeczywista, więc nie rozwiązujemy dalej do konkretnej liczby, a jedynie stwierdzamy rodzaj liczby.
