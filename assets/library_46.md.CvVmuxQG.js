Choices:  -- Genetic mutations inside a person cause autism;  -- Environmental factors contribute to autism;  -- In the UK, one percent of its population are affected by autism;  -- Autism prevents people from interacting socially and communicating openly; Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist  at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres  - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

If Some pursued strategic planning initiatives., can we conclude that \\"Some of them practiced strategic planning proposals.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the provided information, we can make a sensible inference that if \\"Some pursued strategic planning initiatives,\\" that implies that at least a portion of them practiced strategic planning proposals. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the two statements, let's look closely at their elements and break them down. 1. Strategic planning initiatives: Strategic planning initiatives refer to activities or measures undertaken by an organization or group to develop, prioritize, and execute strategies in line with their mission, vision, goals, and objectives. These initiatives might include formulating action plans, conducting SWOT analyses, setting timelines, aligning resources, monitoring progress, and reassessing targets. In essence, strategic planning initiatives help these entities gain a competitive edge in their respective industries, adapt to changes, and achieve long-term sustainability. 2. Strategic planning proposals: A strategic planning proposal, on the other hand, is a documented plan outlining the details of a specific strategy or approach that an organization or group wishes to implement. It may detail all aforementioned elements like mission, vision, goals, objectives, SWOT analyses, action plans, timelines, resources, and monitoring processes. Proposals involve written documentation of the initiative, which might be presented to stakeholders or team members for review, feedback, and eventual implementation. Considering these definitions and components of strategic planning initiatives and proposals, we can reasonably derive that when \\"Some pursued strategic planning initiatives,\\" this means that a few of those involved not only practiced strategic planning but also likely developed proposals as part of the process. In other words, engaging in strategic planning initiatives typically involves creating proposals that lend clarity, structure, and scope to the overall strategy or approach. It is through these proposals that organizations and groups can effectively communicate their intentions to stakeholders and team members, identify gaps or potential challenges, and collaboratively refine the proposed initiatives. So, when we say, \\"Some of them practiced strategic planning proposals,\\" it implies that a portion of the individuals or organizations mentioned actively engaged in developing, reviewing, and iterating on proposals containing intricate details regarding their specific strategies, goals, and action plans. In conclusion, we can reasonably ascertain that when \\"Some pursued strategic planning initiatives,\\" it indicates that some of them indeed practiced \\"strategic planning proposals\\" as a core component of their strategic planning initiatives. It is important to note that while our inference is based on a logical understanding of the involved concepts, direct confirmation from the source—or additional context and information—would provide further validation to the relationship between the pursuit of strategic planning initiatives and the practice of strategic planning proposals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The process of translating this sentence from Spanish to English involves recognizing the words, understanding the grammatical structure in Spanish, and then formulating an equivalent sentence in English. 1. I start with identifying familiar words: 'ciudadanos' means 'citizens', 'Colombia', 'Ecuador', 'Bolivia', 'Venezuela' are countries that remain the same in English, 'exige' means 'is required', 'certificado' means 'certificate', 'vacuna' means 'vaccine', 'Fiebre Amarilla' means 'Yellow Fever' 'ingresar' means 'to enter', and 'Brasil' means 'Brazil'.      2. The next step is understanding the grammatical structure in Spanish: The sentence structure is subject-verb-object. The subject is 'A los ciudadanos de Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela', the verb is 'se les exige', and the object is 'certificado de vacuna contra la Fiebre Amarilla para ingresar a Brasil'. 3. Then I apply the grammar rules of English to formulate an equivalent sentence: In English, the typical sentence structure is subject-verb-object. So it would be \\"Citizens of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela are required to have a Yellow Fever vaccination certificate to enter Brazil\\". So, the English translation of the Spanish sentence \\"- A los ciudadanos de Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela se les exige certificado de vacuna contra la Fiebre Amarilla para ingresar a Brasil.\\" is \\"Citizens of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela are required to have a Yellow Fever vaccination certificate to enter Brazil\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the word \\"thread\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the context of the word \\"thread\\" in the first sentence. In the first sentence, \\"A thread of smoke climbed upward,\\" the word \\"thread\\" is used to describe the thin, continuous line of smoke rising. In this context, \\"thread\\" signifies a narrow, elongated formation or a wispy strand. Step 2: Analyze the context of the word \\"thread\\" in the second sentence. In the second sentence, \\"From the air the road was a grey thread,\\" the word \\"thread\\" is used to describe the appearance of the road from an aerial perspective. Here, \\"thread\\" signifies a thin, continuous line, similar to a piece of string or yarn, representing the narrow appearance of the road from above. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"thread\\" in both sentences. Comparing the meanings of \\"thread\\" in both sentences, we find that they are quite similar. In both cases, \\"thread\\" is used metaphorically to describe a thin, continuous line or elongated formation. Step 4: Final justification. Yes, the word \\"thread\\" means the same thing in both sentences. Although the subjects it describes are different (smoke and a road), the primary meaning of a thin, continuous formation is consistent in both contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? is actually one of its strengths","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence \\"is actually one of its strengths\\", we need to analyze its tone, context and the words used in the sentence.  Step 1: Understanding the sentence - The sentence in question is missing some information at the beginning, as it starts with \\"is actually\\". This suggests it's part of a larger context, and may be referring to a particular aspect of a movie. The words \\"actually\\" and \\"strengths\\" are key here. \\"Actually\\" could indicate a departure from an expected negative judgement, while \\"strengths\\" is definitely a positive term. Step 2: Analyzing the sentiment - Upon assessing the words used and their connotations, \\"strengths\\" stands out as a positive term. Words like \\"strengths\\" are often used to describe positive attributes or aspects of something. The presence of \\"actually\\" could indicate surprise, as if something was not necessarily expected to be a strength, but upon reflection, it is.  Step 3: Conclusion - We can conclude that the sentiment of the reviewed sentence is positive, because it identifies something as a strength. It could potentially express mild surprise or contradiction to expectation, but the ultimate judgement is positive.

A former member of staff at Next has revealed how 'busloads' of Polish workers started arriving at the company's warehouse in South Elmsall in West Yorkshire earlier this month. It comes as it was revealed more than 218,000 are out of work in the Humber and Yorkshire area with unemployment higher than average. An agency based in Warsaw has claimed Next, run by Conservative peer Lord Wolfson, has already taken on 7,000 staff from Poland. Former worker Paul Crowcroft, 63, a retired cleaner, is reported as saying: 'They would suddenly turn up in busloads, seven coaches at a time. 'They were bringing them in every day by minibus from places like Wakefield and Doncaster. They were happy on the money because they got so little working back home in Poland. 'They were on the minimum wage.' The Eastern European work force was reported to be arriving to fill 'minimum wage' jobs weeks before the posts were advertised in the UK. Next has said it is currently using about 250 Polish staff but that it takes on about 500 a year and that it advertises in Poland first because it is more time consuming to take on workers from abroad. It advertised the jobs in Britain on November 19 and says 100 jobs are still up for grabs at South Elmsall. A spokesman told Mailonline today: 'We simply can't recruit enough people locally.' Polish jobs agency Flamejobs was said to be fielding a hundred calls a day looking for employment at Next. The firm's operations director Arseniusz Wolinski told the Mirror that 350 people were going to work at Next but that it had already sent 7,000. Polish workers started arriving at the company's warehouse in South Elmsall in West Yorkshire earlier this month, it has been claimed. The plant is pictured from above. He said wages on offer were up to four times the amount Polish workers would earn for the same role in their homeland. Buses started arriving at the warehouse earlier this month with Flame arranging trips from Warsaw at £100 a head, the Mirror reports. Its workers are offered places to stay for a weekly rent of up to £65 a week, the newspaper says. It comes just weeks after it was revealed that food manufacturer Greencore Group was reportedly looking to recruit staff from Hungary for a new £35 million factory due to open in Northampton - as few people living in the area have applied for jobs. A Next spokesman today told Mailonline that it needed to boost its recruitment on a temporary basis twice a year - for the Christmas period and for late spring sales. An agency based in Warsaw has claimed Next, run by Conservative peer Lord Wolfson (pictured), has already taken on 7,000 staff from Poland. He said: 'The local area cannot support that level of demand for these short spikes.' He added that Polish and British workers get paid the same, which was minimum wage and which is topped up with a bonus scheme and that recruitment started earlier in Poland as the process for hiring foreign workers took longer. When asked what measures were taken to secure British workers, he said all available jobs were posted on the firm's own website. 'The bottom line is there are still 100 jobs available which have to be filled. 'Next does recruit from Poland and has for years - it cannot fill its vacancies otherwise,' the spokesman said. He added that Flamejobs' estimation of 7,000 staff having been sent over may well have been over the period of a number of years. Nobody was available for comment when Mailonline contacted Flamejobs this morning. David Cameron has signalled he is ready to lead Britain out of the European Union if other EU states set their faces against tough new proposals to cut immigration. In a much-anticipated speech setting out plans to bar EU migrants from claiming welfare for the first four years after arriving in the UK and deport those who do not find jobs within six months, Mr Cameron warned that he will 'rule nothing out' if other European states turn a deaf ear to British concerns. The Prime Minister insisted that he still hopes to be able to recommend an In vote in the referendum on EU membership he has promised for 2017, and said he was 'confident' of success in the renegotiation of the terms of that membership he plans if Conservatives win next year's general election. David Cameron (pictured) has signalled he is ready to lead Britain out of the European Union if other EU states set their faces against tough new proposals to cut immigration. But he left no doubt that he has not ruled out recommending British exit if other EU nations refuse to compromise on the principle of free movement and accept reforms that he said were 'radical' but 'reasonable and fair'. Welfare changes to cut migration from within the EU 'significantly' will be an 'absolute requirement' in the renegotiation, he said. Under his plans, EU jobseekers without an offer of employment will not be allowed to claim the new Universal Credit when they arrive in the UK and will be required to leave if they do not find work within six months. Migrants will be able to claim tax credits and child benefit and to apply for social housing only after four years in the country, and will receive no child benefit or child tax credit for offspring living abroad. 'If you elect me as Prime Minister in May, I will negotiate to reform the European Union, and Britain's relationship with it,' said Mr Cameron. 'This issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation. 'If I succeed, I will, as I have said, campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU. 'If our concerns fall on deaf ears and we cannot put our relationship with the EU on a better footing, then of course I rule nothing out. 'But I am confident that, with goodwill and understanding, we can and will succeed.' David Cameron took a swipe at the Ukip, under Nigel Farage (pictured) warning voters to 'distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions' Speaking in Staffordshire a day after official statistics showed net migration rising to 260,000 over the past year - 16,000 higher than when the coalition Government came to office - Mr Cameron conceded that his policies had 'not been enough' to meet the Conservative target of cutting overall numbers to the tens of thousands by 2015. But he insisted that his reforms had made 'a real difference', cutting numbers of migrants from outside the EU by as much as 50,000. He promised to 'go further' if he wins next year's election, by revoking the licences of colleges whose students overstay visas, extending 'deport first, appeal later' rules and requiring landlords to check tenants' immigration status. 'The ambition remains the right one. But it's clear: it's going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions to get there,' said Mr Cameron. In a clear swipe at the UK Independence Party, which has built support by highlighting public concerns over immigration, the Prime Minister warned voters to 'distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions'. Denouncing as 'appalling' any suggestion of repatriating legal migrants, Mr Cameron said Britain was great 'because of immigration, not in spite of it', and insisted he was proud of the UK's openness to incomers and its creation of 'a successful multi-racial democracy'. The isolationism of those who want to 'pull up the drawbridge' and shut off immigration altogether is 'actually deeply unpatriotic', he said. 'For the sake of British jobs, British livelihoods and British opportunities we must fight this dangerous and misguided view that our nation can withdraw from the world and somehow all will be well,' said Mr Cameron. But he also warned against the 'dangerous' idea that immigration is not a problem and that it is racist to voice anxiety about it. 'We should be clear,' said the Prime Minister. 'It is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country. 'People have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: control. People want Government to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come, both from around the world and from within the European Union. 'They want control over who has the right to receive benefits and what is expected of them in return. They want to know that foreign criminals can be excluded - or if already here, removed. And they want us to manage carefully the pressures on our schools, our hospitals and our housing. 'If we are to maintain this successful open meritocratic democracy we treasure, we have to maintain faith in Government's ability to control the rate at which people come to this country. 'And yet in recent years, it has become clear that successive governments have lacked control. 'People want grip. I get that. And I completely agree.' Mr Cameron's speech in the JCB factory in Rocester was briefly interrupted by an alarm bell, which he joked must have been triggered by a direct link to the European Commission in Brussels.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow. Which of the following colours belong to cool colours? A) Yellow, green. B) Blue, violet. C) Black, blue. D) Brown, white. A:","output":"B) Blue, violet.

Peter's business is threatened by banker Stone unless he takes Taylor's side against \\"squatters\\" settling in the region. The blind and wheelchair-bound Taylor and ambitious daughter Norah are secretly aware that railroad surveyors are considering laying tracks nearby, so they want all the land for themselves.

They take him to see Artemus, who tells a vocally reluctant Bell to take Jeff off to a remote canyon and murder him.

Tim got athlete's food from the gym, but Dan didn't.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which brother did not pick up the fungus from the floor of a public shower?  Hint: Other pathogens spread when they get on objects or surfaces. A fungus may spread in this way. For example, you can pick up the fungus that causes athlete’s foot by wearing shoes that an infected person has worn. You can also pick up this fungus from the floor of a public shower or other damp areas. After acne, athlete’s foot is the most common skin disease in the United States. Therefore, the chance of coming in contact with the fungus in one of these ways is fairly high. Answer:","output":"Dan is the brother who did not pick up the fungus from the floor of a public shower. In the provided information, we are told that both Tim and Dan worked out at the same gym, and Tim got athlete's foot, while Dan did not. Athlete's foot is a common fungal infection usually caused by the growth of various types of fungi, including Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum. These fungi tend to thrive in damp, warm environments, such as public showers, gyms, and locker rooms. The hint provided helps us understand that the fungus that causes athlete's foot can be picked up from various sources. For example, it can be transmitted through wearing shoes that an infected person has worn, from the floor of a public shower, or other damp areas. Given that athlete's foot is the second most common skin disease in the United States, the chances of coming into contact with the fungus in such places are quite high. However, considering the information given, Dan did not contract athlete's foot, even though he was exposed to the same environment at the gym as Tim. This suggests that Dan was either more cautious in his interaction with potential sources of the fungus or perhaps had a natural predisposition to avoid infections from the fungi responsible for athlete's foot. In conclusion, based on the details provided, it is evident that Dan is the brother who did not pick up the fungus from the floor of a public shower or other similar damp areas at the gym."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Columbus Delano, (June 4, 1809 - October 23, 1896) was a lawyer, rancher, banker, statesman and a member of the prominent Delano family. Delano was elected U.S. Congressman from Ohio, serving two full terms and one partial one. Prior to the American Civil War, Delano was a National Republican and then a Whig; as a Whig he was identified with the faction of the party that opposed the spread of slavery into the Western territories, and he became a Republican when the party was founded as the major anti-slavery party after the demise of the Whigs in the 1850s. During Reconstruction Delano advocated federal protection of African-Americans civil rights, and argued that the former Confederate states should be administered by the federal government, but were not part of the United States until they met the requirements for readmission to the Union. On his resignation from Grant's cabinet, Delano returned to Mount Vernon where for the next twenty years he served as president of the First National Bank of Mount Vernon. He was a longtime trustee of Kenyon College, which awarded him the honorary degree of LL.D.; among his charitable and civic donations was his endowment of Kenyon's Delano Hall; this building was in use until it was destroyed by a fire in 1906. His Lakeholm mansion, built in 1871 at the outskirts of Mount Vernon, is now part of Mount Vernon Nazarene University.  On April 3, 1880, John W. Wright, a judge from Indiana, was convicted at trial of having assaulted Delano on a Washington, D.C. street corner on October 12, 1877. Wright, who had been an Indian Agent in the Interior Department while Delano was Secretary, had been convicted of fraud, and blamed Delano. On the day of the assault he was in the company of Walter H. Smith, formerly Solicitor of the Department of the Interior; Wright was accused of provoking a fight by questioning Delano's honesty as Secretary of the Interior, and then striking Delano with his walking stick. Wright claimed that Delano had been verbally harassing him, and that he then felt compelled to defend himself. Delano did not sustain serious injuries; Wright's defense was weakened by witness testimony that after the assault, he claimed credit for it, and stated that he would have continued if passers-by had not intervened. Wright was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined 1,000. On April 8, 1880 President Rutherford B. Hayes pardoned Wright, with his release from custody conditional upon payment of the fine.  On December 3, 1889 Delano was elected President of the National Wool Growers Association, a lobbying group organized to advocate for tariff protection of the national wool industry. The association had been formed in 1865, and became more active in the 1880s as a response to the decline in domestic wool production; wool growers faced increasing overseas competition, and had gone from 50 million sheep producing wool in 1883 to 40 million in 1888.

Continue the following story. The energetic puppy loved the ball but really hated the frisbee, because the  pick from the following. a). ball was fun. b). frisbee was fun.","output":"One sunny day, in a beautiful park where all the colorful flowers were blooming, a cute and energetic puppy was playing with his owner. The puppy had a happy, wagging tail, and with a big smile on his face, he was running all around the park. The puppy’s owner, a nice little boy named Tommy, loved playing with his puppy. He had a red ball which he threw as far as he could, and the ball would bounce and roll away from them. The puppy would chase after the ball as fast as he could run, and when he caught it, he'd bring it back to Tommy with great pride. They played like this over and over again, and they both laughed and had so much fun. One day, Tommy decided to bring a new toy to the park – a bright blue frisbee. He thought his energetic puppy would also love catching the frisbee as much as the ball. Tommy threw the frisbee high in the sky, and the wind would make it float and spin like a flying disc. But to his surprise, the energetic puppy really hated the frisbee! You see, the reason the puppy loved the ball so much was because the ball was easy for him to grab and it bounced in a funny way. The puppy found it exciting to chase after the ball and fetch it for Tommy. The ball was just the right size, and whenever the puppy would bite down on it, it would make a little squeaky noise that made him giggle. But the frisbee was a different story. When the frisbee would fly way up in the air, the puppy didn't know how to catch it properly, and it scared him a little bit. Also, the frisbee didn't bounce like the ball, so it wasn't as much fun for the puppy to chase. The frisbee would sometimes fly too high for him, or it would get caught in trees or bushes. The poor puppy would get confused and sad when he couldn't reach the frisbee. So, Tommy figured out that his energetic puppy loved the ball more than the frisbee because the ball was more fun and easier for him to play with. From that day on, Tommy made sure to always bring the red ball with them to the park, and they had many more happy, playful days together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"In fact, I would advise the rapporteur to remember that information on foodstuffs is primarily intended as a tool for consumers rather than a marketing tool for businesses. The sentence given in Finnish highlights the importance of understanding the primary purpose of information related to foodstuffs. The speaker advises the rapporteur, which is a person responsible for compiling reports on certain topics, to remember that such information serves mainly as a source of knowledge for consumers. This distinction stresses that the primary goal of providing food-related information is to educate and inform individuals who consume these products, rather than solely promoting the interests of businesses and their marketing strategies. It is important to recognize that consumers are increasingly interested in knowing more about the products they purchase, including their nutritional content, origin, and production methods. This interest is driven by various factors, such as health concerns, environmental awareness, and ethical considerations related to the food industry. In this context, the primary objective of providing clear, accurate, and comprehensive information is to empower consumers to make informed choices about the food they consume. This requires public authorities, as well as food producers and retailers, to ensure that the information presented on food labels, websites, and other communication channels is accurate, reliable, and easily comprehensible. At the same time, it is important to distinguish between the legitimate goal of informing consumers and the potential misuse of this information as a marketing tool. While companies must promote their products and compete in the market, their communication strategies should respect the overall purpose of food information. This means avoiding misleading or deceptive claims about health benefits, environmental friendliness, or other factors that could potentially influence consumer choices. To achieve a balance between these competing interests, regulatory frameworks and voluntary initiatives should set clear standards for the presentation and communication of food-related information. These may include rules on the use of logos and symbols, restrictions on certain marketing practices, and guidelines for the substantiation of health and environmental claims. Ultimately, the rapporteur's reminder serves as an important lesson for all stakeholders in the food sector: the primary goal of information on foodstuffs should always be to serve the best interests of consumers. This will not only help consumers make better choices about the products they buy but also contribute to greater transparency and trust within the food industry as a whole."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created.  - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland. It has a roughly south-east to west-north-west orientation, emptying into the Baffin Bay in the northwest.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The oral Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family.

With 1,282 inhabitants in 2013, it is the eleventh-largest town in Greenland, and is home to the country's most northerly ferry terminal. Founded in 1763 as Ûmañak, the town is a hunting and fishing base, with a canning factory and a marble quarry. In 1932 the Universal Greenland-Filmexpedition with director Arnold Fanck realized the film SOS Eisberg near Uummannaq.  - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland.  - Qilakitsoq is an archaeological site on Nuussuaq Peninsula , on the shore of Uummannaq Fjord in northwestern Greenland . Formally a settlement , it is famous for the discovery of eight mummified bodies in 1972 . Four of the mummies are currently on display in the Greenland National Museum .  - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.  - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use.  - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland.   - Nuussuaq Peninsula (old spelling: \\"Nûgssuaq\\") is a large (180x48 km) peninsula in western Greenland.  - Baffin Bay (Inuktitut: \\"Saknirutiak Imanga\\"; ), located between Baffin Island and the southwest coast of Greenland, is a marginal sea of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is connected to the Atlantic via Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic Ocean. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about , known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region. Extent. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin Bay as follows: History. The area of the bay has been inhabited since  . Around  1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the \\"Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage\\". Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East. Henry Hudson and Thomas Button's explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffin's Bay after his pilot William Baffin. Aboard the \\"Discovery\\", Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds after members of his company. By the completion of his 1616 voyage, Baffin held out no hope of an ice-free passage and the area remained unexplored for another two centuries. Over time, his account came to be doubted until it was confirmed by John Ross's 1818 voyage.

In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"sympathetic\\" and \\"stern\\") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY. Q: Context Word: Wrap. A:","output":"Part #1: Context Word to create a pair of sentences. Usage: Context Word: Wrap. The given context word is \\"wrap,\\" which means we need to create a pair of sentences using this keyword. Each sentence should contain a blank. Part #2: Similar sentence pair about two different persons. Usage: PersonX tightly wrapped the present, whereas PersonY threw it together in seconds. In this example, we have created two similar sentences describing PersonX and PersonY's actions related to wrapping a present. They are about two different persons, and their actions are contrasting. Part #3: Different trigger words expressing contrasting attributes. Usage: PersonX meticulously wrapped the gift, showcasing their attention to detail, while PersonY carelessly tossed it in a bag, demonstrating their lack of concern. In this example, the trigger words \\"meticulously\\" and \\"carelessly\\" express contrasting attributes of PersonX and PersonY regarding their approach to wrapping a gift. Part #4: No explicit, offensive, or adult content and no real names. Usage: PersonX always made sure to wrap her sandwich in cling film, whereas PersonY casually tossed her meal into a plastic bag. This sample response does not contain any explicit or offensive content, nor does it contain any real person's name. Part #5: Diversity in twin sentences and word count constraint. Usage: Whenever there was a celebration, PersonX put effort into wrapping the gifts beautifully, while PersonY simply placed them in a gift bag and called it a day. These sentences have a diverse structure, are about gift wrapping, and consist of 17 and 19 words respectively, meeting the word count constraint. Part #6: Overlapping words and context word usage. Usage: PersonX neatly wrapped himself in a blanket, while PersonY left her blanket lying loosely around her. In this response, the overlapping words are \\"blanket,\\" \\"wrapped,\\" \\"PersonX,\\" \\"PersonY,\\" \\"in,\\" \\"while,\\" and \\"around.\\" The context word, \\"wrap,\\" is used, and the sentences have over 70% overlap.

This includes vessel maintenance, crew management, technical services, safety management, regulatory compliance, and various administrative tasks. Vessels can range in size and function, and as such, require a management team with relevant expertise to ensure safe, efficient, and effective operations throughout the vessel's service life. The ship management team plays a crucial role in the following areas: 1. Vessel Maintenance: Regular maintenance and inspections of the vessel are necessary to ensure the ship remains in optimal condition and adheres to industry safety standards. The management team oversees any necessary repairs, upgrades or refits and ensures the vessel's equipment and systems are well-maintained. 2. Crew Management: The ship management team is responsible for recruiting, training, and managing the crew onboard the vessels. They ensure a competent crew is available at all times, overseeing the crew's welfare and dealing with any personnel issues that may arise. 3. Technical Services: A ship management team typically includes technical personnel who are responsible for ensuring the efficient operation of the vessel's mechanical, electrical, and other systems. They also manage fuel consumption, monitor the ship's performance, and implement necessary improvements to ensure optimal performance and minimize operational costs. 4. Safety Management: Maritime safety is of utmost importance, and the ship management team ensures the vessel complies with all safety regulations and guidelines. This includes implementing safety management systems, conducting safety drills and training, and responding to emergencies onboard or at sea. 5. Regulatory Compliance: The management team ensures that the vessel adheres to local and international maritime regulations, securing any required permits and certifications. They also liaise with industry bodies and authorities to ensure compliance and maintain up-to-date records for inspections and audits. 6. Administrative Tasks: The ship management team is responsible for managing the vessel's budget, financial documentation, insurance, and other administrative tasks involved in operating a ship. In conclusion, a ship management team is not only necessary after a ship has been purchased, but they play a vital role in ensuring the ship's safe and efficient operation throughout its service life. Without a competent ship management team, the owner may face operational inefficiencies, safety risks, and even legal non-compliance, all of which can have significant financial and reputational consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tim and his parents had already decided on their favorite Mexican restaurant and that was fine with me; the dim lighting would hide the rising flush of my cheeks, and if anyone noticed, I could blame it on the peppers. With proper table manners I managed to survive halfway through dinner without making any unforgivable mistakes. However, in the midst of conversation I reached for my iced tea, raised the glass to my lips and very quickly discovered I had picked up the wrong glass. I quickly lowered the glass and set it back but it was too late; I had burnt my eyebrows, the hair in my nose, and curl over my forehead! I looked up slowly, praying no one had seen me, but all eyes at the table had seen and each face stared at me in shocked silence. Excusing myself, I ran to the restroom. I would have hidden there forever but I'd barely gotten in the door when Tim's mother arrived. \\" Ah, honey,\\" she said, holding out her arms to me. \\" Everything will be just fine.\\" Tim and I eventually married.

During the 1950s more dangerous criminal elements took advantage of Galveston's lax law enforcement and the absence of the Maceo brothers' influence. Non-vice crime increased in the city. The New Orleans crime syndicate, headed by Carlos Marcello, ran guns to Cuba through the island. Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas. In 1953, the police commissioner, Walter L. Johnston, under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease, shut down the red-light district. However, the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough, a supporter of regulated vice, led to the district's being re-established in 1955. That year Galveston was labeled by national anti-prostitution groups as the \\"worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned\\".Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island's illegal activities once and for all. One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000 slot machines were destroyed.  Though officials said they destroyed all of the city's gaming equipment, some locals including R.S. Maceo, nephew of Sam and Rose, claimed that most of the equipment was shipped to Las Vegas before authorities ever discovered it.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What year was the band that released the album Out of Time inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ?  R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors.

Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner.  I do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!!  But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit.  Let me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us. Now as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky.  I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket.  The fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably.  Ok now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment? Pick from: [-] negative. [-] positive.","output":"This review can be described as [+] positive in terms of sentiment. The reviewer shares their love for Jewish deli food and seems to have thoroughly enjoyed their experience at the Montreal restaurant.

Since sentiment analysis is subjective, different people might perceive the tweet in slightly different ways; however, I will provide a detailed interpretation based on general linguistic and emotional cues present within the tweet. The tweet directed to \\"@holly_anne\\" reads, \\"are you better yet.\\" The most apparent sentiment of this tweet can be interpreted as a show of concern, empathy, or inquiry towards the well-being of the individual with the username \\"holly_anne.\\" Considering the phrase \\"better yet,\\" it is likely that \\"holly_anne\\" was experiencing some form of hardship, illness, or difficult situation and the tweeter assumes progress has been made or is interested in knowing if there has been any improvement. There is no explicit use of emoticons, emojis, or other visual cues to hint at the tweeter's tone of voice, but the phrasing gives clues to the sentiment. In this case, the lack of those visual cues could convey a more serious and straightforward intention behind the question. Moreover, the informality of the tweet might suggest a level of familiarity or friendliness between the sender and the receiver. The lack of punctuation at the end of the tweet can denote a casual tone, inviting an informal response. While the tweet has a primarily concerned and empathetic sentiment, the direct and concise nature of the message can also potentially come across as impatient or even demanding, as if the sender is expecting an update or they're inquiring with a hint of frustration. However, it ultimately depends on the specific relationship and shared history between the tweeter and \\"@holly_anne,\\" as well as their communication style and patterns. In conclusion, a possible description of the sentiment of this tweet would be that it embodies a combination of concern, empathy, inquiry, and familiarity towards \\"@holly_anne\\" and their well-being or situation.

For automobile enthusiasts of a certain age, a first glance at the grille and flowing lines of a 2015 Volvo XC90 luxury sport utility may evoke vague, pleasant recollections of a classic sports car from the 1960s, the Volvo P1800. In an era when Scandinavian furniture was all the rage, the P1800 came to epitomize Swedish automotive design. The P1800 sports coupe helped to usher in a parade of Volvo models in the U.S., sedans known for safety, practicality and ruggedness. The brand gained worldwide renown, attracting the Ford Motor Co. F to acquire Volvo Cars in 2000 for 6.45 billion. Fallout from the global financial crisis forced Ford’s sale of Volvo to the Geeley Group of China for 1.8 billion. Five years after Geeley’s purchase, the XC90 today represents Volvo’s determination to recapture the brand’s American mojo, where its roughly 300 retail dealers have been nearly despondent as they wait for new models. Consumers seeking a rugged, sensible car from abroad increasingly have chosen Subarus, which (incredibly) today outsell Volvo 10-to-1 in the U.S. Last year, U.S. sales were about 57,000 units, down almost 8% from a year earlier in a market that was up nearly 6% from 2013. At its peak in 2004, the company sold about 139,000 cars in the U.S. By 2020, Volvo hopes to sell 800,000 cars globally, compared with 466,000 last year, a record high driven by sales in China. “A lot of people grew up in Volvos. We’re not a damaged brand,” said Bodil Erikson, a Swede who is chief marketing officer in the U.S. “We’ve fallen out of mind.” Geeley, a maker of cars and other goods, has put its financial muscle behind an 11 billion capital program to launch a new era of vehicles, starting with the large SUV built on an architecture it calls SPA, which stands for scalable product architecture. The first generation XC90, introduced in 2002, was a phenomenal success story for Volvo. Ford, in fact, admired the vehicle’s engineering so much that it borrowed XC90’s mechanical underpinnings to create its Taurus large sedan, which uses Volvo-designed innards to this day. The new XC90 was designed to convey “Scandinavian authority” and “understated confidence,” according to its chief designer Tisha Johnson. The selection of materials and the shaping of surfaces throughout the car were inspired by objects like the Wegner lounge chair and Orrefors crystal vases. In three versions, starting in price at about 49,000 and ranging up to about 55,000, XC90 will contend against large luxury SUVs like the Audi Q7, BMW X5, Acura MDX, Mercedes-Benz M Class and Infiniti QX60. Volvo executives report the automaker will replace seven of its sedans, station wagons and crossovers during the next four years, a promise that should warm the hearts of its dealers. Because the Volvo brand has shrunk in size over the last decade, it can’t match competitors with advertising buys such as a multi-million dollar commercial during the Super Bowl. Grey Group, its agency, instead devised a guerilla Twitter campaign during this year’s game and another tied to Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony. More advertising will come toward summer, when the cars arrive at dealerships. The automaker’s Chinese owners are staying quietly in the background, at least for the moment, allowing Volvo’s Swedish heritage and image to shine. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. Volvo aims to recapture its American market presence with the launch of the 2015 XC90 luxury sport utility vehicle. 2.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

The people in this city played many games, and sometimes, they won by earning many points! To find out how many points Houston won by, we would need to learn the details of the specific game. Now, points are like stars that a team collects during the game. The more shiny stars they get, the brighter and happier they become. If Houston won the game, that means they got more stars than the other team. Here's how we can find out how many points Houston won by: First, we need to know how many points Houston earned during the game. Imagine they collected 100 shiny stars. Second, we have to know how many points the other team earned. Maybe they collected 90 shiny stars. Now, to see how many more stars Houston got than the other team, you subtract the smaller number of stars from the larger number of stars. In this example, we would count the difference between Houston's 100 stars and the other team's 90 stars. So, let's subtract: 100 stars (Houston's) - 90 stars (the other team's) = 10 stars And there we have it! Houston won by 10 whole shiny points, or stars. Remember, this is just a made-up example.

Needless to say, it was too hot to do anything outside. But it was also scorching in our apartment. This was 1962, and I would not live in a place with an air conditioner for another ten years. So my brother and I decided to leave the apartment to find someplace indoors. He suggested we could see a movie. It was a brilliant plan. Movie theaters were one of the few places you could sit all day and--most important --sit in air conditioning. In those days, you could buy one ticket and sit through two movies. Then, the theater would show the same two movies again. If you wanted to, you could sit through them twice. Most people did not do that, but the manager at our theater. Mr. Bellow did not mind if you did. That particular day, my brother and I sat through both movies twice, trying to escape the heat. We bought three bags of popcorn and three sodas each. Then, we sat and watched The Music Man followed by The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. We'd already seen the second movie once before. _ had been at the theater since January, because Mr. Bellow loved anything with John Wayne in it. We left the theater around 8, just before the evening shows began. But we returned the next day and saw the same two movies again, twice more. And we did it the next day too. Finally, on the fourth day, the heat wave broke. Still, to this day I can sing half the songs in The Music Man and recite half of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart's dialogue from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance!

The president is right. History is not on his side. Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats. The losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year. Trump's approval rating has ticked up in recent weeks, but the average has him just above 40 percent, not a strong position with a midterm looming. \\"You know, you have a very unpopular president.

In 1942, Nazi Germany attempts to bring neutral Turkey into the war on its side by staging an assassination attempt on Franz von Papen, its own ambassador to the country. Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia.  Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance. Joe obliges, but when he later examines the envelope, he finds maps of Turkey with writing on them. When they stop in Ankara, he goes to her hotel to return her property, only to find she has been fatally wounded. He hides when someone else approaches the room.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. \\"Rosenstrasse,\\" which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by, of all peoples, generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street. Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II. The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance, Ruth not only \\"sits shivah\\" (the Jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. Her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting, handsome Luis. Stay tuned. A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, in whole but usually in part, escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. So Hannah, having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not, this would have been a very short film. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story, the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital. The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use \\"Israel\\" as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add \\"Sarah\\" to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false \\"Israel\\" included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation). While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to \\"Aryans\\" were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity. The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up, some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them (\\"Jew-loving whore\\" being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember, Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde.  Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men, and a handful of women, are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story). Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly, one gathers, begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued, the child whose mother was murdered. The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943, a set, and the street today in a bustling, rebuilt, unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times's critic appears not to know that). Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper, to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim \\"copy and paste\\" school of Teutonic nastiness. But that's understandable. The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on. The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was \\"a ray of light\\" in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So \\"a ray of light\\" it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. And always will. 9/10 How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive, with the reviewer giving the film a 9/10 rating.

Article: Disgraced former Penn State President Graham Spanier has sent a new letter to the Penn State trustees in which he expresses \\"great regret about the situation that the entire university finds itself in.\\"      But Spanier, in his three-page letter dated today, also seeks to make clear to the board -- which quickly ousted him after Jerry Sandusky's arrest last November -- that he believes they are getting a biased view from the Freeh Report of his involvement in the scandal.      A copy of the letter was obtained this afternoon by The Patriot-News.      View full size      In it, Spanier continued to maintain, as he did in his grand jury testimony in early 2011, that he \\"never heard a word about abusive or sexual behavior\\" in the limited, mostly second-hand reports he received about Sandusky.      In 2001, Spanier said, his agreement with a plan to handle a shower-room allegation against the former defensive coordinator came only after receiving reports from Athletic Director Tim Curley and then-Senior Vice President for Business and Finance about \\"horseplay,\\" with no mention of sex.      The Freeh report, commissioned by trustees to look at how the allegations against Sandusky were handled internally over time, paints a different picture, accusing Spanier of working with Curley, Schultz and former head football coach Joe Paterno to \\"actively conceal\\" accusations about Sandusky from authorities.      \\"It is unfathomable and illogical to think ... someone who experienced massive and persistent abuse as a child,\\" Spanier said in a reference to himself, \\"... would have knowingly turned a blind eye to a report of child abuse.\\"      Unlike Curley and Schultz, who face perjury charges for allegedly lying to the grand jury about what they knew of and did about allegations againt Sandusky, Spanier has not been charged.      But the investigation is continuing and it is widely believed Attorney General Linda Kelly's investigators have been taking a harder look at Spanier's role since receiving e-mails indicating he was involved in the decision to keep the 2001 incident from police.      In those one of those e-mails, Spanier endorsed that move, adding that the only problem would be if Sandusky did not cooperate with the university's guidance and it would then become vulnerable for not reporting.      Sandusky went on to molest multiple victims in the years that followed. He was convicted on 45 criminal counts after a trial in Centre County last month and is awaiting sentencing.      Spanier, in his letter, also attacked the Freeh report for misrepresenting his handling of the grand jury probe and not giving the full board more comprehensive briefings as it progressed.      Spanier said he \\"was guided by and followed all instructions from the University's General Counsel,\\" former state Supreme Court justice and former Penn State trustee Cynthia Baldwin at the time.      Baldwin, he said, told him three or four times that \\"there appeared to be no issue for the university\\" from the investigation.      Spanier closed by asking for a chance to meet with the board or any designated representatives to answer any other questions or concerns they might have.             ||||| FILE - In this March 7, 2007, file photo, Penn State University president Graham Spanier speaks during a news conference at the Penn State Milton S.

Information:  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014.  - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.  - Godspell is a musical by Stephen Schwartz and a book by John-Michael Tebelak. It opened off Broadway on May 17, 1971, and has played in various touring companies and revivals many times since, including a 2011 revival which played on Broadway from October 13, 2011, to June 24, 2012. Several cast albums have been released over the years and one of its songs, \\"Day by Day\\" from the original cast album, reached #13 on the \\"Billboard\\" pop singles chart in the summer of 1972.  - John-Michael Tebelak (September 17, 1949  April 2, 1985) was an American playwright and director. He was most famous for creating the musical \\"Godspell\\" based on the Gospel of Saint Matthew. The music was by Stephen Schwartz. Some of the lyrics are original, with others taken from either the Bible or traditional hymns in the 1940 Episcopal Hymnal.  - Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation. The term \\"folk rock\\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued.  - The Innocence Mission ( stylized as the innocence mission on all releases since 1995 ) is an American folk rock band centered on husband - and - wife singer - songwriters Karen and Don Peris . The original group , including Mike Bitts ( bass guitar ) and Steve Brown ( drums ) , was formed in Lancaster , Pennsylvania in the early 1980s when the members met during a Catholic school production of Godspell . Although all members of the band have contributed musically , Karen Peris is its principal writer .  - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus.  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.  - West Virginia is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States. It is bordered by Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Ohio to the northwest, Pennsylvania to the north (and, slightly, east), and Maryland to the northeast. West Virginia is the 41st largest by area, the 38th most populous, and has the second lowest household income of the 50 United States. The capital and largest city is Charleston.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - The Byrds were an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) remaining the sole consistent member, until the group disbanded in 1973. Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Rolling Stones for a short period in late 1965, the Byrds are today considered by critics to be one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Initially, they pioneered the musical genre of folk rock, melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music. As the 1960s progressed, the band was also influential in originating psychedelic rock, raga rock, and country rock.    What is the relationship between 'the innocence mission' and '1985'?

Article: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollyhood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much! Question: What is the main topic of the reading? Options: A: famous stars in Bollywood B: how Hollywood movies are made C: the differences between two movie industries D: the history of movie-making in India Answer:","output":"C: the differences between two movie industries"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Raul Fernando Gomez Circunegui, 58, got lost in snowstorms after his motorbike broke down.      He was found in a mountain shelter at an altitude of more than 2,800m (9,300ft) by Argentine officials.      Mr Gomez survived by eating leftover supplies in the shelter and whatever else he could catch, including rats.      He has been taken to hospital in an emaciated and dehydrated state, but is expected to make a full recovery.      Argentine officials from the north-western province of San Juan stumbled across Mr Gomez after arriving in the area near the shelter by helicopter to record snow levels.      Weather conditions in the Andes can be some of the harshest in the world      An enfeebled Mr Gomez was able to open the shelter's door and alert the crew to his presence.      \\"The truth is that this is a miracle. We still can't believe it,\\" San Juan Governor Jose Luis Gioja told the local Diario de Cuyo newspaper.      \\"We let him talk to his wife, his mother and his daughter...

A doctor who examined him was surprised by his resilience, according to Uruguayan newspaper El Pais.      \\"He's a patient with high blood pressure, a history of smoking and signs of undernourishment,\\" the doctor was quoted as saying. \\"But he's going to be fine and in a few days we're going to discharge him.\\"      Members of a Uruguayan rugby team famously survived sub-zero Andean temperatures for 72 days in 1972 by eating the bodies of other plane crash victims.

Write some highlights for the following article: A mother has a rare brain disorder which she claims causes her to take off her clothes in public – and says the condition is 'ruining her life'. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day, each lasting up to half an hour. She blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side-effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear. They also sometimes leave her incontinent, meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly. Mrs Lyon says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers, it is highly debilitating as she cannot hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small, non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day. These episodes can cause her to strip off in public, she claims. Mrs Lyon has a hypothalamic hamartoma, which is thought to affect only one in a million people. She says the condition is 'ruining her life' as she hates having seizures in front of her children: Megan, 6 (left) and Kieran, 9 (right) and feels as though she can't always look after them properly. She relies on a carer to take her two children Kieran, nine, and Megan, six, to school and is heavily dependent on her husband David, 43, a shoe salesman. Mrs Lyon, of Northampton, said she doesn't strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month. She said: 'I have no idea what I'm doing during the fits - it's almost like I'm sleep-walking and it's led to some really embarrassing episodes. 'Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisles. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.' She added: 'Because I black out during the seizures I can never remember what happened - I simply come round with no clothes on. 'I'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life. 'The same thing happened at a taxi rank. 'It's mortifying and frankly I'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.' Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. Medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29. The condition is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss. It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people. At 17, she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Now Mrs Lyon has five or more episodes a day. While some last for a few seconds, others can go on for half an hour. When she was 17, Mrs Lyons had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, behavioural problems, blackouts and memory loss. The condition is thought to affect only one  in a million people. HH is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. Some individuals can go years with very few symptoms, or ones that are so mild, they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals. However, for most people with HH, the most common symptoms are frequent daily 'gelastic' seizures (seizures which involve spontaneous laughing, giggling or smirking) or 'dacrystic' seizures (which involve crying or grunting). People with HH report behavioural difficulties, and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder, depression, paranoid disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some  have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts, aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional-defiant disorder. These angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages. What makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant, they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down. Sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over. These symptoms often start early in life – for some, they become apparent shortly after birth, but are frequently misdiagnosed. They are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine. Source: Hope for HH. Mrs Lyon said: 'It's terrifying - not to mention dangerous - living like this. 'Once, I got onto a bus during a blackout and when I came round I had no idea where I was. 'I also am often incontinent when I have my seizures, which is excruciating. I had to wear adult nappies for a while. 'I can't go out for a night out with friends because I'm terrified I might have an episode. 'It would be really embarrassing to have to go home early because I wet myself or started stripping at the bar.' Mrs Lyon also suffers from embarrassing episodes at home. She said: 'A few months ago I was folding my kids' washing when I had one of my episodes. 'I don't know what I did while I was having my fit but when I came around I had one leg in a pair of my eight-year-old daughter's knickers. 'I frequently walk from room to room in nothing but my underwear with no idea what's going on.' She added: 'My children are more like carers than carefree kids - they've had to grow up so quickly. 'When I start having a fit I usually start laughing. 'When my son sees me laughing he says \\"Mummy's having one of her turns,\\" and he records it on his phone so I can see what happened. 'It is horrible to watch, you can see I'm not quite right. 'I hate to think that my kids have to watch their mother having seizures multiple times a day. 'My devoted husband is incredibly understanding but my condition puts a constant strain on our marriage. 'To him, it must be like living with three children. 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.' Because of the debilitating condition, Mrs Lyon also struggles to hold down a job. The seizures often leave Mrs Lyon incontinent, and she says they are dangerous. Once she had a seizure and got onto a bus and when she 'woke up' she had no idea where she was. She is pictured undergoing tests in hospital with Vivian Gattoc, who founded the Hope for Hypothalamic Hamartoma charity. She says the condition means her children  are 'more like carers than carefree kids'. She said: 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.'

Research shows that if high schools provide career-related courses,students are likely to get higher earnings in later years.The students are more likely to stay in school,graduate and go on to higher education. In Germany,students as young as 13 and 14 are expected to do internships.German companies work with schools to make sure that young people get the education they need for future employment. But in America, education reform programs focus on how well students do in exams instead of bringing them into contact with the working world.Harvard Education school professor Robert Schwartz has criticized education reformers for trying to place all graduates directly on the four-year college track.Schwartz argued that this approach leaves the country's most vulnerable kids with no jobs and no skills. Schwartz believed that the best career programs encourage kids to go for higher education while also teaching them valuable practical skills at high sch001.James Madison High School in New York,for example,encourages students to choose classes on career--based courses.The school then helps them gain on--the-job experience in those fields while they're still at high school. However,even for teens whose schools encourage them to connect with work,the job market is daunting.In the US,unemployment rates for 16-to 19-year-olds are above 20 percent for the third summer in a row. \\"The risk is that if teenagers miss out on the Summer job experience,they become part of this generation of teens who had trouble in landing a job,\\"said Michael,a researcher in the US.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Well, imagine having a toy box and there are certain toys you're told to play with only when you're older. In India, the concept of premarital sex is kind of like these special toys.  India has a really old culture and tradition that values certain beliefs, one of them being that sexual intercourse should only happen after you're married. It's like waiting to play with those special toys till you're grown up enough.  This is seen as a form of respect and value towards the future partner as well as carrying forward the cultural norms. This is why premarital sex is seen as a taboo, or in simple words, something that's avoided by people. And about if premarital sex is wrong in India. This is sort of like asking if not sharing your candy is wrong. Well, some people might think it is because it's nice to share, but others might not, because it's your candy after all. Similarly, whether premarital sex is \\"wrong\\" or right is subjective, it depends on the person's own beliefs and values. The two questions you asked are very related but not exactly the same. The first one is about why something is avoided or not talked about a lot (taboo). The second question is about whether that thing is right or wrong, which, like with our candy example, can depend a lot on who you ask.

Susan Collins (R-Maine). After Kate McKinnon’s Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) praised Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) for having “scored in his own goal,” Collins addressed her own decision to vote in favor of Kavanaugh.      “The last thing I wanted was to make this about me — that’s why I told everyone to tune in at 3 p.m. so I could tell all my female supporters, ‘Psych!' \\" she said, referring to the real-life Collins’s lengthy Senate floor speech on Friday that caused the crash of a website that was set up to fund her future opponent, probably due to an influx of support. \\"Listen, I think it’s important to believe women until it’s time to stop.”      \\"We couldn't have done it without Susan Collins.\\" — Sen.

Every weekend, weather permitting, Tanya spends hours tending to her beautiful garden. She feels a deep connection to the plants and enjoys nurturing them. On the other hand, Katrina prefers to spend her free time indoors, engaging in her own passions such as painting and cooking. Step 1: Describe both characters' motivations and feelings. It's essential to establish the contrasting motivations and feelings of Tanya and Katrina. Tanya views gardening as a fulfilling and soothing hobby, while Katrina doesn't share the same sentiment, instead engaging herself in indoor activities. Step 2: Present a situation. One sunny Saturday morning, Tanya was in her backyard carefully planting some new spring flowers. She loved the vibrant colors and the sweet fragrance they brought to her garden. Meanwhile, inside their house, Katrina was busy in the kitchen trying out a new recipe for homemade pasta sauce. She had been perfecting her culinary skills over the last few months and was excited to try out some new techniques she had recently learned. Step 3: Add a narrative complication. To Tanya's surprise, she came across a mysterious plant growing near the back fence of her garden. It was tall with large, unusual leaves. Curiosity piqued, Tanya decided to take care of the plant and see if she could figure out its identity. Meanwhile, just as Katrina had finished grinding some fresh tomatoes and adding spices, she heard a commotion at the back door. She quickly went to investigate, finding Tanya struggling with the odd-looking plant. Step 4: Build a dialogue between characters. \\"Katrina! Look at this fascinating plant I found in the garden! I've never seen anything like it, have you?\\", Tanya said excitedly, trying to hold up the large plant. \\"I must say, I'm not quite as well-versed in the plants as you are,\\" Katrina replied, amused. \\"But that does look quite peculiar. What do you think it is?\\" \\"I'm not sure yet, but I'm determined to find out. It will be a fun little project for me!\\", Tanya declared, beaming with excitement. Step 5: Create a resolution. Over the next few weeks, Tanya researched and nurtured the mysterious plant, while Katrina continued to indulge in her love for painting and cooking. Eventually, as the plant grew taller and developed small colorful flowers, Tanya identified it as a rare exotic species. She felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment in discovering the plant's unique characteristics. Even though they had their differences, Tanya and Katrina appreciated each other's unique interests and supported one another in their respective pursuits. They learned that having separate hobbies could actually bring them closer together, as they shared their discoveries and achievements with each other.

The author expresses dissatisfaction with the fact that all their friends work night shifts, which presumably leaves them alone or without someone to communicate with during that time. The use of the word \\"why\\" indicates that the author is questioning the situation, while the phrase \\"then I'd have someone to talk to\\" implies the desire for social interaction that currently seems to be unmet. The lamentation might also suggest a sense of longing for connection and a shared experience with friends during nighttime hours. It is essential to note that in sentiment analysis, contextual cues and certain word usage can give us insight into a person's emotions or opinions. In this case, the tweet's sentiment leans more towards negative emotions of frustration, loneliness, and desire for companionship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Former New York Jets star Mark Gastineau, one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushers in the 1980s, said Thursday night he's battling serious brain issues he believes were caused by concussions in football.      \\"When my results came back, I had dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson,\\" Gastineau said in an interview on WOR radio in New York. \\"Those are three things that I have.\\"      Gastineau, 60, said he was diagnosed a year ago and he blames it on poor tackling technique. He called it \\"disturbing,\\" but he's hoping it serves as a warning to coaches and young players.      A member of the celebrated New York Sack Exchange in the early 1980s, Gastineau retired abruptly in 1988 after 10 seasons with the Jets.      What he didn't mention in the rambling, 30-minute interview was that he became a professional boxer after football. From 1991 to 1995, he fought a total of 17 professional bouts, winning 15.      People close to Gastineau have been saying for years they've noticed that he occasionally slurs his words and loses his focus in conversations.      Despite his struggles, Gastineau said he has no regrets about playing football and he encouraged kids to play the sport as long as they follow the proper techniques.      \\"I led with my head all the time,\\" he said. \\"Do you remember Marvin Powell? He was one of the best linemen in the NFL. He and I used to have wars [in practice]. ... People would come and gather round because when we hit each other, I mean, you would hear pops, like a shotgun going off.\\"      Mark Gastineau celebrates a sack while a member of the New York Jets. He said Thursday that he's suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Gene Kappock/Getty Images      Endorsing the NFL-sanctioned USA Football program, Gastineau said he doesn't want his grim diagnosis to \\"overpower or overshadow the 'Heads Up' program. I want it to be a warning to mothers and fathers\\" that football can be harmful if not taught properly.      Gastineau is the Jets' all-time sack leader and his single-season NFL record (22) lasted until 2001, when it was broken by Michael Strahan.      Gastineau disagrees with former football and baseball star Bo Jackson, who recently said he wouldn't allow his children to play football.      \\"I think that if he would have known about the Heads Up program, I don't think that he would have said that he never would have let his kids play,'' Gastineau said. \\"The only reason that I would allow my child to play is because of this USAFootball.com. I would not allow my child to play if I did not have this Heads Up Football. There's no way in the world. You cannot expect your child not to be injured if you do not enter this program.''      Gastineau insisted that, despite his health issues, he has no regrets when it comes to his football career.      \\"I am so happy that I went through the times, the trials and things that I went through in the NFL,'' Gastineau said. \\"I wouldn't trade them for anything.''      The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Mark Gastineau, the flamboyant former Jets defensive end and centerpiece of their infamous Sack Exchange, always had a flair for the dramatic — both good and bad.      But what he revealed about himself during a bizarre and rambling 30-minute radio interview on Thursday sounded like a low point.      The 60-year-old Gastineau portrayed his life in a sad, dead-end way. He sounded several lifetimes away from the superstar who was known for his wild sack dances on the field and squiring model/actress Brigitte Nielsen around in stretch limos off of it.      Gastineau revealed to WOR’s Pete McCarthy he has been diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The franchise’s all-time sacks leader said he believes his health issues are the result of his playing style, and new techniques taught and enforced in today’s NFL could have prevented his diagnosis.      “When my results came back, you know, I had dementia, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s,” Gastineau said. “It’s something that I want every player that goes out and plays to be protected in the best way they can be protected.”      At times in the interview, Gastineau spoke in cryptic sentences that were difficult to decipher.      “I’ve kinda had a huge, huge life change,’’ he said. “I found myself, you know, in places that I just, you know, just wasn’t good. It wasn’t good for me, wasn’t good for my family. Then I met somebody finally who got me straight, you know, my wife, Joanne.      “One day, I said, ‘Joanne, it’d be good for us to go to church maybe, you know?’ [So] I’ve been going to Times Square Church. My wife and I are side by side in the choir.’’      Gastineau then added, “Unfortunately, my self took over me … and I lost. My self was overpowering. I mean, I thought I was better than … you know.’’      He rambled about his former team, saying, “I see the Jets as my family. I have a love for those Shea Stadium fans like no other … they are my favorites. Those 10 years, you know what, now mean so much to me. I look back … everything that I did back then, you know, I was a different person back then. I brought a lot on myself.’’      Gastineau, who played with the Jets from 1979 to 1988, spent much of the interview promoting USA Football’s “Heads Up Football’’ program, which is in place to develop a safer brand of football and address key safety issues in the sport.      He said he believes the techniques taught in the Heads Up program would have prevented his health issues and that without these new developments, he would not have allowed his kids to play football.      “I’m not going to say that I’m not going to let my child play when I know there’s techniques out there that if I would have had them … I know that I wouldn’t have the results that I have now,” he said. “I do not want to have [my diagnosis] overpower or overshadow the Heads Up program. I want it to be a warning to mothers and fathers to be able to put their kids in safe places, to be able to carry on a team sport that I think is going to be [more] beneficial for them than if they didn’t have that in their lives.”      Gastineau repeated himself throughout the interview and often interrupted his own thoughts. He implored McCarthy to help get the word out about the NFL’s program and said he feels a responsibility to help today’s youth learn proper techniques that were not widely taught when he was coming up in the sport.      He also insisted he has no regrets about his career despite his health issues.      “I am so happy that I went through the times, the trials and things that I went through in the NFL,’’ he said. “I wouldn’t trade them for anything.’’      Then he got cryptic again about the current state of his life and where he goes from here.      “I’m in a good place because I’m going to go out … I’m going to help as many people as I can,’’ he said. “I don’t want to give up because I got those results.” |||||","output":"Former New York Jets player Mark Gastineau, who was one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushers in the 1980s, has said that he is struggling with serious brain issues that he believes were caused by concussions sustained in football.

The whereabouts of two of those that sank - including U-31 - was unknown, Mark Dunkley, marine archaeologist at Historic England, said. He called the discovery by windfarm developers ScottishPower Renewables and Vattenfall \\"a significant achievement\\". Scans of the seabed turned up more than 60 wrecks over a two-year period. Most of these were already known about, but the U-boat was \\"entirely unexpected\\", developers said. At first it was thought the wreckage might be a Dutch Navy submarine, missing since June 1940, however, after several dives it was eventually found to be the much earlier German submarine.

The exact location remained unknown until windfarm developers ScottishPower Renewables and Vattenfall found it during their scans of the seabed. As part of their exploration for a potential windfarm site, the developers utilized seabed scans and over a two-year period, they found over 60 wrecks, including the U-31, which came as a complete surprise. Initial speculations considered the wreckage as possibly being a Dutch navy submarine missing since June 1940, but after several dives, it was identified accurately as the German submarine U-31 by a team from Lamlash North Sea Diving. They were able to confirm this through clear footage obtained from the seabed at a depth of 98ft (30m).

John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'.  The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer.  The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair.  The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world. It explains that Viriconium can be visited via a mirror in a bathroom in a cafe in England. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what is storm of wings about?","output":"A Storm of Wings, the second novel in M.

A: OPT: a). signaling proteins. b). harnessing molecules. c). signaling neurons. d). signaling molecules. Answer:","output":"Cells in a biofilm secrete signaling molecules to recruit nearby cells.  A biofilm is a complex, dynamic community of microorganisms attached to a surface and embedded in self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). EPS consists mainly of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Biofilm formation and development involve different stages, including initial attachment of microorganisms to a surface, microcolony formation, maturation of the biofilm, and, ultimately, dispersion of cells from the biofilm back into the environment.  One of the key elements of biofilm development is cell communication, which plays a critical role in coordinating the behavior, growth, and diversity of microbial communities in a biofilm. This communication process in biofilms is primarily achieved through the secretion of signaling molecules, also known as autoinducers or quorum sensing molecules. Quorum sensing is a form of microbial communication that allows bacteria to coordinate their activities and behavior based on cell population density. It comprises the secretion, accumulation, and detection of one or more signaling molecules, leading to changes in the expression of various genes within the biofilm community. These genes are typically involved in processes such as bioluminescence, virulence, motility, and biofilm formation. The main classes of signaling molecules involved in quorum sensing are: 1. N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs): These molecules are produced by Gram-negative bacteria, and they vary in their acyl chain length and substitution at the third carbon position. AHLs play essential roles in various bacterial processes, such as surface attachment, swarming motility, synthesis of EPS, and production of virulence factors. 2. Autoinducing peptides (AIPs): These molecules are produced by Gram-positive bacteria and are commonly characterized as small, cyclic, and modified peptides. They regulate several physiological processes in Gram-positive bacteria, such as competence development, sporulation, and virulence factor production. 3. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2): This signaling molecule is produced by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and is derived from a common metabolic intermediate, 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). AI-2 has been implicated in interspecies communication, allowing different bacteria to coordinate their behavior and interact with one another during biofilm formation. In conclusion, cells in a biofilm secrete signaling molecules, such as AHLs, AIPs, and AI-2, to recruit nearby cells and regulate various behaviors within the biofilm community. This process, known as quorum sensing, enables bacteria to adapt to different environmental conditions and work together as a multicellular community to survive and thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days. Shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, and eight per day the week before May 18. Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations. At 12:36 p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75 m) wide, and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2.1 km) into the air. By this date a 16,000-foot-long (3.0 mi; 4.9 km) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area. This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400 m) above their vent. Most of this ash fell between three and twelve miles (5 and 19 km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 miles (240 km) south to Bend, Oregon, or 285 miles (460 km) east to Spokane, Washington.

Title: In the Cut Movie plot: High school teacher and writer Frannie Avery meets a student at a local bar, and when she heads to the bathroom sees a woman performing oral sex on a man. A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in her garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night. Frannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious. After Malloy tells her that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found. But later she goes with him to a woodsy spot by the water, where he scares her by shooting at garbage bags floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well, before they head back to the city. She finds her old boyfriend in her bed when she gets home, and goes back to her sister's apartment, where she finds the door open and Pauline's dismembered body.

Vernon Smith, 37, was pronounced dead at 10:28 a.m., according to a statement from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.  Smith was convicted of killing Toledo, Ohio, store owner Sohail Darwish during a robbery in 1993.  According to court documents, Darwish did not resist Smith's orders to open the cash register and hand over his wallet, but Smith shot him anyway, saying he \\"moved too slow.\\" Darwish bled to death from a single gunshot wound to the chest, the documents said.  Darwish, a 28-year-old from Saudi Arabia, had a year-old daughter, and his wife was pregnant with another daughter, the Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported Thursday.  The execution was Ohio's second using the one-drug method. Kenneth Biros, 51, was put to death in December. It was Ohio's first execution since September, when Gov. Ted Strickland and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for Broom's lethal injections.  The one-drug method used on Biros had never been tried on U.S. death row inmates. It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein. A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup, officials said. The one-drug method has been used to euthanize animals.  The same drug, sodium thiopental -- but at a much lower dosage -- is the first ingredient in the three-drug method previously used in Ohio, as well as in all but one of the other 34 states with the death penalty.  1.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - She has recorded with Yellow Magic Orchestra and its members Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as with Swing Out Sister, Pat Metheny, The Chieftains, Lyle Mays, members of Little Feat, David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Kenji Omura, Gil Goldstein, Toninho Horta, Mino Cinelu, Jeff Bova, Charlie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Rhodes, Bill Frisell, Thomas Dolby, the band Quruli, Rei Harakami as yanokami and her daughter Miu Sakamoto.  - Biography.

The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.

Write an article based on this summary: A teacher has been struck off for pretending to a be a 13-year-old girl and making false sex abuse claims against her former head teacher. Article:","output":"Title: Disgraced Teacher Banned for Impersonating Teenage Girl and Falsely Accusing Former Headteacher of Abuse Introduction: A teacher, whose identity remains undisclosed, has been struck off the professional register after it was discovered that she had posed as a 13-year-old girl and made false sex abuse claims against her former headteacher. The shocking and unlawful acts of the disgraced teacher have called into question her integrity, as well as raised concerns about the impact of such accusations on the reputation and careers of innocent individuals in the teaching profession. Background of the Incident: The unnamed teacher had filed a series of reports pretending to be a 13-year-old girl who had been a victim of sexual abuse by her former headteacher. These accusations were totally unfounded, but it was only after a thorough investigation by the authorities that the truth came to light. The duplicitous act of the teacher involved creating a fake email account, sending the allegations to her own professional email, and then forwarding them to the authorities to instigate an inquiry. Detecting the Fraud: The swift detection of the fraud can be attributed to the diligent work of investigators, who were able to uncover the inconsistencies in the teacher's claims and ultimately trace the origins of the emails back to her. The investigators quickly discovered that the IP address of the email account that had sent the allegations matched the accused teacher's own home address. Impact on the Teaching Profession: This disgraceful act committed by a member of the teaching profession has not only tarnished her own reputation but also cast a shadow on the credibility of other teachers in the eyes of the public. Allegations of sexual abuse, especially when involving minors, are extremely serious and can have severe consequences for both the accused and the accuser. The impact of such false claims extends beyond the legal realm, with implications for mental health and wellbeing, public trust, and the careers of those falsely accused. The teaching profession already faces numerous challenges, with educator burnout and high attrition rates being some of the prominent factors. Acts of deception and malice in the field only serve to exacerbate these problems and further erode trust in the education system. Conclusion: The striking off of the offending teacher was a necessary step in maintaining the integrity and professionalism of the teaching community. It serves as a reminder of the importance of honesty and upholding ethical standards in any occupation, particularly those in which individuals hold positions of trust and authority over minors. It is crucial that everyone working with young people, especially teachers, maintain high ethical standards and demonstrate an unwavering commitment to safeguarding the wellbeing and welfare of students. Deliberately causing harm or making false accusations not only betray this commitment but also undermine the entire teaching profession and risk causing irreparable damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers. Question: What types of geese are used for human consumption?","output":"There are two main types of domestic geese used for human consumption: the greylag-derived birds and the Chinese geese. Each of them serves a specific purpose in the human diet. 1. Greylag-derived birds: These are large, fleshy birds bred primarily for their meat. Featuring thick necks and large bodies with broad rear ends, they have an upright posture that distinguishes them from their wild counterparts. The flesh of these meat geese is dark-colored, high in protein, and their fat, which is deposited subcutaneously, consists mainly of monounsaturated fatty acids. Greylag-derived geese are usually slaughtered either around 10 weeks or about 24 weeks of age, as dressing carcase issues may arise during the intermediate period due to developing pin feathers. 2. Chinese geese: These geese have smaller frames compared to the greylag-derived birds and are primarily used for egg production. Although they might not be as commonly consumed for their meat as the greylag-derived birds, they are still part of the human diet, providing eggs and potentially meat. Chinese geese are known for being more aggressive and noisy, which also makes them suitable guard animals to alert people of intruders. Apart from their meat and eggs, both the greylag-derived and Chinese geese produce fine down that is highly valued for its use in pillows, padded garments, and other items that require soft and insulating materials. In conclusion, the two main types of geese used for human consumption are greylag-derived birds, which are popular for their meat, and Chinese geese, predominantly used for egg production. Both types also produce valuable down material, contributing to their utility in human lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It's been 50 years since the first James Bond film, Dr. No, premiered   in cinemas. As first embodied by Scottish actor Sean Connery, Agent 007 was a fearless, cool-as-ice spy who excelled at sleuthing  , fighting and saving the world. Since then, more than 20 films featuring the iconic spy have been released-making it one of the longest-running franchises   in the history of cinema. On Nov 9, the 23rd Bond movie, Skyfall, celebrated the legend's 50th birthday. Over the years, audiences have changed. It doesn't matter. Six different actors have acted 007 and it doesn't matter.

Yes, but the most important reason is still the man himself. Bond can challenge his boss and shoot a bad guy in mere minutes. He is an expert in literature, languages, art and fine wines. He has a sharp tongue besides his wits.  In the first film Dr. No, as Connery lit a cigarette, we heard James Bond's voice and saw his cafe for the first time. The simple scene and short phrase have defined the character for half a century. \\"Next to the Beatles and Stones, James Bond was the greatest British import of the 1960s,\\" David Kamp, a US contributing editor for Vanity Fair, wrote in a recent article about the birth of Bond and its influence on the US. The Bond phenomenon has clearly affected movie culture, pop culture and spy culture.

Many asylum seekers try to reach the island, hoping then to move on to the Australian mainland. Christmas Island, located about 1,600 miles (2,575km) north-west of the mainland, is the closest part of Australia to Indonesia - the key transit hub for people-smugglers. \\"Overnight, our officers have rescued 144 people from the sea and recovered the bodies of four other people,\\" Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare said. Australia's rescue co-ordination centre received a phone call from people on the vessel on early on Tuesday, after the boat's engine reportedly stopped, he said. However, the \\"weather conditions and the high sides of the vessel\\" prevented rescue personnel from boarding the boat. Navy vessel HMAS Albany reported that one of the two engines on the boat was not working and began escorting the boat, he said. \\"At approximately 18:00, the vessel began to lean to one side and passengers began jumping into the water. At approximately 18:40, [HMAS] Albany reported that the vessel had rolled and capsized,\\" Mr Clare said. \\"A total of six life rafts were deployed\\" to rescue the passengers as well as an overhead Orion aircraft and small boats from the naval vessels, he said, thanking rescuers for their \\"tough, hard, difficult and dangerous work\\".

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum.

Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in..., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The name of the person who wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre, is Philip Heseltine, also known as Peter Warlock. In the given article, it discusses Heseltine's life at Eynsford, where he presided over a bohemian household filled with artists, musicians, and friends. Heseltine was a composer, music critic, and writer who accomplished a significant amount of work in this unconventional setting, including transcriptions of early music, articles, and criticism. He also completed a book on Gesualdo and attempted to restore the reputation of the neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet. By examining the content of the article and the context of the question, we can deduce that Philip Heseltine, or Peter Warlock, is the author of the general study of Elizabethan music titled, The English Ayre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These features are being introduced with the aim of increasing engagement and allowing brands to create more targeted advertising campaigns. Location-based filters, which are currently in the process of being rolled out, can be 'unlocked' by users in specific geographic locations. This means that not all users will have access to these filters, as they are made available based on the user's current location. This novelty could pave the way for brands to use filters as a form of advertising, making it a potentially lucrative feature to incorporate into marketing strategies. In addition to filters, major companies like Facebook and Apple are now working on the development of self-destructing messages. Facebook's Slingshot app is one example of this new feature, which allows users to send messages that are automatically deleted after being read. Apple is also jumping on the bandwagon and plans to introduce self-destructing messages in its upcoming iPhone and iPad software. Another significant feature recently added by social media platforms is the ability to create group sharing experiences at concerts and live events. This feature allows users to share content with others in their network who are attending the same event, creating a more connected and engaging experience for all involved. As competition between social media platforms intensifies, these new features aim to provide users with unique experiences while also offering brands the opportunity to incorporate them into their advertising efforts. With the growing popularity of location-based filters and self-destructing messages, companies are recognizing the importance of staying ahead of the curve and embracing these novel features to stay relevant in the ever-evolving world of social media."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who made Fritz feel neglected? ?  In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years.  He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.  For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for...

Background: Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a character in a series of suspense novels by Thomas Harris. Lecter was introduced in the 1981 thriller novel Red Dragon as a forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. The novel and its sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, feature Lecter as one of the primary antagonists after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, Hannibal, Lecter becomes a protagonist. Context: Red Dragon firmly states that Lecter does not fit any known psychological profile. In The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter's keeper, Dr. Frederick Chilton, claims that Lecter is a \\"pure sociopath\\" (\\"pure psychopath\\" in the film adaptation). In the novel Red Dragon, protagonist Will Graham says that Lecter has no conscience and tortured animals as a child, but does not exhibit any other of the criteria traditionally associated with psychopathy; Graham explains that psychiatrists refer to Lecter as a sociopath because \\"they don't know what else to call him\\". In the film adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, protagonist Clarice Starling says of Lecter, \\"They don't have a name for what he is.\\" In the novel The Silence of the Lambs, Barney Matthews, an orderly at the facility where Lecter is imprisoned, claims that the only thing Lecter fears is boredom.  Lecter's pathology is explored in greater detail in Hannibal and Hannibal Rising, which explains that he was traumatized as a child in Lithuania in 1944 when he witnessed the murder and cannibalism of his beloved sister, Mischa, by a group of deserting Lithuanian Hilfswillige, one of whom claimed that Lecter unwillingly ate his sister as well.  All media in which Lecter appears portray him as intellectually brilliant, cultured and sophisticated, with refined tastes in art, music and cuisine. He is frequently depicted preparing gourmet meals from his victims' flesh, the most famous example being his admission that he once ate a census taker's liver \\"with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\\" (a \\"big Amarone\\" in the novel). He is well-educated in Anatomy, Chemistry and Physics and also speaks several languages, including Italian, German, Russian, Polish, French, Spanish, and, to some extent, Japanese. He is deeply offended by rudeness, and frequently kills people who have bad manners. Prior to his capture and imprisonment, he was a member of Baltimore, Maryland's social elite, and a sitting member of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra's board of directors.  In The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter is described through Starling's eyes: \\"small, sleek, and in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own\\". The novel also reveals that Lecter's left hand has a condition called mid ray duplication polydactyly, i.e. a duplicated middle finger. In Hannibal, he performs plastic surgery on his own face on several occasions, and removes his extra digit. Lecter's eyes are a shade of maroon, and reflect the light in \\"pinpoints of red\\". He has small white teeth and dark, slicked-back hair with a widow's peak. He also has a keen sense of smell; in The Silence of the Lambs, he is able to identify through a plexiglass window with small holes the brand of perfume that Starling wore the day before. At one point, when Hannibal points out Clarice must have gotten a bruise lately, she suddenly remembers she has a band-aid on her covered leg, so she assumes he must have smelled it. He has an eidetic memory with which he has constructed in his mind an elaborate \\"memory palace\\" with which he relives memories and sensations in rich detail. Question: What other characteristics of Lecter are interesting? Answer:","output":"In addition to the physical and intellectual characteristics mentioned above, several other interesting aspects of Dr. Hannibal Lecter's persona include his complex psychology, exceptional manipulation skills, dual nature, sense of morality, and personal relationships. 1. Complex psychology: Lecter's psychology is a fascinating combination of various traits that make him an enigma and defy classification by the field of psychiatry. He embodies traits of a psychopath, sociopath, and traumatized individual, but does not neatly fit any one category. This complexity attracts both aversion and intrigue, making him a difficult character to fully understand or predict. 2. Exceptional manipulation skills: Lecter is a master manipulator, able to psychologically analyze and exploit others to achieve his objectives. His deep understanding of human behavior and psychiatric insights enable him to control, persuade, and toy with others, from fellow inmates to law enforcement officers. In some cases, he even forms a bond with his \\"targets,\\" establishing an unusually close relationship for a psychopath, and using these connections to further his goals. 3. Dual nature: Dr. Lecter demonstrates a dual nature in his character, embodying both refined sophistication and brutal violence. He is equally at home discussing fine art, playing the harpsichord, or dissecting his victims with surgical precision. This duality between civilized grace and horrific acts makes him a compelling figure and contributes to the public's fascination with his character. 4. Sense of morality: Despite his cannibalistic tendencies and sadistic actions, Lecter seems to possess a unique sense of morality. He has an aversion to rudeness and discourtesy, and often reserves his most gruesome acts for those he considers ill-mannered. This twisted code of ethics adds further depth to his character and suggests that there is a certain order beneath the chaos of his mind. 5. Personal relationships: Lecter's relationships with other characters are intriguing, particularly his dynamic with FBI agent Clarice Starling. Despite his psychopathic nature, the mutual respect, curiosity, and connection between the two characters provide a fascinating study of how such a complex individual can form an emotional bond, albeit a highly unconventional one. In summary, Dr. Hannibal Lecter's multifaceted character is equally engaging and horrifying. His complex psychology, exceptional manipulation skills, dual nature, sense of morality and personal relationships make him an iconic figure in popular culture and an interesting study of the human psyche."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: It is being driven away. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"We cannot conclusively confirm the hypothesis based on the premise given. There are various aspects to consider and different scenarios that could lead to the old, beat-up jeep being towed away. In order to establish whether the hypothesis is valid or not, it's crucial to delve into the possible scenarios and assess the likelihood of each. The premise states that there is an old, beat-up jeep being towed away. This could mean several things: 1. The jeep might no longer be functional due to its age and worn-out state, which could explain the reason for it being towed away. 2. It could be involved in an accident or face a sudden mechanical failure, which rendered it immobile and required it to be towed away for repair or to clear the road. 3. The jeep could have been parked illegally or abandoned, and as a result, it is being towed away by law enforcement officials or towing services. 4. Alternatively, the jeep could be towed away as part of a planned relocation or transportation from one place to another, for various reasons such as transferring ownership, scrapping, or restoration. Given these potential scenarios, the hypothesis that the old, beat-up jeep is being driven away is not necessarily supported. The hypothesis implies that the jeep is operable and mobile with the help of a driver. In the context of the premise provided, the jeep is being towed - which suggests that it is not being driven away by a person. With only the given premise of the jeep being towed away, it is impossible to confirm the hypothesis that it is being driven away without further information about the situation surrounding the event. In several plausible scenarios, the jeep is not operational or driven by someone but rather towed away due to various reasons, as mentioned earlier. To make a conclusive determination of the hypothesis, additional information about the circumstances or the state of the jeep would be required. For example, understanding what led to the jeep being towed away or finding out if it is still functional will shed more light on the validity of our hypothesis.

Answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Question: We do not have rest, so how are we feeling? Options:  A. exhausted  B. lonely  C. worked all day  D. were very tired  E. feel better Answer:","output":"Based on the given scenario, it is reasonable to assume that if we do not have rest, we are likely to be experiencing fatigue or exhaustion due to the absence of adequate relaxation or sleep. Therefore, the most fitting option in line with common sense would be Option A: exhausted.  Lack of rest could be attributed to various factors, such as demanding work schedules, elevated stress levels, or an inability to fall asleep. Continuous insufficient rest can negatively impact our physical and mental well-being, as it hinders our body's capacity to effectively rejuvenate and heal itself. When we do not allow our bodies to rest properly, we feel tired and exhausted, which is quite a natural reaction. Moreover, fatigue often reduces our alertness, decreases concentration levels, and impairs our cognitive functions. Consequently, it becomes increasingly challenging to perform everyday tasks and maintain efficiency in our job or personal responsibilities. In severe cases, chronic exhaustion could result in severe health complications, such as insomnia, anxiety, or depression.  While Options B (lonely), C (worked all day), D (were very tired), and E (feel better) might make sense in other contexts, they do not directly address the issue of not having rest, which is a core concern in the given question. Hence, Option A: exhausted best corresponds with the concept of not receiving sufficient rest and the probable feelings associated with it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(A) not wanting to help train my roommates territorial dog (B) breaking off contact with my long time friends for mocking me","output":"In order to complete the task and determine which action is considered less ethical, I will weigh the potential harm caused by each action and choose the one that seems to have greater negative consequences. Step 1: Analyze Action A In this action, the person does not want to help train their roommate's territorial dog. While it shows a lack of support and cooperation with the roommate, it may also be due to the person's concerns about safety or lack of knowledge in dog training. The main harm caused by this action may be to the relationship between the person and their roommate. Step 2: Analyze Action B In this action, the person breaks off contact with long-time friends because they mocked them. This decision may indicate a desire to protect themselves from emotional harm. However, it also cuts ties with long-time friends, which can lead to isolation and the loss of the support network. Step 3: Compare Actions Comparing the potential harm caused by each action, it seems that Action B may have a more significant impact on the person's life due to the loss of long-standing friendships and the potential for isolation. Action A, while demonstrating a lack of support towards the roommate, might not have as severe consequences for the person. Step 4: Make a Decision Based on my analysis, I determine that Action B is considered less ethical due to its greater potential for negative consequences.

Colby is upset because his prize calf has become sick for no apparent reason, and brings the animal to Hansen's laboratory. Hansen examines the calf, which dies shortly afterward. Hansen tells Colby he cannot explain what made the animal so ill so quickly, but takes samples of the calf's blood to a university lab in Flagstaff.A few days later, Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling), an arachnologist, arrives looking for Hansen. Ashley tells Hansen that the calf was killed by a massive dose of spider venom, which Hansen greets with skepticism. Undaunted, Ashley tells him the problem is serious and that she wishes to examine the animal's carcass and the area where it became sick. Hansen escorts Ashley to Colby's farm. Moments after they arrive, Colby's wife, Birch (Altovise Davis), discovers their dog is dead. Ashley performs a quick chemical test on the dog's carcass and concludes that like the calf, it died from a massive injection of spider venom. Hansen is incredulous, until Colby states that he recently found a massive \\"spider hill\\" on a back section of his farmland. He takes Hansen and Ashley to the hill, which is covered with tarantulas. Ashley theorizes that the tarantulas are converging together due to the heavy use of pesticides, which are eradicating their natural food supply. In order to survive, the spiders are joining forces to attack and eat larger animals.Hansen and Ashley return to the Colby farm. As the scientists and the Colbys are walking past a barn, a bull stampedes out; it is being attacked by tarantulas. Ashley notes that the spiders likely will not be afraid to attack people either. Colby douses the spider hill with gasoline and lights it on fire, seemingly destroying the spider menace. However, many of the spiders escape out of a tunnel.

Ann spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled   close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things. In 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, \\"Where can I buy one?\\" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent   for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps   that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front. By 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month. When Ann made her first baby carrier, she just wanted to keep her baby close and still have her hands free to do other things.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What type of schools do they have in a theocratic nation?\\"  Context: \\"The New York City Charter School Center assists the setup of new charter schools. There are approximately 900 additional privately run secular and religious schools in the city.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In a theocratic nation, the education system, including the types of schools, is heavily influenced by the dominant religious beliefs and principles. The schools in such a nation primarily focus on imparting not only traditional academic knowledge but also religious teachings to promote and preserve the values, belief systems, and historical narratives central to the theocratic governance. The types of schools one can find in a theocratic nation can be broadly classified into the following categories: 1. Religious Schools: These are schools that are explicitly founded upon the principles and teachings of the dominant religion in the theocracy. Religious schools often have a rigorous curriculum that combines secular subjects such as mathematics and science with religious studies and theological interpretation. Teachers in these schools are usually experts in religious education, and the overall emphasis lies on shaping the students' moral and spiritual development. 2. Parochial Schools: Parochial schools are another type of religious educational institution, typically affiliated with a specific religious denomination or congregation. Often sponsored and operated by religious organizations, these schools provide a faith-based education that complements the teachings of the family and the worship community. In a theocratic nation, parochial schools are meant to strengthen the foundation and application of religious ethics and values in the lives of the students. 3. Faith-Based Charter Schools: In some theocratic nations, one might find faith-based charter schools that operate with greater autonomy in curriculum design and operation compared to public schools. While being publicly funded, these schools cater to specific religious communities and incorporate elements of religious education into their curriculum. The goal of these schools is to offer a more diverse but still faith-oriented educational experience to the students. 4. Government-sponsored Public Schools: Though theocracies are primarily governed by religious principles, they may still have government-sponsored public schools. These schools are likely to have a strong emphasis on religious education, but to varying degrees depending on government directives. The curriculum in such schools might be designed to reflect the state's interpretation of religious principles and values, integrated with general academic subjects. 5. Private Secular Schools: While rare in theocratic nations, it is possible to find a few private secular schools that may cater to individuals who seek a more balanced educational experience for their children. These schools may downplay the focus on religious teachings while prioritizing traditional academic subjects. However, even in secular schools, some level of religious influence is likely to persist given the pervasive nature of the theocratic system. In summary, schools in a theocratic nation primarily function to instill and preserve the religious values and belief systems that govern the society. As such, the most common types of schools in these countries are religious, parochial, and faith-based institutions, with government-sponsored public schools incorporating elements of religious education. Private secular schools may still exist but are rare due to the overarching influence of the dominant religion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.  Now, I have a new situation: In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone.  Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Answer this question please: Which century saw northeast Michigan's water table at decreased level, sixteenth century or twentieth century? Answer:","output":"The twentieth century saw northeast Michigan's water table at a decreased level compared to the sixteenth century. During the sixteenth century, the State of Michigan had forests all over, which played a crucial role in maintaining the water table. In the twentieth century, however, the scenario changed significantly.  In the northeast part of the state, vegetation clearance occurred, and wooded areas were replaced with farmlands. This change led to a substantial increase in irrigation. As a result, the water table increased initially, and salts were mobilized, causing groundwater salinization and compromising the buffering properties of the area. These changes led to a decrease in the water table due to increased water usage for agriculture and the loss of forests, which serve as natural sponges and help replenish groundwater supplies. Furthermore, as the habitat changed, the native elm and oak species started to decline due to their increased susceptibility to drought and inability to cope with high salinity levels. The decrease in the water table can also negatively impact the overall health of the ecosystem, making it more vulnerable to various environmental stressors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again.

In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Patriots QB Tom Brady completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, New England pulled away with Brady & Moss hooked up with each other again on a 1-yard TD pass, RB Laurence Maroney getting a 59-yard TD run, and Brady completing a 48-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney.  In the third quarter, the Dolphins would get on the board as QB Cleo Lemon completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Greg Camarillo.  However, the Patriots' defense took over for the rest of the game. How many touchdown passes did Tom Brady throw in the first half?","output":"To find out how many touchdown passes Tom Brady threw in the first half, we need to look at the information provided for the first and second quarters. In the first quarter, Tom Brady completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. That's one touchdown pass. In the second quarter, Tom Brady threw two more touchdown passes - a 1-yard TD pass to Randy Moss and a 48-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney. That adds two more touchdown passes.

Jimbo is browsing the internet on his phone while Milo is lifting weights. Which person is sweating less? (A) Jimbo (B) Milo  Choose the answer between \\"Jimbo\\" and \\"Milo\\". The answer is:","output":"Jimbo To provide a detailed explanation, let us analyze the activities Jimbo and Milo are engaged in while at the gym.  Jimbo is browsing the internet on his phone, which requires minimal physical exertion. His body is not working as hard as it would be during a physical activity such as weightlifting, running, or calisthenics. Browsing the internet involves mostly sitting or standing idle and performing simple finger gestures on the touch screen. As a result, his body is not generating an excessive amount of heat, and his sweat glands do not need to produce much sweat to regulate his body temperature. Therefore, Jimbo is likely sweating very little, if at all. On the other hand, Milo is lifting weights, which is an anaerobic exercise that involves using muscle strength to overcome resistance. Lifting weights can be quite taxing on the body, requiring increased energy expenditure and elevated heart rates. As a consequence of this increased physiological demand, Milo's muscles produce heat as they contract against the resistance of the weights. To maintain a stable body temperature and prevent overheating, the body must dissipate this extra heat by producing sweat.  Sweat is an essential physiological mechanism that helps regulate the body's temperature during exercise or physical work. As the body heats up, it produces sweat, which evaporates from the surface of the skin, enabling heat loss and preventing the body from overheating. In conclusion, based on their respective activities at the gym, it is evident that Jimbo is sweating less than Milo. Jimbo's sedentary activity of browsing the internet does not generate a significant amount of heat or require much cooling via sweating. In contrast, Milo's anaerobic weightlifting exercise generates a significant amount of heat, demanding that his body produces sweat to regulate his temperature effectively. Therefore, the answer is Jimbo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The gravitational force of the Moon pulls on the oceans, causing bulges and consequently the phenomenon we know as tides.

The doctors like giving their patients the pill instead of the liquid, because the  OPT: a). liquid was more helpful. b). pill was more helpful.","output":"The doctors like giving their patients the pill instead of the liquid, because the pill was more helpful. The preference for pills over liquids is due to several reasons.  1. Pills offer more accurate dosing: One significant advantage of pills over liquids is the precise measurement of the medication. Pills are pre-measured with a specific dose, allowing patients to receive the exact amount needed each time. With liquids, measurements can vary depending on how well the patient or caregiver administers it, leading to potential underdosing or overdosing. 2. Improved patient compliance: Some patients find it more convenient to take pills than liquids. Pills are easier to transport and store, making it more likely for patients to take their medication when they need it. Furthermore, pills typically have a longer shelf life than liquid medicines, ensuring that the drug remains effective for a more extended period. 3. Taste and texture preferences: Some liquid medications have an unpleasant taste or texture, which can cause patients to resist taking their medicine. Pills, on the other hand, usually are tasteless or have a bland taste, increasing the likelihood of patients taking their medication as prescribed. 4. Lower risk of contamination: Liquid medications can be more susceptible to contamination than pills. Pills are usually sealed in individual blister packs or kept in a closed container, protecting them from potential contaminants. On the other hand, liquid medications may require the use of droppers or other measuring devices, which can introduce contaminants if not adequately cleaned between uses. 5. Easier to swallow for some patients: While certain individuals, such as young children or elderly adults, may have difficulty swallowing pills, others may find pills easier to swallow than liquids. For some patients, swallowing a small pill is less daunting than ingesting a larger volume of liquid medicine. 6. Pills can provide timed-release options: One key advantage of pills is the availability of timed-release formulations. Timed-release medications release their active ingredients slowly and steadily over an extended period, providing a consistent and prolonged therapeutic effect. It is more challenging to accomplish this with liquid medications. In conclusion, the preference for pills over liquids among doctors is primarily due to their ability to provide accurate dosing, maintain patient compliance, and offer other advantages, including taste, lower contamination risk, ease of swallowing, and timed-release options. While the pill may not be the best choice for every patient, these reasons support the idea that the pill is generally more helpful for most patients than the liquid alternative."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Shanghai smog cancels flights, reduces visibility to metres Shanghai authorities ordered schoolchildren indoors and halted all construction Friday as China's financial hub suffered one its worst bouts of air pollution, bringing visibility down to a few dozen metres, delaying flights and obscuring the city's spectacular skyline. The financial district was shrouded in a yellow haze, and noticeably fewer people walked the city's streets. Vehicle traffic also was thinner, as authorities pulled 30 per cent of government vehicles from the roads. They also banned fireworks and public sporting events. \\"I feel like I'm living in clouds of smog,\\" said Zheng Qiaoyun, a local resident who kept her six-month-old son at home. \\"I have a headache, I'm coughing, and it's hard to breathe on my way to my office.\\" Shanghai's concentration of tiny, harmful PM 2.5 particles reached 602.5 micrograms per cubic metre Friday afternoon, an extremely hazardous level that was the highest since the city began recording such data last December. That compares with the World Health Organization's safety guideline of 25 micrograms. The dirty air that has gripped Shanghai and its neighbouring provinces for days is attributed to coal burning, car exhaust, factory pollution and weather patterns, and is a stark reminder that pollution is a serious challenge in China. Beijing, the capital, has seen extremely heavy smog several times over the past year. In the far northeastern city of Harbin, some monitoring sites reported PM 2.5 rates up to 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter in October, when the winter heating season kicked off. As a coastal city, Shanghai usually has mild to modest air pollution, but recent weather patterns have left the city's air stagnant. On China's social media, netizens swapped jokes over the rivalry between Shanghai and Beijing, saying the financial hub was catching up with the capital in air pollution. Alan Yu, a chef in Shanghai, satirized the air on his microblog as though he were sampling a new vintage of wine. \\"Today, Shanghai air really has a layered taste. At first, it tastes slightly astringent with some smokiness. Upon full contact with your palate, the aftertaste has some earthy bitterness, and upon careful distinguishing you can even feel some dust-like particulate matter,\\" Yu wrote. The environmental group Greenpeace said slow-moving and low-hanging air masses had carried factory emissions from Jiangsu, Anhui and Shandong provinces to Shanghai. But it said the root problem lies with the excessive industrial emissions in the region, including Zhejiang province to the south. \\"Both Jiangsu and Zhejiang should act as soon as possible to set goals to reduce their coal consumption so that the Yantze River Delta will again be green with fresh air,\\" Huang Wei, a Greenpeace project manager, said in a statement.

When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors.

News article: West Indies v England: second Test, day one - as it happened There’s a scene in The Three Amigos (one of the top-five greatest films ever made, thereisaidit) in which the eponymous trio are searching for El Guapo’s lair and, in order to be shown the way, have to summon the Invisible Swordsman by chanting the magic words and then shooting their guns into the air. They have guns. They have the words written down in a notebook. So it should be simple. Not so: Ned Niederlander (Martin Short) and Lucky Day (Steve Martin, at the absolute peak of his powers) both manage the task without fuss, but Dusty Bottoms (Chevy Chase) sloppily shoots sideways rather than up, inadvertently killing the Invisible Swordsman and thus scuppering their search. The point is: even the most straightforward of tasks can easily go wrong. Take this Test tour. It was supposed to be a somewhat gentle reintroduction to Test cricket for a beleaguered England side, with a flaky West Indies making obliging hosts. What perhaps wasn’t expected was a new ball pair that have raised questions about the (very different) rehabilitations of England’s openers and a dogged middle-order that, through centuries from Jermaine Blackwood in the first innings and Jason Holder in the second, denied England what should probably have been a 1-0 lead in the series. So there’s a bit of an edge to this second Test in Grenada. Moeen Ali is expected to come in for the possibly injured James Tredwell and bat at No7, despite Tricky Tredders’ valiant efforts in Antigua, thus providing England with a ludicrously exciting six, seven and eight in the shape of Ben Stokes, Ali and Jos Buttler. I’d personally like to see Mark Wood given a chance ahead of Chris Jordan, though the rumbles coming from the Caribbean seem to suggest that is unlikely. The signs are this is going to be another tough pitch on which to get a result, and with spin likely to play even more of a role leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo will come into the West Indies XI. England’s to-do list, though, has three key bullet points: runs for Cook and Trott, 20 wickets, and, above all, a win – something they haven’t managed away from home since Kolkata in 2012.

I looked at him and he looked back. The mouse said to me, ‘Go back to sleep’ and what could I do? He had a gun.” The following has worked a few times too when students refuse to talk. That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other.

Can one start pursuing CA at the age of 26? Can one start pursuing CA at the age of 22? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: (i). no. (ii). yes.","output":"It is absolutely possible to start pursuing a Chartered Accountancy (CA) course at the ages of both 22 and 26. Although the questions are similar, they are not the same. Hence, the answer to whether they are the same would be (i). no. First, let's discuss each question separately. 1. Can one start pursuing CA at the age of 26? Yes, one can start pursuing CA at the age of 26. There are multiple reasons why it is feasible for an individual to begin this journey: - No age limit: CA courses do not have an upper age limit for enrolment, so anyone who fulfills the eligibility criteria, such as having passed their 10+2 examination, can register.   - Flexible timetable: The CA curriculum offers flexibility both in terms of coaching and the self-study approach. This flexibility allows individuals to plan their preparation effectively, depending on their personal commitments and learning preferences. - Diverse career opportunities: The CA profession offers multiple career pathways, in fields such as taxation, auditing, finance, and consultancy. As a result, individuals seeking a dynamic and engaging career can succeed in the CA domain even if they start at 26. 2. Can one start pursuing CA at the age of 22? Yes, one can start pursuing CA at the age of 22. In fact, pursuing a CA at 22 offers certain advantages: - Better employability: Having completed the CA course by 26-27 years of age, individuals will be in a strong position within the job market. With a robust professional qualification, they will have an edge over their competition. - More time for growth: Starting at 22 offers individuals more time for professional growth, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They would have more years ahead in their career to refine their skills, update knowledge, and accumulate work experience. - Possibility to pursue other qualifications: With an early start, individuals can explore additional qualifications complementing their CA degree. For instance, they may pursue Certified Public Accounting (CPA) or Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certifications to further enhance their profile. In conclusion, both ages, 22 and 26, are perfectly suitable to begin pursuing a CA course. While differences exist in terms of career trajectory and potential opportunities, there is no right or wrong age to start this journey. Each individual should carefully consider their personal circumstances, preferences, and the level of dedication required to make an informed decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Behind China's love affair with bitcoin Li hopes the recent government clampdown on bitcoin trade is an attempt to cool off the euphoria—not a way to shut down trade altogether. \\"It's the equivalent of the government taking a credit card reader out of a restaurant,\\" Li explains. \\"You can still pay, it's just a lot harder.\\" Li say his firm's current trading volume is the equivalent of 50 million a day.

Despite recent volatility, Guo prefers the bitcoin because it helps him transfer money worldwide fast—a luxury Chinese have never had before due to the country's currency controls. \\"It's actually a financial network,\\" Guo explains. \\"If you are in the U.S. and I'm in China, if I ask you to send me two bitcoins, you can transfer it right away.

What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text primarily discusses the popularity of Bitcoin within China. It highlights different perspectives on the recent actions taken by the Chinese government that have seemingly attempted to constrain the raging Bitcoin trade. It addresses multiple significant points: 1. Understanding the Current State: The text mentions that Bitcoin trade volumes in some firms currently equate to 50 million per day, showing just how popular the cryptocurrency has become within China. 2. Government Stance: It is noted that the Chinese authorities are apprehensive about anything that could potentially destabilize the country's tightly controlled financial system. The clampdown on Bitcoin trade is perceived by some as a measure to manage the fervor associated with it, not necessarily as an attempt to entirely prohibit its trade. 3. Users' Perception and Convenience: At a startup cafe that doubles as a Bitcoin trading spot, it is pointed out that enthusiasts of the cryptocurrency are not ready to abandon Bitcoin. One of the traders, Guo, illustrates that he prefers Bitcoin since it allows him to transfer money globally with ease and speed, a comfort never before experienced due to China's currency controls. 4. Trust in the Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin is viewed as more reliable by some because its credibility is grounded in science rather than in an individual or state entity. This perspective promotes continued faith in the technology despite recent volatility. One of the main takeaways from this text is that despite recent government clampdowns, there is a determined interest in Bitcoin in China because of its convenience for international transactions and its perceived reliability. The clampdown is seen more as a cooling measure instead of a shutdown, indicating the potential for continued growth and engagement with cryptocurrency within China's financial landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - deception - betrayal of trust - trickery - more lies - problems  Explain why a human would choose \\"deception\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"deception\\" to answer the question above because it best describes the nature of an illusionist's magic act. Deception refers to the act of deliberately causing someone to believe something that is not true, especially with the intention of gaining an advantage or to manipulate an outcome. In the context of a magic act, an illusionist uses deception as a major aspect of their performance. This is done to create an entertaining and enchanting atmosphere where the audience is led to believe that they are witnessing something extraordinary or supernatural when, in reality, the illusionist is merely executing well-practiced tricks and illusions. Let's briefly analyze the other options: - Betrayal of trust: Although an illusionist may be deceiving the audience, the act of deception itself is typically part of the performance and expected by the audience. This cannot be considered a betrayal of trust, as the nature of the act is known and agreed upon. - Trickery: Trickery is a component of deception; however, it falls short at encompassing the entire act of illusion. Deception is broader and conveys the complete illusion performed by an illusionist, which includes the environment, ambiance, and atmosphere created through their magic act. - More lies: While lying is a part of deception, this option seems redundant. Deception already implies the use of lying as a technique in the illusionist's magic act, so selecting \\"more lies\\" doesn't add more clarity or understanding to the answer. - Problems: This option doesn't adequately describe the illusionist's magic act and seems unrelated to the concept of performing illusions. Given this analysis, \\"deception\\" is the most appropriate response to describe the illusionist's magic act because it clearly and concisely conveys the intentional misleading of the audience through clever tricks and illusions, which is the primary goal of an illusionist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One uses a pressure canner, a device that subjects canned food to high pressures to create high temperatures.  The other method is to use a boiling-water canner, a device in which canned food is submerged in boiling water. When canning meat, seafood, poultry, and vegetables, pressure canning is the only canning method recognized as safe by the USDA. In addition to a canning device, canning at home requires a glass jar (a Mason jar, typically) and, of course, the food that you wish to can.  If you grow your own produce, you could save even more money on your canning materials.  You can often assemble canning materials – including a canning machine – for free on digital marketplaces like Craigslist. Try to get a set of canning jars for free or at a discount rate (but be sure to sterilize them by boiling them in water before use). If you have a community garden in your area, you might be able to lease a small plot for yourself to grow the veggies you want to can. There are two standard canning methods.  One is known as “hot packing.”  This involves blanching your food (usually vegetables), then loading it tightly into canning jars along with some of the water they were blanched in.  The other is known as “raw packing.”  This involves placing raw food into a canning jar and pouring very hot water over it.  If you have a boiling-water canner, you should raw-pack your canned food.  If you have a pressure canner, you should hot-pack your canned food. After hot packing, seal the jar with a metal lid, and follow the directions that came with your canning device to determine your next steps.  The amount of time your canned food will need to spend in the canning device depends on how much you have and what sort of food it is. The only additional cost when canning is your time.  Pressure canners work faster than boiling-water canners. Once you’ve canned your own foods, you’ll need to assign each can an expiration date so that it can be incorporated into your pantry system.

Ajatuksena tässä on, että jos Hamas tunnistaa Israelin valtion olemassaolon tai hyväksyy realistisen kahden valtion ratkaisun Lähi-idän konfliktissa, se voi avata tien rauhanprosessille ja lopulta mahdollistaa pitkän aikavälin sovinnon alueella. Kahden valtion ratkaisu tarkoittaa, että sekä Israelin että Palestiinan valtiot voisivat elää rinnakkain, tunnustaen toistensa olemassaolon ja oikeudet. Tämä vaatisi kuitenkin molemminpuolista jatkuvaa sitoutumista rauhanprosessiin ja neuvotteluihin, joiden tavoitteena olisi luoda kaksi itsenäistä ja suvereenia valtiota, joilla olisikin turvalliset rajat. Tähän skenaarioon pääseminen on ollut hankalaa viime vuosikymmenien ajan, ja suurin syy konfliktin ratkaisemattomuuteen on ollut poliittisen päätöksenteon puute kummankin osapuolen kohdalta. Hamasin tunnustaminen Israelia ja kahden valtion ratkaisua kohtaan voisi olla merkittävä askel kohti rauhaa ja vakautta alueella. Uskon, että ainoa tapa edetä tässä on toistensa kunnioittaminen ja kahden valtion ratkaisun hyväksyminen, joka perustuisi kansainvälisiin sopimuksiin, kuten YK:n päätöslauselmiin. Tämä vaatimustaso edellyttäisi joustavuutta molemmilta osapuolilta, sekä valmiutta neuvotella ja löytää yhteinen pohja erimielisyyksien ratkaisemiseksi. Hamasin uuden hallinnon noudattama uusi suunta voisi merkitä tienraivausta tällaisen prosessin käynnistämiseksi, mikäli se pystyisi vastaamaan vaatimukseen Israelin tunnustamisesta ja kahden valtion ratkaisun hyväksymisestä. Siten Lähi-idän konfliktin lopullinen ratkaisu antaisi ihmisille toiveen rauhallisemmasta ja turvallisemmasta tulevaisuudestailman tulevaisuuden pelkoa uusista väkivaltaisuuksista."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Emar (modern Tell Meskene) is an archaeological site in Aleppo Governorate, northern Syria. It sits in the great bend of the mid-Euphrates, now on the shoreline of the man-made Lake Assad near the town of Maskanah. It has been the source of many cuneiform tablets, making it rank with Ugarit, Mari and Ebla among the most important archeological sites of Syria. In these texts, dating from the 14th century BC to the fall of Emar in 1187 BC, and in excavations in several campaigns since the 1970s, Emar emerges as an important Bronze Age trade center, occupying a liminal position between the power centers of Upper Mesopotamia and Anatolia-Syria. Unlike other cities, the tablets preserved at Emar, most of them in Akkadian and of the thirteenth century BC, are not royal or official, but record private transactions, judicial records, dealings in real estate, marriages, last wills, formal adoptions. In the house of a priest, a library contained literary and lexical texts in the Mesopotamian tradition, and ritual texts for local cults.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - In Ancient Rome, a province (Latin: \\"provincia\\", pl. \\"provinciae\\") was the basic, and, until the Tetrarchy (293 AD), largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire's territorial possessions outside of Italy. The word \\"province\\" in modern English has its origins in the term used by the Romans.  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - Ugarit (\\"Ugart\\"; \\"rt\\", alternatively \\"rt\\") was an ancient port city, the ruins of which are located at what is now called Ras Shamra (sometimes written \\"Ras Shamrah\\" literally \\"Cape Fennel\\"), a headland in northern Syria. Ugarit had close connections to the Hittite Empire, sent tribute to Egypt at times, and maintained trade and diplomatic connections with Cyprus (then called Alashiya), documented in the archives recovered from the site and corroborated by Mycenaean and Cypriot pottery found there. The polity was at its height from c. 1450 BC until 1200 BC.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Lake Assad (\\"Buhayrat al-Assad\\") is a reservoir on the Euphrates in Ar-Raqqah Governorate, Syria. It was created in 1974 when the Tabqa Dam was closed. Lake Assad is Syrias largest lake with a maximum capacity of and a maximum surface area of . A vast network of canals uses water from Lake Assad to irrigate lands on both sides of the Euphrates. In addition, the lake provides drinking water for the city of Aleppo and supports a fishing industry. The shores of Lake Assad have developed into important ecological zones.  - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\"). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 .  - The Tigris is the eastern member of the two great rivers that define Mesopotamia, the other being the Euphrates. The river flows south from the mountains of southeastern Turkey through Iraq and empties itself into the Persian Gulf.  - Shatt al-Arab (  \\"River of the Arabs\\") or Arvand Rud (\\"Swift River\\") is a river in Southwest Asia of some 200 km (120 mi) in length, formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and the Tigris in the town of al-Qurnah in the Basra Governorate of southern Iraq. The southern end of the river constitutes the border between Iraq and Iran down to the mouth of the river as it discharges into the Persian Gulf. It varies in width from about at Basra to at its mouth. It is thought that the waterway formed relatively recently in geologic time, with the Tigris and Euphrates originally emptying into the Persian Gulf via a channel further to the west.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Aleppo (/ ALA-LC: \\"\\") is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate. With an official population of 2,132,100 (2004 census), Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War; however, now Aleppo is likely the second-largest city in Syria after the capital Damascus.  - Aleppo Governorate (/ ALA-LC: \\"Mufaat alab\\" / ) is one of the fourteen governorates of Syria. It is the most populous governorate in Syria with a population of more than 4,868,000 (2011 Est.), almost 23% of the total population of Syria. The governorate is the fifth in area with an area of 18,482 km², about 10% of the total area of Syria. The capital is the city of Aleppo. The governorate is represented by 52 deputies in the parliament (out of 250), of whom 20 come from the city of Aleppo.  - Barbalissos ( Latinized as Barbalissus ) was a city in the Roman province of Euphratensis . Its site is marked by the ruins at Qala'at Balis , which partly retains the old name , south of Maskanah ( the ancient Emar ) , in modern Syria , on the road from Aleppo to the site of Sura , where the Euphrates turns suddenly to the east .  - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - The Persian Gulf is a mediterranean sea in Western Asia. The body of water is an extension of the Indian Ocean (Gulf of Oman) through the Strait of Hormuz and lies between Iran to the northeast and the Arabian Peninsula to the southwest. The Shatt al-Arab river delta forms the northwest shoreline.  - Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometers at its height in AD 117.  - The Euphrates (Sumerian: : \\"Buranuna\\", : \\"Purattu\\", : \\"al-Furt\\", : \\"Prt\\", : \\"Yeprat\\", : \\"Perat\\", ) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia. Together with the Tigris, it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia. Originating in eastern Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf.  - Ebla (modern: , Tell Mardikh), was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the third millennium BC and in the first half of the second millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia, and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the early Bronze Age. Karl Moore described the first Eblaite kingdom as the first recorded world power.  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa).

Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.  Question:   Would it require more strength for a construction worker to move a heavy load of bricks with a pulley that used 1 rope segment? or 10 rope segments?    Paragraph :  The more rope segments on a pully that are helping to do the lifting work, the less force that is needed for the job.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, utilizing more rope segments on a pulley system would require less force to lift a heavy load of bricks. Therefore, it would require more strength for a construction worker to move a heavy load of bricks with a pulley that used only 1 rope segment as compared to a pulley that used 10 rope segments. To further explain this concept, let's dive into the mechanics of the pulley system. A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a wheel with a grooved rim, through which a rope or a cable runs. The pulley system helps to reduce the effort needed to lift a load by increasing the number of rope segments used to share the load. When using a single rope segment, the construction worker would have to apply a force equal to the weight of the bricks to lift them. However, as the number of rope segments increases, the lifting force is distributed among each of the segments. This causes the force required to lift the load to decrease, which means that less strength is needed to perform the task. In a pulley system with 10 rope segments, for instance, each rope would carry only 1/10th of the total load, resulting in a significant reduction in the force needed to lift the bricks compared to a single-rope pulley system. In summary, a construction worker would need more strength to lift a heavy load of bricks using a pulley that has only 1 rope segment, while a pulley system with 10 rope segments would require significantly less effort and force due to the load being distributed among the multiple rope segments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: . The power of positive thinking is not just a myth. In fact, positive thoughts are key to dieting properly. Thinking positive thoughts can increase your motivation and energy levels. Negative thoughts, on the other hand, can lead to behaviors such as emotional eating and skipping a workout.  Avoid negativity. Try to not get angry at yourself if you slip up and reach for pizza instead of a healthier option. Instead, get back on track the next day. Some days it can be hard to feel comfortable in your own skin. It doesn't help when you're surrounded by images in the media of exceedingly thin celebrities; however, a positive body image is very important to your overall health and wellness. It will increase your confidence and make you more likely to make healthy choices.   Focus on the good things. If you really like your arms, tell yourself that when you look in the mirror. Make it a habit to compliment yourself at least once a day. Tape a positive affirmation or quote to the mirror. Seeing encouragement each day will help you gain a more positive body image over time. . Stop beating yourself up. Research shows that if you are kinder to yourself you will be more successful in your fitness goals. When you have a negative thought, try to acknowledge it and then let it go. There's really no point in berating yourself for skipping the gym. It's much more effective to forgive yourself and move on.  Tell someone (or everyone) that you're dieting.  Making a public declaration can increase your chances of success by holding you accountable to others.  It can also engender the support you need from family members and friends who can cheer you on to your goal. Join a support group.  This could be formal group such as Weight Watchers or simply a group you organize yourself.  Post an ad on Craigslist looking for weight-loss partners or organize or join a Meetup group dedicated to healthier eating. Post inspirational sayings on your fridge.  Having mood-boosting words-of-wisdom close at hand can help you handle a difficult diet day. Do things that make you feel good.  Get a pedicure, have your hair done, buy a new perfume.  Little things that make you feel special and pampered can offset the feeling of deprivation that can sometimes creep in when you're dieting.","output":"Positive thinking helps you in dieting by giving you more motivation and energy.

The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.

News article: Image copyright Court exhibit Image caption Dellen Millard at his father's firm MillardAir      A former Canadian millionaire and twice-convicted murderer has been convicted of killing his father, whose death was initially ruled a suicide.      Dellen Millard wept when he heard the judge pronounce him guilty of murdering his father Wayne Millard.      Millard is already serving two life sentences for the murders of Laura Babcock and Tim Bosma.      He inherited the family fortune after his father was found shot in the head.      The 2012 death was originally ruled a suicide, but on Monday an Ontario Superior Court judge found him guilty of shooting his father while he slept.      Millard had told police his father had been depressed and an alcoholic.      \\"He carried some great sadness with him throughout life that I never knew - he never wanted to share that with me,\\" he said the day after his father died.      But employees at MillardAir, the family's aviation company, said there had been tensions between Millard and his father, according to a CBC investigation.      Six months later, the disappearance of Tim Bosma set off a chain of investigations that would eventually lead to Millard being charged with three murders.      'It was just a truck'      The 32-year-old was trying to sell his vehicle when Millard responded to an ad online. Millard and his friend Mark Smich met Bosma at his family home outside Hamilton, Ontario.      Bosma agreed to go with the pair while they took it for a test drive in May 2013. He was never seen again.      \\"It was just a truck, a stupid truck,\\" Bosma's wife said, before Smich and Millard's arrest.      Bosma's truck was eventually found by police on a property owned by Millard's mother, and soon he and Smich became prime suspects in his murder. The truck had been stripped, but gunshot residue and traces of his blood were found inside.      Police also began digging around into Millard's past, his father's death, and the disappearance of his former partner Laura Babcock the year before.      The first killing      Three months before his father's death, Babcock had gone missing.      Eventually, police would learn that she had been involved in a love triangle between Millard and his current girlfriend, and that Millard had promised to \\"remove her from our lives\\".      Her body was never found, but soon after her disappearance Millard purchased an incinerator. Police have never been able to identify Babcock's and Bosma's remains, but believe both were shot and their bodies burned.      Millard and Smich were found guilty of Bosma's murder in 2016; they were also found guilty of murdering Babcock in 2017.      Father and son      Police then began to re-examine Wayne Millard's apparent suicide following the convictions,      Prosecutors alleged Millard wanted to kill his father to protect his inheritance, which was being used to fund a new aviation business.      Millard said he was at Smich's house the night of his father's death, but phone records reveal he travelled back to his father's house in the early hours of the morning.      A gun purchased by Millard illegally was also found next to his father with Millard's DNA on it.      Smich was not charged in the death of Millard's father. ||||| A Toronto man who stood to inherit a multimillion-dollar aviation company was found guilty of first-degree murder in his father’s death Monday, a ruling that marked his third such conviction.      Applause broke out as a judge declared Dellen Millard had carried out a planned and deliberate killing of his father, whose death was initially ruled a suicide.      Wayne Millard, a wealthy 71-year-old businessman, was found dead in his bed with a bullet lodged in his brain on Nov. 29, 2012. His son had pleaded not guilty in the death but the judge hearing the case found otherwise.      Story continues below advertisement      “I am satisfied that Dellen Millard killed his father by shooting him in the left eye as he slept,” said Justice Maureen Forestell. “I can find no theory consistent with innocence.”      Millard, 33, cried softly as the decision was read out to a packed courtroom.      Among those who had gathered for the ruling in the judge-alone trial were the parents of Millard’s two other victims, Toronto woman Laura Babcock and Hamilton man Tim Bosma. Babcock’s father said all three families would be forever linked as a result of Millard’s crimes.      “It’s been proven that not only has the Bosmas and ourselves have lost a loved one, the Millard family must live with the fact this heinous individual murdered his own father,” Clayton Babcock said outside court. “There’ll be not a day in our lives when the loss of Laura, Tim or Wayne won’t be felt.”      Crown attorney Ken Lockhart said he was grateful for the outcome of the case.      “I hope that the process has brought (the families) some kind of closure,” he said.      Wayne Millard’s death was Dellen Millard’s second murder.      Story continues below advertisement      Story continues below advertisement      He had killed Babcock, a 24-year-old woman he had been seeing, months earlier in July 2012. Six months after his father’s death, Millard killed Bosma after taking the 32-year-old man’s truck for a test drive.      Millard’s friend, Mark Smich, was also convicted of first-degree murder for the Babcock and Bosma slayings. The pair are serving life in prison with no chance for parole for 50 years for those murders.      Police reopened the case of Wayne Millard’s death after arresting the younger Millard for Bosma’s killing.      The latest trial unfolded in June without a jury. The Attorney General granted a defence request for a judge-alone proceeding after agreeing that Millard’s notoriety, given the Bosma and Babcock murders, would make it impossible to find fair jurors.      Prosecutors alleged Millard killed his father because millions in potential inheritance money was being squandered on a new aviation business.      Forestell rejected significant parts of the Crown’s case, including the motive for money, saying it played no role in her decision. Instead, she found the case turned on a lie Millard told investigators after his father’s death.      Story continues below advertisement      The trial heard Millard told police he found his father dead in bed around 6 p.m. on Nov. 29, 2012. He said he last saw his father alive around noon the day before and had then stayed the night at Smich’s house. But phone records indicated that one of Millard’s phones moved from Smich’s house around 1 a.m. on Nov. 29, 2012, to his father’s home where it stayed until shortly after 6 a.m.      “I do not believe the statement of Dellen Millard that he stayed at Mark’s,” Forestell said. “I find it was fabricated to conceal he was involved in the death of his father.”      Forestell also said Millard created a false alibi after leaving his truck, credit card and his other phone at Smich’s house.      The trial also heard that Dellen Millard, who did not testify in his own defence, bought a handgun found next to his father’s body from a weapons dealer – evidence Forestell accepted. Dellen Millard’s DNA was on the gun.      The defence argued Wayne Millard’s death was a suicide.      Dellen Millard told police his father was depressed, an alcoholic and under a tremendous amount of stress because of his efforts to turn around the family’s aviation business, court heard.      “He carried some great sadness with him throughout life that I never knew – he never wanted to share that with me,” Dellen Millard told police in an interview played in court.      Wayne Millard had inherited the family aviation business, Millardair, from his father, Carl Millard, in 2006. It had been launched as a cargo carrier in 1963 and later flew passengers before going bankrupt in 1990, court heard.      The company then rented out aircraft hangars at Toronto’s Pearson airport until 2010, when Wayne Millard moved into the maintenance, repair and overhaul business and built a massive, multi-million dollar hangar at the Region of Waterloo International Airport by 2012.      The trial heard that Dellen Millard blamed his father for the company’s financial issues.      “The last time I spoke to him, I told him the company’s financial troubles were his doing and that he was a failure,” Millard wrote in a text to his girlfriend that was presented in court. “Usually he tells me not to worry. But this time he said maybe I was right.”      Days after his father’s death, Dellen Millard fired everyone at Millardair and wound the business down, court heard.      A sentencing hearing for Millard is scheduled for Nov. 16. The Crown said it will seek an additional 25 years of parole ineligibility for Millard in his father’s death. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A man from Canada named Dellen Millard used to be very rich. He has already been found guilty of killing two people, and now he has been found guilty of killing his own father too. At first, people thought that his father had killed himself, but then a judge found out that Dellen had actually shot his father while he was sleeping.

Russia slaps economic sanctions on Turkey over downing of military jet Russia has slapped economic sanctions on Turkey in the latest tit-for-tat move over the downing of a Russian warplane, as Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was \\"saddened\\" by the jet incident. With the row showing no sign of abating, the Kremlin released the text of a decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin that announced an end to charter flights between the two countries, a ban on Russian businesses hiring any new Turkish nationals and import restrictions on certain Turkish goods. It also asked Russian tour operators to refrain from selling trips to Turkey, normally a top holiday destination for Russian tourists. The new measures come into effect from January 1, 2016. The list of Turkish goods subject to \\"bans or limitations\\" has not yet been made public. The Kremlin announcement came just hours after Erdogan made his most conciliatory comments to date over the shooting down of the jet, saying he wished Tuesday's incident had never happened. Turkey claims the Su-24 warplane strayed into its airspace and ignored repeated warnings to change course, but Russia has insists it did not cross the border from Syria. The incident is thought to be the first downing of a Russian plane by a NATO member in more than half a century. \\"I'm really saddened,\\" Mr Erdogan said. \\"We wish it had never happened, but it happened. I hope something like this doesn't happen again. \\"We hope that the issue between us and Russia does not escalate any further, become corrosive and have dire consequences in the future.\\" He also renewed a call to Putin for a face-to-face meeting in Paris on the sidelines of a UN climate summit on Monday. But the Turkish leader stopped short of apologising for the incident, as a furious Putin had earlier demanded. \\"Russia is important for Turkey as much as Turkey is important for Russia. Both countries cannot afford to give up on each other,\\" Mr Erdogan said. A day earlier the Turkish leader had struck a more combative tone, warning Moscow not to \\"play with fire\\" as Russia announced it was halting visa-free travel for Turkish visitors, also from January 1. Turkey's foreign ministry has warned its citizens against non-essential travel to Russia \\"until the situation becomes clearer. UN chief Ban Ki-moon told France 24 that the jet incident was \\"regrettable\\" and urged both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue, stressing that they were key members in the fight against the Islamic State jihadist group. One of the Russian pilots aboard the downed plane was shot dead in Syria after parachuting from the burning aircraft, while the second was found safe and sound. One Russian soldier was killed in a rescue operation. Moscow has ruled out any military response, but has pledged broad measures targeting entire sectors of the Turkish economy including tourism, agriculture and possibly key energy projects. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said Turkey had \\"crossed the line of what is acceptable\\" and warned the incident could severely undermine Turkey's national interests. The two countries have established significant trade ties in recent years and Russia is already energy-poor Turkey's biggest oil and gas supplier. But they are on opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, with Ankara backing rebels fighting to topple Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad while Moscow is one of his last remaining allies. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu meanwhile sought to ease tensions and appealed for the world to unite against IS, in an editorial published in The Times newspaper. \\"The focus should be to tackle, head-on, the international threat that Daesh (IS) poses, securing the future of Syria and seeking a solution to the current refugee crisis,\\" he wrote. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Russia putting economic sanctions on Turkey because Turkey shot down a Russian military jet.

We agree. The condition imposed is not listed in the sentencing guidelines as a standard or mandatory condition of supervised release, and it is not among the conditions recommended by the Sentencing Commission insofar as the record does not support its application here.

Part #3: Evaluating five answer choices containing different holding statements. Usage: (A) holding that a conflict with oral pronouncement is not created by including conditions that are standard mandatory or recommended by the sentencing commission.

The text provides several clues that suggest this is the most accurate answer among the given options. Firstly, the mention of \\"fallen fences and wild trees\\" hints at an open and perhaps somewhat untamed landscape outdoors with tree growth. The next part, \\"we watch the sunset and ate a few tree ripened mangoes,\\" further clarifies that the location has mango trees, and that these trees bear fruit. In addition, the subsequent reference to specific mango varieties—such as Bowen, Nam Dok Mai, KP, and Elephant Tusk—indicates that not only are there mango trees at the site, but they are of a diverse range, showcasing a level of specialization seen in fruit farming. The mention of \\"tonnes of... mangoes just splotting on the ground below\\" within two weeks points to the immense quantities of fruit produced, which is a common characteristic of a commercial fruit farm. Summing up, although there is a remote possibility that the location is a tree farm (option [i]) growing several kinds of trees, including mango trees, the context and specific details provided in the text support the conclusion that the location is an actual mango farm (option [iv]).

A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes. Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females  swim to land. They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown. When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers. When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs. The turtles lay the eggs in deep holes and cover them with warm sand. The sand protects the eggs from harm. Then the females leave them. After a few weeks, if you happened to be walking along the beach, you might see the sand begin to shake. You may see tiny black balls coming out of the sand. The tiny heads of baby turtles!

Depending on the context, here are a few things this could mean: 1. Life expectancy of Bill and Melinda: Without specific information regarding when Bill and Melinda are expected to pass away, the precise year by which all the trust's resources must be spent cannot be identified. However, it is clear that the timeline for the spending is pegged to their lifetimes.  2. Trust lifespan: According to the statement, the trust resources will be depleted within two decades following the demise of both Bill and Melinda. This means that the trust has a defined lifespan, which will likely affect its investment, grant-making, and spending strategies. A trust with a \\"spend-down\\" mandate such as this may adopt a more aggressive spending approach compared to a trust intended to exist in perpetuity. 3. Financial implications: In terms of financial management, this could change the way the Trust's resources are managed. If the resources have to be spent within 20 years of Bill and Melinda Gates' deaths, it may mean that the Trust doesn't have to invest in long-term, safe options but can instead consider riskier, high-yield investments. 4. Legal and operational considerations: The decision places a legal obligation on the trust to carry out the stated mandate. It also necessitates careful future planning in terms of operational execution, selection of programs and initiatives to support, as well as estimation of potential contingencies. To sum up, based on the provided statement, the trust resources must be completely spent within 20 years after both Bill and Melinda Gates pass away. This timeline introduces certain constraints and opportunities which will influence how the trust operates and manages its money.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday adopted a broad expansion and overhaul of its program to bring high-speed Internet into schools and libraries, a move that will also add to the fees tacked on to the phone bills of Americans each month. The E-Rate program, part of the Universal Service Fund, will grow by 1.5 billion, to a spending cap of 3.9 billion, the first change in the base spending cap since it was set in 1997. F.C.C. officials said consumers would pay less than 2 a year in additional fees per phone line, or less than 6 extra per household, on average; the average household now pays about 36 a year for multiple phone lines. The amount an individual household pays can vary widely, with fees assessed on both home and mobile service. Businesses pay into the program as well. The approval came in a 3-2 vote split on political party lines and drew fiery dissents from the two Republican commissioners. Ajit Pai, one of the Republican commissioners, said that the proposal “shies away from real reform” and “simply pours money into a broken system.” Michael O’Rielly, the other Republican commissioner, said the changes would make the fund “more complex, less efficient and potentially wasteful.” Over all, the 8.7 billion Universal Service Fund has grown about 20 percent since President Obama took office. The E-Rate program accounts for about 28 percent of the fund. Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, strongly disagreed. “I am aghast at the hostility that is expressed to giving students the tools they need to get a 21st century education,” he said. The commission’s action drew praise from Democratic members of Congress. “The F.C.C.’s vote will ensure that our schools and libraries achieve the connection speeds and Wi-Fi needed to connect fully with our interconnected world,” said Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. The F.C.C. also approved an order requiring companies receiving financing from the Connect America program, a part of the fund aimed at high-cost, rural areas, for use in fixed broadband connections to provide a minimum download speed of 10 megabits per second. The commission also released a public notice seeking comment on detailed proposals for conducting the broadcast television incentive auction, in which willing broadcasters will agree to give up their airwaves or move to a different spot on the broadcast spectrum in exchange for a portion of the proceeds from the auction of those airwaves.

Originally the social network rejected calls from users to delete the clips saying that it wanted to \\"preserve people's rights to describe, depict and comment on the world\\". But after the BBC revealed that one of its own safety advisers - the head of the Family Online Safety Institute - had criticised its decision, the firm announced a U-turn, saying it would remove clips showing beheadings while it re-evaluated its rules. That potentially opens a can of worms. Since publishing the article, readers have contacted the BBC to complain about other videos, including: In all cases they said the network had refused their requests to remove the material. A spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed its policy had only been amended in regard to decapitations. But imposing stricter controls would open the firm up to other criticism. Before his death, internet freedom campaigner Aaron Swartz warned of the dangers of privately owned parts of the net limiting what was posted onto their sites. He called this \\"corporate tyranny\\" and named Facebook as a specific concern. The social network could not provide a date for when its review would be complete. The following range of opinions suggest it will struggle to please everyone. More than a billion people express themselves and comment on the world in which we live through Facebook and most of the time this is entirely without problem. On occasions, there are concerns about some of the content that is being shared and we have put in place a reporting system so that people can tell us about this. The reported content is evaluated against our community standards and appropriate action is taken where our rules have been breached. When drawing up and enforcing our approach to acceptable behaviour and content on Facebook, we aim to strike the right balance between enabling people to share information, news and content - and protecting the community as a whole. This is a complex challenge as Facebook is a large, diverse community and we are continually presented with novel situations. While we freely admit that we do not always get it right, the trouble-free daily experience of the vast majority of Facebook users demonstrates that our systems are working well in all but the most exceptional cases and that they are improving over time. Facebook online safety As we said last week, we are reviewing our rules related to content showing graphic violence. In doing so we are clear that there are situations where it is important for people to be able to share content through Facebook even if this can at times be quite shocking. For example, people caught up in violent incidents such as the recent Boston bombings or the ongoing conflict in Syria want to be able to report on their experiences and may use quite graphic content to do this. This illustrates the kind of challenge that our highly experienced team deals with on a daily basis as we strive to offer a space for sharing that is mindful of everyone's expectations. As a person who holds a strong sense of justice, I had no hesitation in setting up a petition for the removal of the sickening decapitation video I was shocked to find on my Facebook news feed. What shocked me even more was the fact that I had to actually make a petition in any hope for the video to be removed. No matter how many times my friends and I reported it, we all received the same message, stating that \\"it doesn't violate Facebook's community standard on graphic violence, which includes depicting harm to someone or something\\". How does a video of an innocent woman being brutally murdered not \\"violate\\" this? I can only hope that there is a criminal investigation that will bring her justice. As a loyal Facebook fan, I understand that Facebook is only allowing people to have freedom of speech. However, I think it is about time they drew a line between what is and isn't appropriate for the public. Facebook videos petition Facebook's audience starts from children aged 13 - what I feared the most was that my younger sister could easily have witnessed that disgusting video. No-one should be exposed to such graphic horror. Sadly, that video isn't the only inappropriate content to have wandered onto Facebook recently. I have heard of others showing extreme violence and cruelty to both humans and animals. It's time that new stricter regulations are made by Facebook in order to remove these vile videos for good so that it might return to being the safe social network it used to be. Any intervention by Facebook to remove or block access to content beyond what a court might order - while respecting basic fundamental rights and the principle of proportionality - would in practice amount to privatised censorship, and nobody has an interest in going there. A dominant, centralised actor such as Facebook would be incentivised to spend as little money as possible determining which content would be lawful or not, suitable or not, etc. This would raise the question of what criteria would be used. Opening such a breach would ensure that any government could pressure Facebook to consider their own criteria, whether for political, religious or other reasons. Under such conditions we can be sure that the fundamental right to freedom of speech or the right to a fair trial would not be respected. As surely as we cannot trust giant centralised corporations to defend our fundamental freedoms, we cannot ask them to become the judges and enforcers of what information should be shared online. La Quadrature du Net Protecting children on the net is a responsibility of their parents in the first place. It cannot be outsourced to Facebook. It is a matter of educating them about the difference between between privacy, publicity and a circle of trust. Since Facebook collects and stores so much information it should be able to determine when one of its members is a minor and is about to be exposed to content that has been reported as unsuitable, and display a warning message. Users would then be free to choose to take that advice, or make a conscious choice to access the content. Facebook, and most other social media sites, have explicit terms of service about what is and what is not acceptable to be hosted on their websites. Family Online Safety Institute Some go further and have created what are known as community standards. These more clearly state the rules about what kinds of content will be removed. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have robust reporting mechanisms so that ordinary users can flag inappropriate or abusive content for review. What is challenging for these companies is how and where to draw the line. This will help them determine when to invoke the \\"public interest\\" principle in keeping material - such as images from the Boston Marathon bombing - up on their site, even though they depict graphic violence. This is new territory for us all as we navigate the rules, ethics and standards of user-generated content sites. The controversy over Facebook's treatment of shocking videos of beheadings is the latest illustration of the enormous complexity at work when it comes to promoting the exercise of human rights online. Billions of people rely on internet platforms to speak and access information in the networked public sphere, but the platforms are controlled by private companies, whose terms of service in large part determine the contours of free expression. In one sense, platform operators are themselves speakers that have the right to determine their own policies.  At the same time, these \\"digital sovereigns\\" - to borrow a phrase from Rebecca MacKinnon - effectively govern their users' exercise of free expression rights. Platforms have a responsibility, particularly as they grow to Facebook-scale, to consider the human rights impact of their policies and to minimise restrictions on free expression. Center for Democracy & Technology This is especially true with respect to government restrictions.  It would be troubling indeed if government pressure precipitated the video's removal in this case. A key step in carrying out this responsibility is ensuring that content policies are clearly communicated and fairly applied. The horrific beheading video and Facebook's reported reaction demonstrate the challenges that arise when trying to develop and apply clear, consistent standards in the complex and multi-faceted realm of online communication. Context matters a great deal. Different companies might draw the line in different places, and just because something is offensive or disturbing does not mean it necessarily violates a particular term.  And it certainly does not make it illegal. Because of this complexity, systems for assessing content require constant refinement to ensure that free expression is protected. Advocates, too, must remain vigilant that the private players that provide so much public value online are meeting their responsibilities to users. Is it complicated and prone to mistakes and close calls? Yes, but the alternative - mandated content policies and individual governments vying for control over the global internet - is untenable and fraught with risk for free expression. The main concern, as an experienced psychologist, in working with the effects of actual and vicarious violence is a lack of awareness of violation of choice. Material is posted on news feeds and \\"liked\\" indiscriminately without thought as to the rights of under-aged youngsters and others who may view it. People, whether young or old, can be negatively affected by witnessing violence either on screen or in reality. Effects include trauma responses such as replaying the images, feeling scared and vulnerable, ashamed, invaded or violated and confused, as well as angry and helpless, which is reinforced via the news feed as these things pop up uninvited. Ethical codes are there for safety and to preserve the right to choose what is viewed when users are considered of age or able to understand the implications. Social media sites are mostly not obliged to adhere to such codes which creates a problem, particularly if they issue their own vague inadequate guidelines. Social networks' news feeds allow material to arrive on people's pages that might never be sought by choice. Jordan Counselling Extensive \\"friendship lists\\" develop with people who may not be actual friends but through casual contact get \\"befriended\\", perhaps out of obligation or a need to fit in, be liked etc. The material is often posted supposedly to prevent the spread of violent crime or other violations, but in fact it can inadvertently escalate it by sidestepping the consent of the people accessing the feeds. This is reminiscent of the \\"ban smoking in public places\\" debate with the concern of whose rights we are protecting. In that debate it was largely about public physical health. This debate concerns public mental health and wellbeing.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where were the first modern greenhouses built?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad.\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where were the first modern greenhouses built?\\" The sentence indicates that the first modern greenhouses were constructed in Europe during the 16th century. To provide more context, greenhouses are structures with transparent walls and roofs that create a controlled environment to cultivate plants. These enclosures protect the plants from external factors, such as temperature, precipitation, pests, and diseases, making it easier to grow varieties that may otherwise struggle to survive in the local climate. The concept of greenhouses can be traced back to ancient times, with evidence of greenhouses-like structures used by the Romans (e.g., Pliny the Elder described structures made with sheets of mica) and the Chinese to cultivate plants. However, the term \\"modern greenhouses\\" refers to the structures that were built during the Renaissance period, incorporating different technologies and designs to effectively regulate temperature and humidity. The 16th century was a time of exploration and discovery, when European explorers traveled to distant lands and started to bring back exotic plants from various regions, such as the Americas. These plants, such as pineapple, tobacco, and pepper, piqued the interest of European botanists, who aimed to study and cultivate them. In order to adapt to the non-native climates of Europe, they required appropriate conditions for their growth, which led to the development of modern greenhouses. The first modern greenhouses consisted of glass, brick, and wood construction, with crystal-clear Flemish glass allowing maximum sunlight and heat retention. As the greenhouse technology advanced, designs and materials improved, leading to the development of greenhouses that could be heated with stoves, ventilation systems, and double-layered glass for better insulation. By the 17th and 18th centuries, greenhouses became a symbol of prestige for wealthy families. The trend of building greenhouses for the purpose of growing exotic plants promoted scientific curiosity, as well as a fascination with horticulture. In conclusion, the first modern greenhouses were constructed in Europe during the 16th century to accommodate the increasing demand for cultivating and studying exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. These structures evolved over time, incorporating advanced features and better materials to create the controlled environments that we now associate with greenhouses today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eye contact and smiling are two universal acts of flirting. Looking at someone from across a room lets them know that you notice them. Choices: A. You don't need to look uncomfortable or nervous, but really what you're trying to do is to make eye contact, open your mouth slightly, and smile in turn. When you touch your nose to theirs or head slightly back, it sends the right message to them and starts a conversation; other times, a shy or nervous smile actually starts the conversation.; B. Doing things that other people can't cannot makes a person feel good about themselves while slowly trying to attract them. Smiling and making eye contact enables you to attract a person who is confident in their looks.; C. When you smile, you're showing them that you are open to talking to them and that you may be interested in them, or that you like how they look. Don't force a smile or stare at them, however! You can meet a potential date at school, work, a grocery store, a bar, or in other social situations.; D. Try to not appear nervous or stiff when you meet someone. However, try to feel relaxed in your eye contact.; Answer:","output":"Your flirtatious overtures can begin with making eye contact and exhibiting a friendly smile. This simple interpersonal approach tends to convey preliminary interest and may potentially grab someone's attention, prompting them to notice you in a crowd or social setting. Option A suggests making consistent eye contact and showcasing a genuine smile in a bid to convey an interest in getting to know the person better. It encourages sending positive signals through body language, such as making slight moves with your head or touching your nose to theirs. It underscores the importance of maintaining relaxed demeanor and making sure not to appear nervous or uncomfortable. Your gestures can then naturally pave the way for starting a conversation. Option B indicates that being confident about oneself tends to make one attractive to others. It prompts making regular eye contact while smiling as an effective means of making an impression on the person of interest. But this does not necessarily entail doing what others cannot. It is ultimately about genuinely expressing your interest notably through your demeanor. Option C advises that when you exchange smiles with someone, you demonstrate your openness for conversation and potential interest in them. It cautions against forcing gestures or maintaining an unblinking stare that might intimidate or unnerve the person concerned. It suggests that potential dating opportunities may present themselves in various social spaces, whether it's school, work, or even a grocery store. Option D recommends maintaining a relaxed appearance and not seeming overly nervous when making eye contact with the person you're interested in. If you appear calm and confident, you are more likely to successfully attract and engage with potential dates. In short, all the options carry valid suggestions on how to make the first approach by engaging with a smile and maintaining eye contact. The most effective approach can depend on your personal style, the nature of the social situation and the responses of the person you are interested in. Confidence is key and sincere gestures are often appreciated. Additionally, identifying the right location such as a public place with a relaxed atmosphere helps in easing initial conversations and potentially sets the stage for asking someone out on a date."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Julius Caesar is informed, and laughs. He makes a decision with his council and goes to Armorica, to speak with Vitalstatistix.

The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1.\\tRun faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The Indian capital is a city of extreme contradictions - if the summer heat doesn't burn you alive, the winter chill can freeze your soul. The city of 25 million people, with more trees per square kilometre than any other in India, also has the dubious distinction of being the world's most polluted. The World Health Organisation says the air here is so toxic that it kills more than 30,000 people annually. Delhi has sprawling wide roads, but the traffic is a nightmare. Streets are choked at peak hours, and boorish drivers who have little regard for road rules or laws only add to the misery. But this overcrowded city with limited resources still remains a magnet, that every day draws thousands from across India, in search of new dreams. Steeped in tradition and history, Delhi has inspired poets, artists and writers over the centuries. But in recent years, it has been in the news for all sorts of wrong reasons. After a series of high-profile crimes against women, it has been dubbed the rape capital of India. The city's infrastructure has been criticised for being massively inadequate - there are long spells of power cuts and water shortages. And despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to clean up India, in many Delhi neighbourhoods the walls and sidewalks are stained with spit, the air is filled with the stench of urine, and litter and dog poop line streets and walkways in community parks. The organisers of Delhi I Love You - or simply called DILY, the way the city's name is pronounced in Hindi - say it is this negative image that they want to change. The brainchild of Frenchmen Thomas Ellis and Alexis de Ducla, who have made Delhi their adopted home, along with some of their Indian friends, the DILY festival aims to \\"celebrate the city and its people\\". And they are not trying to gloss over the problems. \\"Delhi has unfortunately built a bad image in the last few years, from the rising crime towards women to it being the most polluted city in the world. We are conscious of these issues, but the picture is not all that gloomy,\\" says Mr de Ducla. \\"When you have so many millions living together, there are bound to be problems. But then you see Delhi'ites taking to the streets to protest against these things.\\" \\"We don't say we can change the bad traffic or build new infrastructure. All we are saying is look at what's good in this city,\\" he adds. And good is what Mr Ellis says he encounters at every turn in the city. \\"I've been living in Delhi for the past eight years. Here, you encounter humanity on every corner. This is one place where you can meet people from different social classes on the same day.\\" Over the past 18 months, the festival organisers say they have met more than 600 residents of Delhi, including students, activists, artists, poets, historians and government ministers and officials to solicit support, and over a period of 30 months, 120 events will be held as part of the celebrations. At the end of it, 12 short films will be stitched together into a feature to be part of the Cities of Love series that has already featured Paris, New York and Rio. The celebrations kicked off in early September with #MyDilliStory - an online Twitter competition inviting  people to share their stories, poems and anecdotes about the city. They received more than 8,000 entries in Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and English and 40 of the best tweets are being painted on walls and flyovers across the city. The author of the winning tweet in English, college student Chhaya Dabbas says even though there is plenty in the city that she loathes, there's plenty more that she loves. \\"It's a constant fight between tradition and modernity here. The city is definitely unsafe for women, I've been harassed and teased many times. \\"But I equate the city with dreams and aspirations. It provides a home for everyone. I was born and raised here, but it's equally kind or cruel to those who come from outside to live here,\\" she says.","output":"\\"Delhi I Love You\\" is a festival in India that aims to celebrate the city and its people and change the negative image of Delhi, which has issues like pollution, crime, and inadequate infrastructure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" is a popular song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. It was first recorded by Bobby Vee for Liberty Records on March 28, 1962. The lyrics consist of a young man asking a young attractive woman to stay away from him, so that he will not be tempted to betray his steady girlfriend by kissing her. The song is notable for making the American Top 20 three times: for Steve Lawrence in 1962 (US number 1), for The Happenings in 1966 (US number 12), and for Donny Osmond in 1971 (US number 1). It is also the first song, and one of only nine, to reach US number 1 by two different artists.  - \\"The Closer I Get to You\\" is a romantic ballad performed by African American jazz, soul, R&B, and folk singer-songwriter Roberta Flack and African American soul musician Donny Hathaway. The song was written by James Mtume and Reggie Lucas, two former members of Miles Davis' band, who were members of Flack's band at the time. Produced by Atlantic Records, the song was released on Flack's 1977 album \\"Blue Lights in the Basement\\", and as a single in 1978. It became a major crossover hit, becoming Flack's biggest commercial hit after her success with her 1973 solo single, \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\". Originally set as a solo-single, Flack's manager, David Franklin, suggested a duet with Hathaway, which resulted in the finished work.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - Carole King (born Carol Joan Klein, February 9, 1942) is an American composer and singer-songwriter.

A more appropriate answer to the question could be: Visible light is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, with wavelengths that range from approximately 380 nanometers (for violet light) to 750 nanometers (for red light). The size of visible light waves typically refers to their wavelengths, as the concept of \\"size\\" does not directly apply to electromagnetic waves.

Until 1964 it was known as the Army Council.  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines.

Denise Chen and Wen Zhou have been experimenting with the science of smell, and have made some very interesting discoveries.                To explore that, you will need two things with strong, characteristic smells and, of course, your nose. The idea is to smell a different smell with each nostril  . Hold one smell very close to your right nostril, and the other smell very close to your left nostril. Then breathe in and pay close attention to what you smell.               What you should find is that one smell will be very strong. After another sniff   or two, the first smell will go away, and you will smell the other smell. Keep sniffing, and the first smell will come back. Instead of smelling the two smells evenly   mixed, they will work in turns, one after the other.               Why? Chen and Zhou found that your sense of smell acts much like your sense of sight. Hold a book in front of your nose, so that your left eye sees things on the left side of the book, and your right eye sees things on the right side of the book. You will find that your sight works in turns, first on the left side of the book and then on the right side. Notice that you can't focus your left eye on one object while focusing your right eye on another object. Your brain jumps back and forth  , paying attention to one and then the other.

PRO TIPS How to Be a White Person on Halloween (Hint: Skip the Blackface) By Rembert Browne on October 28, 2013 4:30 PM ET      DEVONE BYRD/PACIFICCOASTNEWS      I've never been a white person for Halloween. Because I have no interest in ever being white, even for a costume party. And for me, there is a never-ending, exponentially growing supply of amazing black people to impersonate.      Last year, I was Madea. For an entire weekend, I proudly walked around New York City dressed as a gun-toting, \\"Hallelujer\\"-ing woman in a muumuu. And I'd do it 10 more times before it would ever occur to me that \\"maybe this is the year to be Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs.\\"      Because it's just not happening.      There are some amazing white people, though. White people who, at times, I'm a little bummed I'll never portray for Halloween. I've been studying the Independence Day Jeff Goldblum \\"We just saved Earth, watch me stunt with this cigar until my girl jumps into my arms\\" strut for years. It'd be kind of nice to be him for Halloween. But then I think, why not let my boy Matt, a wonderfully Jewish fellow with similarly amazing dark hair, be Goldblum? I'm more than happy being Jaden's dad.      So I can understand why you, a white person, might want to be someone black for Halloween. I know what you're thinking: The only thing more fun and carefree than being black is being temporarily black.      I get it. And no one has the right to tell you that you can't be a temporary black for Halloween. Do you.      But, in \\"doing you,\\" understand that there are risks. For instance, just a few days ago, actress Julianne Hough \\"did her,\\" and gave the world grounds to describe her actions as racist, by darkening her face to portray Uzo Aduba's character from Orange Is the New Black. \\"Doing Julianne\\" backfired on Julianne, because blackface always backfires on the person whose face was temporarily blackened.      Chances are, if someone tells you they were hurt by Julianne Hough's Halloween outfit, they are exaggerating. But what is felt is merely a continuation of a long-held face-in-palm reaction, less \\"how dare they\\" and more \\"they'll never learn.\\" \\"They\\" being white people, you see.      But is it fair for Julianne to receive such a swift, damning judgment of her costume choice? Who cares? Is it fair that white people get to be white? No. Similarly, is it fair that I get to be black and white people don't? Also no. Nothing's fair.      One time, I did consider being George Washington for Halloween. But not for a second did I consider painting my face pale. My plan was to walk up to people with a white wig on, dressed in all of the late-1700s gear, with my brown-ass face, telling people \\"Yes, I am the first president of the United States of America, George Washington.\\" And it would have been awesome.      Does my face look like George Washington's? Thank the heavens on high, no, but if I were to go all out as George Washington, you'd know I was George Washington. There's no need to alabasterize my face to hammer that point home, trust me.      So, white person, I'm not saying that you can't be a black person for Halloween. But why not just be a white person? That's what I do with black people, which is why my Halloween greatest-hits lineup (Cliff Huxtable, Diddy, Frederick Douglass, and Prince) has been so successful.      And I didn't lighten my skin for Prince, either. I just wore six blouses, scored a triple-double in a pickup game, and then served everybody pancakes.      And everyone still knew I was Prince. ||||| Every Halloween, people take the opportunity to step out of their lives and into a playful realm where they can dress up as anything they can imagine: make-believe for adults. Halloween is the one time of year largely free from judgment. Women can go as a sexy [insert object or occupation]. Men can dress in drag. Couples can indulge in the saccharine sweetness of matching costumes.      But then there are the people who choose to spend Halloween as someone of a different race. They use blackface, brown face, yellow face or red face to bring just the right amount of authenticity to their look.      Actress Julianne Hough stepped out in blackface over the weekend. She was attending a Halloween party as Crazy Eyes from “Orange Is the New Black.” That’s fine. The show is hot this year and Crazy Eyes is a popular character. Hough wore the prison oranges, had her hair done up in what charitably could be considered Bantu knots and wore a name tag that said “Crazy Eyes.” That should have been enough — the necessary cues were there.      Hough took her costume one step further, though, dousing herself in bronzer to darken her skin so she might better resemble Uzo Aduba, the actress who plays Crazy Eyes. The blackface did nothing of the sort. It never does. Instead, Hough looked like she spent way too much time out in the Los Angeles sun before stepping out that evening. Once the images of Hough in her ill-informed costume were released, the Internet went crazy.      Here we were, yet again, having this bewildering conversation about why blackface, given its historical uses and the ongoing sensitivity around issues of race, will never be an appropriate costume choice. The apology parade began, and Hough said: “I am a huge fan of the show ‘Orange is the New Black,’ actress Uzo Aduba and the character she has created. It certainly was never my intention to be disrespectful or demeaning to anyone in any way. I realize my costume hurt and offended people, and I truly apologize.”      We know this dance. Public figure makes misstep. Public figure apologizes. That apology is then dissected endlessly, and we’re left wondering if the public figure even knows what they’re apologizing for.      Hough wasn’t alone in donning blackface for Halloween. Her costume was, in fact, the least offensive. As Gawker reports, two young men in Massachusetts spent Halloween as George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin. The man dressed as Martin smeared his face with black makeup and wore a “bloody” sweatshirt. In the most widely circulated image, the Zimmerman wannabe holds his fingers, cocked as a pistol, against the other fellow’s head. The image is chilling, repulsive, but mostly pathetic. On Instagram, there’s a picture of an unidentified white man also posing as Trayvon Martin — the blackface, the bloody sweatshirt — but he steps up his game, so to speak, by also holding a pack of Skittles and an iced tea. I’m not sure what’s worse — that this was a viable costume idea or that the same absurd idea occurred to more than one person.      There’s always pushback when people say “Blackface is wrong.” It’s “just jokes,” an excuse that belies a complete misunderstanding of humor. There’s a lot of nonsense about the freedom of speech. Sad individuals might remind us of the 2004 movie “White Chicks,” in a crowning moment of false equivalence. I choose to believe these people are simply entitled and ignorant about history. I choose to believe they don’t know how blackface was used to create offensive, degrading caricatures of black people — the exaggerated features, the buffoonery, the shuck and jive. The imagery from the 20th century was emblazoned across advertising and children’s toys. Time and again, black people in this country were told: “This is how we see you. This is what we think of you.” Very little has changed.      Racist Halloween costumes are nothing new. Each year, people try to push the envelope. They think they’re being funny, but really, they’re using the freedom of Halloween, the pass we all get to indulge our secret selves, to say, to people of color: “This is how we see you. This is how we think of you.”      Though it is infuriating that we still need to have this conversation about why blackface is unacceptable, there may be some comfort in the knowledge that when people put on the mask of blackface, they reveal who they truly are.

Can you fix that?","output":"Drill Cotton Flame Laminated It appears that you are mentioning a combination of four different words that seemingly don't have any direct connection to each other. However, I will attempt to provide a detailed explanation of each term and how they might be related: 1. Drill Cotton: Drill cotton is a type of durable, heavyweight cotton fabric that is usually tightly woven with a diagonal pattern. This fabric is typically used in making work clothes, uniforms, and various items where a strong, hard-wearing material is needed. Some examples of drill cotton products include aprons, pants, utility bags, and jackets. 2. Flame: Flame refers to a visible, gaseous part of a fire. It occurs due to the combustion or burning process, where a substance reacts with oxygen to produce heat, light, and various chemical by-products. Flames are generally associated with safety hazards and can cause severe damages if not controlled. In the context of textiles, flame or fire resistance is an essential aspect to consider, especially for materials destined for use in public spaces or industries where fire hazards are common. 3. Laminated: Lamination is a process used to bond two or more layers of material together, typically using heat, pressure, or adhesives. In textiles, lamination is often utilized to create composite materials with specific properties, such as improved durability, water resistance, or thermal insulation. Laminated fabrics are commonly found in a wide range of applications, including outdoor apparel, upholstery, protective gear, and various industrial uses. Now, considering the three terms mentioned above, one possible connection could be the creation of a laminated drill cotton fabric designed to have flame-resistant properties. This could involve treating the cotton fibers with a flame-retardant chemical or bonding a fire-resistant layer to the drill cotton material. The resulting product would be a strong, durable, and flame-resistant fabric suitable for use in industries with high fire risks, such as welding, firefighting, or electrical work. 4. If we try to find a link between all four words, we could imagine a product such as a \\"Flame-Resistant Laminated Drill Cotton\\" fabric. This material would combine the strength and durability of drill cotton with additional protective layers designed to mitigate fire hazards, resulting in a versatile and reliable solution for a variety of applications in industries where flame resistance is paramount."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What formation was the youngest of the Supai Group?, using the article: An unconformity of 15 to 20 million years separates the Supai Group from the previously deposited Redwall Formation. Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today.  Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta.  This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color.  Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages 300 feet (90 m) thick in Grand Canyon. Wescogame (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 m) thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 200 to 800 feet (60 to 200 m) thick.

Context: A school board in the eastern state of Virginia has filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt a ruling that allows a transgender student to use the boys’ restroom next school year. The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.

Is an adopted Chinese person without Chinese friends or family as smart as one connected to the collective? Can Chinese parents adopt kids? Do those questions have the same meaning?  a. no; b. yes;","output":"The level of intelligence of an adopted Chinese person without Chinese friends or family cannot be determined solely based on their connections to the collective. Intelligence is a multifaceted concept encompassing cognitive abilities, emotional intelligence, creativity, and social skills, among others. Connections to the collective or a person's cultural background may play a role in shaping an individual's social intelligence and values, but do not define or limit their overall intelligence. An adopted Chinese person without Chinese friends or family may develop expertise and intelligence in various domains, but they may lack exposure to some cultural elements and social cues that their counterparts connected to the collective might have. This difference may influence their ability to navigate certain situations or understand cultural norms, but it does not determine their overall intellectual capacity. Moving on to the second question, yes, Chinese parents can adopt children. In China, there is a formal adoption system in place which is governed by laws and regulations. Domestic adoptions in China are handled by the China Center for Children's Welfare and Adoption (CCCWA) and follow strict guidelines to ensure the best interests of the child are met. Similarly, Chinese parents living abroad can also adopt children through international adoption agencies and must follow the regulations of both their country of residence and China. Now, to answer the third question: No, the two questions posed do not have the same meaning. The first question is exploring the potential impact of connection to the collective or cultural background on the intelligence of an adopted Chinese person. It probes into the possible differences in intelligence levels between those with Chinese connections and those without. The second question, on the other hand, inquires about whether Chinese parents can adopt children or not. This question deals with the laws, guidelines, and regulations related to the adoption process in China or for Chinese parents living abroad. In conclusion, an adopted Chinese person's intelligence cannot be solely determined by the connections or lack thereof to the Chinese collective. Intelligence depends on various factors and is not limited by cultural or social relationships. Additionally, Chinese parents can indeed adopt kids, and the adoption process is governed by specific guidelines and regulations. The two questions posed do not have the same meaning as they explore different facets related to adoption and connection to a specific cultural background."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The department is responsible for providing firefighting, emergency medical services, fire prevention, and disaster response in the Greater Tokyo area, which is one of the most densely populated and developed urban regions in the world. The second largest municipal fire department is the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) in the United States, employing over 10,000 uniformed firefighters, 3,500 emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, and about 2,000 civilian employees.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change.

Two primary chemosensory organs found in these amphibians are the olfactory system and the taste system. 1. Olfactory system: The primary organ responsible for the sense of smell in frogs, toads, and salamanders is the olfactory epithelium, which is located in the nasal cavity. This specialized tissue contains olfactory receptor neurons that are sensitive to various chemical molecules. When these molecules come into contact with the olfactory receptors, they generate nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain, where they are processed and identified as specific odors. 2. Taste system: Frogs, toads, and salamanders have taste buds that allow them to taste chemicals.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a news article: Whole digits, tips of fingers, and parts of a thumb. These are body parts of Tyson Foods’ employees which were severed last year in 10 of the company’s plants. The details are made possible by a new OSHA regulation that took effect on January 1, 2015. The regulation requires employers to report within 24 hours any work-related incident that results in an amputation or hospitalization.      After nearly a year on the books, I was curious to find out what just a single large employer had reported to federal OSHA. I picked Tyson Foods. It has more than more than 400 facilities in 30 US states and it processes 35 million chickens, 400,000 hog, and 128,000 cattle per week. I sent a FOIA request to federal OSHA in October asking for data on injury reports submitted by Tyson Foods. I wasn’t sure what to expect. How many incidents did Tyson report? For what kind of amputations and hospitalizations?      Two weeks ago, I received OSHA’s response to my FOIA request. It does not include information from the states the run their own OSHA program, 10 of which have Tyson operations. Here’s what I learned for the period January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015:      Tyson made 34 reports to OSHA of amputations or hospitalizations. The hospitalizations included a worker at the company’s facility in Rogers, AR who fell 32 feet off of a roof, and a worker in Holcomb, KS who broke his leg while learning to operate a forklift.      Seventeen of the 34 incidents were amputations—an average of more than 1 per month. I’ve summarized them in this table:      Seven of the 17 incidents occurred at beef-processing plants and another seven at poultry-processing plants.      An incident in February 2015 at Tyson’s St. Joseph’s, MO plant resulted in a sanitation worker losing both hands .      . Two plants—one in Amarillo, TX the other in Lexington, NE—had two amputations each.      Some of the injury reports are more descriptive than others. The reports of two amputations in August that occurred at Tyson’s Amarillo, TX plant simply say this:      “Employees are exposed to ‘caught between’ hazards when operating fork lifts due to lack of training.”      While the incident in April at the Emporia, KS beef-processing plant is described this way:      “Employee was working on the flat steak line running meats over the skinner when his left thumb was cut on the blade (skinner is like a planner that removes the outer layer of the meat) amputating the outside edge and end of the right thumb.”      Skinners. Band saws. Wing saws. Hide grippers. The names of these tools tell just part of the story of why these amputations occurred. Their names, however, provide more than an inkling about the physical demands of these jobs.      This 9-month snapshot of data on amputations at Tyson Foods’ facilities provide just a glimpse. What have other large food production companies reported to OSHA?      Time for me to write some more FOIA requests. ||||| In the first nine months of 2015, workers in meat-packing plants owned by Tyson Foods averaged at least one amputation a month.      That report was gleaned from a Freedom of Information Act request by Celeste Monforton, a George Washington University occupational health professor.      Monforton writes on her blog that she sought the data because of a new regulation that requires companies to report injuries to OSHA within 24 hours. She focused on one of the big meatpackers, Tyson, to get a feel for how the new rule, which kicked in on Jan. 1, 2015, would play out.      \\"Skinners. Band saws. Wing saws. Hide grippers. The names of these tools tell just part of the story of why these amputations occurred,\\" Monforton wrote. \\"Their names, however, provide more than an inkling about the physical demands of these jobs.\\"      Most of the amputations occurred in beef plants, Monforton found, including a sanitation worker's loss of both hands at a Tyson plant in St. Joseph, Mo., and two incidents when employees at a Lexington, Neb., slaughterhouse lost fingers.      Tyson announced a new workplace safety program last year. I contacted a company representative in November, seeking a tour of a facility to see the details of the new plan, but I didn't get a response.      Monforton's report is significant because OSHA data is rarely up-to-date – the most recent in the Department of Labor's online databases is from 2013.      OSHA data is also viewed suspiciously by many experts – considered inaccurate and under-reported by as much as 30 percent to 70 percent, according to Monforton -- because it is gathered from employers. The data isn't analyzed by OSHA for accuracy, is often gathered years after the accidents, and the companies often penalize workers who make injury reports, the GAO, a congressional watchdog, found.      \\"For example, workers may not report a work-related injury or illness because they fear job loss or other disciplinary action, or fear jeopardizing rewards based on having low injury and illness rates,\\" the GAO reported in 2009.      Last year, Oxfam America released a report calling on consumers and the government to help better what it said are \\"grim\\" conditions for the largely invisible people who work at the four largest poultry companies, which includes Tyson.      As consumer groups push the meat industry on concerns of the welfare of meat animals, there appears to be little consumer concern for how workers in the meat industry are treated.      Here at Harvest Public Media, we’ve reported on the immigrant influx into the Midwest slaughterhouses and how their children grow up mostly in the shadows, thanks to their immigration status and location in rural areas.

Click here to offer your experience to our ongoing look into workplace safety at slaughterhouses. ||||| Turning chickens into chicken nuggets can be a rough business. A new OSHA report lists the fingers and other body parts lost in meat factories.      One year ago, a sanitation worker at a meat-processing plant in Missouri lost both his hands in a work-related accident. Two months later, a worker amputated part of his right thumb while running flat steaks over a skinner (a blade that removes the outer layer of meat) in an Amarillo, Texas factory. \\"Skinners. Band saws. Wing saws. Hide grippers. The names of these tools tell just part of the story of why these amputations occurred,\\" wrote Celeste Monforton, a professor of occupational health at George Washington University. Monforton was referring to the kind of machines that caused 34 injuries at 10 meatpacking plants run by Tyson Foods in the first nine months of 2015 — for an average of one amputation per month. Monforton compiled a full tally of the amputations, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request:      Iowa Public Radio first covered Monforton's findings. The details are available thanks to a new Occupational Health and Safety Agency (OSHA) regulation requiring that all work-related incidents resulting in an amputation or hospitalization be reported within 24 hours. \\"We don’t want anyone hurt on the job,\\" a Tyson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in an email. \\"We’re continually focused on improving workplace safety and preventing accidents for all of our 113,000 team members.\\" Data from OSHA has long been considered inaccurate due to under-reporting by workers and employers, as noted in a report by Oxfam America last year and a Government Accountability Office study from 2009. While plants must report the number of days taken off by workers due to injuries, Monforton told BuzzFeed News in October that plants sometimes keep injured workers on site, sitting idly in offices, to avoid having to record the time off. The Oxfam America report implicated all four of the country's largest chicken producers in unsafe workplace conditions leading to avoidable repetitive motion injuries and grisly amputations.      Tyson is America's biggest meat producer, and each week it processes 35 million chickens, 400,000 hog, and 128,000 cattle. The full tally of amputations at its facilities is likely higher than the number obtained by Monforton, which does not include information from Tyson factories in 10 states that run their own OSHA programs.      The Tyson spokesperson said that \\"almost 500 health and safety professionals work in our 100 or so locations. We have plant safety committees that involve management and hourly workers and provide safety training in multiple languages.\\" The company also recently launched new programs to improve workplace safety communication, awareness and education. \\"Now more than ever, we’re stressing awareness about surroundings within the workplace and helping shape appropriate safe behavior for our team at all locations,\\" he said. \\"We’re constantly reviewing equipment design and our processes to reduce risks throughout our company.\\"      Cora Lewis is a business reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

Article:","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Boarding Process for Air Travel Introduction Air travel can be an exhilarating experience for seasoned travelers and first-time flyers alike. Excellent preparation and understanding of the boarding process can significantly reduce the stress often associated with air travel. This article will break down the essential steps involved in the boarding process, providing a comprehensive guide for a smooth and hassle-free experience. Step 1: Wait for the Announcement to Board Whether you are seated in the departure lounge or passing the time at a nearby airport establishment, keep an eye on the airport monitors and listen for boarding announcements. Airlines often have a specific order for boarding their aircraft, usually starting with passengers who have mobility issues or are traveling with small children. Airline loyalty program members, business class passengers, and those with priority boarding benefits will follow. Finally, general boarding for remaining passengers starts. Once your zone or group is called, make your way to the gate. Step 2: Get Your Boarding Pass Checked When you approach the gate, the airline staff will check your boarding pass to ensure that you have the correct flight and boarding group. This process typically requires you to either scan the barcode on your boarding pass or present it to the staff who do the scanning for you. Depending on the airport, you may also need to show your photo ID or passport to confirm your identity. Step 3: Walk Down the Hallway that Leads Up to Your Plane Following the verification of your boarding pass and ID, you will be directed to walk down the hallway or jet bridge which connects the waiting area to the aircraft. These jet bridges are designed to provide easy access for passengers, luggage, and staff directly onto the plane, reducing the need to walk across the tarmac or use additional stairs or ramps. As you make your way down the passageway, take your time and follow any posted signs, ensuring your safety and that of other passengers as well. Step 4: Enter the Aircraft Upon entering the aircraft, airline staff or the flight crew will usually greet you. They may also guide you to your assigned seat or instruct you to follow the seat numbers or letters listed overhead. Take note of the nearest emergency exit, as pointed out by the crew or mentioned during the safety briefing. Step 5: Stow Your Carry-On Items With limited overhead bin space, it is vital to store your carry-on items efficiently. This process typically involves placing larger carry-ons, such as roller bags or backpacks, in the overhead compartments, ensuring they fit securely. If you have a smaller personal item, such as a purse or laptop bag, it should be stowed under the seat in front of you. Following this procedure ensures that everyone has sufficient space for their belongings while keeping walkways clear. Step 6: Get Settled In Finally, find your assigned seat and ensure you are comfortable. Familiarize yourself with the seat functions, including the recline button and the entertainment system. Take a moment to review the safety instructions in the seat pocket in front of you. Adjust your seatbelt, and store any items you may need during the flight within easy reach. Lastly, sit back and enjoy your flight to your destination. Conclusion By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth boarding process and an enjoyable flight. Being well-prepared and aware of each step along the way will not only minimize stress but also pave the way for many successful trips in the future.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Pink Floyd The Wall Context: The film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \\"Money\\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants.As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror.Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \\"worms\\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Pink Floyd The Wall,\\" Pink (played by Bob Geldof) fantasizes about reaching a father figure, having a successful and fulfilling career, and being loved and cared for throughout his life. However, the reality is far different, as he experiences emotional isolation, alienation, and a series of painful life events, including the loss of his father during World War II, an unkind teacher who humiliates him for writing poems, an overprotective mother, a failed marriage, and a downward spiral into mental instability. As Pink's mental state deteriorates, he experiences various hallucinations and fantasizes about different scenarios. One notable example is the \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\" sequence, where he imagines a rebellion against the oppressive education system, with students destroying the school.  Additionally, Pink becomes increasingly isolated and constructs a metaphorical wall around himself. In his delusional state, he fantasizes about becoming a fascist dictator who has complete control over his audience during a concert, as represented in the \\"In the Flesh\\" and \\"The Trial\\" scenes. Ultimately, Pink's internal struggle and the metaphorical wall crumble as he confronts his turbulent past and figures out how to integrate it into his present life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. The humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film. However, despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that I haven't experienced for a long time. That is to say, it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects.  'Dan In Real Life' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices. It has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require, and indeed would be ruined by, any further embellishment. At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. It's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers. There are some scenes that feel a bit 'Waltons' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments. The rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. The peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill. I highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself with multiple ties and between hardening fronts. The dependencies turn out to be reciprocal.

Whether it's a worn, leather-bound book with fragile, yellowing pages or an intricately crafted silver tea set that has been passed down through generations, these carefully curated treasures pique my interest and captivate my imagination. I often explore flea markets, antique shops, and online auctions in search of these precious relics. Every antique has its unique history, a tapestry of lives and events that it has touched or witnessed. It's almost as if each piece whispers to me, beckoning me to unravel the mysteries hidden within its intricate design and age-old materials. For me, the appeal of vintage items doesn't stem only from their aesthetic beauty or the intricate craftsmanship that has gone into creating them; instead, it's the connection to the past that truly draws me in. Owning and preserving such objects allows me to feel as if I am caretaker of fragments of history, entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the legacy of those who came before me. Whenever I come across a new piece that I find particularly intriguing, I can't help but delve into research, eager to learn as much as possible about its origin, the time period it was made in, and the people who may have owned or used it. There is something incredibly rewarding about being able to add context and depth to an object, making it more than just a beautiful item, but also a tangible link to our collective past. Embracing the vintage and the antique has taught me the importance of cherishing the things that have stood the test of time, that have survived for us to appreciate, and understanding the bond that ties us to previous generations. The love and care that went into creating these artifacts are apparent, and I am grateful for the opportunity to play a role in preserving these nuggets of history. In a world that is constantly moving forward, where new technologies continue to emerge and life is in a perpetual state of change, choosing to surround myself with the vestiges of yesteryear acts as a reminder of the impermanence of all things, and the longevity of the human spirit.

Select the topic that this about: Kerr-McGee Corp. plans to shut down its Savannah, Ga., pigment sulfate production, resulting in charges of 75 million to 85 million in the third quarter.","output":"Topic: Shut Down of Savannah Pigment Sulfate Production by Kerr-McGee Corp. Kerr-McGee Corp., a leading multinational energy and chemical company, has announced its plan to shut down its pigment sulfate production facility in Savannah, Georgia. This critical decision will result in substantial charges ranging between 75 million to 85 million in the third quarter. The closure is believed to impact the local economy and the company’s manufacturing operations. In this detailed analysis, we will explore the reasons behind the shut down, the consequences, and the potential mitigating measures Kerr-McGee Corp. may undertake to minimize the negative impact. Reasons for the Shut Down: 1. Economics: Kerr-McGee Corp. may have assessed that the pigment sulfate production was not economically viable in the long run, given the potential changes in the global market for pigment sulfate and the cost involved in running the operations. Market demands for pigment sulfate may have reduced, leading to lower sales and revenues, making it economically unprofitable for the company to maintain the facility. 2. Environmental Regulations: Increasing pressure regarding stricter environmental regulations and the need to reduce the ecological footprint of the company may have influenced the decision. Complying with increasingly rigid environmental standards, such as wastewater management and air quality control, can be expensive and challenging for a chemical manufacturer like Kerr-McGee Corp. 3. Competition: The pigment sulfate market might have evolved over the years, with more affordable and efficient alternatives being introduced by competitors. The company may have decided to shift its focus and resources to other areas and business operations where it can be more profitable and competitive. 4. Restructuring: Kerr-McGee Corp. could be undergoing company-wide restructuring to streamline its operations, cut costs, and focus on its core businesses for further growth. Shutting down the facility could be part of a larger plan by the corporation to reorganize its resources and manufacturing strategies. Consequences of the Shut Down: 1. Financial Impact: Charges between 75 million to 85 million in the third quarter will affect the company’s profitability and balance sheet. Shareholders and investors may express concern over the financial health of the company due to the high costs incurred because of the closure. 2. Loss of Jobs: The closure of the manufacturing facility would lead to job losses for employees working at the Savannah plant. This would have a sizable impact on the local economy and could result in a potential increase in unemployment rates in the region. 3. Supply Chain Disruption: The termination of pigment sulfate production in the Savannah facility might cause disruptions in the supply chain, affecting distributors, suppliers, and customers who rely on Kerr-McGee Corp.'s services. Mitigating Measures: 1. Worker Compensation and Support: Kerr-McGee Corp. should provide adequate compensation and support to affected employees in the form of severance packages, job training, and assistance with finding new employment opportunities. 2. Environmental Remediation: The company should ensure that the shut down facility is properly decommissioned, and the site is cleaned up to minimize any long-term environmental damage. 3. Clear Communication: Kerr-McGee Corp. should have transparent and open communication regarding the reasons for the shut down, its plans to mitigate the adverse effects, and future plans for its business operations with all stakeholders, including employees, investors, and customers. 4. Strategic Investment: The company should identify new areas of investment or potential growth opportunities within its core business lines and use the resources saved from the closure to foster further development and expansion. In conclusion, the shut down of Kerr-McGee Corp.'s pigment sulfate production in Savannah, Georgia has significant implications for the company, community, and broader industry. By carefully considering and addressing the potential consequences and implementing mitigating measures, the company can minimize the negative impact of this decision and steer towards a successful future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as \\"being in the living presence of the orchestra\\" by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still based on the principle of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35 mm magnetic film instead of half-inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35 mm magnetic film prevented tape layer print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of 3-to-2 mix directly to the master recorder.

From that perspective, Russia's actions do not look very rational and foreign commentators have explained them in terms of President Vladimir Putin's anger and feelings of humiliation after the overthrow of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. But I would focus on domestic political considerations as a driving force. The famous Bill Clinton presidential campaign slogan, \\"It's the economy, stupid\\", comes to mind. The Russian government's expectations of economic recovery by the end of 2013 went wrong. According to different experts, Russia's economy is already in de facto recession with a drop in investment, a rapid decline in consumer demand and a real-terms decrease in incomes. The economy has already shrunk for two consecutive quarters. The rouble is weakening, causing expectations of growth in inflation. Russia's ministry for economic development has revised downwards its short-term forecasts on an almost monthly basis. According to the most recent forecast by the independent Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy last month, the Russian economy will not grow faster than 2% per year until 2016, even with a best-case scenario of growing quasi-state investment, an improving investment climate and small business growth. Now with all the events developing in Crimea, even this scenario looks too optimistic. On 3 March, dubbed Black Monday, Russia's RTS stock market index plummeted 12% and the rouble fell 1.9% against the dollar in spite of massive intervention by Russia's Central Bank. The stock market has since recovered its losses. The Crimean parliament's decision to join Russia has only added to the economic instability. The rouble had already fallen by 10% in two months, which due to the high dependence of the Russian economy on imported goods and commodities almost automatically translates into a fall in real incomes. A lengthy economic stagnation, perhaps even a recession, caused by domestic problems rather than by the world market might not be so devastating if the government was not already facing accusations of a decline in legitimacy since the 2011-2012 political protests. It should be taken very seriously because it means that the political-economic base of Vladimir Putin's 2004-2013 administration is coming to an end. The regime had to do something about these: either by improving the economy at the expense of weakening its control over it, or by focusing on the image of an external enemy and consolidating the nation around the leader. Russia appears to have made its choice, passing a very important fork in the road, by choosing to tighten the screw and switching to a different model of relations between state and society rather than liberalising the economy and improving the investment climate. This is by no means an immediate reaction. The events that culminated in the past week in Crimea had been developing for a while. Looking back, several developments over recent months fit this scenario. There was the merger of Russia's two top courts - the merger of the Supreme Arbitration Court with the Supreme Court - along with tougher controls on the  judiciary and the increasingly powerful role of Mr Putin's inner circle at the Kremlin, known as the Siloviki. The final stage can be traced back to the start of last autumn, first with the Kremlin's appointment of Mr Putin's former deputy chief of staff Vladislav Surkov as his personal aide; then the very serious reshuffle at Russia's Ria Novosti news agency; and finally the intense pressure placed on two largely independent media outlets, Dozhd TV and Echo Moskvy Radio. Facing the prospect of recession, Mr Putin now appears to be returning to the days of 1999-2000, when \\"a small victorious war\\" in Chechnya led to a major rise in his tremendous approval ratings. Attacking Ukraine may promote mobilisation and the consolidation of the society around the leader, at least in the short term, with a tightening of the screws on his opponents and any potentially disloyal members of the elite. The paradox is that sanctions placed on the elite could serve Mr Putin's goal of closing Russia and creating a siege mentality. Serious economic sanctions, especially from Europe, seem unlikely for now. But Russia has already paid a high price for its aggression in terms of a fall in the stock market and a further decline in investment due to both the increased cost of borrowing and the further alienation of investors. However, it doesn't look like this changes his calculations of costs and benefits. It became evident last year that Russia's leadership was not put off by the high cost of keeping Ukraine on side - with an eagerness to pay almost 15bn (Â£9bn) a year in discounts on gas sales. However, if more serious European sanctions were to be imposed such as an embargo on Russia's gas supply, by replacing it as some experts suggest with Norwegian gas and liquefied natural gas, then Russia would stand to lose some 100bn a year and face economic collapse. Nikolay Petrov is professor of political science at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. This article was about:","output":"The article discusses the economic challenges faced by Russia and how these might be affecting its actions towards Ukraine. The author highlights Russia's economic struggles in recent years, including a de facto recession and the weakening of the rouble. The government's expectation of an economic recovery in 2013 did not materialize, and forecasts for future growth have been revised downwards. The unfolding events in Crimea have further contributed to economic uncertainty, resulting in stock market and currency fluctuations. The author suggests that Russia's poor economic situation and declining political legitimacy have forced the government to either focus on improving the economy or create the image of an external enemy to consolidate the nation around the leadership. Russia appears to have chosen the latter option, using the conflict in Ukraine as a means to rally the population and tighten control over domestic affairs. The article points out that this strategy could create a siege mentality and may backfire if economic sanctions are imposed by other countries. The author contends that continued aggression may ultimately lead to significant economic costs for Russia, but it is unclear whether this will alter the country's leadership's calculations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

About long, it flows west through the northwest part of the Olympic Peninsula, from the Olympic Mountains of Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest, then through the broad Sol Duc Valley. Near the Pacific Ocean the Sol Duc River joins the Bogachiel River, forming the Quillayute River, which flows about to the Pacific Ocean at La Push. Although the Quillayute River is short, its large tributary riversthe Sol Duc, Bogachiel, Calawah, and Dickey Riversdrain the largest watershed of the northern Olympic Peninsula, . The Sol Duc's watershed is the largest of the Quillayute's tributaries, at .  - The Olympic Mountains are a mountain range on the Olympic Peninsula of western Washington in the United States. The mountains, part of the Pacific Coast Ranges, are not especially high  Mount Olympus is the highest at ; however, the eastern slopes rise out of Puget Sound and the western slopes are separated from the Pacific Ocean by the wide Pacific Ocean coastal plain. The western slopes are the wettest place in the 48 contiguous states. Most of the mountains are protected within the bounds of the Olympic National Park.  - The Olympic Peninsula is the large arm of land in western Washington that lies across Puget Sound from Seattle. It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, the north by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the east by Hood Canal. Cape Alava, the westernmost point in the contiguous United States, and Cape Flattery, the northwesternmost point, are on the peninsula. Comprising about 3600 square miles, the Olympic Peninsula contained many of the last unexplored places in the contiguous United States. It remained largely unmapped until Arthur Dodwell and Theodore Rixon mapped most of its topography and timber resources between 1898 and 1900.  - The Quillayute River (also spelled Quileute River) is a river situated on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. It empties to the Pacific Ocean at La Push, Washington. The Quillayute River is formed by the confluence of the Bogachiel River, Calawah and the Sol Duc River. The Dickey River joins the Quillayute just above the river's mouth on the Pacific Ocean.  - Olympic National Park is a United States national park located in the state of Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The park has four basic regions: the Pacific coastline, alpine areas, the west side temperate rainforest and the forests of the drier east side. Within the park there are three distinct ecosystems which are sub-alpine forest and wildflower meadow, temperate forest, and the rugged Pacific Shore. These three different ecosystems are in pristine condition and have outstanding scenery.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The Bogachiel River is a river of the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It originates near Bogachiel Peak, flows west through the mountains of Olympic National Park. After emerging from the park it joins the Sol Duc River, forming the Quillayute River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean near La Push, Washington.  - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas.  - Olympic National Forest is a U.S. National Forest located in Washington, USA. With an area of , it nearly surrounds Olympic National Park and the Olympic Mountain range. Olympic National Forest contains parts of Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, and Mason counties. The landscape of the national forest varies, from the temperate Olympic rain forest to the salt water fjord of Hood Canal to the peaks of Mt. Washington.  - The Dickey River is a stream on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It has three main forks, the East Fork, West Fork, and Middle Fork Dickey Rivers. The main stem is formed by the confluence of the East and West Forks. The river and its forks rise in the northwestern part of the Olympic Peninsula and flow generally south and west to join the Quillayute River near its mouth on the Pacific Ocean.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Sol Duc Hot Springs is a resort located in Olympic National Park that is best known for its soaking pools , hot tubs , and a swimming pool that are heated with the nearby hot springs .

This article: Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.  However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the man who clashes with Robert?, what is it ?

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the song with a music video that was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics?, using the article: The first single from the album was \\"The Day You Come\\", a politically and socially influenced song. The band did not intend for it to be the first single, and released it only when they could not decide on anything else. Haug said it being \\"a pretty inoffensive song musically\\" helped Powderfinger make that decision. \\"The Day You Come\\" spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.The second single was the double a-side, \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray\\", released on 9 November 1998. \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date. 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out' could be comfortably ranked with other Powderfinger songs such as 'Lighten My Load' and 'Rise Up'. Drummer Jon Coghill described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so \\"fast and offbeat\\". The music video for \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. \\"Good-Day Ray\\" was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former Media Watch host Stuart Littlemore. Its lyrics verged on punk, though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band. He also described the music video for \\"Good-Day Ray\\" as being one of the better videos the band had made.Internationalist's third single was \\"Already Gone\\", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to the Beatles and their influence on Powderfinger's music. The fourth and final single from the album was \\"Passenger\\", released on 9 August 1999.  \\"Passenger\\" was influenced by Elvis Presley, and included a big horn section, as well as backing vocals from folk group Tiddas. \\"Passenger\\" won the ARIA Award for \\"Song Of The Year\\" in 1999. The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. \\"Passenger\\" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30. It appeared at #48 on Max's top 100 songs from the 1990s list., what would be the answer ?

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  and the situation: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would  be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A.

The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.

He thought the  Options: a. necklace was uglier.; b. ring was uglier.;","output":"The boy bought a necklace, instead of a ring for the girl he had a crush on. He thought the ring was uglier. The sentence ends with the option b. Despite the societal expectation that a ring might be a more suitable gift for expressing romantic interest, the boy chose to buy a necklace because he found the ring to be less attractive. This could be attributed to various reasons, such as his personal taste, the design of the particular ring, or an understanding of the girl's preferences. In some cases, rings are seen as a symbol of commitment, especially engagement rings. However, the boy may have thought that giving a ring would be too forward or intense in the early stages of their relationship. He must have thought that a necklace would appear as a more thoughtful and subtle gesture, while avoiding any potential misconceptions regarding the intention behind the present. Apart from matters of taste and symbolism, the boy might have also considered other factors while choosing between the necklace and the ring. For instance, he might have pondered over the girl's lifestyle and daily routine; a necklace can arguably be a more versatile accessory that the girl could wear on various occasions without it interfering with her activities. In contrast, choosing a ring would require knowledge of the correct size, as well as an understanding of whether the girl would be comfortable wearing it daily or at different events. Moreover, if the boy knew the girl well enough, he could have opted for the necklace based on her preferences. Some people have a particular affinity for necklaces, while others lean towards rings. The boy may have observed the girl in different settings, noticed that she wears necklaces more often, and inferred that the necklace would be a better fit for her style and comfort. Lastly, price could have played a role in the boy's decision, as well. Depending on the designs and materials used, necklaces and rings may vary greatly in price. Assuming that the necklace and the ring were made of similar metals and stones, the boy might have opted for the necklace, as it could simply be a more affordable option, allowing him to express his feelings without breaking the bank. In conclusion, the sentence ends with the option b, revealing that the boy chose to buy a necklace instead of a ring because he found the latter to be uglier. This decision might have been influenced by various factors, such as personal taste, symbolism, versatility, the girl's preferences, or affordability. This simple choice of words offers a brief insight into the boy's thought process and the careful consideration that went behind his choice of gift."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: -  You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart","output":"The final step of this process is: - The oxygen-rich blood is pumped by the heart to the rest of the body to be utilized by cells for various functions and energy production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred.

Based on the premise \\"employing management and engineering practices that are disciplined and effective.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Disciplined engineering practices that are also effective were being employed.\\" is true?","output":"In order to thoroughly analyze this question, let's first break down the given premise and the hypothesis proposed. Premise: \\"Employing management and engineering practices that are disciplined and effective.\\" The premise states that the focus is on utilizing both management and engineering practices that possess two distinct qualities: discipline and effectiveness. This implies that the practices being used are well-structured, well-planned, and exhibit a high degree of efficiency in achieving their goals. Hypothesis: \\"Disciplined engineering practices that are also effective were being employed.\\" The hypothesis states that engineering practices being employed exhibit the same two qualities mentioned in the premise: discipline and effectiveness. It essentially aims to confirm whether these said practices have been used or implemented in a given scenario. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis to determine whether the hypothesis is true based on the premise. The premise outlines the desired qualities of both management and engineering practices – discipline and effectiveness. It signifies that any organization or entity employing these practices would adhere to a well-defined structure, order, and results-driven approach. However, it is crucial to remember that the premise pertains to both management and engineering practices. Therefore, the hypothesis can be considered true if and only if the scenario being referred to concerns the deployment of the practices mentioned in the premise. Based on the premise provided, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Disciplined engineering practices that are also effective were being employed.\\" is true, given that the given scenario involves the application of disciplined and effective practices in both management and engineering domains. Furthermore, the hypothesis holds as long as it is being analyzed within the context of the premise, as the premise contains information about both management and engineering practices. To strengthen this conclusion, it would be beneficial to gather more information about the specific scenario, such as the type of organization or project, the goals and objectives, and any challenges faced. This contextual information can help in better understanding the degree to which disciplined and effective practices were employed, as well as evaluating their overall success and impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His auburn hair appears tousled, as if running his hands through it has become a nervous habit to coax his creative thoughts. As he sits on a weathered, large boulder, his furrowed brow and pursed lips suggest that he's contemplating something of great importance to him. Gradually, the camera pans out to reveal the expansive beauty of the woods, with towering trees cloaked in bright green leaves and a carpet of moss and damp grass underfoot. A gentle breeze rustles through the branches overhead, enabling a soothing melody to harmonize with the distant sound of a babbling brook. This enchanting symphony of nature appears to be both invigorating and calming, as the man is rooted in his spot like he's part of the environment itself. As we continue to watch, a sudden flutter of wings attracts the man's attention, drawing his gaze towards a majestic bird of prey perched on a thick branch above him. The creature gazes intently at the man, as if imparting some ancient wisdom or a secret message that only they are privy to.

Question: Article: A few years ago, in one experiment in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects for their willingness to obey instructions given by a \\"leader\\" in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal dislike of the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer \\"teacher-subject\\" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from \\"15 volts of electricity (slight shock)\\" to \\"450 volts (danger -- severe shock)\\" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed \\"pupil\\" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the \\"pupil\\" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects _ administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to carry on with the experiment and that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion  against the rules and conditions of the experiment. Before carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people...

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. These systems deter break-ins and crime because they offer a direct line to emergency services from inside your home, whether you are home or away. If burglars notice that your home is equipped with a home security system, they might pass on your house and move on to an easier target.  Only share your home security code with individuals whom you absolutely trust. If you think someone untrustworthy has obtained the code, change it as soon as possible. Choose a home security system with a lighted motion sensor. When these systems detect movement, they turn on flood lighting, making it easy to see what or who is approaching your home.  Some home security systems involve cameras. Be sure to invest in a high definition camera, so that if your home is ever burglarized and the cameras capture photos or video of the perpetrator, the images will be clear enough to give a good picture of the burglar. Don’t give burglars the opportunity to hide or lurk outside your home. Keep bushes and shrubbery trimmed and leave your porch light on, if possible. You want your home to be as uninviting to criminals as you can make it. While everyone loves a bright, airy space, window coverings are important to install so that your belongings aren’t on display for potential burglars. It’s especially important to keep your window coverings closed at night when it’s easiest for prowlers to look into your home for things they might want to steal when you’re gone. This is a basic but very important safety precaution. Before you leave your home or go to bed for the night be sure that all your doors and windows are locked, including your garage door, if you have one. This applies to your car, as well. Be sure that all your windows are closed and any valuables are out of sight or locked in the trunk. Timers help you control when your lights and TV turn on and off when you aren’t home. This gives the illusion of someone being home and can help deter potential home break-ins. Many timers can be programmed remotely with your cellphone and some even have a battery backup in case of a power failure. Offering personal information on your mailbox or exterior of your home invites stalkers and burglars to learn who lives at your address. For safety and anonymity do not advertise your name on the exterior of your home. If they keep an eye on your home while you’re gone, ask them to watch for any suspicious activity. Authorize them to report any strange activity or suspicious individuals to police or the neighborhood watch group in your absence. If you’ll be gone for more than a week, consider having the post office hold your mail and hire a teenager in the neighborhood to mow your lawn. An overgrown lawn with packages piling up at the front door is a dead giveaway to criminals that no one is home at your house. Make it a priority to have your home appear to have someone at home so that potential criminals will be deterred. Summary:","output":"Invest in a home security system, maintain privacy and exterior lighting, and create the illusion of occupancy to deter burglars and protect your home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised)  23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.

Butler (4 May 1914  7 January 1968) was a Canadian born screenwriter working in Hollywood who was blacklisted by the movie studios in the 1950s.  - Science fiction film (or sci-fi) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.  - Roderick Andrew Anthony Jude McDowall (17 September 1928  3 October 1998), known as Roddy McDowall, was an English-American actor, voice artist, film director and photographer.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases. With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur ( Figure below ). Let’s say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day. It would be hard to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have. Smaller pieces dissolve more easily.  Now, I have a new situation: Rocks commonly found in Beijing are often found spread out in smaller pieces, whereas rocks in Montreal typically remain large in size and don't break apart as much. Both Beijing and Montreal are expected to experience bouts of acid rain in the upcoming weeks.  Answer this question please: Which area's rocks will have higher rates of chemical weathering caused by the acid rain? A:","output":"Beijing B: Montreal  Step 1: Identify the key factors influencing chemical weathering in the given scenario. - Acid rain is expected to affect both areas - Rocks in Beijing are found in smaller pieces - Rocks in Montreal are typically larger and don't break apart as much Step 2: Recall the relationship between mechanical weathering and chemical weathering from the given background information. - Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering - Smaller rock pieces have more surface area, leading to more places for chemical weathering to occur Step 3: Analyze the key factors in the context of the background information: - Rocks in Beijing, being smaller and with more surface area, would have more places for chemical weathering to occur because of their size.

If you're interested in being a paramedic, you should study courses related to the field, such as anatomy and physiology. Once you advance far enough in the paramedic training process, take college courses such as biology and anatomy. If you have a B.A. or have taken these courses, you will have a leg up. If you're really determined to be a paramedic right out of high school, though, there's nothing stopping you. That's right. Before you can be a paramedic, you'll need to pass a background check so you can't have any felonies in your background. Being in trouble with the law for drug use or other crimes can keep you from being a paramedic. Paramedics need to demonstrate strong character and a respect for the law. This shouldn't be a problem since you will probably be eighteen or close to it after you graduate high school anyway. Though you can work to develop the qualities you really need to be a paramedic, if you have them up front, you will be a stronger candidate and will be more mentally and physically prepared for dealing with the job. Here are the skills that you should have and develop.  Compassion. You'll have to offer emotional support to patients in extreme situations. Interpersonal skills. You'll also have to get along with your fellow team members to get the job done. Listening skills. This skill will help you understand the extent of your patients' injuries. Strength. You'll be doing plenty of lifting, bending, and kneeling for this job, so you have to be fit. Problem-solving skills. The solution to a patient's problem won't usually be obvious. Communication skills. You'll need to clearly explain procedures to a patient and to communicate and give and receive orders within your team. Though speaking Spanish or another language that is commonly spoken in your community won't guarantee you a job, it will give you a major leg up in the application process. Many paramedics do not speak a foreign language, so if you're one of the few applicants in your area who speaks a language that is common there, your resume will rise to the top.","output":"To become a paramedic, one must meet basic schooling requirements and take courses related to anatomy, physiology, and biology. Having a B.A. or prior knowledge in these subjects can be advantageous. There are no age constraints, but a clean background, free from felonies, is necessary. Key skills for paramedics include compassion, interpersonal skills, listening, strength, problem-solving, and communication. Speaking a foreign language common in the community can boost your chances of being hired."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? According to the above context, answer the following question. Who is the hairdresser? Options: A). The narrator's mother. B). The narrator's boss. C). The narrator's best friend. D). not enough information.

Choices:  - headaches - sidetracked - then have - disappointment - being happy  The rationale to choose \\"headaches\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Inadequate ventilation causes the accumulation of fumes, which in turn can lead to a variety of health issues for workers exposed to them. Among the choices provided, \\"headaches\\" is the most plausible answer for the following reasons: 1. Direct correlation between fumes and health issues: There is a well-documented connection between exposure to fumes in poorly ventilated spaces and the occurrence of headaches. These headaches typically result from inhaling volatile organic compounds, chemicals, and other pollutants that irritate the respiratory system and can cause physical discomfort. In comparison, the other choices—such as getting sidetracked or experiencing disappointment—do not have a direct causal relationship with the presence of fumes. 2. Reduced oxygen levels: Inadequate ventilation can lead to a reduction in oxygen levels within a workspace. When workers are not receiving enough oxygen, it can cause headaches or even dizziness due to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain. Other symptoms may include fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and general malaise, which can also contribute to the worker feeling sidetracked but are not the primary concern in this instance. 3. Prolonged exposure risks: The longer a worker is exposed to harmful fumes, the more severe the headache may become. Prolonged exposure to fumes can not only lead to chronic headaches but also increase the risk of other health issues, such as respiratory illnesses or neurological problems. The other choices do not represent concrete risks that are specifically linked to prolonged exposure to fumes in a poorly ventilated environment. 4. Most logical answer based on context: When considering the context of the question, which involves fumes not being well ventilated and a worker experiencing an effect, \\"headaches\\" is the most relevant and logical outcome. Other choices, like \\"being happy\\" or \\"disappointment,\\" contradict the context or do not present a specific health concern related to the issue. In conclusion, the choice of \\"headaches\\" as the answer is well-supported by the direct correlation between fumes and health issues, reduced oxygen levels, risks associated with prolonged exposure, and the context of the question. By contrast, the other choices either lack a causal relationship with the presence of fumes or do not represent specific health concerns in connection with inadequate ventilation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation 519f + 353f = 42f + 14940 for f, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have two terms with 'f' in them: 519f and 353f. Combine these terms by adding them together: (519 + 353)f = 872f Now the equation is: 872f = 42f + 14940 Step 2: Move all terms with 'f' to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. To do this, subtract 42f from both sides: 872f - 42f = 14940 This simplifies to: 830f = 14940 Step 3: Solve for 'f'. Now, to solve for 'f', divide both sides of the equation by 830: f = 14940 / 830 Step 4: Simplify the fraction. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 14940 and 830 is 10: f = (14940 / 10) / (830 / 10) f = 1494 / 83 So, the solution is: f = 1494 / 83"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Three decades later, the local government is pouring funds into the tourism sector. Ancient monuments and museums are being restored, and various copies of Buddhist and Tang heritage are being constructed to help Chinese tourists rediscover their national heritage. One of those ancient monuments is the Big Wild Goose Pagoda-Xi'an's most sacred   monument-which was built in 652 by the monk Xuanzang ,who travelled across India for 18 years and returned with a precious collection of Buddhist sacred texts. In 1966,the Red Guards burnt the pagoda's scriptures, silk wall hangings and other relics in a bonfire that raged all night. But that destruction has largely been forgotten as tourists flock to the newly restored pagoda. The only original remainders-the empty shell of the seven-storey pagoda-light up at night, standing out in the city's skyline. Xi'an is also displaying the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty, with a 165-acre Tang Paradise Theme Park that is visited by flocks of tourist groups. Although every bit of this Tang heritage is recreated, it is artistically pleasing, landscaped with ponds and lakes, classical gardens, bridges, palaces and pavilions.

Just outside the town of Crescent Cove, Mike Tobacco and his girlfriend Debbie Stone are parked with other couples at the local lovers' lane when they spot a strange glowing object falling to Earth. Nearby, farmer Gene Green also spies the object, and believing it to be Halley's Comet, he ventures into the woods to find the impact site. He instead stumbles upon a large circus tent-like structure, and he and his dog are abruptly captured by mysterious clown-like aliens, the \\"Klowns\\". Shortly thereafter, Mike and Debbie arrive to investigate for themselves. Entering the structure, they discover a complex interior with elevators and various bizarre rooms. They soon find a gelatinized Green encased in a cotton candy-like cocoon and are spotted by a klown, who shoots popcorn at them from a large gun. The couple flees, pursued by a group of klowns and a balloon animal dog that comes to life. Narrowly escaping, Mike and Debbie travel to the police station to report the incident to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson, and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney. The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then travel to the lovers' lane, only to find all the cars abandoned and covered in a cotton candy-like substance.

Hypothesis: The older lady is wearing gold jewelry. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. From the provided premise, it is stated that the older woman is wearing a golden earring. This golden earring constitutes as gold jewelry. In the premise, two significant pieces of information are provided: she is wearing sunglasses and a golden earring. Sunglasses note her accessory choice, it doesn't tie into the gold jewelry hypothesis but it helps build an image of her get-up. The key piece of information in the premise relative to the given hypothesis is the mention of a golden earring. An earring is a piece of jewelry, and since the earring is described as golden, it falls under the category of gold jewelry. Thus, considering the definition of jewelry, which commonly refers to personal adornments such as rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, and keeping in mind that the material of the earring is described as gold, it is indeed valid to infer from the premise that the older lady is wearing gold jewelry. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"The older lady is wearing gold jewelry\\" is true if we consider that premise is true.  However, it's crucial to note that this statement does not indicate all the possible jewelry that the older woman could be wearing. The golden earring is the only piece of jewelry mentioned. She could potentially be wearing other pieces of jewelry that are not gold, but that does not negate the hypothesis since there is, at least, one piece of jewelry (the golden earring) that confirms it. It also doesn't indicate the quantity of gold jewelry. We can only verify she's wearing one golden earring, without information about other possible golden jewelry. Nevertheless, the known presence of the gold earring supports the hypothesis.  In conclusion, it is accurate to assert that the hypothesis holds up under the evidence provided in the given premise. The older woman in question is indeed wearing gold jewelry as she has on a golden earring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  Please answer this question : Which farm used fewer cover crops?","output":"Based on the given situation, Apple farm implemented an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils. Agroforestry systems often include groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses, which help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.

It is portrayed as a very spooky, forbidding place.While finishing up on his vacation in Istanbul, Turkey, American college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is in his hotel room and straps several pounds of hashish (about two kilograms) to his body. The film's soundtrack consists of an increasing heartbeat.Billy is at the airport, nervous at being caught smuggling, goes to the washroom to wet his face and attempt to relax himself, and makes his way with his girlfriend, Susan (Irene Miracle), through customs.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The overseas expansion under the crown of Castile was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish conquistadores. The Americas were incorporated into the Spanish Empire, with the exception of Brazil and Canada, and the crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the Catholic faith through indigenous conversions. Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands, half of South America, most of Central America and much of North America (including present day Mexico, Florida and the Southwestern and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States). During the Napoleonic Peninsular War in Europe between France and Spain, assemblies called juntas were established to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII of Spain. The Libertadores (Spanish and Portuguese for \\"Liberators\\") were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence. They were predominantly criollos (Americas-born people of European ancestry, mostly Spanish or Portuguese), bourgeois and influenced by liberalism and in some cases with military training in the mother country.  In 1809 the first declarations of independence from Spanish rule occurred in the Viceroyalty of New Granada. The first two were in present-day Bolivia at Sucre (May 25), and La Paz (July 16); and the third in present-day Ecuador at Quito (August 10). In 1810 Mexico declared independence, with the Mexican War of Independence following for over a decade. In 1821 Treaty of Cordoba established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War. The Plan of Iguala was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico.  These began a movement for colonial independence that spread to Spain's other colonies in the Americas. The ideas from the French and the American Revolution influenced the efforts. All of the colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, attained independence by the 1820s. The British Empire offered support, wanting to end the Spanish monopoly on trade with its colonies in the Americas.  In 1898, the United States achieved victory in the Spanish-American War with Spain, ending the Spanish colonial era. Spanish possession and rule of its remaining colonies in the Americas ended in that year with its sovereignty transferred to the United States. The United States took occupation of Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico continues to be a possession of the United States, now officially continues as a self-governing unincorporated territory.

News article: The promotion of Julianna Smoot to White House Social Secretary is good news for wealthy donors to President Obama's campaign, for whom Smoot -- the chief campaign fundraiser -- is friend and point of contact.      Smoot, who had been working in the relative obscurity of the U.S. Trade Representative's office, will now be the key gatekeeper to the kind of social functions from which donors have complained that this administration, unlike President Clinton's, has barred them.      But the choice to unite money and access in the person of Smoot -- a career political fundraiser whose efforts were downplayed by a campaign eager to focus on small donors -- cuts against both President Obama's broader message of change and against the talking points of her departing predecessor, Desiree Rogers.      Rogers told Lynn Sweet that she saw her role as turning the White House into the \\"people's house,\\" and Michelle Obama praised her in a statement for \\"welcoming scores of everyday Americans through its doors, from wounded warriors to local schoolchildren to NASCAR drivers.\\"      Smoot may have the same goal, but her credentials and relationships point in the opposite direction: To ensuring access and satisfaction for the ultra-wealthy elite who will, incidentally, be called on to finance President Obama's next campaign.      A White House official says appointing a fundraising staffer Social Secretary isn't \\"outside the norm\\" because one of President George W. Bush's Social Secretaries, Lea Berman, had been such a staffer, though not one of Smoot's centrality.      comments closed      permalink ||||| Smoot will replace Desiree Rogers when she steps down next month. Smoot is a big Democratic donor and last served as chief of staff for U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk.            “I am humbled and excited to take on the role of White House Social Secretary and support the Obama administration in a different capacity,” Smoot said in a statement. “Over the last year, I have had the honor of building relationships in the international community through my work at USTR, and I am looking forward to implementing this experience at the White House.”      ADVERTISEMENT      Rogers said she stepped down to explore opportunities in the corporate world but she also came under fire last November after Virginia socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi crashed the White House's first state dinner.      Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee demanded that Rogers testify as to how they gained entry into the event.      But White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in December that Rogers would not testify at hearings due to separation of powers.      Smoot, who served as the 2008 Obama campaign's finance director, comes aboard with Capitol Hill experience as well, having worked for Democratic Sens. Harry Reid (Nev.), Charles Schumer (N.Y.), Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Jay Rockefeller (W.Va.)      \\"Julianna Smoot brings extraordinary organization and people skills to the role, and sharp attention to detail – all attributes critical to the highly complex responsibilities of the White House Social Secretary,\\" said Susan Sher, First Lady Michelle Obama's chief of staff.       ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The appointment of Julianna Smoot as White House Social Secretary is seen as beneficial for wealthy donors to President Obama's campaign, due to her strong connections as chief campaign fundraiser. Smoot, previously working in the U.S. Trade Representative's office, will now be responsible for managing the social events that wealthy donors have felt excluded from in comparison to the Clinton administration. However, Smoot's appointment does seem to contradict President Obama's message of change and Desiree Rogers' previous efforts in turning the White House into the \\"people's house.\\" Smoot's expertise is more inclined towards catering to the ultra-wealthy elite who will be essential in financing President Obama's campaigns. Although appointing a fundraising staffer as Social Secretary is not unusual, as seen in President George W. Bush's administration, some critics view Smoot's appointment as a significant step away from the \\"people's house\\" message."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A blighted ovum or anembryonic gestation is characterized by a normal-appearing gestational sac, but the absence of an embryo. It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast. When small, the sac cannot be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy, as there may be a yolk sac, though a fetal pole is not seen. For diagnosis, the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established. The criteria depends on the type of ultrasound exam performed. A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) greater than 25 mm and no yolk sac, or an MGD >25 mm with no embryo. Transabdominal imaging without transvaginal scanning may be sufficient for diagnosing early pregnancy failure when an embryo whose crown--rump length is 15 mm or more has no visible cardiac activity. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: do you have yolk sac with blighted ovum?","output":"Based on the above text, it is possible to have a yolk sac with a blighted ovum. In the early stages of a blighted ovum, the gestational sac may appear normal and a yolk sac might be present, though a fetal pole is not seen.

Positive Movie Review: Parasite (2019) Title: A Masterful Exploration of Society's Depths Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a brilliant, genre-defying film that expertly weaves together elements of dark comedy, drama, and thriller. The South Korean film simultaneously captivated and unsettled audiences around the world, earning not only the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival but also becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards. The story follows the yearning Kim family, who struggles to make ends meet in their semi-basement apartment. When the son, Ki-woo, hatches a cunning plan to infiltrate the affluent Park family's household, the Kims swiftly and deceptively become indispensable to their unsuspecting hosts. As Bong Joon-ho carefully peels back the layers of his intricate story, secrets and grotesque discoveries lie in wait, leading to a shocking climax that will render viewers speechless. Bong Joon-ho's masterful storytelling is backed up by a powerful and talented ensemble cast, with exceptional performances by Song Kang-ho as the head of the Kim family, Choi Woo-shik as the son Ki-woo, Park So-dam as his sister Ki-jeong, and Jang Hye-jin as the mother Chung-sook. The cast brings to life the complex and multidimensional characters, eliciting fascination, sympathy, and horror in equal measure. Remarkable cinematography and set design further elevate Parasite into the echelon of cinematic masterpieces. The contrast between the cramped, dingy living conditions of the Kim family and the meticulously sleek and expansive Park residence underscores the suffocating oppression and disparity between social classes. The carefully chosen color schemes, sweeping tracking shots, and geometric compositions not only enhance the film's visual appeal but also serve as a visual metaphor for the labyrinthine structures of societal hierarchy. One of the film's most striking aspects, however, is its ability to intertwine moments of dark humor with soul-stirring drama and nail-biting suspense. Bong Joon-ho proves that the audience's emotions can be manipulated with great dexterity, as he takes viewers on an unpredictable rollercoaster ride through the underbelly of society. The biting satire, tear-jerking tragedy, and heart-stopping tension are masterfully crafted and seamlessly woven together, showcasing Bong Joon-ho's unparalleled skill as a storyteller. In conclusion, Parasite is a haunting masterpiece that delves into the realm of social inequality and unfurls its darkest corners. The film is as visually stunning as it is deeply unsettling, intelligently provoking thought, outrage, and introspection long after the credits roll. Bong Joon-ho has created a genuinely original cinematic experience that transcends boundaries and genres, solidifying its place as an exceptional work of art in the annals of film history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  and the situation: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy.  Answer the following question: Which element has more electronegativity? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it can be inferred that electronegativity generally decreases down a column of the periodic table. Since Timmy has observed that Sampline is located further down the periodic table than Mardine, Mardine would have a higher electronegativity value as compared to Sampline. This trend in electronegativity occurs because as you move down a column, the atomic size increases. This is due to the addition of energy levels (electron shells) as you go down the periodic table, which in turn, leads to an increase in electron shielding. Electron shielding is the phenomenon where inner electrons shield or block the outer electrons from feeling the full attraction of the positively charged nucleus. As a result, the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons decreases with the increase in the number of electron shells. This lowers the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons, leading to a decrease in electronegativity for elements further down the column. In conclusion, Timmy can infer that Mardine, the element higher up in the column, will have a higher electronegativity value as compared to Sampline, which is positioned lower down the column in the periodic table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Located within the City of Sydney, this historic church has been in continuous use since its consecration in February 1824, making it the oldest church building in the city still used for its original purpose. St. James' Church played a significant role in the early days of colonial Australia, reflecting the close association between government and religion at the time. The church was part of a group of official buildings constructed on the east side of Sydney under Governor Macquarie's town plan, which aimed to improve the fledgling settlement. However, the location and completion of the church were disrupted by the intervention of the British government's Commissioner of Enquiry, J.T. Bigge, and the administrative consequences of the controversial Bigge Commission. The historic significance of St. James' Church extends beyond its architectural and institutional history. The church was where the first Bishop of Australia, W.G. Broughton, was installed in 1836, and he regularly officiated services there. It was also the site where the first classes were held for Australia's initial theological college, emphasizing the importance of the church in the establishment of the Anglican Church in the country. St. James' Church also played a role in education, hosting the first kindergarten teaching initiative in New South Wales. The renovation of the building from 1900 to 1902 marked a shift in attitudes towards the preservation of historic buildings and an appreciation for the structure's architectural style, despite criticism in the late 19th century. Furthermore, the church has strong associations with various prominent individuals in the cultural and natural history of New South Wales, including architects Francis Greenway, John Verge, Varney Parkes, and John Hingeston Buckeridge; artists Ethel Anderson, the Turramurra Painters, Norman Carter, David Wright, and Leon Sadubin; as well as Bishop William Grant Broughton and a long line of distinguished clergy members. In conclusion, St. James' Church in Sydney holds a special place in Australian history as the location where the first ordinations of Anglican clergy took place in the country. The church's rich legacy, architectural beauty, and associations with key figures in New South Wales's history make it an essential historical and cultural landmark."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Son rôle est de fournir un appui technique et financier aux pays en développement pour les aider à élaborer et mettre en œuvre des stratégies de développement durable à long terme. Le PNUD travaille en partenariat avec les gouvernements, la société civile et d'autres partenaires internationaux pour réaliser les Objectifs de développement durable (ODD) adoptés par les Nations Unies en 2015. En plaçant l'Office sous l'administration du PNUD, l'objectif était de renforcer la coopération et la coordination entre les différents organismes des Nations Unies travaillant dans le domaine du développement. Cela permettait également de faciliter l'accès aux ressources et à l'expertise nécessaires pour mener à bien les programmes et les projets de développement. Au fil des ans, le PNUD a mené diverses initiatives pour améliorer la vie des populations des pays en développement. Parmi ces initiatives figurent, entre autres, la promotion de l'égalité des sexes, la lutte contre le changement climatique, la préservation de la biodiversité et la promotion de la gouvernance et de la paix. Le PNUD s'appuie sur un réseau de bureaux de pays et de partenaires locaux pour fournir un soutien généralisé qui répond aux besoins spécifiques des pays en développement. En résumé, en 1977, la mise sous l'administration du PNUD de l'Office permettait à l'organisation internationale de mieux coordonner et de renforcer les efforts de développement dans les différents pays. Cette mesure a également facilité l'accès aux ressources et à l'expertise nécessaires pour soutenir les objectifs de développement à long terme. Aujourd'hui, le PNUD continue de travailler en étroite collaboration avec les gouvernements, la société civile et les partenaires internationaux pour concrétiser les Objectifs de développement durable et créer un monde meilleur pour tous."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Baltic languages can be found in which general area?\\"  Context: \\"In order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, many scholars have proposed the Indo-Aryan migration theory, asserting that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in what is now India and Pakistan from the north-west some time during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the Baltic and Slavic languages, vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European Uralic languages, and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.\\"  Answer:","output":"The Baltic languages can be found in the northeastern region of Europe, specifically in the area around the Baltic Sea. There are primarily two living Baltic languages spoken today: Latvian and Lithuanian. Both of these languages belong to the Eastern Baltic subgroup. They are mainly spoken in the countries of Latvia and Lithuania, which are part of the Baltic region, along with Estonia. In the context you provided, the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues, Baltic and Slavic languages is highlighted as evidence for the Indo-Aryan migration theory. This theory suggests that the original speakers of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, arrived in present-day India and Pakistan from the northwest during the early second millennium BCE. In summary, the Baltic languages, which include Latvian and Lithuanian, are primarily spoken in the northeastern part of Europe, particularly in the countries of Latvia and Lithuania, making up the Baltic region along with Estonia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.\\"  Answer:","output":"The bird, a Manx shearwater, flew from Boston in the United States to its colony in Skomer, Wales, which is a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi)."},{"instruction":"Every evening, 15-year-old Rashida returns home from school, changes out of her uniform, and rushes to a neighboring farm to help her mother harvest vegetables.

Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. \\"We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,\\" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams.

Can you tell me the answer to what time did one direction became a band??","output":"One Direction was formed on July 23, 2010, during the seventh season of the British singing competition show \\"The X Factor.\\" Here's a more detailed account of how the band came into existence: In 2010, five young singers—Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, and Louis Tomlinson—auditioned for \\"The X Factor\\" as solo artists. The judges for that season were Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole, Dannii Minogue, and Louis Walsh. While all five singers were talented on their own, they were individually eliminated from the competition during the Bootcamp round. However, the judges saw potential in them and recognized that the boys had something special, so the judges came up with an idea. Simon Cowell decided to bring them back into the competition as a group. On July 23, 2010, the five singers were asked to return to the show and perform together as a new band, which would later be known as One Direction. This change of events can be accredited to a specific time during the show's filming, though the exact hour and minute are not documented. Their first appearance as a group was performing a rendition of \\"Torn\\" by Natalie Imbruglia during the Judges' houses stage of the competition. The performance was well-received, and they were moved forward to the live shows. Throughout their time on \\"The X Factor,\\" One Direction gained a massive fan following and finished in third place in the competition. Although they didn't win, their appearance on the show led to a recording contract with Simon Cowell's label Syco Records in 2011. In the years following their formation, One Direction became one of the most successful boy bands of all time. They released five studio albums, embarked on four world tours, and achieved numerous awards and chart-topping hits. In 2015, Zayn Malik left the group to pursue a solo career, and in 2016, One Direction announced they would be going on an indefinite hiatus as the remaining members pursued solo projects. In summary, One Direction officially became a band on July 23, 2010, during their time on \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK. Their formation as a group was a pivotal moment in pop music and would lead to a successful career spanning several years, leaving a lasting impact on popular culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:  Michael is planning on playing a prank on his older brother. He is going to take a bungee cord and stretch it and then release it so that it hits his older brother as he is sleeping.  He is deciding whether to stretch the cord only partially or completely before releasing it.  Will the bungee cord resist further stretching more when it's stretched partially or completely? The answer to this question is:","output":"The bungee cord will resist further stretching more when it is stretched completely as compared to when it is stretched partially. This resistance is due to the properties of elastic materials and the relation between elastic force and the degree of deformation. As mentioned earlier, elasticity is the property of a material to return to its original shape after being deformed (stretched or compressed). Elastic force is the counteracting force exerted by the material in response to this deformation. Hooke's Law plays a vital role in understanding this relation between elastic force and the degree of deformation. Hooke's Law states that the elastic force (F) acting on an object is directly proportional to the object's elongation (x) or deformation and can be represented as: F = k * x Where F is the elastic force, k is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the material), and x is the elongation or amount of deformation. Based on this law, we can conclude that the more a bungee cord is stretched (increased x), the greater elastic force (F) it develops. So, when the bungee cord is stretched completely, it will have a higher elastic force acting against its deformation as compared to when it is only partially stretched. As a result, it will resist further stretching more when it has been stretched completely. However, it is important to note that every elastic material has an elastic limit. The elastic limit is the maximum extent to which a material can be deformed before its elasticity is permanently impacted, and it does not return to its original shape when the force is removed. If the bungee cord is stretched beyond its elastic limit, it will no longer resist further stretching as effectively, and its ability to spring back to its original shape may be compromised. In conclusion, the bungee cord will resist further stretching more when it is stretched completely as compared to when it is stretched partially due to the direct proportionality between elastic force and the degree of deformation as explained by Hooke's Law. However, exceeding the elastic limit of the material can reduce or eliminate this resistance and may permanently damage the cord's elasticity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the most extensive missing-child searches was mounted to find him, but two decades later, the boy was officially declared dead. No one has ever been arrested.      FILE - In this May 18, 1985 file photo, Stanly Patz, left, holds a photo of his son Etan, as he poses for a photo with his other son Ari, at their home in New York. Etan Patz vanished on May 25, 1979.... (Associated Press)      Now, the Manhattan district attorney's office will take a fresh look at the evidence collected against the prime suspect, a convicted child molester serving 20 years in prison in Pennsylvania.      By looking into the cold case, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. will be making good on a campaign promise. A spokeswoman for Vance said Wednesday she could not comment further on an open investigation.      Etan Patz (pronounced AY'-tahn payts) vanished while walking from his lower Manhattan home to a bus stop two blocks away. His disappearance spawned the national movement to publicize the cases of missing children. His photo was the first put on a milk carton, and his case turned May 25 into National Missing Children's Day.      The longtime former district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said repeatedly he didn't have enough evidence to charge anyone. But Etan's father, Stan Patz, said that while there is little forensic evidence, he believes there is enough to convene a grand jury and get an indictment.      \\"All we have been asking for is the district attorney to take a good look at the information,\\" Patz said. \\"I realize this is not like \`CSI.' That's why it's been a tough case all along. But there is enough evidence that a competent attorney can use to prosecute.\\"      Jose Ramos, who had dated Etan's baby sitter, has been the prime suspect all along, according to the boy's family. Ramos allegedly admitted to Pennsylvania authorities that he tried to molest Etan on the day of the child's disappearance but has denied harming him. It was unclear Wednesday if Ramos has an attorney, and Ramos was unreachable at the prison.      After Etan's disappearance, his parents kept the same number and stayed in the same SoHo apartment, in case he returned. But in 2001, after waiting 22 years, they obtained a court order declaring the boy dead.      In 2004, a Manhattan judge ruled Ramos was responsible for the boy's disappearance and presumed death, after the inmate ignored orders to answer deposition questions for a lawyer for the boy's parents. He was later ordered to pay 2 million to Etan's family.      Ramos is to be released in 2012 after a 20-year sentence for sexually abusing an 8-year-old boy, bringing a certain urgency to the case, which was never officially closed, the boy's father said. At least one FBI agent and a New York Police Department liaison is assigned to the case.      Patz is hopeful a fresh pair of eyes will yield some results.      \\"He (Vance) says he's willing to do that, and the fact he's willing to say it in public is very encouraging,\\" Patz said. ||||| The 31-year-old case of Etan Patz, the little boy who disappeared on his way to a school bus stop in downtown Manhattan, has been reopened, a spokeswoman for the New York district attorney confirmed to ABC News.      On National Missing Children's Day, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance agreed to investigate the iconic case, which sparked a national campaign to find missing children and marked profound changes in how missing children cases were investigated.      Vance took office in January after the retirement of District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who had declined to proceed with the case, citing insufficient evidence.      Play      For the Patz family, it has been more than three decades of agonizing investigations and years of wondering what happened to their blond son with the gorgeous smile, and questioning why the man they believe is responsible for his kidnapping -- Jose Antonio Ramos -- has never been held criminally liable.      \\"I still gag with fear that this child must have felt ... when he realized he was being betrayed by an adult,\\" Etan's father Stan Patz told ABC News' \\"20/20\\" in an interview last May.      Play      Former federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who fought to solve the disappearance of Etan Patz for more than 20 years, told ABC News he agrees with Vance's decision.      \\"I'm quite pleased that the DA's office sees fit to reopen the investigation and hopefully they'll also see fit to indict and convict Jose Antonio Ramos for the abduction and murder of Etan Patz,\\" said GraBois, who took over the investigation in 1985, but was never able to prosecute the case.      Ramos, an imprisoned child molester whose former girlfriend had worked for the Patzes, walking Etan to and from school during a bus strike, is still the main suspect in the case.      Play      Investigators connected Ramos, a convicted pedophile, to the Etan Patz case. Etan's body was never found, but he was declared dead in 2001. In a 2004 civil suit, a New York judge ruled Ramos responsible for Etan's death -- a charge he denied. Ramos is currently serving time in a Pennsylvania prison for molesting an 8-year-old boy in an unrelated case. He is expected to stay behind bars until 2012.      Missing Child: The Search for Etan Patz      On May 25, 1979, six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared in the Soho neighborhood of New York City walking to the school bus stop. It triggered a massive search where neighbors and police covered the city with missing child posters featuring Etan's smiling face. But there were few leads.      Etan's father -- a professional photographer -- used a collection of photographs he had taken of his son in the effort to find the missing boy. Stan Patz's photos of Etan would be printed on countless missing child posters, milk cartons, and even projected on screens in New York's Times Square.      At first, detectives considered the Patzes as possible suspects, but they quickly determined the parents had no involvement.      'The 90 Percent Confession'      From early on, GraBois believed that Ramos was involved in Etan's disappearance. Some boys had accused Ramos of trying to lure them inside a drainpipe, where he lived in 1982 in the Bronx. When police searched the drainpipe, they found photographs of Ramos and young boys who resembled Etan, but no charges were pressed and Ramos vanished. GraBois eventually found out that Ramos was in custody in Pennsylvania in connection with an unrelated child molestation case.      GraBois brought Ramos to New York to meet face-to-face. Ramos had no idea why he was there. Out of the blue, GraBois asked him directly, \\"How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz?\\" According to GraBois, Ramos \\"froze\\" and said, \\"I'll tell you everything.\\"      Ramos' response is now known as \\"the 90 percent confession.\\" He admitted taking a young boy back to his apartment for sex on the day Etan disappeared and told GraBois he was 90 percent sure it was the boy he later saw on TV. As GraBois pointed out, \\"the only boy missing and on television that evening was Etan Patz.\\" GraBois said that at that moment he \\"believed we had the right guy.\\"      But the confession was not complete. Ramos did not use Etan's name and he claimed he had \\"put the boy on a subway.\\"      GraBois himself would never hear the last 10 percent of the story that he was after. However, during Ramos' time in lockup, two convicted criminals, claimed to have knowledge about Ramos and volunteered to try to get more information from Ramos about the Patz case.      One informant told GraBois and FBI agent Mary Galligan that Ramos told him that he knew what happened to Etan. Ramos had even drawn a map of Etan's school bus route, pointing out that he knew Etan's stop was the third one.      In an interview with 20/20 on the thirtieth anniversary of his son's disappearance, Stan Patz said each year he sends a special reminder to Ramos in prison that the case is not forgotten. He mails one of the old lost child posters to Ramos with a simple typewritten line on the back that reads: What did you do to my little boy?      ABC News' Emily Friedman contributed to this report. |||||","output":"A long time ago, in 1979, a six-year-old boy named Etan Patz disappeared while walking to his bus stop in New York. People looked for him everywhere, but they could not find him. Many years later, in 2001, people said he was officially not alive anymore, but no one knows what really happened to him. Now, some important people called district attorneys want to look at the very old case again. They think a man who is in prison for doing bad things to children might be the one who did something to Etan. Etan's family is hopeful that looking at the case again might help them know what happened to him."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Background: Anton Friedrich Wilhelm (von) Webern (German: ['anton 've:ban] ( listen); 3 December 1883 - 15 September 1945) was an Austrian composer and conductor. Along with his mentor Arnold Schoenberg and his colleague Alban Berg, Webern was in the core of those in the circle of the Second Viennese School, including Ernst Krenek and Theodor W. Adorno. As an exponent of atonality and twelve-tone technique, Webern exerted influence on contemporaries Luigi Dallapiccola, Krenek, and even Schoenberg himself. Context: Webern published little of his early work in particular; like Brahms, though perhaps for not entirely the same reasons, Webern was characteristically meticulous and revised extensively. Many juvenilia remained unknown until the work and findings of the Moldenhauers in the 1960s, effectively obscuring and undermining formative facets of Webern's musical identity, highly significant even more so in the case of an innovator whose music was crucially marked by rapid stylistic shifts. Thus when Boulez first oversaw a project to record \\"all\\" of Webern's music, not including the juvenilia, the results fit on three rather than six CDs.  Webern's earliest works consist primarily of lieder, the genre that most belies his roots in Romanticism, specifically German Romanticism; one in which the music yields brief but explicit, potent, and spoken meaning manifested only latently or programmatically in purely instrumental genres; one marked by significant intimacy and lyricism; and one which often associates nature, especially landscapes, with themes of homesickness, solace, wistful yearning, distance, utopia, and belonging. Robert Schumann's \\"Mondnacht\\" is an iconic example; Eichendorff, whose lyric poetry inspired it, is not far removed from the poets (e.g., Richard Dehmel, Gustav Falke, Theodor Storm) whose work inspired Webern and his contemporaries Alban Berg, Max Reger, Arnold Schoenberg, Richard Strauss, Hugo Wolf, and Alexander Zemlinsky. Wolf's Morike-Lieder were especially influential on Webern's efforts from this period. But well beyond these lieder alone, all of Webern's music may be said to possess such concerns and qualities, as is evident from his sketches, albeit in an increasingly symbolic, abstract, spare, introverted, and idealized manner.  Other works include the orchestral tone poem Im Sommerwind (1904) and the Langsamer Satz (1905) for string quartet.  Webern's first piece after completing his studies with Schoenberg was the Passacaglia for orchestra (1908). Harmonically, it is a step forward into a more advanced language, and the orchestration is somewhat more distinctive than his earlier orchestral work. However, it bears little relation to the fully mature works he is best known for today. One element that is typical is the form itself: the passacaglia is a form which dates back to the 17th century, and a distinguishing feature of Webern's later work was to be the use of traditional compositional techniques (especially canons) and forms (the Symphony, the Concerto, the String Trio, and String Quartet, and the piano and orchestral Variations) in a modern harmonic and melodic language. Question: what was Juvenilia?. Whats the answer?","output":"Juvenilia refers to the early works or compositions of an artist, writer, or musician, which were created during their youth, before they fully developed their mature style and mastery. In the context of Anton Webern, juvenilia refers to his early compositions that remained largely unknown until the discoveries made by the Moldenhauers in the 1960s. These early works provide insight into Webern's formative influences and his progression towards the innovative musical style he became known for as a key member of the Second Viennese School."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The basic reason is that his Catholic flock in Africa has increased faster there than in any other part of the world during the past 50 years. The Pope has just been forced to set up a new programme of evangelisation in Europe, where Catholics have been leaving the church in ever greater numbers. In Europe there is a serious problem of renewing an ageing priesthood. In West Africa his flock is flourishing, despite antagonism and even violence between Christians and Muslims in several countries. New vocations are booming. The Ouidah Catholic seminary is the burgeoning training ground for new African priests who - 150 years after the first Catholic missionaries from Switzerland established themselves there - are prepared to reverse the missionary direction and carry out pastoral work among Europeans in Europe. But Ouidah is also a centre for traditional African religions.  It is the heartland of Voodoo, whose rituals and beliefs travelled to the Caribbean and to South America, particularly Brazil, during the centuries when slavery depopulated West Africa. By Virgile AhissouBBC Afrique, Cotonou Voodoo is completely normal in Benin. People across West Africa, especially Togo, Ghana and Nigeria hold similar beliefs but in Benin it is recognised as an official religion, followed by some 40% of the population. It has none of the negative connotations it has in the West and many of those who are officially Christian or Muslim also incorporate some Voodoo elements into their beliefs, especially in times of crisis. But Voodoo is more than a belief system, it is a complete way of life, including culture, philosophy, language, art, dance, music and medicine. Voodoo priests ask the gods to intervene on behalf of ordinary people but local adherents stress that they have nothing to do with sorcery or black magic. People here do not stick needles into dolls to cause misfortune to their enemies, as you see in some Western films. What is Voodoo? In pictures: Voodoo priestess There is still a Voodoo temple filled with sacred pythons in Ouidah, not far from the huge Catholic seminary. Voodoo is a belief system with a culture which includes art, dance, music, rituals, medicine, and is expressed in several languages. Nearly half the population of Benin still follow traditional African animist religions such as Voodoo. Many who have converted to Catholicism still refuse to abandon their former beliefs entirely. The Catholic Church however has a problem with this. It is called syncretism, which means treating all religions on the same footing. Right-wing Catholic traditionalists denounced the late Pope John Paul II for allegedly \\"consorting with Satan\\" when he invited an African animist to take part in his groundbreaking interfaith prayer for world peace in the Italian city of Assisi, the shrine of Saint Francis, back in 1986. Pope John Paul's successor, Benedict, invited another African traditional religious leader to celebrate with him the 25th anniversary of that meeting only last month.  But this time there were no public prayers together, only private meditation. The Catholic Church, which cannot tolerate the idea of Protestants and Catholics sharing the same communion table, has even greater difficulty in reconciling the worship of Jesus Christ side-by-side with African animists offering libations to spirits of the forest. The Pope travelled to Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, with a larger retinue of advisers than usual on his travels. All the senior Vatican Cardinals who work in the Roman Curia were invited by the pope to join him for the six-hour flight. They included Cardinal Peter Appiah Turkson from Ghana, the head of the Vatican's Council for Justice and Peace, the body which monitors human rights records not only in African countries but around the world. Cardinal Turkson is the first Ghanaian to be appointed to the highest rank of prelates in the Catholic Church. He is even considered to be a possible candidate to succeed Benedict XVI, when the 84-year-old pontiff dies. Another member of the Pope's retinue is Bishop Barthelemy Adoukonou, a former student of the Pope at the University of Regensburg in Germany, where he taught theology. Monsignor Adoukonou, promoted to the rank of Bishop as recently as last month, is rapidly gaining influence as an adviser in the highest ranks of the Roman Curia. One of Pope Benedict's restricted number of engagements in Benin - but one to which he to which he attaches great importance - is a meeting with 200 sick and disabled children, who are looked after by Catholic missionaries. He will address all the suffering children of Africa in a speech he plans to make where they live. Another high point of Pope Benedict's visit to Benin will be a meeting with the head of state, members of the government and members of the diplomatic corps in the presidential palace. About 3,000 people are expected to attend and Pope Benedict plans another keynote speech, in which he will refer to the many human rights abuses in Africa. He will refer also to the role of the Church during the democratisation of the country, following Marxist rule after its independence. Here, he also plans to greet some local leaders of traditional African religions who have been invited for the occasion. Vatican Radio has produced its first music CD on the occasion of the Pope's African visit. Five thousand copies will be distributed to representatives of local churches. It is called Afrika Tenda Amani and has been recorded by two popular West African musicians Papa Wemba and Bonga. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the reasons behind the Pope's visit to West Africa, particularly Benin, where the Catholic Church has seen significant growth in recent years. Unlike Europe, where the number of Catholics is declining, West Africa witnesses a flourishing Catholic population, with new vocations booming despite tensions between Christians and Muslims. Ouidah, a center for the training of African priests, is also a vital hub for traditional African religions like Voodoo, which has a substantial following in the region and is often incorporated into other religious practices.  The Catholic Church does not approve syncretism, which involves treating all religions equally. This causes difficulty in reconciling Christianity with African traditional beliefs and practices. The Pope's visit includes several meetings, such as addressing sick and disabled children, meeting with the head of state and various government and diplomatic officials, and engaging with local leaders of traditional African religions.

Article: Trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis, Spain is considering moving the country's clock back by one hour. Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. \\"The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,\\" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.\\"This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.\\" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet. Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less.

It's just a couple of miles from  Shepperton film studios - where movies such as The Third Man, The Omen, Alien and Shakespeare In Love were filmed - and Creek House has played its own part in showbiz history. The Canadian-born British TV personalities  Bernard Braden and his wife Barbara Kelly once owned the 19th Century, seven-bedroom mansion - which is now on the market for a guide price of £3 million. Bernard and Barbara were household names in the 1950s and 1960s. Bernard is best remembered for ITV's On The Braden Beat - a precursor to Esther Rantzen's That's Life - in which he showcased his acerbic wit. Creek House, Shepperton, bought for £650,000 by Mr Barry and Mrs Jane Wilkinson. Barbara is remembered for regular appearances on the hugely popular BBC Sunday night panel show What's My Line? In the couple's heyday, House & Garden magazine devoted eight pages to an 'at home' interview with them and their three children. The couple spent nine years at Creek House, in Surrey, where the garden leads down to Millbrook Creek, which flows into the Thames. In 1959 they sold the house to actor John Gregson and his wife Thea, who lived there with their six children. Gregson starred in 40 films, including Ealing comedies Whisky Galore! and The Lavender Hill Mob. But he is renowned for the Bafta-winning 1953 picture Genevieve, in which he starred alongside Kenneth More. He died aged 55 in 1975. Earlier, the pub down the road from. Creek House was a focus of Hollywood gossip, as it was where trysts. between Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were conducted while Taylor. was still married to Eddie Fisher. 'The Gregsons held parties here where they played host to stars such as Peter O'Toole, Peter Ustinov and Vivien Leigh,' says current owner Barry Wilkinson, 74. 'We feel very dull in comparison,' says his wife Jane, 67. While the central part of the house is Georgian in style, there are sprawling Arts and Crafts and Victorian additions that the Wilkinsons believe were added by an early architect owner. These include a stunning room at the top of the house with stained-glass windows and a vaulted ceiling - now Barry's study. Former resident John Gregson in a scene from the 1949 film Whisky Galore! The Wilkinsons bought the house 16 years. ago from a dentist who had bought it from Thea Gregson. She had stayed. on in the house for several years after John's death. Thea is still alive and living in the Cotswolds and until recently made twice-yearly pilgrimages to Creek House. A devout Catholic, she built a small - and unconsecrated - chapel  in the grounds which still stands today on the acre of land across the creek which is included in the house sale. When the Wilkinsons bought it for £650,000, they had a teenage son and daughter and the house was in need of a lot of work. 'We were living in Woking and had no intention of moving, but a property magazine  came through the letterbox and we couldn't resist coming to have a look,' says Jane,  who used to run her own human resources consultancy. Three days later they had put  in an offer, despite their home not being on the market. The couple spent £250,000 rewiring, installing a new roof, ripping out the dated bathrooms and moving the kitchen from a small anteroom to the middle of the house, where it now looks over the garden down to the creek. They kept one part of the house as a self-contained cottage, which they now let out. The couple retained original features, such as the stunning oak panels in the drawing room, and replaced some of the broken sash windows and doors. They uncovered original fireplaces, which had been painted or boarded over, and restored some stained-glass windows. They had the garden redesigned and landscaped and renovated stone balustrades on the patio. 'I love to restore things - it was a labour of love,' says Barry, a former accountant who retired a year into the three-year project. We hired a builder to do the work for us but I was his apprentice and learnt a lot from him.' The warm, comfortable sitting room at Creek House. According to estate agent Russell Gooden of Jackson-Stops & Staff, Creek House is so unique that there is little to compare it to in the vicinity, although he explains it's not uncommon to pay a 35 to 40 per cent premium for a waterside property in Shepperton. He says prices in the area have been pushed up because of a lack of stock, adding: 'Traditionally, the beginning of the year is a time  to sell, but we haven't seen the usual influx. Mortgages are a little more difficult to get so perhaps people who want to move are unable to do so and a lot of people are still sitting on the fence.' Barry and Jane are now downsizing and plan to buy something smaller in the area. 'We feel very rooted here,' says Jane. 'Shepperton is very villagey and has a great sense of community. People tend to stay a long time.' Who do they expect to buy the house next? 'I've got an image of a young family who would really enjoy being at Creek House,' adds Jane.

The Vikings defense forced Green Bay to punt on the first possession of the game, but soon kicked the ball back to the Packers, allowing Eddie Lacy's running to set up an 8-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers to Randall Cobb. The Vikings' ensuing possession again ended with a punt, and Rodgers punished them with a 66-yard TD pass to Jordy Nelson. The teams traded possession as the game moved into the second quarter, until Ponder threw the ball directly to Packers DE Julius Peppers, who returned the interception 49 yards for his team's third TD of the game. Two plays later, Ponder was picked off again, this time by LB Jamari Lattimore, leaving a short field for Rodgers to work into before throwing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Davante Adams. The second half began in much the same vein, as the Packers forced a Vikings punt on the first possession before marching downfield to set Lacy up for an 11-yard scoring run. The running back went into the end zone again at the end of the Packers' next possession with a 10-yard run, giving the home team a 42-0 lead. CB Marcus Sherels returned the ensuing kickoff 46 yards, and Ponder was able to pass downfield to the Green Bay 6-yard line, from where he ran into the end zone for the Vikings' first points of the game. Three plays later, Harrison Smith picked off a pass from Matt Flynn at the Green Bay 30-yard line, but the Vikings were unable to get into the end zone despite the short field and had to settle for a 26-yard Blair Walsh field goal.

But this isn't the line-up for CES—it's the Sundance Film Festival. After bringing a handful of Oculus Rift installations to Sundance in 2014, the festival's New Frontier program, which focuses on innovation in filmmaking, is doubling down and bringing in a much larger slate of virtual reality experiences for 2015.

As the festival concludes and attendees discuss the groundbreaking experiences they witnessed, the impact of virtual reality in the world of filmmaking and entertainment becomes increasingly apparent. As the Sundance Film Festival wraps up, the success of the New Frontier program, including its focus on virtual reality, is widely celebrated. Film critics and industry professionals realize the immense potential that virtual reality holds for the future of entertainment. From fully immersive movie experiences to interactive video games based on historical events, virtual reality is recognized as a powerful tool that can fundamentally transform storytelling, education, and the way we engage with the world around us. In the months that follow, virtual reality experiences take center stage at numerous film festivals and industry events, drawing attention and investments from major Hollywood studios and tech giants alike. Recognizing the opportunities presented by this burgeoning technology, particularly in the realms of entertainment and education, these companies begin to invest heavily in developing their virtual reality content and platforms. Collaborations between filmmakers, game developers, and tech companies flourish, resulting in the creation of numerous innovative virtual reality experiences. These range from the exploration of fantastical worlds and thrilling adventures to insightful documentaries and simulations that address pressing social and environmental issues. As a result of this newfound focus on the potential of virtual reality, gradually, there is a dramatic shift in the entertainment industry. The days of passive entertainment – simply watching movies or TV shows – begin to fade, as increasingly, viewers are drawn to the more immersive virtual reality experiences that allow them to become active participants in the stories unfolding around them. The rise of VR creates new opportunities for independent filmmakers, who can now create cheaper, more intimate experiences that resonate with audiences on a deeper, more personal level. Virtual reality also becomes an important platform for fostering empathy and understanding by enabling users to experience environments and situations that they may never encounter in real life. Furthermore, the educational potential of VR becomes clear as students from around the world are offered the chance to explore historical events, understand cultural differences, and engage with scientific and artistic concepts through immersive simulations. Enabled by VR, classrooms evolve into interactive spaces where students can learn and collaborate together in a more engaging and dynamic manner. Advancements in technology, along with ongoing experimentation by filmmakers and developers, continue to push the boundaries of what is achievable within the realm of virtual reality. And with these advancements come changes to the way we consume entertainment, interact with one another, and understand the world around us. In the end, this story of the Sundance Film Festival and the focus on VR at the New Frontier program serves as the catalyst for a revolution in the world of entertainment, education, and communication. The turn to virtual reality not only forces the film industry to rethink the way they tell stories but also paves the way for a more immersive, interactive, and empathetic society, forever transforming the way we experience and connect with each other and the world around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination. Moreover, under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organization, countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read with the goals of public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration. What has been accused of reducing access to medicines in developing countries? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Patents have been accused of reducing access to medicines in developing countries. This is because patents often grant pharmaceutical companies monopolies over their products, which can lead to high prices and reduced affordability for people in developing nations. However, international policies such as the TRIPS agreement, the Doha Declaration, and mechanisms like compulsory licensing and parallel imports have been introduced to help reconcile patents with universal access to medicine. These measures aim to balance the need for incentive for innovation in the pharmaceutical industry with the public health interests of ensuring that medicines are accessible and affordable for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Deepstar Six Context: DeepStar Six is an experimental deep sea US Naval facility, crewed by a mix of military and civilians, now in the final week of their tour. The project is headed by Dr. Van Gelder, in order to test underwater colonization methods, while overseeing the installation of a new nuclear missile storage platform. Already nearing his deadline, Van Gelder's plans are threatened when geologist Burciaga (Elya Baskin) discovers a massive cavern system under the site. Van Gelder orders the use of depth charges to collapse the cavern, to the dismay of Dr. Scarpelli (Nia Peeples), who want to study the potentially primordial ecosystem inside. The ensuing detonation collapses part of the seabed, forming a massive fissure in the ocean floor. Submarine pilots Osborne and Hodges (Ronn Carroll, Thom Bray) send an unmanned probe to explore, but lose contact and venture in after it. Upon finding the probe, they detect a large sonar contact moments before being attacked and killed by an unseen force. The aggressor then attacks the observation pod, leaving Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard) and a dying Burciaga trapped inside as it teeters on the edge of the ravine. Captain Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) and submarine pilot McBride (Greg Evigan)- who is also Collins' paramour -attempt a rescue. They dock with the pod and rescue Collins, but the unstable hatch door closes on Laidlaw. Mortally wounded, he floods the compartment, forcing McBride and Collins to return and leave without him. The remaining crew now prepare to abandon the base, but the missile platform must first be secured. Without Laidlaw, facility technician Snyder (Miguel Ferrer) is forced to interpret the unfamiliar protocol. When prompted by the computer to explain the reason, Snyder reports \\"aggression\\" (due to the creature), which the computer interprets as an enemy military force and advises to detonate the missile warheads. He complies and the resulting explosion creates a shockwave that damages DeepStar Six and the cooling system for the bases' nuclear reactor. With...

Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters.  and a hint : On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.  Please answer this question : Which continent experienced wind phenomena?

Here is a hypothesis: If you go back and look, you'll see that you offered it in order to introduce your own explanation. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also likely true based on the information provided. First, let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: The premise states that you (the person addressing the speaker) were offering a characterization of the speaker's views, not as an accurate representation of their views, but rather as a way to introduce your own traditional/cultural explanation. The speaker suggests revisiting the original context to confirm this. Hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that if one goes back and examines the original context, they will find that the reason you (the person being addressed) offered the characterization of the speaker's views was to introduce your own traditional/cultural explanation. Now, let's connect the two: The premise implies that the offering of the characterization of the speaker's views was done as a way to introduce your own traditional/cultural explanation. The hypothesis mirrors this idea by stating that, upon revisiting the original context, it will be apparent that the characterization was offered for the purpose of introducing your own explanation. In this scenario, if the premise is true (meaning that the characterization of the speaker's views was indeed used as a means to introduce your own traditional/cultural explanation), then it is logical to conclude that the hypothesis is also likely true, as it essentially reiterates the assertion made in the premise. However, it is important to note that the claim made by the speaker is based on the assumption that one would have to revisit the original context to validate the premise. As such, the conclusion that the hypothesis is also true relies on the accuracy of this assumption and the speaker's interpretation of the original context. So, while it seems likely that if the premise is true, the hypothesis would be too, one cannot make a definitive conclusion without examining that original context."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: John an Keith are coworkers in a chemistry lab.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who conducted the 2010 production of L'incoronazione?  The first recording of L'incoronazione, with Walter Goehr conducting the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in a live stage performance, was issued in 1954. This LP version, which won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1954, is the only recording of the opera that predates the revival of the piece that began with the 1962 Glyndebourne Festival production. In 1963 Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Staatsoper issued a version described by Gramophone as \\"far from authentic\\", while the following year John Pritchard and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recorded an abridged version using Leppard's Glyndebourne orchestration. Leppard conducted a Sadler's Wells production, which was broadcast by the BBC and recorded on 27 November 1971. This is the only recording of the opera in English.Nikolaus Harnoncourt's 1974 version, the first recording without cuts, used period instruments in an effort to achieve a more authentic sound, although Denis Arnold has criticised Harnoncourt's \\"over-ornamentation\\" of the score, particularly his use of oboe and trumpet flourishes. Arnold showed more enthusiasm for Alan Curtis's 1980 recording, live from La Fenice in Venice. Curtis uses a small band of strings, recorders and continuo, with a trumpets reserved for the final coronation scene. Subsequent recordings have tended to follow the path of authenticity, with versions from baroque specialists including Richard Hickox and the City of London Baroque Sinfonia (1988), René Jacobs and Concerto Vocale (1990), and John Eliot Gardiner with the English Baroque Soloists. Sergio Vartolo's production of the opera at Pigna, Corsica, was recorded for Brilliant Classics in 2004. A feature of this recording is the casting of a soprano Nerone in acts I and III, and a tenor Nerone in act II, to allow for the differing vocal requirements of the role in these acts. Vartolo accepts that \\"a staged performance would almost certainly require a different approach\\".In more recent years, videotape and DVD versions have proliferated.

The Bible is a compilation of texts considered sacred in Judaism and Christianity, consisting of the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is a collection of various books written by multiple authors over the centuries. The authors are believed to be individuals from different backgrounds and periods, and their compositions were later compiled and organized into the Old and New Testament. In the Old Testament, it is primarily written in Hebrew with a few portions in Aramaic, while the New Testament was written in Greek. The Old Testament, a foundational part of the Jewish faith, consists of texts written by numerous individuals, including prophets and religious leaders like Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. It contains various genres, such as history, poetry, prophecy, and wisdom literature. It is divided into three parts: the Torah (the first five books), the Prophets, and the Writings. Different authors wrote the New Testament, primarily known as the Christian Greek Scriptures. It includes gospels (narrating the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ), letters or epistles (written by early Christian leaders such as Paul, Peter, and John to guide the churches), and the Book of Revelation (an apocalyptic text). It was written over a period of roughly 50 years, from around AD 50 to AD 100.

Lazio moved up to second place in Serie A on Saturday with a 1-0 win at Sampdoria. A first-half goal from Brazilian midfielder Anderson Hernanes was enough for all three points as a clutch of teams look to keep touch with leaders Juventus. The reigning champions, who left it late to beat Cagliari on Friday, are currently eight points clear with 44 points. Vladimir Petkovic's side replace Inter Milan in second place after Andrea Stramaccioni's side could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to struggling Genoa. Ciro Immobile gave the visitors the lead in the 77th minute before Argentina's Esteban Cambiasso headed home an equalizer with five minutes remaining. The result sees Inter slip to fourth, level on 35 points with Fiorentina, but with an inferior goal difference. Vincenzo Montella's men boosted their league goal tally with a 3-0 win away to Palermo. Three second-half goals -- two from Stevan Jovetic and one from Gonzalo Rodriguez ensured a comfortable win over 18th place Palermo. Read: Lone soccer fan wins army of admirers. Napoli remain fifth in the league after a 2-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Siena -- Christian Maggio scored with four minutes remaining before Edinson Cavani converted a spot kick in injury time. Erik Lamela scored a brace as sixth-placed Roma thumped AC Milan 4-2 at the Stadio Olimpico. Nicolas Burdisso put the home side ahead in the 13th minute before Pablo Osvaldo doubed the lead ten minutes later. Lamela made it three on the half-hour mark before finding the net again in the 60th minute to leave Milan reeling following a winning streak of four matches. Read: The lonely death of Diego Mendieta. Milan managed to claw two goals back late in the game -- substitute's Giampoalo Pazzini and Bojak Krkic finding the net in the 87th and 88th minute -- but it was only after Roma's Brazilian defender Marquinhos had been shown a red card for deliberate hand ball ten minutes earlier. The win, which sees Roma consolidate 6th place ahead of Milan, is likely to heap further pressure on Rossoneri coach Massimiliano Allegri. Parma move up to eighth after a 2-1 away to Bologna. Frederik Sorensen gave the hosts the lead in the 54th minute before Roberto Donadoni's team struck back with two quickfire goals. Jaime Valdes equalized in the 56th minute before Nicola Sansone hit the winning goal ten minutes later. Mid-table Atalanta and Udinese shared the points in a 1-1 draw -- Luis Muriel opening the scoring for the visitors in the 33rd minute only for German Denis to cancel out the lead with a spot kick seven minutes later. Torino eased their relegation worries with a 2-0 win over Chievo. The win lifts Giampiero Ventura's side up to 13th with 19 points two points behind 12th placed Chievo.

At the same time, they are unable to clearly record images when such light is shone directly into their lenses. Position your camera facing away from major light sources. Make sure that whatever you're trying to film is well-lit at the specific time of day it's most likely to be seen. A hidden camera does you no good if your target knows it's there. There are two major strategies for making sure hidden cameras stay hidden:  Make the camera itself small and difficult to see. In other words, a camera with a tiny visible lens that is put in a discreet location. This is what comes to mind when most people think of hidden cameras. The truth is this type of disguise is much easier to spot since an effective hidden camera must have an unobstructed view of whomever it's watching. If the lens can see a person, the person can see it. Disguise the camera as an everyday object. Tissue boxes, coffee makers, alarm clocks, digital picture frames, wall hooks, and even plug-in air fresheners are all examples of commercial nanny cams that blend seamlessly into the home environment. A person is much less likely to see a lens that was designed to look like a button compared to a separate camera that has simply been hidden. There are hundreds of different commercially available hidden cameras and each comes with its own particular set of installation instructions.  If you've purchased your camera secondhand, try looking up its model number online. The user manuals for many electronic devices are freely available for download. Don't forget to install any necessary software. Most hidden cameras rely on external software to function. This can be a program that was bundled with your camera or one made by a third party available for download. Some programs are even meant to be installed on you smart phone for you to keep watch while on the go. It's very important to check your camera's functioning, especially if it's motion- or sound-activated. It's a good idea to make sure that your camera switches on when given the right stimulus. How you do this will vary greatly depending on your particular camera and any companion software.  Start by waving your hand in front of the camera to see if your camera records at all. Check your computer or the camera's internal storage to see whether or not this motion was recorded. Try mimicking a real world scenario, such as walking into the room, to see if the camera records your actions with appropriate image quality. Test it again in a few hours and yet again a few days later to ensure that it continues to work. Even if setup was a breeze, you will likely need to do some maintenance from time to time to make sure your camera is still working.  If your camera runs on battery power, you will need to either swap in fresh batteries or recharge the device. Consult the owner's manual for advice on how often this should be done. If no suggestion is provided, make a note of how quickly it takes the battery to discharge. Clean out the camera's memory regularly. For cameras with limited internal storage, you should review and purge footage often. If your camera is hooked up to a server with a vast storage capacity, you may never need to do this. Like all electronics, your camera may break or wear down without you immediately knowing. Periodically double-check your camera to make sure it's still working. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Hidden cameras work best in well-lit conditions but should be positioned away from direct light sources. To keep hidden cameras concealed, make them small and discreet or disguise them as everyday objects. Proper installation and necessary software setup are essential for a hidden camera's functionality. Regular testing, battery maintenance, memory clearance, and periodic checks are required to ensure the camera's optimal performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the individual may choose to evaluate the situation on their own, consult online forums or support resources, or reach out to colleagues who might have faced similar issues with their SmartBoard. They might experiment with different troubleshooting options and attempt to find a solution by trial and error. B) They will hire an IT expert to come fix it: In this scenario, the stakeholders in charge of maintaining the educational technology will decide to seek professional assistance from an IT expert in resolving the SmartBoard issue. The IT expert will then evaluate the hardware and software components of the system to identify and repair any existing problem with the SmartBoard, and potentially optimize it for future use. C) They will ditch the SmartBoard: If the stakeholders determine that the cost of repairing or maintaining the SmartBoard outweighs its benefits, they may choose to discontinue using it. In this situation, they could explore different alternative technologies for classroom presentations and interactions, such as using projectors, tablet-based systems, or other interactive educational tools. D) They will find another way to upload their information: In this scenario, the individual experiencing the issue will attempt to find an alternative method of presenting their lesson. This could include, but not limited to, transferring the content from the flash drive to another compatible device or cloud storage, or even using a different format to share the lesson like emailing it, using Google Slides, or Microsoft PowerPoint. They may also leverage collaborative platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams to share their screen with their audience, ensuring a seamless lesson delivery despite the SmartBoard issues encountered.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Does Brandon's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's?  Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them.  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","output":"The paragraph does not provide specific information on the presence or absence of toxic compounds in Brandon's soil. However, it is mentioned that hypoxic soil, like Jeff's, forms toxic compounds as a result of anaerobic bacteria using nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. Since Brandon's soil is not hypoxic, it is inferred that his soil would have fewer toxic compounds compared to Jeff's.

When you think you’ve found the right area for your hostel, check local laws before you do anything else. Some towns and cities have designated zones for hostels, and running one outside these areas is illegal. Find out where hostels are allowed, then search for a suitable building within these areas.  Many local governments have their zoning laws on the internet. Try searching the local government website for hostel information. Contact the local zoning agency and ask about which areas are zoned for hostels. Most cities require permits and licenses to run a hostel. Check with your local zoning board or chamber of commerce and ask what regulations there are for operating a hostel. Apply for and obtain all the permits before opening your hostel.  Remember that permits often take time to process and cost a fee. Include the potential processing time and fees in your calculations on when the hostel will open. Don't try to save time or money by skipping certain permits. If you operate a hostel without all the necessary permits, you could be fined or even arrested. Operating costs are what it costs to keep a business running every day. Account for every dollar you will spend in opening this hostel so you know how much financing to secure. Calculate the rent, utilities, and any other expenses so you have a full picture of your business finances.  Remember to include taxes in your estimation of costs. Include the outlay for construction, permits, and hiring employees as well. This gives you your total cost for the project. Have at least 1 year of expenses on hand before opening the hostel to support the business before you start profiting. If you don’t have enough savings to self-finance opening and operating the hostel, then you’ll need funding from other sources. Consider going to a bank for a business loan. Another option is finding affluent people interested in providing private investment for the hostel. Whichever option you choose, have financing in place before you start building your hostel.  There are advantages and disadvantages to looking for loans from banks or individuals. Banks may be more conservative and refuse to loan you more than a fixed amount. Private investors may be more willing to offer higher sums, but they want a return on their investment. They might want to own a part of the business and share in the profits. Consider the costs carefully before choosing a financing option. Produce a good business plan, especially if you’re looking for private financing. Investors will want a return on their investment, and if you don’t prove that your business will be profitable, they won’t provide financing. Summary:","output":"1. Research and familiarize yourself with local laws and regulations related to hostels.  2. Search the local government website for information or contact the local zoning agency to find out which areas are zoned for hostels.  3. Apply for the necessary permits and licenses, including processing time and fees into your calculations.  4. Calculate all operating costs and expenses, including construction, permits, hiring, and taxes.  5. Secure financing for the project, whether through a bank loan, private investments or personal savings.  6. Weigh the advantages and disadvantages of different financing options and choose the best one.  7. Create a solid business plan to present to potential investors or lenders, showing your business's potential profitability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The song is believed to be about ignorance and its effects on people , its lyrics apparently being a sarcastic imitation of hero - worship . Musically , the song begins with a unique , dreamy , slightly flanged arpeggio that is unusual for Tom Morello . After a repeat , the main riff of the song crashes in accompanied by drums and bass . Tom 's solo once again invokes the toggle switch technique , with one handed tapping in the left hand that creates a hectic array of notes which seem to bounce off each other before entering the closing bridge of the solo , where the whammy pedal is put into full force . It appears on the soundtrack for the video game Madden NFL 07 . In addition , \`\` Revelations '' along with \`\` I Am the Highway '' were featured in the documentary Warren Miller 's Off the Grid .

The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles, California, in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of then-former Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, and then-former Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums).

Given the following context:  In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble. Question: What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The company where Dick Drew worked learned from its mistake by encouraging people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones? , can you please find it?   William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones is Etty.

Here is an article: Walking into our first premarital counseling session, my fiancé, Trevor, and I were nervous—more nervous, in fact, than we’d ever been going into a job interview. What if our counselor told us we couldn’t get married? That we weren’t compatible enough? But that’s not the point of premarital counseling: You and your intended have already made the decision to get married, and after a few years of dating, know each other well. The point is to take a look at the expectations you’re bringing into your marriage, learn how to communicate them, and figure out how to successfully merge them. Which, if you think about it, is the same goal you have when you’re working with a team at work. Everyone brings different backgrounds, experiences, and expectations to the table—and you have to figure out how to make them work together in order to get the job done. So, why not use some of those same relationship-building skills with your boss and co-workers? Here are the three biggest lessons I’ve learned from premarital counseling, and how you can apply them in the workplace. Many relationship authors have written their own personal take on the concept of “love languages.” But the basic idea is this: Each person has his or her favorite way of receiving affection—whether that’s through verbal affirmation, nice gifts, or the giving of quality time—and it’s important to recognize that the way you like to receive love isn’t necessarily the same way that will resonate most deeply with your partner. Now, think about that when you’re communicating with your boss: How you communicate—or how you prefer to be communicated with—might not be the same as for her. Do you need to check in with her before taking on a new task, or does she prefer that you take the initiative to get started? Does she want to have weekly in-person meetings to catch up on your progress—or would she rather receive a quick email update each morning? Will she respond best to hard numbers or personal success stories from your clients? You want your achievements to be visible, and you don’t want to leave your boss or co-workers wondering what you’re up to. So once you’ve figured out how to best communicate with each individual you work with, be sure to share your ideas and accomplishments in a way he or she will readily identify with. While this sounds simple, it can be one of the hardest things to remember when you’re dead set on doing something your way, and the other person—co-worker or spouse—is not about to capitulate. During a recent non-serious discussion with Trevor, I jokingly threw out, “Why can’t you see things my way? It’s completely reasonable.” Except that it’s not reasonable at all. You can’t change someone else’s thoughts, opinions, or behavior in a relationship. And at work, that’s definitely not in your job description. What you can change is how you react to it. If you’re locked in a disagreement with a co-worker, drop the argument for a bit, and agree to revisit it when you’ve both had a chance to consider the other’s perspective. Or, say you’re a manager, and you know one of your employees doesn’t deal well with change. You may not be able to change his aversion to new procedures, but you could consider how to introduce them in a way that won’t catch him by surprise. Again, obvious, right? After all, soon you’ll be saying vows about having and holding through good times and bad. But when it comes down to day-to-day quibbles (Do you overschedule every moment of your combined days? Does your partner leave a trail of clutter as he moves throughout the house?), that can be easy to lose sight of. The same challenge can occur at work if you allow small things to distract you from the overall goals of the team. That one co-worker who’s always late? She’s on your blacklist this week, even though she’s the one who keeps meetings running smoothly when the rest of the group gets off topic. Or maybe it’s the guy in the cubicle across from yours who spends way too much time on the phone with his clients (at max volume, mind you)—but who brings in a hefty chunk of your team’s sales goals. You’ve got to let the little stuff go and focus on the big picture. Because, when it comes down to it, everyone in your office is (or, at least should be) working toward the same goal. Each person may have different methods, approaches, and working styles, but that’s to be expected—and it’s probably what makes you a good team.

Possible A: catch cold, eat food, study literature, own animal, word sentence  Why is \\"own animal\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Own animal\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because the question refers to a person's preference for pets. In this context, the phrase \\"their own animal\\" means the specific pet that the person owns or takes care of. When someone likes various types of pets, it is natural and expected for them to have a special bond or attachment to their own pet, as they interact and care for that animal on a daily basis. This preference can be due to personal experiences, emotional attachment, or simply being accustomed to taking care of their own pet. Examining the other answer choices, we can see that they do not fit the context of the question: - Catch cold: Refers to becoming sick with a cold, which is unrelated to a person's preference for pets. - Eat food: Pertains to the act of consuming food, and has nothing to do with pets. - Study literature: Involves academic or intellectual pursuits in the realm of literature, not related to pet preferences. - Word sentence: Refers to the grammar and structure of sentences, which also has no connection to the context of a person's preference for pets.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  Question: suppose you are more successful during the great american smoke out happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"More. During the Great American Smokeout, if you are more successful in refraining from smoking, it will have a positive impact on the oxygen being brought to your body. Smoking negatively affects lung function and can damage the cilia (tiny hair-like structures) that help to move mucus and contaminants out of the lungs.  By not smoking during the event, your body will have a greater opportunity to heal, and the cilia can work more efficiently. As a result, there will be less obstruction in your bronchial tubes and bronchioles. This improvement allows for better airflow and more effective oxygen exchange in the alveoli. Additionally, without cigarette smoke, there would be less carbon monoxide in your bloodstream, allowing for better oxygen transportation. The second effect mentioned is the oxygen passing through the alveoli into the blood vessels. With increased oxygen delivery due to improved lung function, there will be more oxygen available to pass through the alveoli into the blood vessels. Consequently, it leads to an enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity of your blood, benefiting your body's overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Question: \\"Who helped make the religion more popular?\\"  Context: \\"It gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America. The origins of Evangelicalism are usually traced back to the English Methodist movement, Nicolaus Zinzendorf, the Moravian Church, Lutheran pietism, Presbyterianism and Puritanism. Among leaders and major figures of the Evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Billy Graham, Harold John Ockenga, John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Several individuals and religious movements helped make Evangelicalism more popular. Overall, Evangelicalism became more widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries due to the rise of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America. Key figures and groups contributing to the growth of this religious movement include: 1. John Wesley: Wesley was an English cleric, theologian, and one of the founding fathers of Methodism. His preaching and theology focused on the importance of personal faith, holiness, and the love of God. He organized many Methodist societies throughout Britain and North America, and these societies eventually grew into the Methodist Church. 2. George Whitefield: Another prominent figure in the Methodist movement, Whitefield was an Anglican minister and evangelist who preached throughout Britain and the American colonies during the 18th century. His passionate and compelling sermons helped to attract large audiences and convert many to Evangelical faith. 3. Jonathan Edwards: Edwards was an influential preacher, philosopher, and theologian during the First Great Awakening in North America. His sermons emphasized the need for personal religious experience and the sovereignty of God. His legacy remains significant in shaping the theological foundation of Evangelicalism. 4. Nicolaus Zinzendorf: Zinzendorf was a German religious leader who founded the Moravian Church, another important early influence on Evangelicalism. He emphasized the importance of devout, personal piety, and his followers became some of the earliest Protestant missionaries, spreading their faith across Europe and the Americas. 5. Lutheran Pietism: This movement within Lutheran theology emphasized the importance of personal faith, good works, and spiritual renewal. Key figures within this movement, such as Philipp Jakob Spener and August Hermann Francke, played a major role in shaping the course of Evangelicalism in Europe. 6. Presbyterianism and Puritanism: These distinct but related Protestant movements in Britain and North America gave rise to various strands of Evangelical theology. Calvinist thought from these movements helped to shape the doctrine and practice of Evangelical churches. 7. Billy Graham: An American Christian evangelist, Graham is among the most influential Evangelical leaders of the 20th century. His large-scale evangelistic crusades attracted millions, and through his extensive ministry work, he significantly contributed to the global expansion of Evangelicalism. 8. Harold John Ockenga: Ockenga was an American pastor and theologian who played a significant role in shaping modern Evangelicalism during the 20th century. He helped to define the movement's core beliefs and was instrumental in founding key institutions like Fuller Theological Seminary and the National Association of Evangelicals. 9. John Stott: As an English Anglican cleric and scholar, Stott contributed to the global Evangelical movement through his numerous theological writings and leadership within the Evangelical community. His work helped clarify Evangelical positions on social and ethical issues. 10. Martyn Lloyd-Jones: A prominent Evangelical preacher from Wales, Lloyd-Jones's lengthy ministry and numerous published works helped to shape modern Evangelical theology and practice. In conclusion, the popularity of Evangelicalism grew significantly through the concerted efforts and influence of several individuals and religious movements, ranging from the Methodist leaders John Wesley and George Whitefield to the Puritan preacher Jonathan Edwards to the 20th-century evangelist Billy Graham. Each of these figures and movements made a unique and significant contribution to the expansion and shaping of Evangelical faith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble. Question: What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas.\\" The company where Dick Drew worked, Minnesota Mining Company, learned from its mistake after Drew's invention of the new type of tape became a significant and widely-used product. Realizing the value of fostering creativity and giving employees the freedom to develop new ideas, the company implemented a policy that encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time solely on thinking and cultivating new ideas. This shift in company culture highlights the importance of nurturing creativity not only in the workplace, but also in schools and parenting, to foster innovation and help individuals reach their full potential."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(i) If the person has been released from jail, scheduling a time to talk to a bail bondsman should be your next move. Since bail arrangements differ from state to state, it is crucial to gather information from the court about your options. The bail bondsman will inform you about the required collateral, fees, and terms of the bail bond agreement, as well as assist you with the associated paperwork. Prompt communication with a bail bondsman can expedite the process and potentially help secure the release of the detained individual more quickly. (ii) The second option discusses contacting the Mexican army or detention system to help convict someone. However, this choice does not seem to be relevant to bailing someone out of jail, as it primarily focuses on conviction rather than release from detention. Therefore, it would not be an appropriate next step in this context. (iii) Looking up the expiration date of the sentence on your computer might be useful if the person is already serving a sentence. However, this option does not directly address bailing someone out of jail following their arrest. If the person is already sentenced, the focus should be on contacting the individual's attorney and discussing parole or appeal possibilities, rather than seeking immediate release through bail. (iv) In the case that the person has been jailed and not yet arraigned before a judge, you should pay attention to the date of arrest. The date of arraignment typically depends on the arrest date: if it occurred on a weekday, the detained individual could appear before a judge within the next day or two. On the other hand, if the arrest happened during the weekend, they would have to wait until the following Monday. Upon the arraignment, the judge will determine if the person is eligible for bail and specify the conditions, if applicable. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate next step would likely be either option (i) or (iv). If the detained person hasn't been arraigned before a judge yet, taking note of the arrest date and waiting for the arraignment becomes crucial. If the person has already seen a judge and is eligible for bail, then contacting a bail bondsman and understanding the bail bond terms and conditions is essential in order to secure their release from jail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Anna Edwards PUBLISHED: 23:34 EST, 19 August 2012 | UPDATED: 15:16 EST, 20 August 2012 The wife of a fallen Chinese politician who confessed to killing her lover, British businessman Neil Heywood, has today avoided execution. A Chinese court sentenced Gu Kailai, wife of ousted politician Bo Xilai, to death with a two-year reprieve for murdering a British businessman, two witnesses to the closed-door hearing said. The sentence means that Gu is likely to face life imprisonment - which would in effect mean her serving about 14 years in jail - provided she does not commit offences in the next two years. During the trial, the court heard how Mr","output":"Heywood, a 41-year-old British businessman, played a vital role in managing the financial affairs of Gu Kailai and her family. Gu's husband, Bo Xilai, was a high-ranking politician in China's Communist Party and a contender for a top leadership position. Mr. Heywood's close relationship with the family raised suspicions, and it was later established that he allegedly planned to reveal evidence of the family's vast wealth and corruption.  Prosecutors presented evidence indicating that Gu Kailai, fearing exposure and angered by Neil Heywood's alleged attempts to extort money from her family, decided to take matters into her own hands. The court heard how she invited Mr. Heywood to a hotel in the city of Chongqing, where she and her trusted aide, Zhang Xiaojun, spiritually prepared themselves to carry out the murder. Following a banquet held for Mr. Heywood on November 13, 2011, the businessman was placed in a room in the hotel, intoxicated with an unspecified poison, and left to die. Upon discovering Heywood's death, government officials initially claimed that the cause was acute alcohol poisoning, and quickly cremated his body without any further inquiry. However, rumors and inconsistencies regarding his death began to circulate, prompting international attention and media scrutiny. The Chinese government eventually decided to launch a full investigation into the matter. The case of Gu Kailai and Neil Heywood further exposed the deep-rooted corruption and power struggles in China's Communist Party. The connection between a high-ranking politician's family and a murder quickly drew additional attention to Bo Xilai, with several allegations against him surfacing, including corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement.  In September 2013, Bo Xilai was found guilty of bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power and sentenced to life imprisonment. The high-profile trial not only brought down one of China's political stars but also shook the entire Chinese political landscape. The Gu Kailai trial, in turn, represented a significant turning point for China's political landscape. The verdict demonstrated the Chinese government's efforts to establish a tough stance on corruption and to publicly impose severe punishments on those who break the law. At the same time, her sentence to death with a two-year reprieve was perceived as a compromise that aimed to maintain a fragile political balance within the ruling party. Overall, the case of Gu Kailai's murder of Neil Heywood became a symbol of a broader struggle for transparency and accountability in China's political system. The repercussions of this case continue to shape the country's policies today, as China intensifies its crackdown on corruption and works to restore public faith in the government."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: If I tell you that A coating slows the transfer of electricity, and ask you the question \\"a coating does what to the transfer of electricity \\", is the correct answer \\"amplifies\\"? The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"amplifies\\". When you say that a coating slows the transfer of electricity, it means that the coating inhibits, reduces, or retards the transfer or flow of electricity. Amplifies, on the other hand, means to increase or make stronger. In the context of electricity, amplification would mean increasing the strength of electrical signals or enhancing the transfer of electricity. This is the opposite of what a coating, described as slowing the transfer of electricity, is doing.  Usually, a coating on a wire, like rubber or plastic, serves as an insulator. Insulators are materials that resist or slow down the flow of electricity, preventing unwanted flows of current, protecting the user from electric shocks, and helping maintain the intended path for the electricity.  The concept works on the principle of conductivity. Conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct electric current. Some materials like copper or other metals have high conductivity, meaning they allow electricity to pass through them easily. Conversely, non-metallic solids usually have high resistivity, meaning they do not conduct electricity well. The coating, which is an insulator, has high resistivity; thus, it does not amplify, but instead, it inhibits, reduces, retards, or slows down the transfer of electricity. It's also worth pointing out that these coatings or insulators help control electricity transfer in more sophisticated ways: they prevent 'leakage' of electricity which could cause inefficiency in the system, protect the wires from physical damage that might impair their function, and prevent electrical fires by stopping current transference where it's not desired.  So in summary, a coating does not amplify the transfer of electricity; rather, it regulates, slows down or inhibits the transfer of electricity, ensuring safety, efficiency, and functionality in our electrical systems."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question.

People, towns, high schools, and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back alumni and former residents. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet and, most often, a game of American football, or, on occasion, basketball, ice hockey or soccer. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring the school's marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming Queen (and at many schools, a Homecoming King). A dance commonly follows the game or the day following the game. When attached to a football game, Homecoming traditionally occurs on the team's return from the longest road trip of the season.

Home to most of the university's original buildings, this portion of the campus remains the geographic and historic center of the modern campus. Originally designed by noted English-born architect William Nichols, construction of the university campus began in 1828, following the move of the Alabama state capital from Cahaba to Tuscaloosa in 1826. The overall design for this early version of the campus was patterned after Thomas Jefferson's plan for the University of Virginia, with its Lawn and Rotunda. Following the destruction of the campus during the American Civil War, a new Quad emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Different in form and function from the original design of the early 19th century, the modern Quad continues to fill its role as the heart of the campus. Although completely surrounded by academic and administrative buildings, only five structures are built directly on the Quad: the Little Round House, Tuomey Hall, Oliver-Barnard Hall, Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library, and Denny Chimes. The remainder of the space is occupied by a grove of trees on the west side and a great lawn on the east. A feature on the northwestern side, known as The Mound, is the site of the old Franklin Hall.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

A: The answer is:","output":"Mammalian eggs exhibit a type of cleavage called \\"holoblastic cleavage.\\" Holoblastic cleavage is a process in which the entire volume of the egg undergoes cell division, resulting in smaller, individual cells called blastomeres. This type of cleavage is observed in mammals, as well as in other organisms with a relatively small amount of yolk in their eggs.  In contrast, meroblastic cleavage occurs when only a portion of the egg divides due to the presence of a large amount of yolk. Meroblastic cleavage is found in eggs with a large yolk content, such as those of birds and reptiles. During holoblastic cleavage in mammalian eggs, the first cell division is slow, taking about 12-24 hours, and occurs without growth or the addition of new cytoplasm. Following the initial division, the rate of cell division increases, and the zygote transforms into a multicellular structure known as a blastocyst. The blastocyst eventually implants into the uterine wall, where it continues to develop into a fetus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.
