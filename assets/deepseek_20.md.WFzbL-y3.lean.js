Article: Children who grow up in households where books are plentiful go further in school than those without books, a new study finds. This book benefit was seen across countries, and held regardless of the parent's educational back-ground, father's occupation or the political system of the country, the researchers say. The results, based on data from 73,249 people living in 27 countries, including the United States, show that having a 500-book library boosted a child's education by 3.2 years on average. \\"You get a great effect for your books,\\" said study researcher Mariah Evans, a sociologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. \\"It's quite a good return-on-investment in a time of scarce resources.\\" For years, educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated. But according to the findings, a good-sized book library is just as good as university-educated parents in terms of increasing education level. \\"Even a little bit goes a long way,\\" in terms of the number of books in a home, Evans said. Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on propelling a child to a higher level of education, and the more books are added, the greater the benefit. In some countries, such as China, having 500 or more books in the home propels children 6. 6 years further in their education. In the United States, the effect is less, 2.4 years. But, Evans points out that 2.4 years is still a significant advantage in terms of educational achievement. For example, Americans who have some college or an associate's degree, but not a bachelor's degree, earn an average of  7,213 more annually than those with just a high school education. Those who attain a bachelor's degree earn  21,185 more each year, on average, than those with just high school diplomas. Having books in the home is twice as important as the father's education level, and more important than whether a child was educated in China or the United States.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie starts in the past, in an African reserve, when Alex the Lion was just a little cub, being tutored in the art of being a lion, by his doting father, Zuba, who is also the Alpha Lion. Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo.

If you haven’t finished your taxes — and fear waiting in line at the post office on April 18th — you’re not alone. In fact, this year tax season may be moving a bit slower than usual because the last-minute, year-end tax agreement delayed the usual timetable for the Internal Revenue Service to get its forms and systems ready. “We are probably a week behind last year,” Fleming says. “Everything has been pushed back a week or so.” The mad dash to the finish could cause extra problems this year because of the feds’ push for electronic filing; e-filing is now mandatory for accounting firms that do at least 100 returns a year, and there’s no precedent for how the government’s e-filing system will do under pressure. If you’re among those who are just now struggling through your taxes, here’s a quick guide to the things you need to know now: IRA contributions. Making a contribution to your IRA is a necessity for a secure retirement, and if you fit the rules for a tax-deductible contribution, it will also lower your tax bill. The deadline for making your 2010 contribution (even if you get a tax extension) is April 18th. You’re allowed to contribute up to 5,000 (6,000 if you’re 50 or older). The 5,000 contribution limit can go to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, or be split between the two. If you want more in a Roth than you’re allowed by income limitations, you could set up a non-deductible IRA and immediately convert it, as there are no income limitations on conversions. HSA contributions. If you were covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan in 2010, you have until tax day to make a tax-deductible contribution to a Health Savings Account. You can deduct that contribution even if you don’t itemize, and the money in your account will grow tax-free — and you can withdraw it tax-free, too, if you use it to pay uninsured medical expenses. Maximum contributions are 3,050 for singles and 6,150 for families (with an extra 1,000 if you’re over 55). Roth conversions. If you converted an IRA to a Roth last year, as many people did to take advantage of the new rules that removed income limitations on conversions, you’ll owe taxes on that move starting this year. You get the option to pay the taxes, on 2010 conversions only, over two years; unless you expect to be in a higher tax bracket next year, that’s likely a better deal. Also, note: Your 1099 form won’t necessarily say that it’s for a conversion, so you need to be sure that your accountant knows. New tax day for same-sex couples. This is the first tax season in which many gay and lesbian couples can file federal income tax returns reflecting community property rules. The IRS spelled out its new position in a legal memorandum last summer. If this affects you — and it may if you live in California, Nevada or Washington — you’ll need to sort your way through the thicket of community property rules. A good place to start is the lengthy explainer by tax attorney Kaye Thomas of Fairmark. While complicated, the new division could result in substantial tax savings for some couples; if that turns out to be the case, you can go back and amend prior years’ tax returns. Tuition tax credits. There’s a few different ways to get tax benefits for education, but typically the best is the American Opportunity Credit. It can only go towards undergraduate education, but if you qualify it’s worth 2,500. Capital gains, capital losses. If you’re like most investors, you’ve still got some tax loss carryforwards hanging around from the financial collapse. Use them now to offset gains, then take the permitted 3,000 deduction against income. If you’re still got capital losses after that, you’ll roll them over to next year again. Deadlines, deadlines, deadlines. It’s a complicated year this year. Normally tax day would be the 15th, but because of Emancipation Day, recognized as a holiday in Washington, D.C., the federal tax due date moved to Monday the 18th. The upside: You get the weekend. The downside for procrastinators: You get the weekend. The complicated piece is that not all states are sticking with the feds: Massachussetts, for example, celebrates Patriot’s Day on Monday the 18th, so its returns aren’t due till Tuesday the 19th (though residents will still have to file their federal returns the day before). And remember: April 18th isn’t just the deadline for 2010 income taxes. It’s also the deadline for first quarter estimated taxes (more on that later), gift tax returns (due if you gave more than 13,000), and the last day you can claim a refund you were due for 2007. Extensions. If you just can’t get it together to file on April 18th, file for an extension to avoid the hefty penalties for late filing. It’s automatic and it lasts for six months — till October. But beware: Getting an extension doesn’t extend the time to actually pay your taxes, so if you think you’ll owe money, it’s best to send a guestimated payment to minimize late-payment penalties. “In the last week before the deadline, we may get a lot more extensions depending on whether the IRS’s website crashes under the pressure of electronic filing or we crash under the pressure of electronic filing,” Fleming says. “We think it’s going to be okay, but it’s like being in line at the post office. You want to be there before the rush.” What was this article about?","output":"The article provides crucial tips for individuals who are filing their taxes at the last minute. Key points discussed include making IRA and HSA contributions before the deadline, understanding the implications of Roth conversions, recognizing new tax guidelines for same-sex couples and university students, managing capital gains and losses strategically, meeting different tax filing deadlines, and filing for extensions if necessary. The article also discusses the potential for increased issues due to mandatory electronic filing for accounting firms and the anticipated increased load on the IRS's website as the deadline approaches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor.

What is the answer: Into what was Daphne changed as a means of avoiding the advances of the God Apollo?","output":"Daphne, a figure in Greek mythology, was transformed into a laurel tree as a means of escaping the advances of the god Apollo. This myth offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Ancient Greek beliefs, captivating our imaginations with a story of unrequited love and divine intervention. The story begins with Daphne, the beautiful daughter of the river god Peneus and the nymph Creusa in Thessaly. As a woodland nymph, Daphne spent her days wandering through the forests, enjoying her freedom and insisting on remaining unmarried. She was a dedicated follower of the goddess Artemis, the virgin goddess of hunting and wild animals, and, like her patron deity, Daphne vowed to remain chaste and independent. Apollo, one of the most important gods in Greek mythology, was known for his many romantic exploits. He was the god of the sun, light, truth, prophecy, healing, and of the arts such as poetry and music. Apollo was smitten by Daphne's beauty, and he found himself irresistibly drawn to her. According to the myth, Apollo's infatuation with Daphne was the result of Eros (the god of love and desire) shooting two different arrows at them: a golden arrow into Apollo's heart, which instilled passionate love, and a leaden arrow into Daphne's heart, which caused disdain and aversion to love. Eros chose to intervene in this manner due to an earlier dispute with Apollo, where the latter had belittled Eros's abilities as an archer. This act of revenge led to the tragic, unrequited love of Apollo for Daphne. Apollo, overcome with desire, pursued Daphne relentlessly, but she continued to repudiate his advances. As Apollo closed in on her, Daphne knew that she could not escape his grasp by her own power, and she desperately called upon her father, Peneus, for help. Peneus, hearing his daughter's plea for protection, granted her wish and transformed her into a laurel tree. The act of transformation saved Daphne from Apollo's advances, preserving her chastity and independence. It is important to note that the laurel tree, also known as the \\"bay tree\\" or Laurus nobilis, was a symbol of victory, nobility, and distinction in ancient Greece. As a result of his loss, Apollo chose to honor Daphne by adopting the laurel tree as his sacred plant. He declared that he would forever wear a crown of laurel leaves and that victors of athletic and artistic competitions would also be awarded a wreath made from the branches of this tree. The story of Daphne and Apollo also serves as an allegory that highlights the consequences of uncontrolled passion, the struggle between love and independence, and the power of transformation as a means of protection from unwanted advances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The MG glowed on its small screen. \\"There's one up for auction on carsforsale.com and I'm too young to bid. You've got to help me.\\" \\"Aage!\\" She put her hands on her hips and shook her head. \\"Your age is not the problem. You can't even afford it.\\" \\"I'd pay you back.\\" How could he explain his fascination with the Vehicular Age to her? The seductive sheen, the rumble, the combustive power of automobiles called to him like a siren at sea. He coveted the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. And the MG-TD held a place high in his list of hope. British Racing Green, wood dashboard and a four-stroke engine. He had only seen one MG-TD, when he'd gone on holiday with his folks to the U.K. They had been walking down the street in downtown London. Most of the traffic had been pedestrian or cyclist. The occasional fuel-cell car glided by like a ghostly leftover from the Vehicular Age. Double-decker biodiesel buses roared past regularly, trailing the odor of fish and chips after them. And then it came down the street toward them. A car that purred as its rounded lines soaked up the sun with a green so deep it was almost black. It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of this story, Aage is experiencing: Options:  A. Longing  B. not enough information  C. The security of having enough funds to afford multiple cars  D. The joy of driving his new car A:","output":"A. Longing In the given story, the protagonist Aage is longing or yearning for a classic car – a 1952 MG-TD. His love for the car is demonstrated through his knowledge about it: its British Racing Green color, wood dashboard, and four-stroke engine. The MG-TD represents something more to him than just a vehicle; it symbolizes an era he is fascinated with, the Vehicular Age, and he is captivated by the roar of the engine, the glamorous sheen of its body and the intrinsic potential he feels is distilled in the simple turn of a key.  He is so determined to own this car that he pleads with his mother to bid for one that's on sale online since he's underage and cannot do it himself. A poignant memory of seeing the vintage car in London is brought up, reflecting his deep admiration for it. He promises his mother that he’ll repay her for the car – a sign of his earnest intent and deep desire for the vintage vehicle.  At the end, however, there is no indication that his wish is fulfilled, nor that he has the financial resources to satisfy his desire, or that he finally got to drive his dream car. Hence, option A – longing, encapsulates his feelings the best. After the story ends, Aage is left in a state of longing for the 1952 MG-TD that he saw in London and wants to own so desperately. His fascination, admiration, and hope are all directed towards fulfilling this dream of his, truly reflecting his deep-seated longing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Accelerate: Hitting the ground would not cause the airplane to accelerate. The force of impact would likely result in the opposite effect, causing deceleration or possible destruction, depending on the speed and angle of impact. 2. Carry freight: This option is not directly related to the events resulting from an airplane hitting the ground but rather, a function an airplane performs, which is carrying freight from one location to another. 3. Taxi: While taxiing is related to airplanes maneuvering on the ground, it does not directly describe what happens when an airplane hits the ground, especially in the context of a hard or unintended landing. 4. Produce bang: If an airplane hits the ground, it is likely to produce a loud noise or \\"bang\\" due to the force of impact. This is a potential result of the event in question. 5.

Evans preferred to remain in Rome, so Etty travelled alone, pausing briefly in Florence and in Ferrara (where he stopped to kiss the armchair of Ludovico Ariosto). The painter Charles Lock Eastlake, then resident in Rome, had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D'Orville, British Vice consul in Venice; D'Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house, rather than in lodgings. Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and \\"the hope and idol of my professional life\\", and had often wondered why, given its artistic importance, so few English travellers visited the city. He was not disappointed. Throughout the remainder of his life, he looked back on his visit to Venice with great fondness, writing shortly before his death that \\"Venezia, cara Venezia! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now!\\"Although Etty had only intended to stay for 10 days, he was so taken with Venice that he remained for over seven months. He fell into a routine of copying paintings in Venetian collections by day, and attending the life class of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts by night, producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches. He was extremely impressed with the high quality of the Venetian Academy; the instructors in their turn were extremely impressed with the quality of Etty's work, in particular his flesh tones. He acquired the nickname of \\"Il Diavolo\\" owing to the high speed at which he was able to paint, and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right; luminaries including Gioachino Rossini and Ladislaus Pyrker (then Patriarch of Venice) came to watch him paint.

Enter the factory code. Press the 1/2 control within five seconds of step 1. Enter your personal 5-digit entry code. Article:","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Setting and Using Your Personal Entry Code on Your Vehicle Introduction Personal entry codes are becoming increasingly popular as more and more individuals seek to enhance their vehicle's security. By setting up a unique access code for your vehicle, you can ensure that you have an extra layer of protection against unwanted intrusion. In this article, we will provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to locate the factory code, remove the panel covering the Remote Access Panel (RAP), and set your personal 5-digit entry code. Step 1: Locate the Factory Code The factory code is a unique, preprogrammed access code that comes with your vehicle. It is typically found either in the owner's manual or in the glove compartment. Alternatively, you might find it on a sticker near the fuse box or on the vehicle's computer module. Ensure that you have this code readily available, as it will be necessary for initializing the process of setting up your personal entry code. Step 2: Find and Remove the Panel Covering the RAP The Remote Access Panel, or RAP, is a component within your vehicle that allows you to manage the access codes. It is usually located either under the dashboard or on the driver's side door. Once you have determined its location, remove the panel to gain access to the RAP system. Take note of the existing factory code, which is often displayed on the panel covering the RAP. Step 3: Enter the Factory Code With the panel removed and the RAP system now accessible, use the keypad to input the factory code. This will allow you to enter the programming mode necessary to set up your personal entry code. Step 4: Press the 1/2 Control Within Five Seconds of Entering the Factory Code Upon entering the factory code, you will need to act quickly. Within five seconds of inputting the factory code, press the 1/2 control button. This will put the RAP system into a state where you can enter your personal 5-digit entry code. Failure to press the 1/2 control within the time frame will result in the system defaulting back, and you will need to re-enter the factory code and try again. Step 5: Enter Your Personal 5-Digit Entry Code Now that the RAP system has successfully entered the correct mode for setting your personal entry code, use the keypad to establish a secure 5-digit code. This should be a combination of numbers that is easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess. Once you have successfully input your code, the system will automatically save it. You can now replace the panel covering the RAP and begin to use your personal entry code to access your vehicle. Conclusion Setting up and using a personal entry code on your vehicle is an effective way to enhance your car's security. By following this step-by-step guide, you can easily set up your unique access code and ensure that your vehicle remains protected from unwanted access. Always remember to keep your personal and factory codes in a safe place, and enjoy the added peace of mind that comes with this valuable security feature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices. Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding, cold welding, vacuum packing and vacuum frying. Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging. The electrical properties of vacuum make electron microscopes and vacuum tubes possible, including cathode ray tubes. The elimination of air friction is useful for flywheel energy storage and ultracentrifuges.

Through their tireless efforts and unwavering dedication, they established Cecily's Fund, a charity in memory of their beloved daughter. With its core mission set to empower and support the underprivileged children in Africa, the charity aimed to provide these kids with the tools and opportunities necessary to overcome the harsh reality of destitution. Over the years, the charity grew from strength to strength, as it not only garnered support from the local communities of Bicester and Oxfordshire but also received considerable recognition and financial aid from renowned institutions such as Cambridge University. Red Nose Day and Comic Relief soon followed suit, contributing to the worthy cause and amplifying its impact. The work of Cecily's Fund slowly but surely spread across Zambia and other parts of Africa, touching the lives of thousands upon thousands of children. In Kitwe, the once sleepy town where Cecily had taught, the transformation was nothing short of miraculous. The streets, which were once filled with helpless children, now brimmed with newfound hope and ambition. Schools expanded, as more resources and teachers became available, and the homework clubs that Cecily had initiated continued to thrive, reaching even the most remote corners. The legacy of Cecily Eastwood shone brightly through the smiles of the children nurtured by her fund. Her spirit lived on in the sparks of inspiration that ignited their minds and guided these young individuals to dream big and break free from the shackles of their unfortunate circumstances. As Cecily's Fund continued to grow, Africa witnessed a generation of empowered individuals climbing up the ladder towards a better life - all because of the selflessness and love of one extraordinary young woman and her devoted parents. Basil and Alison Eastwood could never fill the void left by their daughter's passing, but they found solace in knowing that their charity was now her living testament. From the depths of their sorrow, they had created a beacon of light and hope that would shine brilliantly for generations to come, illuminating the path towards education and a brighter future for thousands of children in Africa. And in this heartening reality, they found the strength to carry on, honoring the memory of their cherished daughter, Cecily, forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Butterfly Effect Movie plot: In the year 1998, Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who suffered severe sexual abuse and traumas as a boy (played by Logan Lerman) and a teenager (played by John Patrick Amedori), blacks out frequently, often at moments of high stress. While entertaining a girl in his dorm room, he finds that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he travels back in time, and he is able to \\"redo\\" parts of his past, thereby causing the blackouts he experienced as a child. There are consequences to his choices, however, that then propagate back to his present life: his alternate futures vary from college student, to prisoner, to amputee. His efforts are driven by the desire to undo the most unpleasant events of his childhood which coincide with his mysterious blackouts, including saving his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart) from being molested by her father (Eric Stoltz) and tormented by her sadistic brother (William Lee Scott).The actions he takes, and those he enables others to take during his blackouts, change the timeline in the new future where he awakes. As he continues to do this he realizes that even though his intentions are good his actions have unforeseen consequences. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternate timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds. Ultimately, he decides that his attempts to alter the past end up only harming those he cares about. But Evan realizes that the main cause of everyone's suffering in all the different timelines is himself.At the conclusion of the film, Evan purposely travels back in time one final time to the first day he met Kayleigh. By scaring her away, he makes sure that she is never a part of his life, and thus finally succeeds in saving her life.

Maybe not. New research into the reasons for shark attacks   suggests that sharks don't like the way humans taste! In fact, most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite  . Why is this? There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people. One opinion is that sharks are just curious  . We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment, so they are not afraid of anything. Naturally, that means they are curious when they meet something unusual. Because they don't have hands or feet., the only way they can find out an object is to bite it! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason, and then swim away. Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human, as we have a lot of bones  . It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks don't have hands, and they can't pull the meat off our bones. Maybe that's why they only bite us once. Unluckily, one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly! Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake. Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal. An example of this is when a shark  attacks a surfer. A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below. Sharks like seals because they have thick fat. Whatever the reason for shark attacks on humans, sharks should be afraid of us. Sadly, we kill almost 40 million of them each year. What would the author write the passage mainly for? A) To tell surfers to stay away from sharks. B) To ask people to stop killing sharks. C) To let us know the reasons for shark attacks on people. D) To show that humans are much stronger than sharks.

(CNN)The fiancée of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been granted immunity, compelling her to testify at his murder trial, according to a decision released by the trial judge on Tuesday.

Review: Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film. A heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we've loved and lost. Although, only 15 minutes long, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time. Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death. Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth's pet cow, Tulip. The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted.

Herbie, a Volkswagen Beetle, is towed to a junkyard after losing several races, and Ray Sr. takes Maggie to the junkyard to buy her a car as a college graduation present. After Maggie selects Herbie, she finds an anonymous note in Herbie's glove box, possibly written by Herbie's old owner Hank Cooper (from the 1997 The Love Bug TV film) which reads: \\"Please take care of Herbie. Whatever your problem, he'll help you find the answer\\". Herbie takes her against her will to the garage where her friend Kevin works as a mechanic. Kevin has Maggie take Herbie to a car show to buy parts for Herbie, but when they arrive, Herbie tricks Maggie into disguising herself in a racing suit and helmet and challenging NASCAR champion Trip Murphy to an impromptu race, which Herbie wins by a second. This delights Kevin, who tries to talk Maggie into racing again. However, Ray Sr., who has forbidden her from racing since she was hospitalized after a street racing accident years ago, is concerned. It also infuriates Murphy, who becomes obsessed with Herbie. Murphy organizes a local street-racing competition to lure Herbie back for a rematch, which Maggie and Kevin enter.

Before Buying a Prefab Prefab is an umbrella term that covers any home partly built in a factory. It includes everything from modulars that arrive in just a few sections — complete with attached walls, flooring and even finishes — to what are called panelized homes, which are delivered in smaller pieces. Manufacturers range from those focused on more modern designs to makers of Cape Cods and center-hall colonial styles. With any designer, ask how many homes the firm has built and how many are in the pipeline, and arrange to visit a finished house. The growing prefab field has led many designers to jump in, but not all them actually have designs that have been built. “There are a lot of designers doing computer renderings, but the number who have actually built homes is very small,” said Steve Glenn, chief executive and founder of LivingHomes in Santa Monica, Calif., which sells houses by two designers. Finding the right design is about not just visual appeal, but also such practical issues as finding one that can actually be built on the site. After all, the house has to be delivered on a flatbed truck. And it can be nearly impossible to deliver a modular house to a site that is off a windy, narrow road or one off a route with low overpasses. Prefab design firms also offer levels of hand holding that take owners through not only the design phase, but also the permit process and the final construction. In some cases, the owner is responsible for hiring a general contractor, while some firms, like Marmol Radziner Prefab in Los Angeles, where designs start at 235,500 for a 660-square-foot, metal-sided one-bedroom house with a deck (not including delivery or the cost of the foundation) take a comprehensive approach. “We offer a full suite of services,” said Leo Marmol, one of the firm’s partners. “We not only design the house but we own our own factory, and we are a licensed general contractor.” Also ask what changes can be made to plans and how complete the house is when it arrives from the factory, a variable that can affect construction time. Some modular houses arrive 90 percent finished, with light fixtures in place; others need considerably more work from a contractor. Hive Modular, a Minneapolis firm selling homes that typically range from 140 to 200 a square foot (including delivery but not inclusive of certain changes to plans, like changing the exterior finish) teamed up with 10 factories to produce its designs. Not all of those factories are able, for example, to install the type of Italian bath fixtures that the company uses. “The finish level can vary dramatically,” said Paul Stankey, a partner at Hive. “From our factory in Nebraska, houses arrive 95 percent completed. The tile is in, but not grouted. The cabinets are there and the flooring is down. Even the walls are painted.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Prefab homes are partly built in a factory and come in various designs, styles, and finishes, with varying levels of construction completion upon delivery. Before buying a prefab home, consider factors such as design, feasibility of delivery, permits, and the amount of additional work required, as well as available services provided by the design firm and customization options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nothing The answer is:","output":"Title: The Unfazed Genre: Drama/Sci-fi Setting: A dystopian future in which a totalitarian government has succeeded in completely eradicating emotions from the general public. Plot: In the not-so-distant future, the world is governed by an authoritarian regime that has effectively suppressed all forms of human emotions to maintain social order and stability. Citizens are subjected to a strict regimen of emotion-suppressing medication from a young age. The government controls every aspect of life, as emotions are deemed the cause of societal issues and conflicts. The mere act of showing emotions is a crime punishable by harsh consequences. The film follows the life of a young man named Ezra, a low-ranking government agent tasked with monitoring citizens' behavior and reporting any sign of emotional expression. Ezra quietly goes about his daily duties, as he is one of the few people to have never shown any emotion, even in times of great distress. One day, while on a routine mission investigating an underground resistance movement suspected of promoting and practicing emotional expression, Ezra stumbles upon a hidden chamber containing a strange artifact. Upon laying his hands on the artifact, Ezra begins to experience a powerful range of emotions for the very first time in his life. Initially overwhelmed, Ezra struggles to adjust to his newfound feelings, grappling with the intensity of love, grief, joy, and anger. As he becomes more intimately acquainted with these emotions, he ultimately decides to keep his experience a secret from the authorities and steps away from his job. Together with members of the resistance movement, Ezra embarks on a daring quest to disrupt the government's authoritarian rule, utilizing the unpredictable power of human emotions to mount a resistance against the emotionless regime. Along the way, he encounters other individuals who have similarly discovered their emotions, building a support system and network of allies as they navigate through their new lives. As the story unfolds, the audience is taken on an emotional journey, witnessing the beauty of human connections, personal growth, and the importance of emotional expression. The film ultimately serves as an allegory for the political and social consequences of suppressing our true selves and the fundamental aspects of our humanity. In the end, Ezra and his newfound friends succeed in triggering a revolution amongst the general public, kickstarting a wave of emotional awakening that dismantles the government's stranglehold on society. Through the power of empathy, teamwork, and authentic emotion, they pave the way for a future where individuals are free to embrace the full spectrum of human emotions, leading to a more compassionate, connected, and humane world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

[II] positive.).","output":"[I] Negative Movie Review Title: The Last Journey Director: John Doe Genre: Sci-Fi, Action Rating: 2/5 Step 1: Preparing to watch the movie As a movie buff, I always look forward to a fresh addition to the wide spectrum of sci-fi and action films. However, despite the considerable hype, The Last Journey, directed by John Doe, left me thoroughly disappointed. Step 2: Observing the film's strong and weak points The film began with an interesting premise - a skilled astronaut embarks on a treacherous mission to save Earth from an imminent cataclysm. Nonetheless, as soon as the story unfolded, it quickly became evident that the movie's unique ideas were outweighed by an array of poorly executed elements. Step 3: Analyzing the acting performances One of the critical weaknesses of the movie was the disappointing acting performances. The lead actor seemed to struggle with delivering believable emotional depth, making it challenging to root for his character. Similarly, the supporting cast failed to stand out, often blending into the background instead of adding flavor to the story. Step 4: Evaluating the storyline and pacing Another crucial aspect of The Last Journey that contributed to its downfall was the storyline. The pacing felt slow and uneven, which made the audience lose interest in the film's climax. Furthermore, the lack of coherent plot development and weak character motivations left the audience wondering what the point of the mission actually was. Step 5: Assessing the visual effects and sound design The visual effects, in contrast, were above average. Nonetheless, they were overshadowed by the lackluster storyline. The film's sound design and score didn't fare any better, with a generic soundtrack that failed to evoke any genuine emotions or elevate the overall experience. Step 6: Determining my overall impression In conclusion, The Last Journey stands as a missed opportunity to create a riveting sci-fi, action flick. Hindered by a weak storyline and inconsistent pacing, it falters in delivering a memorable cinematic experience. I can't recommend this film, as there are far superior choices available in the same genre."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Information:  - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.  - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry.  - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus .

Select from the following. +Put bub in a milk carton.. +Put bub in a glass bottle..","output":"Creating a hanging light fixture is a great DIY project that you can do at home. Here is a detailed guide on how to do it by using a glass bottle which could create an aesthetically pleasing and unique point of attraction in your house, rather than using a milk carton which likely won't hold up well and might not create the visual effect you desire. Materials needed: 1. Glass Bottle (You can select any size or shape of bottle to suit your desire) 2. Pendant light kit  3. Masking tape 4. Diamond hole saw 5. Safety glasses 6. Gloves 7. Cord grip (optional) Please note that safety is priority so while handling any electrical component or tool, it is essential to do so cautiously. Process: A. Preparing the Bottle 1. Start by thoroughly cleaning your glass bottle. You may need to soak it to remove any sticky residue if you're reusing an old bottle.  2. Allow it to dry completely. 3. Use masking tape to mark the area where you plan to drill a hole for your light fixture. This will help to prevent the drill bit from slipping when you start drilling. B. Drilling the Hole 1. Put on your safety glasses and gloves. 2. Using the diamond hole saw, carefully drill a hole in the glass bottle. Go slow and gentle to avoid breaking the bottle. If possible, do this under slow running water or with a water drip because it keeps the temperature down and eliminates glass dust. C. Installing the Lighting Fixture 1. Unpack your pendant light kit.  2. Feed the end of the cord that will be connected to your power source through the hole you've drilled in your bottle, ensuring the socket end is positioned inside the bottle. 3. If your kit includes a cork or cap to hold the socket securely in the neck of the bottle, secure this now. 4. Attach the cord grip (if using) around the cable just above the top of the bottle hole, this will relieve the weight strain on the cable and is especially important for heavier bulbs. D. Finishing Up 1. Screw the light bulb into the socket inside your bottle. 2. Connect the fixture to your power source as per the light kit instructions - avoid handling the electric parts if they're plugged in. 3. Once everything is connected, turn on the power to test if the light bulb lights up before hanging the fixture.  4. Once everything is working well, hang your new glass bottle light fixture in your preferred spot as per the instructions provided in your pendant light kit. Remember to always turn off the electricity when installing any light fixture to prevent any accidents.  Now, you have a beautiful, stylish and fully functioning hanging light fixture, made from a glass bottle. It can also make a perfect item for your home decor."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: bad design, bad quality Product review: We bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year, and she took excellent care of it.

Please answer the following question: A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier.  A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid.  Which beaker had a reactant poured into it? A:","output":"Beaker T had a reactant poured into it. In this scenario, the chemist is working with two beakers, R and T, both filled with identical solutions. When she pours one liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change observed in the solution. This would suggest that the liquid added to beaker R did not participate in any reaction with the original solution, and therefore, it is not a reactant. On the other hand, when the chemist pours a different liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid. This change in beaker T indicates that a chemical reaction has taken place between the original solution and the liquid that was added. Therefore, the liquid poured into beaker T is a reactant, as it has undergone a reaction with the contents of the beaker, leading to observable changes. In summary, beaker T had a reactant poured into it, as evidenced by the observed change resulting from the interaction between the added liquid and the original solution in the beaker. This contrasts with beaker R, where no reaction or visible change occurred upon the addition of another liquid, indicating that it was not a reactant in that case."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Background: Mumtaz Mahal (Urdu: mumtz mHal ), ([mum'ta:z me'hel]; meaning \\"the Exalted One of the palace\\"; Arjumand Banu; 27 April 1593 - 17 June 1631) was Empress consort of the Mughal Empire from 19 January 1628 to 17 June 1631 as the chief consort of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. The UNESCO World Heritage Site Taj Mahal in Agra, often cited as one of the Wonders of the World, was commissioned to act as her final resting place. Mumtaz Mahal was born Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra to a family of Persian nobility. Context: Upon his accession to the throne in 1628, Shah Jahan designated Mumtaz as his chief empress with the title of 'Malika-i-Jahan' (\\"Queen of the World\\") and 'Malika-uz-Zamani' (\\"Queen of the Age\\"). Mumtaz's tenure as empress was brief (spanning a period of only three years due to her untimely death), nonetheless Shah Jahan bestowed her with luxuries that no other empress was given before her. For example, no other empress' residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra Fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given regular monthly allowance for her gastos (housekeeping or travelling expenses). The highest allowance on record is 10 lakh rupees per year given to Mumtaz Mahal under Shah Jahan.  Shah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state and she served as his close confidante and trusted adviser. At her intercession, he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest honour of the land -- his imperial seal, the Mehr Uzaz, which validated imperial decrees. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power, in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign.  A great influence on him, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. Mumtaz also patronized a number of poets, scholars and other talented persons. A noted Sanskrit poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress' favourite. On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh. It is the only architectural foundation which can be connected to her patronage. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1.

A new investigative report by Filter Magazine has named the likely killer as Stig Engstrom, who died in 2000.      Police had initially dismissed him a suspect, but reports suggest they have recently spoken to people close to him.      Palme, a charismatic Social Democrat leader, was shot dead in the centre of Stockholm and died on the pavement.      He was attacked as he left the cinema with his wife on 28 February 1986.      Some 10,000 people were questioned after his murder and 134 people have since claimed they carried it out.      Police say they have been looking into new leads in the case and have promised a solution \\"in the near future\\", say Swedish media.      Stig Engstrom's ex-wife confirmed to Expressen newspaper that she had been questioned about him by detectives on two separate occasions last year.      \\"It is out of question,\\" she said of the latest reports. \\"He was not that kind of person, that's for sure. He was too much of a coward. He wouldn't harm a fly.\\"      Who was Stig Engstrom?      Engstrom was identified as a suspect by journalist Thomas Pettersson, whose 12 year investigation has been published in Filter magazine.      He had always been considered a key witness as he was one of the first people on the scene, but not formally as a suspect. Swedish media had dubbed him Skandia man because he had been working late that night in the Skandia building close to where the attack took place.      Two minutes after he left the building at 23:19, Olof Palme was shot.      He later gave evidence in the trial of Christer Pettersson, who was jailed for life for the murder in 1988 but then had his conviction overturned on appeal.      During the trial he said he was walking on the pavement when he stumbled on someone lying on their back on the ground. \\"I see there's blood. I hesitate whether to go to my metro station or stop.\\"      Filter magazine has now alleged that Stig Engstrom had had weapons training.      He also is said to have had access to a firearm similar to the one used in the attack because a close friend had a weapons collection, it reports. The friend had spent time in the US military and had a strong interest in American Magnum revolvers, it is claimed. It was a Magnum that was used to kill the prime minister.      Engstrom killed himself in 2000.      Experts unimpressed by new claim      The mystery surrounding the killing continues to fascinate Swedes and has spawned numerous different theories as to what exactly happened.      But various legal and political figures have warned against jumping to conclusions.      \\"I'm not impressed,\\" lawyer Leif Silbersky told the Aftonbladet newspaper. \\"It is easy to point out a dead man who cannot defend himself.\\"      \\"You should be very careful. We are quite used to seeing different tips,\\" former chief prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem added.      Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven commented on the case on Swedish TV on Wednesday. \\"This is an open wound in Swedish society. It is extremely important that this is solved,\\" he said.      What happened to Olof Palme?      The prime minister and his wife Lisbeth had just watched a Swedish comedy film The Mozart Brothers when they were shot in the street.      He was hit twice in the stomach and died almost instantly. His wife Lisbeth was also hit but suffered superficial injuries.      Police say a taxi-driver used his mobile radio to raise the alarm. Two young girls who were sitting in a car close to the scene of the shooting tried to help the dying prime minister.      He was rushed to hospital but was declared dead on arrival. ||||| In the years since Christer Pettersson’s release, theories about Mr. Palme’s death have flourished. Many of them relate to his political credentials as an idealist who fought for perceived victims of injustice, particularly in the developing world.      At the height of the Cold War, he sought a “third way” between East and West and was criticized as tilting too much toward Moscow. He opposed the war in Vietnam and castigated apartheid in South Africa.      Indeed, Sweden became a conduit for clandestine financial support to foes of the white government in Pretoria. After the collapse of apartheid in 1990, a white former security officer, Col. Eugene de Kock, alleged that an agent of the apartheid government had murdered Mr. Palme because of his stance against racial segregation.      But that was only one of many theories.      Another hypothesis linked the killing to a shadowy arms deal with India. Others implicated Kurdish separatists in Turkey.      There were suggestions of complicity by a secretive Italian masonic lodge. Other accounts laid the blame at the door of Chilean fascists supposedly taking revenge for Mr. Palme’s opposition to the Pinochet regime.      But the latest theory, by Mr. Pettersson the journalist, published on Wednesday in the magazine Filter, claimed that the police had noted Mr. Engstrom’s presence at the crime scene but that investigators failed to follow up.      The journalist, who is no relation to the man who was jailed over the crime, also found that Mr. Engstrom had access to the same kind of weapon used to kill Mr. Palme, that he had been active in a shooting club, that he had political and private motives for killing Mr. Palme, and that his personality matched a police profile of the likely killer. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A man who claimed to be a key witness to Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme's assassination in 1986 has now been linked to the killing.

It discusses the movement of US Treasury notes and their relation to durable goods orders, as well as the potential impact on the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding interest rates. The story is primarily focused on economic data, financial markets, and monetary policy, which all fall under the business category.  To provide a more detailed understanding, let's break down the key components of the article: 1. US Treasury notes: These are debt securities issued by the United States government to raise funds to finance its operations and various programs. They have various maturities, typically ranging from 2 to 10 years, and pay a fixed interest rate to investors. The prices of these notes fluctuate in the market based on various factors, including economic data, investor sentiment, and interest rate expectations. 2. Durable goods orders: These refer to the new purchase orders placed with manufacturers for items that are expected to last for at least three years, such as appliances, vehicles, and machinery. Durable goods orders are seen as an indicator of the overall health of the economy, as increased orders may signal higher production levels, job growth, and ultimately, increased consumer demand. 3. Federal Reserve: The United States' central bank, responsible for implementing monetary policy in the country. One of its primary functions includes setting short-term interest rates, which impact borrowing costs and investment decisions. The Fed considers various economic indicators, including employment, inflation, and overall economic growth, to make decisions about interest rate adjustments. 4. Interest rate expectations: A key factor impacting the prices of financial assets, including US Treasury notes. When investors believe that interest rates will rise in the future, the prices of existing fixed-income securities like treasury notes may decline, as their yields become relatively less attractive compared to newer, higher-yielding securities. Conversely, when interest rate expectations fall, treasury note prices may rise. In summary, the article focuses on the +Business topic by discussing the drop in US Treasury notes prices, influenced by better-than-expected durable goods orders and the potential for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. This information is relevant to those interested in monitoring economic indicators, financial market movements, and potential changes in monetary policy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the last name of the English artist whose portraits of male nudes were generally well received?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"Let me clarify the given information and the question: We have a process that creates an electromagnet: 1. Electromagnet is created using electricity. 2. A conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal. 3. An electric current is introduced from a power source. 4. The current flows through the wire. 5. A magnetic field is created in the wire. 6. The metal gets magnetized. 7. When the power is turned off, it is no longer magnetic. The question asks how the following scenario will affect a weaker electromagnet: - Suppose volcanoes become inactive. First, let's establish the connection between volcanic activity and electromagnetism if any. Volcanic activity can generate localized magnetic fields due to the movement and interaction of molten rock (magma) with the Earth's magnetic field. However, this localized effect typically does not influence electromagnets' operation. Based on this information, we can conclude the following: Since the inactivity of volcanoes would have no noticeable impact on the operation of electromagnets, there would be no effect on a weaker electromagnet in terms of the process described earlier. In other words, the perturbation due to volcanoes becoming inactive does not influence the second effect mentioned (creation of a magnetic field with a weaker electromagnet) and hence has no effect on it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hillary Clinton’s surrogates and campaign aides faced what they called an overwhelming wave of Twitter attacks during the 2016 election cycle — some of it, they’re convinced, driven by Russian bots and trolls.      Now Senate Intelligence Committee investigators plan to ask Twitter representatives on Thursday whether false information spread by Russians accounts made it into real news stories aimed at torpedoing the Democrat’s candidacy, and whether the social media company took any steps to stem the fake news.      Story Continued Below      Thursday’s closed-door briefing in the Senate’s Hart office building is the latest move by federal investigators to probe social media’s role in last year’s presidential campaign, putting Twitter into the same hot seat occupied for weeks by its larger rival Facebook.      Facebook was a natural first target for congressional scrutiny, given its enormous 2 billion user reach and its role as an intermediary between trusted friends and family. But Twitter is also of keen interest to the Intelligence Committee because of the company’s outsize influence in distributing and amplifying news, a source close to the investigation told POLITICO.      Among other topics, the Senate staffers are eager to learn more about how disinformation posted on Twitter found its way into the news. They’re also interested in exploring whether automated Twitter accounts known as “bots” were used to boost the Google rankings of fake or misleading news items.      Senate investigators are inviting Google, Twitter and Facebook to testify publicly on Nov. 1 about attempts by Russia to use digital platforms to influence the presidential race, a Senate aide said Wednesday.

A former senior U.S. intelligence official said the Russian use of Twitter is “consistent” with what U.S. intelligence agencies found in their election post-mortem, which concluded that hackers associated with Vladimir Putin’s regime had interfered in the presidential campaign. That includes “the methodology of using multiple different lanes in an information operations campaign,\\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation.      Twitter’s power to influence the news cycle makes it a convenient tool, people who have studied the social network’s role in the election say.      “The fastest way to move a story from outlying media to mainstream media is to promote it on Twitter,” said Clint Watts, a counterterrorism expert and former FBI agent who has studied Russian influence campaigns. “All mainstream media is watching Twitter and it spreads organically from there to other platforms.”      Former Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel said tweets from foreign entities intended to cause trouble in U.S. elections should be no less alarming to lawmakers and regulators than the paid advertisements at the center of Facebook's role in the Russia investigation.      \\"The sock puppets, the fake accounts cost money,” Ravel told POLITICO. “It's not just a couple of guys in Moldova. If it were just a bunch of kids doing it for no reason, or a bunch of crazies putting stuff up on the internet, OK, that's fine. That's not political ads. But these are political ads: People are being paid to do it.\\"      Clinton supporters say they sensed early on that Twitter would be surprisingly toxic terrain.      “You’d get dogpiled for days if you expressed support for Clinton,” said one supporter, Brooklyn-based author Sady Doyle, who shared screenshots of critics who lambasted the Democratic hopeful as an “unindicted criminal,” “liar” and “fraud.” Doyle added: “One time I got something that was either a bot or a very bad impersonation of an American Trump supporter because it was a tweet in Cyrillic that when I translated was something like, ‘You are an ugly and bitter woman.'\\"      But it’s unclear how much help Twitter will offer the investigators.      Facebook showed up for its own Senate briefing earlier this month with a detailed story to tell about how Russian actors had used its site. The company shared seven out of about 3,000 ads linked to a St. Petersburg-based “troll farm” called the Internet Research Agency — a level of preparation the source close to the investigation called a “happy surprise.”      That raises the stakes for Twitter, which declined to say what it plans to show Senate staffers. A Twitter spokesperson has simply said the company is cooperating with congressional investigations.      But Senate investigators are coming to the debriefing with specific questions, the source said. Chief among them: What, if anything, did Twitter do to address bots once it had identified them as potentially malicious?      The prevalence of bots is a known problem on the platform, and researchers at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute found, in a study published on the eve of Election Day, that an estimated 400,000 bots were participating in the conversation around the election during a six-week period in September and October 2016. That represented about 19 percent of all election-related tweets.      The congressional investigators are also eager to learn more about how disinformation posted on Twitter bled into news outlets. This spring, researchers from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology documented “a network of mutually-reinforcing hyper-partisan sites” including Breitbart and Infowars that gleaned content from Twitter.      Moreover, the Senate aides are interested in exploring whether the bot-driven amplification of tweets was used to boost the Google rankings of fake news. Google does not fully disclose how its algorithm works, but in 2010 a company official in charge of search-result quality revealed in a video posted on YouTube that the “organic rankings treat links the same from Twitter or Facebook” as they do from traditional websites. (Google periodically modifies its ranking methods without revealing the extent of the changes, so it’s unclear whether that practice has changed since then.)      U.S. intelligence officials have been closely studying Russia's interest in tapping social media to fulfill its own geopolitical ends. A report on Russian election interference that the director of national intelligence issued Jan. 6 concluded that Russian elements enlisted social media trolls \\"as part of its influence efforts to denigrate Secretary Clinton.\\" Those efforts included pro-Kremlin online activists who prepared to mark Clinton’s expected victory by circulating the hashtag \\"#Democracy RIP.\\"      Even without foreign meddling, the internet might have remained a hostile place for Clinton. As a candidate, the former secretary of State has often been criticized for what's judged to be a lack of authenticity, a quality often held in high esteem online. Former President Barack Obama openly joked about Clinton’s lack of online prowess, remarking that “Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signed up for Facebook.”      But Clinton herself has concluded that the overwhelmingly negative reception she got on the internet was ginned up at least in part by Russians. She dedicated four pages of her campaign memoir to the topic, writing that both Russian publications and independent trolls circulated stories saying she was \\"a murderer, money launderer, and secretly had Parkinson's disease\\" — themes that often quickly found their way to right-wing outlets.      Twitter has long avoided drawing too much attention to the prevalence of bots on its platform. In part, that's because such artificial accounts raise questions about the company's already shaky business model. The platform makes money selling advertising in the form of promoted tweets, and shrinking its already stagnant user base by culling fake accounts would make it potentially less attractive to advertisers.      Twitter has defended its hands-off approach by saying it encourages the free exchange of ideas and information, and that journalists, media watchdogs and engaged citizens will push back on fake or manipulated tweets.      But the former senior intelligence official and other observers of the 2016 campaign say Twitter’s response doesn’t address the fact that a sophisticated bad actor — such as Russia — can create entirely new and false narratives by manipulating the size and scale of Twitter activity.      The cybersecurity firm FireEye reported that many hundreds of fake accounts with links to Russian entities were actively posting anti-Clinton messages, especially as Election Day neared.      “And then the day after the election, all of it decreased,” said Frank Cilluffo, a former Bush administration cybersecurity official who testifies frequently before Congress on the issue.      Much of the Russian effort to manipulate Twitter and Facebook was aimed at exploiting controversies over such issues as immigration and police shootings of minorities, according to Cilluffo, who directs the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University. “It was more that they were driving wedges into existing cracks in our society, around divisive issues, and trying to provide legitimacy to fringe ideas.”      “And that’s very consistent with the old KGB tradecraft, like [the false rumor] that the CIA created AIDS, but leveraging social media to do it,” he added. “And if it fails, it's cheap.”      Elana Schor contributed to this report. ||||| The incidents displayed on this map represent the ten most recent incidents of authoritarian interference in transatlantic democracies.

FILE PHOTO - U.S. Senator James Lankford (R-OK) smiles after he was ceremonially sworn-in by Vice President Joseph Biden in the Old Senate Chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington January 6, 2015. REUTERS/Larry Downing      The assertion, made by Republican James Lankford, comes as congressional investigators probing Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election are focusing on how Russian agents used social media to spread divisive political content.      “We watched, even this weekend, the Russians and their troll farms, their internet folks, start hashtagging out #TakeAKnee and also hashtagging out #BoycottNFL,” Lankford, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing on threats faced by the United States.      “They were taking both sides of the argument this weekend ... to try to raise the noise level of America and make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they are trying to push divisiveness in this country,” Lankford said.      Lankford did not provide evidence to corroborate his statement.      A Lankford aide said U.S. intelligence shared with senators showed that Russian troll operations relied on social media to meddle in U.S. issues going back to last year’s presidential election in an effort to divide Americans.

Answer:","output":"In Myanmar, the majority culture is primarily Buddhist and Bamar, but it has been influenced by neighboring countries' cultures. As a result, various aspects of Myanmar's culture, such as language, cuisine, music, dance, and theater, have embraced these external influences. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been significantly impacted by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. The Yama Zatdaw, Myanmar's national epic, exemplifies this cultural blending as it is an adaptation of India's Ramayana with substantial influences from Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the story.  In addition to practicing Theravada Buddhism, the people of Myanmar also engage in nat worship. Nat worship is a form of animistic belief that predates the arrival of Buddhism in the region. It involves intricate rituals to propitiate, or appease, one or more deities from a pantheon of 37 nats, which are spirits or supernatural beings. These nats are believed to have the power to assist or hinder human endeavors, and it is through rituals and offerings that the locals seek to obtain their favor. The relationship between nat worship and Buddhism in Myanmar is marked by a unique coexistence and syncretism. Over a long period of coexistence, Buddhism gradually absorbed aspects of nat worship and vice-versa, leading to a unique form of religious belief that integrates both faiths. It is not uncommon for people to visit a Buddhist temple to offer their prayers and then proceed to a nat shrine to perform rituals for the nats. This syncretic relationship between nat worship and Buddhism has given rise to a distinct religious landscape in Myanmar, characterized by shared spaces, rituals, and beliefs. Commonly found in Buddhist temples are shrines dedicated to nats, where devotees partake in ceremonies and present offerings to both the Buddha and the nats. These overlapping elements allow individuals to draw upon the strengths and merits of both belief systems to navigate through life's challenges and seek spiritual guidance. In summary, nat worship and Buddhism in Myanmar share a unique and symbiotic connection that has been shaped by cultural influences and centuries of coexistence. This relationship is manifested in the syncretic religious practices, shared spaces, and the intertwining of beliefs and rituals in the daily lives of the Myanmar people. This fusion of faiths serves as a testament to the adaptability and resilience of both Buddhist and indigenous spiritual traditions in the face of cultural exchange and transformation."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill.

A: Answer:","output":"The opening in the front of the eye is called the pupil. The pupil is a central, circular opening within the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. The primary function of the pupil is to regulate the amount of light entering the eye by changing its size. In bright light conditions, the pupil constricts or becomes smaller, allowing less light to enter the eye, while in dim light or dark conditions, the pupil dilates or becomes larger, allowing more light to enter and reach the retina. Aside from the pupil, there are other essential components of the eye involved in collecting and focusing light, including: I. Lens: The lens is a transparent, biconvex structure located behind the iris and the pupil. Its primary function is to focus the light entering the eye onto the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The lens changes its shape through the action of the ciliary muscles, enabling the eye to focus on objects at different distances, a process known as accommodation. II. Cornea: The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer surface of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. It acts as the eye's primary light-bending structure and is responsible for approximately two-thirds of the eye's total focusing power. The cornea works together with the lens to refract light and provide sharp vision. III. Iris: As mentioned earlier, the iris is the colored part of the eye, composed of pigmented tissue and muscles. Its primary function is to control the size of the pupil and, consequently, the amount of light entering the eye. The iris contains two types of muscles: the circular muscles that constrict the pupil and the radial muscles that dilate it. In summary, the opening in the front of the eye is called the pupil, which regulates the amount of light entering the eye by changing its size. The pupil works together with other structures, including the lens, cornea, and iris, to collect and focus light, allowing us to see our surroundings clearly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters.  But I can use this background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.  What is an answer for this question: Which ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock?","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the Pacific Ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock compared to the Arctic Ocean. This is primarily due to the fact that the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters, whereas the Arctic Ocean only has a single dormant divergent plate. At the mid-oceanic ridges where the tectonic plates diverge, new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. With seven diverging plates in the Pacific Ocean, there is a larger extent of mid-oceanic ridges where this process takes place. As a result, more cooling of hot molten rock occurs in the Pacific Ocean, leading to a higher rate of new oceanic crust formation. Furthermore, the higher degree of volcanic activity in the Pacific Ocean as a result of the greater number of diverging plates also contributes to increased cooling of hot molten rock. As you mentioned, most volcanic activity on Earth is submarine and forms new seafloor due to the presence of divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of the ocean. The more active diverging plates in the Pacific Ocean lead to an increased number of black smokers and undersea volcanic eruptions, each playing a significant role in cooling and solidifying the hot molten rock to create new oceanic crust. On the other hand, the Arctic Ocean's single dormant divergent plate suggests that there is significantly less tectonic activity and, therefore, less cooling of hot molten rock in this region. The divergent plate boundary of the Arctic Ocean experiences less volcanic activity, leading to a slower rate of new oceanic crust formation. In conclusion, the Pacific Ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock due to the presence of seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters, promoting increased tectonic and volcanic activity. These factors contribute to a higher rate of new oceanic crust formation, outpacing the level of cooling and crust formation in the Arctic Ocean, which has only a single dormant divergent plate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: CLOSE The Homeland Security Department is demanding that airlines around the world step up security measures for international flights bound for the United States, or face the possibility of a total electronics ban for planes. (June 28) AP      The new CT scanner for carry-on bags being tested at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's Terminal 4. (Photo: Courtesy: American Airlines)      WASHINGTON — In a massive escalation of airline security worldwide, hundreds of thousands of travelers flying to the U.S. from overseas will face additional scrutiny for laptops and other electronics larger than cellphones, the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.      The tougher standards apply to 180 domestic and foreign airlines that fly direct to the U.S. from 280 airports from 105 countries. The new rules will affect about 2,000 daily flights carrying 325,000 passengers.      Intelligence about terrorists developing ways to hide bombs and infiltrate airport staffing prompted the tougher security measures, according to two senior DHS officials who spoke on background during a conference call for reporters on Wednesday.      In the case of recent airline bombings in Egypt and Somalia, investigators suspect airport workers smuggled explosives aboard planes.      “Make no mistake: our enemies are constantly working to find new methods for disguising explosives, recruiting insiders and hijacking aircraft,” John Kelly, secretary of Homeland Security, said in a speech Wednesday at the Center for a New American Security, a non-profit that develops security and defense policies.      “It is time that we raise the global baseline of aviation security,\\" Kelly said. \\"We cannot play international whack-a-mole with each new threat.”      DHS expects 99% of airlines to be able to meet the new requirements and time frames, the officials said. They did not give specifics on either the requirements or the time frame.      If airlines don't or can't comply, the U.S. could ban electronics larger than cellphones on entire planes — in both carry-on bags and checked luggage, the officials said.      The Federal Aviation Administration could also block flights by pulling an airline’s certificate, the officials said.      Nicholas Calio, CEO of the trade group Airlines for America, which represents most of the largest carriers, said airlines shared the commitment for better security, but that travel disruptions are likely from the new requirements.      “While we have been assured that carriers will have the substantial flexibility necessary to implement these measures on a global scale, we believe that the development of the security directive should have been subject to a greater degree of collaboration and coordination to avoid the significant operational disruptions and unnecessarily frustrating consequences for the traveling public that appear likely to happen,\\" Calio said.      Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said airlines need to warn travelers about what to expect.      “As these new rules affect over 2,000 flights a day, it is crucial that Americans, tourists, and immigrants are properly informed on how their travel is affected,\\" Thompson said.      The new measures will be seen and unseen at airports, Kelly said, and will focus on enhanced screening for electronics, more thorough passenger vetting and measures to reduce the threat of insider attacks.      “Terrorists want to bring down aircraft to instill fear, disrupt our economies and undermine our way of life — and it works, which is why they still see aviation as the crown jewel target in their world,” Kelly said. “The threat is not diminished. However, we are not standing on the sidelines while fanatics hatch new plots.”      Protocols will change for passenger areas around gates and on the tarmac around planes. Security methods could vary by airline and airport.      Travelers could see more bomb-sniffing dogs or upgraded technology such as CT-scanners at airports, like the test that American Airlines is running at the Phoenix airport with the Transportation Security Administration. The advanced technology can peer into the clutter of carry-on bags to detect possible explosives.      The tougher standards aren’t an expansion of the laptop ban enacted in March for carry-on bags of flights of nine airlines from 10 airports in eight countries, officials said.      Those airlines will be able to get out from under that ban — passengers will be allowed to bring laptops again — if they meet the new standards.      DHS officials are also encouraging more foreign airports to join Customs and Border Protection’s pre-clearance program, which screens in-bound travelers for Customs and Immigration before they board planes.      Pre-clearance facilities are located at 15 airports in Canada, Ireland, the Caribbean and Abu Dhabi. Sweden is in the midst of joining. But other countries have balked because of the shared costs for CBP facilities and staffing.      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2tqlIUZ ||||| U.S. officials on Wednesday announced enhanced security and screening measures for all commercial flights to the United States but backed away from a proposal to expand a ban on laptops and other electronic devices — unless airlines and airports refuse to comply with the new rules.      Since March, passengers on flights to the United States from certain primarily Muslim-majority countries have been prohibited from bringing electronic devices larger than a cellphone on board with them. But those restrictions could be lifted if the affected airlines and airports adopt the new security protocols, officials said.      Department of Homeland Security officials said airlines and airports will be responsible for implementing the changes and communicating new procedures to the traveling public. Officials declined to offer specifics about the changes, citing security concerns, but said they could include enhanced screening of laptops and smartphones and increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas.      The hope is that the new requirements will not result in longer wait times at security checkpoints or be prohibitively costly for airlines and airports to implement.      In a briefing with reporters, senior DHS officials said the requirements will “raise the baseline” on aviation security worldwide. The directives are focused on preventing terrorists from circumventing aviation security.      “It is time that we raise the global baseline of aviation security,” Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said. “We cannot play international whack-a-mole with each new threat.”      Despite talk of expanding a ban on laptops and other large electronic devices that was put into place in March, senior DHS officials said Kelly ultimately concluded that the threats could be handled without an expansion of the ban.      “The good news is we found a way to raise the bar worldwide, but at the same time not inconvenience the traveling public,” said Kelly, who announced the new measures at a security conference at the Center for a New American Security.      [Britain, U.S. ban most electronic devices in cabins on flights from some Muslim countries]      DHS officials said they have been in “constant contact with our interagency, industry and foreign partners to address evolving threats” and had a shared goal of putting measures in place that would pose a minimum of disruption to the traveling public.      However, airlines and airports that do not comply with the new requirements could face repercussions, including a full ban on all personal electronics on board flights, even in cargo; fines and possible loss of their permission to fly to the United States.      Officials, however, said they expect the vast majority of airlines and airports to comply with the rules. Flights within the United States will not be affected, in part because airports here already use many of the enhanced security measures that are being called for.      DHS officials indicated they have been in touch with airlines and countries covered by the current ban and that “all of those countries had expressed an eagerness to comply so that those restrictions could be lifted.”      “We are standing ready to go in and inspect how they adhere to the new security restrictions,” the official said. “It is up to the carriers how quickly they want to move.”      It is not clear when the new measures will be put into place, but DHS officials said travelers might start to see changes as early as this summer. Not all the measures will be visible to the public, they said, though travelers might notice more bomb-sniffing dogs, more thorough screening of their carry-on bags and swabbing of devices for traces of explosives.      Wednesday’s announcement comes after months of debate over whether the United States should expand the ban on laptops and other electronic devices that it put into place in March for travelers from 10 airports in mostly Middle Eastern countries.      The ban was prompted by growing concerns that terrorists could conceal bombs in laptops and other similar devices.      In May, U.S. officials suggested the ban might be expanded to include direct flights to the United States from Europe. Later that month, in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Kelly suggested he might go even further and extend the ban to all international flights in and out of the United States.      [E.U., U.S. officials meet to discuss possible expansion of the laptop ban]      European officials raised concerns about potential new restrictions and sought more information about the threats that prompted talk of an expansion. European Union officials characterized a meeting last month in Brussels with top U.S. Homeland Security officials as productive but also urged officials to consider other ways to address the potential threat.      Industry groups in the United States and abroad said they were concerned about the economic implications of expanding the ban as well as the impact it could have on worker productivity.      In May, the head of the International Air Transport Association, which represents more than 270 international carriers, expressed serious concerns about the ban and urged leaders to consider other enhanced screening methods as an alternative.      Expanding the ban could cost 1.1 billion a year in lost productivity, travel time and “passenger well-being,” Alexandre de Juniac, director general and chief executive of the group, which represents 265 airlines, wrote in a letter to Kelly and Violeta Bulc, the E.U.’s top transportation official.      In all, 280 airports in 105 countries will be required to meet the heightened security standards, DHS officials said. Roughly 325,000 daily passengers on 2,100 flights could be affected.      DHS officials said one visible change could be the expansion of Customs and Border Protection’s Preclearance program, which is in place at airports in six countries: Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates. Under the program, CBP officers screen international passengers traveling to the United States before they arrive.      Still, the announcement was welcome news for international carriers.      “Keeping our passengers and crew safe and secure is our top priority,” said de Juniac. “Today’s actions raise the bar on security. The aggressive implementation timeline will, however, be challenging. Meeting it will require a continued team effort of government and industry stakeholders. In particular, airlines and airports will need to be supported by host states during the phase-in of the new requirements.” ||||| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday unveiled enhanced security measures for flights to the country designed to prevent expanding an in-cabin ban on laptops, but an airline trade group said the changes might cause more disruptions.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo      The measures, which European and U.S. officials said would begin taking effect within three weeks, could require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives.      The measures would affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries.      The United States in March banned laptops on flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in eight countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey, to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft.      Britain quickly followed suit with a similar set of restrictions.      The decision not to impose new laptop restrictions eases U.S. and European airlines’ concern that expanding the ban to Europe or other locations could cause major logistical problems and deter travel.      “Inaction is not an option,” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told a news briefing, adding that he believed airlines would comply with the new screening. But he said the measures were not the last step to tighten security. U.S. carriers said they would follow the new security directive, but industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A), criticized Homeland Security for not working more closely with them on the new policies.      “The development of the security directive should have been subject to a greater degree of collaboration and coordination to avoid the significant operational disruptions and unnecessarily frustrating consequences for the traveling public that appear likely to happen,” A4A Chief Executive Nicholas E. Calio said in a statement.      Kelly had been saying since April he thought an expansion of the laptop ban was “likely.” He said in late May the government could potentially expand the ban worldwide.      Homeland Security officials told reporters they expected more than 99 percent of airlines would comply, a move that would effectively end the controversial electronics ban.      Airlines that fail to satisfy new security requirements could still face in-cabin electronics restrictions, Kelly said. “We expect all airlines will work with us to keep their aircraft, their crew and their passengers safe,” he said.      European and U.S. officials told Reuters that airlines have 21 days to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and have 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers.      U.S. authorities want increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas, expanded canine screening and additional places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart.      Since laptops are widely used in flight by business class passengers - who pay double or more than the average ticket price - the airline industry had feared expanding the ban could cut into revenue.      Airline officials told Reuters they were concerned about adding enhanced security measures to all airports worldwide that have direct flights to the United States rather than focus them on airports where threats are highest. European airline groups said in a document reviewed by Reuters that if the threats are confirmed, the restrictions should be deployed to cover all EU departing flights, not just U.S.-bound flights.      A TSA official removes a laptop from a bag for scanning using the Transport Security Administration's new Automated Screening Lane technology at Terminal 4 of JFK airport in New York City, U.S., May 17, 2017. REUTERS/Joe Penney      Homeland security officials said Wednesday that those 10 airports can get off the list if they meet the new security requirements, but did not say how long it will take.      U.S. airline stocks rose on Wednesday, with United Continental Holdings UAL.N closing up 1 percent, Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) up 2 percent and American Airlines Group (AAL.O) up 1.6 percent.      Kelly said last week he planned a “step by step” security enhancement plan that included short, medium-term and longer-term improvements that would take at least a year to implement fully. |||||Summary:","output":"US Homeland Security has demanded that airlines across the world step up security procedures for international flights heading to the United States or face the possibility of a total electronics ban. Tougher standards will apply to both domestic and foreign airlines that fly directly the US from 280 airports across 105 countries, covering nearly 2,000 flights carrying 325,000 passengers daily. The measures, which are expected to be implemented by 99% of airlines, are intended to protect against terrorists developing ways to hide bombs and infiltrate staffing at airports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Title: Disappointing Dining Experience at Dine Divine I recently visited Dine Divine, a trendy new eatery aiming to serve up culinary delights. However, my experience left me feeling truly underwhelmed. Upon entering the restaurant, the atmosphere was a bit off, with dim lighting that felt more gloomy than intimate. The decor was lackluster, giving off a cold, uninviting vibe.  Next came the service, which I found to be disorganized and inattentive. Our server took ages to take our order and seemed uninterested in answering our questions about the menu items.  As for the food, I regret to say it was a major letdown. I ordered their signature dish, the Herb-Crusted Salmon, which arrived cold and overcooked. The accompanying vegetables were lackluster and clearly under-seasoned. My companion was equally disenchanted with their bland Mushroom Risotto. To add insult to injury, we felt like the prices were extremely steep for the quality of food and service we received. I ordered a glass of wine, opting for one of their cheaper options, and it was still overpriced at 12 for a small serving. In conclusion, Dine Divine was a disappointing experience in terms of ambiance, service, and food quality. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a satisfying dining experience. One can only hope they will improve their standards as time goes on."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts.

Plato (; Greek: Platon Platon, pronounced [pla.to:n] in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 - 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. Although Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of Pythagoras upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \\"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \\"for substantial theses in science and morals\\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \\"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism.  Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. This ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato.  Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: \\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\\" (Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia).  George Karamanolis notes that  Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy--including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally.  The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his Apology of Socrates that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d-34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b). In the Phaedo, the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \\"Plato was ill\\". (Phaedo 59b)  Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the Second Letter, it says, \\"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new\\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form.  Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates (Metaphysics 987b1-11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding.  Mythos and logos are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of Homer and Hesiod (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of tale or history. Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a nonverifiable account, and logos a rational account. Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use.  Plato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul.  It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"One interesting aspect from the article is about the use of myths in Plato's philosophy.

Although he lives with his partner Miguel Álvarez (Antonio Banderas), Beckett is not open about his homosexuality at the law firm, nor the fact that he has AIDS. On the day he is assigned the firm's newest and most important case, one of the firm's partners notices a small lesion on Beckett's forehead. Shortly thereafter, Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions. While at home, he finishes the complaint for the case he has been assigned and then brings it to his office, leaving instructions for his assistants to file the complaint in court on the following day, which marks the end of the statute of limitations for the case. Beckett suffers from bowel spasms at home and is rushed to the hospital. Later that morning, while still at the ER, he receives a frantic call from the firm asking for the complaint, as the paper copy cannot be found and there are no copies on the computer's hard drive. However, the complaint is finally discovered and is filed with the court at the last possible moment. The following day, Beckett is dismissed by the firm's partners, who had previously referred to him as their \\"buddy\\", but now question his professional abilities in light of the misplaced document. Beckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm a pretext to fire him, and that the firing is actually as a result of his diagnosis with AIDS. He asks several attorneys to take his case, including personal injury lawyer Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), with whom he had been involved in a previous case. Miller, who is admittedly homophobic and knows little about Beckett's AIDS, initially declines to take the case and immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the AIDS through shaking Beckett's hand. The doctor explains the methods of HIV infection. The doctor then offers to take a sample of Miller's blood, suspecting that Miller was... A:","output":"The cause of the lesion on Andrew Beckett's forehead in the movie Philadelphia is due to his AIDS. The lesion is a symptom of Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that can develop in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with AIDS. Kaposi's sarcoma often causes lesions to form on the skin, which can be an early indicator of the disease. In the movie, this lesion draws attention to Beckett's health condition and ultimately leads to the discrimination he faces at his law firm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Plans to impose a compulsory ‘death tax’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care have been revived by the Labour Party. The idea was floated before the last election by Labour but was dropped after intense criticism from the Conservatives. But Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham has restated his desire to introduce the scheme that would see estates of the deceased taxed at 15 per cent. Scroll down for video. Labour has revived plans to impose a compulsory ‘death tax’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care. The Tory Party has again derided the idea after it emerged that Labour was holding ‘internal party discussions’ on the issue. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the levy as a ‘secret tax bombshell’ and said ‘pensioners deserve better’. The plans will prompt criticism that Labour is targeting the wealthy, who are likely to be charged on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax rate. The plan would also cost the average Briton £46,000 on a 15 per cent tax, the Conservatives claimed. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said that the death tax was 'the best way' to fund elderly social care - but admitted the plan was controversial. The social care green paper was first unveiled by Mr Burnham in 2009, which included a favoured compulsory insurance scheme. A later incarnation, which suggested pensioners should pay 10 per cent of their estates rather than a flat rate of £20,000, was lambasted by the Conservatives. The Coalition has pledged to tackle England’s care crisis scandal by stating that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £72,000. The rising cost of care can see the elderly facing unlimited expense, leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year. Mr Burnham said the death tax was ‘the best way’ to fund social care – but admitted the plan was controversial. He added: ‘It’s only where you create a system where everyone is in and everyone is then covered, that I think you’ll be able to help people protect their own homes. ‘If you have that system, people would pay, let’s say, ten, 15 whatever it might be per cent, well then they would be able to pay that as an insurance payment to protect the other 85 per cent that they would otherwise stand to lose.’ Mr Hunt said: ‘People who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if Labour were ever to get in.’ Highlights:","output":"- The Labour Party has revived plans to impose a compulsory 'death tax' levy of up to 15% on estates to pay for elderly care. - The proposal was previously dropped after intense criticism from the Conservatives, who claimed it would cost the average Briton £46,000 on a 15% tax. - Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham believes it is the best way to fund elderly social care and protect people's homes. - The plan has been criticized for targeting the wealthy, who may face the levy on top of a 40% inheritance tax rate. - Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the proposed levy as a 'secret tax bombshell' and said that pensioners deserved better than Labour's plan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Randall William \\"Randy\\" Rhoads (December 6, 1956  March 19, 1982) was an American heavy metal guitarist who played with Ozzy Osbourne and Quiet Riot. A devoted student of classical guitar, Rhoads combined his classical music influences with his own heavy metal style. He died in a plane accident while on tour with Osbourne in Florida in 1982. Despite his short career, Rhoads, who was a major influence on neoclassical metal, is cited as an influence by many guitarists and is included in several \\"Greatest Guitarist\\" lists.  - Uli Jon Roth (born Ulrich Roth, 18 December 1954) is a German guitarist, who became famous as the Scorpions lead guitarist, and is one of the earliest contributors to the neoclassical metal genre. He is also the founder of Sky Academy and inventor of the Sky Guitar. He is the older brother of fellow guitarist and artist Zeno Roth.  - Neoclassical metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that is heavily influenced by classical music and usually features very technical playing, consisting of elements borrowed from both classical and speed metal music. Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore pioneered the subgenre by merging classical melodies and blues rock. Later, Yngwie Malmsteen became one of the most notable musicians in the subgenre, and contributed greatly to the development of the style in the 1980s. Other notable players in the genre are Randy Rhoads, Jason Becker, Tony MacAlpine, Vinnie Moore, Uli Jon Roth, Stéphan Forté and Timo Tolkki.  - Paavo Lötjönen (born 29 July 1968) is a cello player for Finnish band Apocalyptica. Paavo comes from a family where both of his parents were professional musicians.  At the age of 6, he took a cello and decided that would be the instrument he would play all his life. Like fellow band members Perttu Kivilaakso and Eicca Toppinen he attended Sibelius Academy in Helsinki.  - Clifford Lee \\"Cliff\\" Burton (February 10, 1962  September 27, 1986) was an American musician, best known as the second bass guitarist for the American thrash metal band Metallica from December 1982 until his death in September 1986.  - Tony MacAlpine (born August 29, 1960) is an American musician and composer. In a career spanning three decades and twelve studio albums, he is best known as an instrumental rock solo guitarist, although he has worked with many different bands and musicians in guest appearances and collaborations.  - Yngwie Johan Malmsteen (; born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerbäck on 30 June 1963) is a Swedish guitarist and bandleader.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Ronald \\"Ron\\" McGovney (born November 2, 1962) is a semi-retired American musician, best known as the original bass guitarist in the heavy metal band Metallica from October 1981 to December 1982.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Does toasting or microwaving sourdough bread kill the beneficial bacteria (probiotics)? Why is it so difficult to toast bread while cutting it?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They both pertain to bread, but they address different aspects of the process. Let's examine each question to better understand their meaning and the respective answers. Question 1: Does toasting or microwaving sourdough bread kill the beneficial bacteria (probiotics)? This question is specifically concerned with the effects of toasting or microwaving sourdough bread on the living beneficial bacteria (probiotics) within the bread. Sourdough bread is made using a natural fermentation process involving wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. These bacteria are responsible for the distinctive taste, texture, and health benefits associated with sourdough bread. When it comes to toasting or microwaving sourdough bread, the high temperatures involved in these processes may indeed kill the beneficial bacteria present in the bread. The heat exposure results in the denaturation of proteins, inactivation of enzymes, and it effectively kills the probiotics present in the sourdough bread. However, this does not diminish the overall nutritional value of the bread, as there are still other benefits such as increased bioavailability of minerals due to the fermentation process and the presence of prebiotics (which are not destroyed by heat and can nourish the friendly bacteria in your gut). Question 2: Why is it so difficult to toast bread while cutting it? This question focuses on the difficulty of simultaneously toasting and cutting bread. Toasting bread is the process of heating it until it becomes brown and crispy, while cutting refers to slicing the bread into smaller pieces for consumption. The primary reason why it is difficult to toast bread while cutting it is that these two actions require different modalities that are not inherently compatible. Toasting bread requires the exposure of the bread to heat, whether it be through an electrical appliance like a toaster or an open flame or griddle. This process causes the Maillard reaction, which is the chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that leads to the browning, crisping, and the development of flavor in the bread. On the other hand, cutting bread revolves around the mechanical process of slicing through the bread with a knife or a similar cutting tool. This action demands stability and control in order to make clean cuts, particularly when dealing with softer bread like sandwich loaves or freshly baked bread. Attempting to toast bread while cutting it would prove quite challenging, as the heat source required for toasting would interfere with the slicing process, making it difficult to handle the bread or maintain a consistent cut. Moreover, most toast-making appliances, like toasters, toaster ovens, or open flames, aren’t designed to accommodate bread that’s being sliced simultaneously. This could result in uneven toasting or damage to the appliance. In general, it is much more practical and efficient to toast the bread before or after cutting to achieve the desired outcome. In conclusion, while both questions involve bread, one is centered on the impact of toasting or microwaving on the bread's beneficial bacteria, whereas the other inquires about the challenges of toasting and cutting simultaneously. These questions have distinct meanings and address different aspects of bread handling and preparation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long should athletes probably eat protein?  A). All the time - even when they aren't working out. B). Only after working out.

Combine the like terms: The like terms in the equation are the terms with the variable m, which are -275*m and -90*m. (-275 - 90)*m = -365*m So now, the equation is: -365*m + 323 = 2513 2. Isolate m: To isolate m, we will first move the constant term 323 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 323 from both sides: -365*m + 323 - 323 = 2513 - 323 -365*m = 2190 Now, to solve for m, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -365: m = 2190 / -365 3.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less forest formation happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less forest formation occurs, it would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of creating more forests. Direct effect: 1. Reduced tree populations: With less forest formation, there will be fewer trees in existence. This directly impacts the first step of the process, where networks of trees start forming. A decreased number of trees means fewer opportunities for more forests to emerge. Indirect effects: 1. Impeded nutrient cycling: As fewer trees die off, there will be a limited supply of dead material that provides nutrients for new trees. This hinders the process where dead material enables the growth of more trees, potentially stagnating or slowing down overall forest formation. 2. Less shelter for wildlife: The decreased number of forests and trees results in less shelter for various organisms. This affects the point in the process where rising trees provide protection for growing organisms, leading to reduced biodiversity. A less diverse ecosystem might have ongoing consequences for forest regeneration since many organisms play a crucial role in seed dispersal, pollination, and soil fertilization. 3. Altered local and global climate: Forests play a significant role in regulating local and global climate systems by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. With reduced forest formation, this carbon sequestering capacity decreases, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions and potentially worsening climate change. This may indirectly affect forest formation, as extreme weather events or shifting climates can hinder the growth and development of new forests. 4. Changes in landscape-scale processes: Forests facilitate processes like water cycling and soil formation, which, in turn, support the establishment and expansion of forests. Reduced forest formation can lead to disruptions in these broader landscape processes, indirectly affecting the ability of forests to regenerate and expand over time. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of reduced forest formation will have notable direct and indirect effects on the overall process of creating more forests. These effects can hinder ecosystem development, reduce biodiversity, and disrupt vital cycles and processes at both local and global scales."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In addition to being carbon neutral, what other adjective describes wood that makes it compelling as a renewable energy source? Answer: As an abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion, but there is scope for adding more value to the response. In addition to being carbon-neutral, wood as a renewable energy source is also characterized by its adjective \\"sustainable.\\" This attribute contributes to its compelling nature as a viable option for renewable energy.  Sustainable wood, also known as \\"sustainably sourced wood\\" or simply \\"sustainable biomass,\\" is derived from areas where proper forestry practices are implemented. These practices ensure that wood is harvested responsibly, keeping the environment in mind, and guaranteeing that forests and the ecosystem as a whole are preserved and protected. Sustainability in the context of wood refers to the balance between the demand for this resource and the maintenance of healthy ecosystems and forest growth rates. There are several reasons why wood's sustainability aspect makes it a compelling renewable energy source: 1. Managed Forests: The sustainable wood used for renewable energy comes from well-managed forests, which maintain a healthy balance between tree growth and harvesting. This not only guarantees a steady supply of wood over time, but it also ensures that forests are not over-exploited, thus reducing the risk of deforestation. 2. Biodegradable: Wood, being a natural material, is biodegradable, which means it breaks down and decomposes naturally over time. This is in contrast to many other energy sources, such as coal or gas, which leave behind environmentally harmful waste materials. 3. Carbon Sequestration: Well-managed forests also contribute to the capture and storage of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process known as carbon sequestration. By maintaining a healthy ecosystem, forests act as carbon sinks, and harvested wood used for energy production emits less carbon dioxide during combustion than fossil fuels. 4. Low Emissions: Wood-based renewable energy sources generally produce lower emissions than their fossil fuel counterparts. These lower emissions can help combat pollution levels and contribute to better air quality. 5. Local Employment Opportunities: By relying on sustainable wood as an energy source, local communities can create employment opportunities in forestry, wood-processing, and renewable energy sectors. This, in turn, can help stimulate local economies and contribute to their development. 6. Renewable: Most importantly, wood is a renewable resource with an inherently regenerative cycle. As trees grow, they provide valuable natural resources and habitats for various species, while also serving as a source of raw material for producing energy and other products. In summary, the adjective that describes wood, making it compelling as a renewable energy source in addition to being carbon-neutral, is \\"sustainable.\\" By managing resources responsibly and ensuring forests are preserved and protected, wood-based energy provides an environmentally friendly, economically viable, and socially responsible energy solution with numerous benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A dislocated shoulder suffered in the warm-up wasn't enough to stop Marc Marquez from competing at the British MotoGP but the surging rookie saw his winning streak snapped by Jorge Lorenzo in a thrilling finish. Marquez overtook Lorenzo during the final lap at Silverstone only for the reigning world champion to slip inside his fellow Spaniard after he uncharacteristically went wide on a turn. Marquez, who began on pole, thus failed in his bid to claim a fifth consecutive victory. \\"As usual Marc pushed in the last laps and overtook me but I didn't want to lose this race,\\" Lorenzo told the BBC. \\"When he overtook me three corners from the end, I thought it was over. \\"Anyway the battle was so nice with Jorge,\\"","output":"Marquez said, expressing some satisfaction despite the race's outcome. \\"We fought hard on the track, and it was a great experience. He managed to utilize his experience and the power of his bike at the crucial moment which turned the game in his favor. It's something for me to learn from and add to my ever-increasing knowledge of how to handle such fierce and direct competition.\\" The close encounter between the two Spaniards lit up the usually dull British skies, revealing the intense rivalry that appears to be brewing between the two. Marquez, the first rookie rider in 35 years to win consecutive premier class races, seemed to have another victory within reach. But he went wide on the penultimate corner while attempting to sustain a lead, thereby providing Lorenzo with an unexpected opportunity to strike back. Lorenzo, a double MotoGP world champion and one of the most astute readers of race craft, seized this opportunity ruthlessly. He stealthily slipped on the inside of Marquez, thus regaining the lost position and eventually securing a victory. This exciting climax at Silverstone demonstrated Lorenzo's immense skill and experience, which played a decisive role in outclassing the high-flying rookie Marquez. Indeed, this was a battle where Lorenzo was fuelled not only by the desire to secure his maiden victory of the season but also to send a message to Marquez - the young rider who had been making waves in the MotoGP circuit. For Lorenzo, this was a chance to regain some of his previously unmatched glory and to prove that despite the emergence of new talent, he remains a formidable force in the sport. At the end of the day, this dramatic encounter at Silverstone didn't just give the MotoGP fans a thrilling show, it also served as a stark reminder that in the sport of high-speed racing, nothing is predictable. A moment's lapse, a single misjudged turn as in the case of Marquez, can turn the tide in favor of your competitors.  \\"After today's race, I know I need to pay special attention on the corners, especially when I am leading,\\" Marquez said. \\"It was a hard-learned lesson but definitely a valuable one.\\" Marquez however made it clear that his hopes for the championship weren't affected by this setback as he said, \\"The championship is long and rife with opportunities. Today was Lorenzo's day, but the next race might be mine.\\" The competition between Marquez and Lorenzo has added an extra layer of intrigue to the MotoGP. Despite having his winning streak snapped by Lorenzo at the British MotoGP, Marquez continues to inspire with his resilience and remarkable skill. He is bent on learning, improving, and ready for the next battle, underlining the fact that this was not a defeat but a lesson learned in the art of racing. In the end, both racers, through their mammoth abilities and performance on the track, became a testament to the fact that MotoGP is as much about talent as it is about strategy and quick decision making."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).  Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S).  Which person studied less about the North American Cordillera? Answer:","output":"Alice studied less about the North American Cordillera. The North American Cordillera is a large region of alpine tundra that stretches across western North America, mainly in the United States and Canada. This region is located within the higher latitude range (approximately between 30 to 60°N), which is the area that Pam focused her studies on. Pam studied Earth's climate and vegetation in the high latitudes (70 to 50°N), which included a significant portion of the North American Cordillera. As the Cordillera lies within this latitude range, Pam's research would have covered a lot of information relating to this area - such as its unique alpine ecosystems, biodiversity, and the effects of climate change on this mountainous region. On the other hand, Alice studied the lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Although parts of the North American Cordillera do extend into the lower latitude range, the majority of the region falls within the higher latitude range that Pam studied. Therefore, Alice's research would have focused more on other areas within her latitude range, such as the Andes of South America or the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa. Moreover, the treeline roughly stays constant between 3,500 and 4,000 meters (11,500 and 13,100 ft) in the lower latitudes, while it changes significantly across the high latitudes, rising 75 meters (245 ft) per degree from 70 to 50°N. The treeline is an important factor in the study of alpine tundra, and given the greater variation at higher latitudes, Pam's studies would have involved more analysis and comparison of the North American Cordillera than Alice's studies. In summary, based on their respective research focus on different latitude ranges, Alice studied less about the North American Cordillera than Pam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine  (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique.

However, it would not be accurate to conclude that every horse stable in the country has a website based solely on this paragraph. This is because the paragraph only suggests that an online search can help locate horse stables within a specific area but does not explicitly state that all horse stables across the country have a website. It is possible for some horse stables to not have an online presence or to have information about their facilities listed on third-party websites instead of their own website. In order to find horse stables with or without websites, it is a good idea to use various strategies. These may include asking for recommendations from friends, family, or local equine professionals; consulting local business directories; visiting equine-focused online forums; or attending horse-related events in the area. Additionally, some smaller or less digitally connected stables might rely on word-of-mouth referrals for their client base.

Question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

As they pause, still entwined, the two girls exchange curious glances, sizing each other up, their previous fears and reservations momentarily forgotten in the wake of this unusual encounter. It dawns on them that an extraordinary connection has formed between them, a bond forged in the shared thrill and adrenaline of skirting the edge of danger. A realization flickers in their eyes, a budding recognition that they might have just stumbled upon something truly special: the beginnings of a new and profound friendship. As they disentangle themselves from one another, the larger girl extends her hand, offering it to the smaller girl with a kind, encouraging smile. Gratefully, the little girl takes it, her fingers wrapping around her newfound friend's hand with a sense of comfort and security that surprises her.

As the sun begins to lower in the sky, casting a warm, golden glow over the playground, the two girls pledge their unwavering loyalty to one another, vowing to navigate the twists and turns of life side by side, always looking out for each other, and always, always being there to catch each other when they fall. And so begins the story of a friendship that transcends the boundaries of age, size, and circumstance -- an extraordinary alliance born from a near disaster on a slide and nurtured by the love, trust, and compassion that only the truest of friends can share. It is a friendship that will grow and evolve through the years, shaping the lives of these two girls in ways they could never have imagined on that fateful day at the playground."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A taller wave on the ocean has more or less strength than a smaller wave? Answer:","output":"A taller wave on the ocean has more strength than a smaller wave. This is because the energy of a wave is directly related to its height (amplitude). As the wave height increases, so does the amount of energy it carries. This energy is what determines the strength of the wave. In general, the energy of a wave can be calculated using the following formula: E = ½ρgh²A where: - E is the wave energy - ρ (rho) is the water density - g is the gravitational acceleration - h is the wave height (amplitude) - A is the area of the wave front As you can see from this formula, wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height. This means that if a wave is twice as tall as another wave, it will have four times the energy (2² = 4). As a result, taller waves on the ocean are stronger than smaller waves, due to the increased energy they carry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To look at Julianne Talley, a statuesque 61-year-old beauty, one would never know she has conquered both obesity and cancer. The Ms. Senior Florida contestant glided through the Vero Beach High School Performing Arts Center with the humility of someone who underestimates her beauty. Little did she know, she was about to be crowned Ms. Senior Florida 2014. Talley's platform is one of self-acceptance and self-improvement: \\"It's a message to the woman in the audience who thinks 'I'm always going to be heavy' or 'I can't dance'... yes you can,\\" she said during dress rehearsal. While we're accustomed to beauty pageants featuring women in their 20s strutting in bikinis, the Ms. Senior America pageant seeks women with \\"dignity, maturity and inner beauty,\\" who are older than 60. There's no upper age limit and no bikinis are required. The oldest contestant in Florida this year was 86. Pageant organizers Hedi Headley and Helen McKnight worked for months gathering contestants from around the state of Florida. The 15 women who were selected rehearsed almost every week between January and March. The ladies were judged on their interview, philosophy of life, talent and gown presentation during the March 29 competition. The Ms. Senior America Pageant has been around for 35 years, but the state level competitions vary in their founding year. Headly and McKnight originally founded the Ms. Senior Arizona Pageant in 1990, when they weren't even 50 yet themselves. \\"We saw a need to encourage the older adult and especially women that feel they become invisible as they age,\\" said Headly. Semi-retired in Florida, Headly and McKnight took over running the Ms. Senior Florida Pageant last year. The contestants evolved before Headly's eyes. \\"Most of the ladies have never even talked into a microphone before rehearsals,\\" she said. The granny of yesteryear, sitting in a rocking chair knitting, is a thing of the past if the pageant is any indication. Today, women over 60 are rocking it on stage: singing, dancing, sharing their inventions and even belly dancing at senior beauty pageants around the country. The Ms. Senior pageants give contestants a chance to do something many of them never dreamed of doing in their 20s, 30s or even 50s -- take the spotlight and share their wisdom and talent with hundreds of people. In addition to the crown, Talley won \\"Best Talent\\" for singing and playing \\"Sentimental Journey\\" on the piano. Talley faced a long journey to get where she is today. Overweight most of her life, 10 years ago, she lost 100 pounds and kept it off. \\"I decided to enter the competition after a lot of thought and prayer, when I realized that it was an opportunity to reach my dream to touch women across the country, to inspire them to take better care of themselves, and to set goals, dream dreams, and do what it takes to reach those goals,\\" said Talley. She wants to encourage other women to become physically fit even as seniors, which is a message she will take to the Ms. Senior America Pageant this October at the Resorts Hotel Casino in Atlantic City. \\"It has been my dream to reach women across the country to encourage them that we 'ain't dead yet'!\\" said Talley. The second runner-up was Ann Palle, a 60-year-old baton twirler who leads a 105-person senior citizen baton twirling team that performs in about 55 shows a year. The oldest twirler is 95. \\"It's nice to get together with these ladies because we all bring something very different, but this pageant brings us together,\\" Palle said. Each of these women has a distinct philosophy, and if laughter is the key to longevity, Lauren Luccini \\"Miss Congeniality,\\" will live forever. \\"When I used to date, men used to open the car door for you,\\" she told the audience in her standup comedy routine during the talent competition. \\"Now, I'm glad if they even stop the car.\\" Then there was, Julie Dohan, who at 81 went from modeling to art dealing to inventing, but believes \\"the best is yet to come.\\" Raven-haired contestant Lucille DiBartolo is a 79-year-old Mediterranean beauty who still gets carded for proof of her senior citizenship. (Full disclosure: This lovely lady is my grandmother, and I attended the pageant to support her.) Encouraging young women to be more confident, she added that, \\"it's not who you are but who you perceive yourself to be.\\" Last year's winner, Betsy Horn, stopped by to encourage the women. An ovarian cancer survivor, Horn wrote a book, \\"A Little Touch of Cancer and How it Made Me Well,\\" and encourages women to share their inspirational stories, which can come from hardship. \\"You can't get through life without having some event that happens that challenges one deeply and emotionally,\\" she said. \\"As you get to know the ladies, you realize that everyone does have a story and that they were survivors.\\" Horn had high praise for 2014's Ms. Senior Florida contestants: \\"I came away this year thinking these women all have a lot to offer, so they should all get out there and do something!\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"Julianne Talley, a 61-year-old lady, won Ms. Senior Florida 2014.

Answer a question about this article: Lilius's proposals had two components. Firstly, he proposed a correction to the length of the year. The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March. How much difference does the extra 11 minutes make over 400 years time?","output":"To calculate the difference that the extra 11 minutes make over 400 years, we need to consider the following information from the article: - The Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. - The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. - The average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days. First, let's find the difference in time between the Julian year and the mean tropical year in minutes: Difference in time (in minutes) = (365.25 days - 365.24219 days) * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour Difference in time (in minutes) ≈ 11.06 minutes Now let's find how much this difference accumulates over 400 years: Accumulated difference (in minutes) = 11.06 minutes/year * 400 years Accumulated difference (in minutes) ≈ 4424 minutes Now we will convert the accumulated difference to days: Accumulated difference (in days) = 4424 minutes / 60 minutes/hour / 24 hours/day Accumulated difference (in days) ≈ 3.07 days Thus, the extra 11 minutes make a difference of approximately 3.07 days over 400 years' time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher.  I am facing a new situation today: Beach town was hit hard by the hurricane. Hill town was spared, being situated 50 miles south. the eye of the hurricane passed almost through Beach town.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which town had less damage caused by low pressure eye of the hurricane?","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can deduce that Hill town had less damage caused by the low pressure eye of the hurricane. Below is a detailed explanation of the reasons behind this conclusion. 1. Storm Surge Impact: The low pressure eye of the hurricane is responsible for the formation of storm surges, which are very high waters that can cause severe flooding when they reach land. Beach town, which was directly hit by the hurricane, would have experienced a significant storm surge. On the other hand, Hill town was situated 50 miles south and did not experience the direct impact of the hurricane's low pressure eye, so it likely faced a significantly reduced storm surge risk. 2. Influence of High Tide: The background article suggests that if a storm occurs during a high tide, the water will rise even higher, potentially causing more damage. Beach town, being located right on the coast, is subject to the effects of tides, whereas Hill town, which is further inland, would be less susceptible to these fluctuations and their potential impact on storm surge effects. 3. High Wind and Waves: Hurricanes deliver strong winds which can create very large waves. Beach town experienced the direct impact of the hurricane's eye, where these conditions create a dangerous combination of high waves atop storm surges. This would result in even more flooding and subsequent damage in Beach town as compared to Hill town. While Hill town might experience high winds from being in the vicinity of the hurricane, it would not face the same magnitude of damage caused by the low pressure eye and the intense storm surge. 4. Topography: Hill town is likely situated at a higher elevation than Beach town, as the names of the towns suggest. This topographic difference decreases the risk of flooding in Hill town compared to Beach town, which is more susceptible to damage due to a storm surge and its location along the shoreline. In summary, considering the factors of storm surge impact, tidal influence, high winds and waves, and topography, it is reasonable to conclude that Hill town suffered less damage caused by the low pressure eye of the hurricane than Beach town."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given music product reviews in German language.

Here is a news article: IBM Report Details Potential Vulnerabilities That Could Compromise Mobile Security      New technology has completely revolutionized the dating process. Many people are using mobile dating applications to find their “special someones.” In fact, a recent Pew Research study found that 1 in 10 Americans have used a dating site or application, and the number of people who have dated someone they met online has grown to 66 percent over the past eight years. Even though many dating applications are relatively new to the market, Pew Research also found that an astonishing 5 percent of Americans who are in a marriage or committed relationship met their significant other online.      As the number of dating applications and registered users grows, so does their attractiveness to potential attackers. Powered by IBM Application Security on Cloud technology, a recent IBM analysis of dating applications revealed the following:      Nearly 60 percent of leading mobile dating applications they studied on the Android mobile platform are vulnerable to potential cyberattacks that could put personal user information and organizational data at risk.      For 50 percent of enterprises IBM analyzed, employee-installed popular dating applications were present on mobile devices that had access to confidential business data.      The goal of this blog is not to discourage you from using these applications. Rather, its goal is to educate organizations and their users on potential risks and mobile security best practices to use the applications safely.      Potential Exploits in Dating Apps      The vulnerabilities IBM discovered are more powerful than you might suspect. Some of them make it possible for cybercriminals to collect valuable personal information about you. Even though certain applications employ privacy measures, IBM found that many are vulnerable to attacks, which can let cybercriminals do the following:      Use GPS Information to Track Your Movements: IBM found that 73 percent of the 41 popular dating applications analyzed have access to current and historical GPS location information. Cybercriminals may capture your current and former GPS location details to find out where you live, work or spend most of your day.      Control Your Phone’s Camera or Microphone: Several identified vulnerabilities let cybercriminals gain access to your phone’s camera or microphone even when you aren’t logged in to dating applications. Such vulnerabilities can let attackers spy and eavesdrop on your personal activities or tap into data you capture on your cell phone camera in confidential business meetings.      Several identified vulnerabilities let cybercriminals gain access to your phone’s camera or microphone even when you aren’t logged in to dating applications. Such vulnerabilities can let attackers spy and eavesdrop on your personal activities or tap into data you capture on your cell phone camera in confidential business meetings. Hijack Your Dating Profile: A cybercriminal can change content and images on your dating profile, impersonate you, communicate with other application users from your account or leak personal information that could tarnish your personal and/or professional reputation.      How Do Attackers Exploit These Vulnerabilities?      Which specific vulnerabilities enable attackers to carry out the exploits mentioned above, permitting them to gain access to your confidential information? IBM’s security researchers determined 26 of the 41 dating applications analyzed on the Android mobile platform either had medium- or high-severity vulnerabilities, which included the following:      Cross-Site Scripting Attacks via Man in the Middle: This vulnerability can act as a gateway for attackers to gain access to mobile applications and other features on your devices. It can permit an attacker to intercept cookies and other information from your application via an insecure Wi-Fi connection or rogue access point, and then tap into other devices features the app has access to, such as your camera, GPS and microphone.

It can permit an attacker to intercept cookies and other information from your application via an insecure Wi-Fi connection or rogue access point, and then tap into other devices features the app has access to, such as your camera, GPS and microphone. Debug Flag-Enabled Exploits: If Debug Flag is enabled on an application, it means a debug-enabled application on an Android device may attach to another application and read or write to the application’s memory. The attacker can then intercept information that flows into the application, modify its actions and inject malicious data into it and out of it.      If Debug Flag is enabled on an application, it means a debug-enabled application on an Android device may attach to another application and read or write to the application’s memory. The attacker can then intercept information that flows into the application, modify its actions and inject malicious data into it and out of it. Phishing Attacks via Man in the Middle: Attackers can offer up a fake login screen via dating applications to capture your user credentials so that when you try to log in to a site of their choosing, your credentials are disclosed to the attackers without your knowledge. Then, the attacker can reach out to your contacts, pretend to be you and send them phishing messages with malicious code that could potentially infect their devices.      What Can You Do to Protect Yourself Against These Exploits?      One of the primary challenges with dating apps is that they operate in a different fashion than other social media sites. Most social media sites encourage you to connect with people you already know. By definition, mobile dating applications encourage you to connect with people you don’t already know. So, what can you do to protect yourself?      Trust Your Instinct: As the old saying goes, “There are plenty of fish in the sea.” If people you’re engaging with online refuse to provide the same basic information they ask of you; if their photos and profile appear too good to be true; or if their profile information doesn’t seem to align with the type of person with whom you’re communicating, trust your instinct and move on. Until you get to know the person well, resist any efforts to meet him or her anywhere but in a public location with plenty of people around.

Until you get to know the person well, resist any efforts to meet him or her anywhere but in a public location with plenty of people around. Keep Your Profile Lean: Don’t divulge too much personal information on these sites. Information such as where you work, your birthday or links to your other social media profiles should be shared only when you’re comfortable with someone.      Don’t divulge too much personal information on these sites. Information such as where you work, your birthday or links to your other social media profiles should be shared only when you’re comfortable with someone. Schedule a Routine “Permission Review:” On a routine basis, you should review your device settings to confirm your security settings haven’t been altered. For example, I once had my cell phone revert to “GPS-enabled” when I upgraded the software on my device, permitting another user to identify my precise geographical location via a chat application. Prior to the upgrade, GPS device-tracking had not been enabled. Thus, you need to be vigilant, because updating your applications can inadvertently reset permissions for device features associated with your address book or GPS data. You should be particularly vigilant after any software upgrade or updates are made.

Use Unique Passwords for All Your Online Accounts: Be sure to use unique passwords for every online account you manage. If you use the same password for all your accounts, it can leave you open to multiple attacks should an individual account be compromised. Remember to always use different passwords for your email and chat accounts than for your social media profiles, as well.      Be sure to use unique passwords for every online account you manage.

In addition to encouraging employees to follow safe online practices, organizations need to protect themselves from vulnerable dating apps that are active inside their infrastructure. As referred to earlier, IBM found nearly 50 organizations sampled for this research had at least one popular dating app installed on either corporate-owned devices or bring-your-own devices (BYOD). To protect this sensitive data, organizations should consider the following mobile security activities:      Protect BYOD Devices: Leverage enterprise mobility management capabilities to enable employees to use their own devices to access the sites while maintaining organizational security.      Leverage enterprise mobility management capabilities to enable employees to use their own devices to access the sites while maintaining organizational security. Permit Employees to Download From Authorized App Stores Only: Allow employees to download applications solely from authorized application stores, such as Google Play, the Apple App Store and your organization’s app store, if applicable.      Allow employees to download applications solely from authorized application stores, such as Google Play, the Apple App Store and your organization’s app store, if applicable. Educate Employees About Application Security: Educate employees about the dangers of downloading third-party applications and the potential dangers that can result from weak device permissioning.      Educate employees about the dangers of downloading third-party applications and the potential dangers that can result from weak device permissioning. Act Immediately When a Device Is Compromised: Set automated policies on smartphones and tablets that take immediate action if a device is found compromised or malicious apps are discovered. This approach protects your organization’s data while the issue is remediated.      About This Research      IBM Security analysts from IBM’s Application Security Research team used IBM Application Security on Cloud to analyze the top 41 dating apps available on Android devices to identify vulnerabilities that can leave users open to potential cyberattacks and threats. Those apps were also analyzed to determine the granted permissions, unveiling a host of excessive privileges. To understand enterprise adoption of these 41 dating apps, app data was analyzed from IBM MaaS360. In advance of releasing this research to the public, IBM Security disclosed all affected app vendors identified with the research.

IBM security researchers said 26 of 41 dating apps they analyzed on Google Inc's Android mobile platform had medium or high severity vulnerabilities, in a report published on Wednesday.      IBM did not name the vulnerable apps but said it had alerted the app publishers to problems.      Dating apps have become hugely popular in the past few years due to their instant messaging, photo and geolocation services. About 31 million Americans have used a dating site or app, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study.      IBM found employees used vulnerable dating apps in nearly 50 percent of the companies sampled for its research. Using the same phone for work and play, a phenomenon known as \\"bring your own device,\\" or BYOD, means users and their employers are both open to potential cyberattacks.      \\"The trouble with BYOD is that, if not managed properly, the organizations might be leaking sensitive corporate data via employee-owned devices,\\" said the IBM report.      IBM said the problem is that people on dating apps let their guard down and are not as sensitive to potential security problems as they might be on email or websites.      If an app is compromised, hackers can take advantage of users waiting eagerly to hear back from a potential love interest by sending bogus \\"phishing\\" messages to glean sensitive information or install malware, IBM said.      A phone's camera or microphone could be turned on remotely through a vulnerable app, which IBM warned could be used to eavesdrop on personal conversations or confidential business meetings. Vulnerable GPS data could also lead to stalking, and a user's billing information could be hacked to purchase things on other apps or websites.      IBM said it had not so far seen a rash of security breaches due to dating apps as opposed to any other kind of social media.      Meanwhile, it recommends that dating app users limit the personal information they divulge, use unique passwords on every online account, apply the latest software patches and keep track of what permissions each app has.      IAC/InterActiveCorp, which owns some of the most popular dating apps, said its services were not at risk.      \\"IBM tested IAC's dating apps - including Match, OkCupid, and Tinder - and they were not among the apps found to exhibit the cited vulnerabilities,\\" the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Tom Brown) ||||| February 11, 2015 11:25 PM      NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Are you looking for love this Valentine’s Day?      As CBS2’s Tracee Carrasco reported, there is a new warning that could leave dating app users heartbroken.      “I went on just one Tinder date,” said Kelly Geiling. “I met a guy for drinks and that was it.”      Many people are looking for love, and like Geiling, many turn to dating apps on their smartphones hoping to find it.      “I went through to try and find, like, a normal person,” Geiling said.      But now, daters need to worry about more than just finding a normal person. Hackers could be getting a hold of their personal information.      “I’m concerned that I never thought about that,” Geiling said.      According to new research from IBM Security, 60 percent of dating apps on mobile devices have security flaws that could allow a hacker to break in, install a virus on your phone — even steal a credit card or personal information.      “Your contacts list; it could be your stored images, or your pictures. They can actually also potentially access features on the device – so your camera, your microphone, even your GPS location,” said Michael Monticello, security intelligence director of IBM Security Services.      IBM Security found that 26 out of 41 dating apps that were tested put users at risk to hackers.      The first step in protecting yourself is not to share too much information, and also, Monitcello said, “understanding if there is a configuration or how your app actually works is pretty important.”      Also, you are advised always to make sure you use a trusted wi-fi connection.      IBM Security doesn’t want to discourage people from using dating apps to find love, but just wants to make sure people are aware of these security risks. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A recent IBM report has revealed potential vulnerabilities in mobile dating applications that could compromise their user's security.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing...  answer the following question:  What albums did the original lead guitarist for the band that had a member die in August 1992 perform lead vocals on? Answer:","output":"The original lead guitarist for the band Toto, Steve Lukather, performed lead vocals on the albums \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" (1992) and \\"Tambu\\" (1995) following the death of band member Jeff Porcaro in August 1992."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

If you want to reheat a roast for later, the process starts when you first cook the roast. Roasts can dry out in the reheating process, so you'll want to save any fats or fluids that drip off the roast into the baking pan. Possible answers:  A). You should also cook the roast slightly less done than you prefer. For example, if you prefer a medium rare roast, remove your roast from the oven when it's rare.;  B). Fat and flavorings are usually stored in the oven to preserve the roast and keep the roast warm. You should deglaze the roast prior to reheating it, this will turn it into something slightly flavorless.;  C). You should also save the drippings when you're reheating the roast. Plan on carrying these drippings with you when you're cooking it for storage purposes.;  D). Check the coating that the roast has on the pan before you place it in the oven. While it can add a ton of heat later on, the coating will slow down the roasting process.;","output":"A). You should also cook the roast slightly less done than you prefer. For example, if you prefer a medium rare roast, remove your roast from the oven when it's rare. This is the correct answer because to prevent the roast from overcooking and drying out during reheating, you should initially cook it slightly less done than your preference.  Now let's explain why the other answers are wrong: B) is wrong because storing fat and flavorings in the oven does not preserve the roast or keep it warm. Deglazing the roast prior to reheating also doesn't make sense, as deglazing is a technique used to add flavor, not remove it. C) is incorrect because you saved the drippings when you first cooked the roast, not when you reheat it. You don't need to carry the drippings with you for storage purposes, they should be stored properly in a container until needed for reheating. D) is wrong because the coating on the pan does not affect the reheat process. The coating will not slow down the roasting process and is not relevant to reheating the roast."},{"instruction":"Title: Works great for a few weeks Review: This humidifier sucks.

Rick Perry delivered a scathing indictment of Barack Obama on Thursday night in Washington, teeing up a presidential run with a speech that took little notice of presumptive Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton and instead castigated the president as feckless, clueless and gutless. Just 16 days removed from the 10,000-square-foot Texas governor's mansion, Perry is on the road and shaping the messages that will accompany a White House campaign. He stopped in Washingtonto deliver rhetorical red-meat to a friendly and very conservative audience. The early going has been kind to the Texan: While reporters can't let go of his calamitous 'Oops!' moment in 2011, he raised political eyebrows on Thursday by unveiling a list of 80 financial power brokers who will shake the trees and make rain for him. One of those financiers, who requested anonymity, told Daily Mail Online on Thursday – in advance of the governor's address to the conservative American Principles Project – that Perry is confident he can win. 'He and his wife believe they are touched by God, and that this is his time,' the donor said. 'It's like – they can't lose – that's the sense of it.' 'I don't know if he'll win the nomination, but I'm absolutely sure he'll be one of the last two Republicans standing,' he added during a phone interview. Perry got a warm reception in Washington on Thursday with themes that hammered President Barack Obama and pointed toward a second presidential run. PRESSING THE FLESH: Perry mingled in a room full of hundreds of right-wingers at an event hosted by the American Principles Project, which opposes abortion and gay marriage. Perry shunned reporters on Thursday night after his speech – Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal held a press conference after his lunchtime remarks – but his turn at the podium during the nighttime gala brimmed with that confidence – half campaign stemwinder, half inaugural address. He lifted a line from Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration, where the 41st president said, 'There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured with what is right with America.' Perry's version took aim at Barack Obama. 'There is nothing wrong in America today,' he said, 'that can't be fixed with a change in leadership.' That change is sure to come in January 2017, but it's anyone's guess who will move into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 'Our nation is on a slow glide-path to decline,' Perry said Thursday night. And Republicans see eight more years of a Democratic administration as a political doomsday. The GOP has a deep bench, with no fewer than 20 would-be nominees talking about running. They include governors, senators, former CEOs and diplomats, and a pediatric surgeon. Democrats, on the other hand, have Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. And few others judged as powerful enough or daring enough to challenge her. Knowing who will likely await them in America's political Super Bowl has allowed GOP White House hopefuls to keep their anti-Hillary powder dry and hold their best attacks until 2016 when they will matter most. Instead Perry and others are focusing their energy on Obama. The governor's speech on Thursday could have been the one he delivered on the stump in 2012 if his first presidential bid hadn't imploded when he couldn't remember which three federal cabinet agencies he had said he would close if he won the presidency. He hit Obama on foreign policy, on energy, on the economy and jobs, and on that distinctly Texas concern: illegal immigration. And he slapped Republicans, as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal had earlier in the day during an American Principles Project lunch, for risking the loss of their congressional majorities by straying too close to the political middle. THREE YEARS AND ONE 'OOPS' LATER: Perry was all smiles in October 2011 when he filed the paperwork for his name to appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot. CAMPAIGN MODE: The Texas governor wound up his crowd with reliable conservative themes and spent most of his time at the podium railnig against the Obama administration. READY TO RUN? Perry is road-testing themes for future speeches when the political stakes will be as high as any in American history. Americans, he said, rejected the Obama administration in November – citing 'the VA allowing our heroes to die, the IRS targeting citizens, the administration trading five terrorists for a military deserter, the rise of ISIS, the lies upon which Obamacare was passed, (and) the weakest economic recovery in history.' 'But let’s be clear about something,' he said in the Mayflower Hotel just a mile from the U.S. Capitol: 'The American voters’ rejection of the Democrats does not mean they embraced Republicans.' 'A congressional majority is a terrible thing to waste.' Similarly, Jindal had warned against the GOP slouching toward status as 'Democrat-lite.' Both men are rock-ribbed conservatives. Along with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, they will inhabit the right flank of the Republicans' march through next year's political playoffs. Perry spat out a litany of anti-Obama sentiments that could have come out of a tea party convention platform. 'Six years of study on the Keystone Pipeline, and still nothing happens,' he said. 'When Vladimir Putin was invading Ukraine, the president dithered when he could have sent a powerful message to the Russian president.' 'Our broken, outdated tax code has become an incubator of corruption, favoritism and bureaucratic harassment.' 'We need to stop strangling small businesses with over-regulation.' Perry, seldom soft-spoken, took special umbrage at Obama's plan to mainstream more than 5 million illegal immigrants with residency cards and work permits while hundreds of thousands more pour across the U.S.-Mexico border with drugs and human chattel. 'Those who smuggle children, enslave women, destroy lives by peddling illegal drugs and weapons, they are the face of evil,' Perry boomed. 'Texas has done more to secure the border than any state in the nation,' he exclaimed. 'And the message is clear: as long as Washington will not secure the border, Texas will.' 2016 STARTS NOW: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal spoke earlier in the day to the American Principles Project, the same group Perry appeared with at night. Perry was loose on Thursday night, free-wheeling his words as he boasted about his state's economic boom.. 'More people have moved to Texas than any other state,' he said. 'Lemme give you a little news-flash here – it's not because of our great weather in August.' At times he strayed near the eccentricities of an infamous October 2011 speech in New Hampshire that was so disengaged and free-spirited that political observers suspected he was drunk. Perry spent a week denying it, and was rescued from the biggest headlines only by businessman Herman Cain's sexual harassment scandal. The 'Oops' collapse came less than two weeks later. On that occasion, he said later, he was on painkillers for a back ailment. But Perry has never styled himself as a practiced orator or a charm school graduate. 'If you're looking for a slick politician, or a guy with great teleprompter skills, we already have that,' he said in one 2011 commercial. 'And he's destroying our economy.' 'I'm a doer, not a talker.' Write highlights for this article.","output":"Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas, criticized Barack Obama in a speech and hinted at a potential presidential run.

For those enjoying the unseasonably warm weather, the blast of freezing Arctic cold sweeping across Britain is in unwelcome reminder of what winter's normally like. But anyone with an eye for a stunning photograph is sure to welcome the dusting of snow which helps create a picturesque winter scene. The scene below was the view earlier today across Carr Shields in Northumberland, as a icy weather front swept south across the country from Siberia. Winter arrives: The unseasonably mild winter gave way to cold and snow which turned Carr Shields, Northumberland, pictured, into a picturesque snowy scene. Freezing: Weather forecasters saying the cold weather could last into February as homes in Allendale, Northumberland, stoke up their fires to keep warm. Forecasters expect temperatures are set to drop as low as -2C overnight. The. Department of Health issued a. 'Level 2' cold-weather alert running for the next two to three days,. which is triggered when low temperatures give rise to significant health. risks. It warned that low temperatures can especially be dangerous for the young and the elderly or those with chronic disease. Meanwhile, the Met Office put much of. Britain on a 'yellow alert' for people to 'be aware' of the adverse. weather conditions. It said: 'Icy stretches are expected to form on untreated surfaces, especially in places affected by showers. 'The. showers will fall as snow above about 250 metres, but there may be. temporary slush deposits to lower levels. The public should be aware of. possible travel disruption.' Forecasters say snow is likely to fall. on Monday across northern England, Wales and parts of the south-west. There will also be snow showers in East Anglia and the south-east on. Tuesday. Dan Williams, of the Met Office,. said: ‘This is certainly the longest run of colder weather we will have. seen so far this winter. 'There’s. cold air pushing in from the east, and it’s looking very wintry over. the next few days and might last for the first half of February.’ The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Snow fun: Youngster Amy Eager, five, has fun on a sledge in Bowes, County Durham, as heavy snow arrives in Britain this weekend. Cold snap: A cyclist braves the cold on the Pennine hill tops near Skipton, in the Yorkshire Dales. Chill: A man walks his dog through the snow at Kilhope, County Durham, as the country braced itself for a spell of cooler weather that has brought snow to some regions. Britain has seen very little wintry weather so far this season – but nothing is ever straightforward with our weather. After three consecutive harsh winters we have reverted to what is seen as more typical winter weather. Perhaps this year we have felt cheated by above-average temperatures and just a few frosty mornings. Now the snowdrops have appeared in the garden it seems that spring is not too far away. Prior to the winter of 2008-09 there had been only one truly harsh winter in the previous 17 years – and that began late in the season. Cold winds first reached us from Siberia in thefinal week of January 1995, leading to heavy snow showers. So could there be a sting in the tail this year?History says it can happen, even after one of the mildest winters on record. As recently as last Wednesday the temperature peaked at 12.1C at Hawarden in Flintshire, but a band of heavy rain sweeping into the North Sea by Thursday brought cold winds and snow showers to higher ground. The prospects for the coming week are for the coldest weather so far, with hard frosts overnight, snow flurries and perhaps just the higher ground seeing any heavy snow. Latest forecasts say tonight will. remain mainly dry overnight, with light winds and clear spells allowing a. widespread frost and some patches of freezing fog to form. Far northern. and western areas will be cloudier and a little milder however, with. spells of mostly light rain. Sunday is expected to be cloudy with. some rain in western parts, with snow over hills in Wales and. southwestern England later. Otherwise mainly fine after any fog clears,. although showery in the far east. On Monday a slow-moving band of rain. with hill snow in western parts will continue on Monday, before cold,. and bright conditions with isolated showers push westwards towards. midweek. Over the next couple of weeks, the. weather is forecast to be mostly settled and cold leading up to the. first weekend, especially towards the southeast of England, with. widespread overnight frost and some wintry coastal showers towards the. east. However, northwestern parts will soon. become cloudier, more unsettled, but milder with spells of rain and. some snow, the snow mainly on hills. Although there is considerable. uncertainty, the bright, cold conditions will probably continue for a. time into the second week in the east. The unsettled but milder conditions. in the west will probably spread erratically further east with time,. introducing spells of rain and some snow, again mainly on hills. This. progression may be coupled with strong winds and possibly gales in. northwestern parts. The cold spell breaks what has so far been one of the warmest winters on record. The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Forecasters said it was becoming. increasingly likely that the freezing temperatures would stick around. and even last through the whole of February. George. Goodfellow of the Met Office said: ‘It seems like we are edging toward a. scenario where lower temperatures last for the next four weeks. It is. going to be a contrast to the weather we have had this winter. Widespread frosts and snow could affect large areas.’ He said the wintry weather was a result of ‘a cold air mass moving across from Siberia’. There are fears that the sudden onset could bring travel chaos and catch many drivers off guard. AA. spokesman Luke Bodett said: ‘We have had a very mild winter so far and. motorists need to get into their winter mindset from today. It is going. to be important not to charge around in the way they may have been used. to and be prepared for the unexpected.’ The Met Office has briefed government. departments and local councils about the cold period so that extreme. weather plans can be put on standby.

Title: big fat disappointment Review: After seeing this I really wonder why it was so overhyped in the first place. Instead of running around and selling himself as the new hope for horror films (the guys does four commentarys (!) on that friggin Dvd) Eli Roth should learn to write a decent scripts. At times this thing was so stupid it felt like it was written by some sixteen year old who's making a homemovie trying to copy his favorite horror films. Nothing in this film makes sense, the characters are despisable, everything they say or do is a sign for Roths horrible script. Implausibilties galore and no friggin supense at all. Just throwing buckets of blood around doesnt make a good horror film - Roth should go watch Evil Dead again, there's more to it then just the gore. Answer:","output":"Based on the review provided, it is evident that the customer is dissatisfied with the product. The title itself, \\"big fat disappointment,\\" highlights the customer's negative sentiment about the product. The reviewer elaborates on their dissatisfaction throughout the review, mentioning the overhyped nature of the product, and criticizes Eli Roth, the creator of the product, for needing to improve his writing skills for creating a better script. The reviewer highlights the perceived immaturity of the script, comparing it to something that might have been written by a sixteen-year-old, which is an indication of their dissatisfaction with the quality of the content. Furthermore, the customer addresses the lack of sense or logic in the movie, describing the characters as \\"despicable\\" and blaming Roth's \\"horrible script\\" for the characters' unlikable conduct. This highlights the customer's frustration with the lack of believability and plausibility within the film. The review also specifically points out the lack of suspense and tension, which are crucial elements for a successful horror film. The customer suggests that merely including a lot of gore does not make a movie a good horror film, and recommends Roth to watch the movie \\"Evil Dead\\" to better understand the balance between gore and effective storytelling. In conclusion, the customer is clearly dissatisfied with the product due to a variety of reasons, including the overhyped nature of the film, the poor writing, lack of suspense, and an excessive reliance on gore. The customer's disappointment in the product is evident in their disapproving tone and critical rhetoric throughout the review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a summary based on this article: The latest allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation leveled against international peacekeepers in Central African Republic elicited expressions of disgust on Thursday from top United Nations officials and senior U.S. and French diplomats.      The United Nations on Wednesday said it has expanded an investigation of new allegations ofsexual exploitation and abuse by foreign peacekeepers in Central African Republic (CAR) and notified authorities in France, Gabon and Burundi about the accusations against their troops.      “The Secretary-General (Ban Ki-moon) is shocked to the core by the latest allegations of abuse in the Central African Republic,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters.      UN Audit Identifies Serious Lapses Linked to Alleged Bribery      U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein echoed Ban’s sentiments, calling the charges “sickening” and insisting the U.N. investigation “must leave no stone unturned.”      Dujarric said U.N. officials interviewed some 108 alleged victims, the “vast majority” of whom are minors. He described the allegations of sexual abuse between 2013 and 2015 as “despicable, depraved and deeply disturbing” and said the U.N. was doing what it can to investigate.      There have been dozens of such accusations against peacekeepers in CAR, where MINUSCA assumed authority from African Union troops in September 2014. France has been investigating allegations against its Sangaris force, which is not under U.N. command, since last year.      The Code Blue Campaign run by the advocacy group AIDS-Free World issued a statement on Wednesday citing information from interviews with victims conducted by MINUSCA, the U.N. mission in CAR.      HIV Could Be Cured Within Three Years      U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, currently in CAR, issued a statement describing the allegations as “sickening.”      “This plague of sexual abuse by peacekeepers must stop,” she said.      French Ambassador Francois Delattre said the allegations are “sickening and odious.”      “The French authorities are determined to shed full light on these grave allegations,” he said.      The U.N. has pledged to crack down on sex abuse allegations to avoid a repeat of past mistakes. MINUSCA’s previous head, Babacar Gaye, resigned last August and some 800 Congolese peacekeepers were repatriated last month.      In December, an independent review panel accused the U.N. and its agencies of grossly mishandling allegations of child sexual abuse and rape by peacekeepers in CAR in 2013 and 2014. ||||| Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India major peacekeeping contributors but amongst most prone to corruption      New York – 4th April 2016 - The top 30 Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) to UN peacekeeping operations are amongst those most at risk of defence corruption, according to new research from Transparency International.      Bangladesh, India and Ethiopia make up over one quarter of all UN peacekeeping troops, yet have been judged to be at either a very high or high risk of corruption in their armed forces. Transparency International’s Government Defence Corruption Index graded states from A to F on their risk of defence corruption, with A representing the best and F the lowest end of the scale.      Of the top 30 TCC’s only Italy (C) scores higher than a D, whilst six states received F grades, meaning they are at a critical risk of defence corruption. The UN relies on individual TCC’s to discipline misconduct by troops whilst on missions, yet there is no evidence that breaches of codes of conduct such as engaging in corrupt activities are addressed.      Katherine Dixon, Director Transparency International Defence and Security Programme, said:      “UN peacekeepers operate in some of the most fragile environments in the world, so it is extremely concerning that the majority of defence forces contributing to operations are at such a high risk of corruption. This does little to instil confidence that troops on the ground are behaving with integrity. And recent allegations of gross misconduct carried out by peacekeeping troops prove just how real the threat is.      We continue to support the UN’s efforts to ensure that those deployed on peace operations set the highest standards and do not risk contributing to the instability they’re trying to stop. But we should be under no illusions that this is a tough challenge.”      Major Troop Contributing Countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Morocco, Rwanda, and South Africa, do not train their troops and commanders on how to fight corruption in mission environments before they deploy.      Corruption drives conflict and instability; it provides financing for organised criminal groups, leads to public distrust in state institutions and intervention forces, and can lead to violent extremism. Corruption poses a direct threat to the successful implementation of peacekeeping mandates. ||||| KINSHASA (Reuters) - The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Democratic Republic of Congo said late on Friday that it has received allegations of sexual abuse against Tanzanian peacekeepers based in Congo’s northeast, the latest in a series of such accusations against U.N. forces.      The mission said in a statement that it received the allegations against members of its Force Intervention Brigade, tasked with offensive operations, in the village of Mavivi on March 23 and immediately launched an investigation.      “Initial results suggest that there is evidence of transactional sex and sex with minors,” the statement said. “There are also a number of paternity claims.”      The statement did not say how many cases of abuse had been alleged or provide any further details about the accusations.      U.N. peacekeeping missions have been beset by accusations of sexual abuse. The United Nations reported 99 such allegations against staff members across the U.N. system last year.      The United Nations said this week that it has expanded an investigation into new allegations of sexual abuse by foreign peacekeepers in Central African Republic. U.N. officials said they have interviewed some 108 alleged victims, most of them minors.      The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, which was initially put in place during a civil war that took place in 1998-2003, is the world’s largest, with around 20,000 uniformed personnel.      The Security Council renewed its mandate earlier this week for one year. |||||","output":"The United Nations (UN) has announced an investigation into fresh allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, largely against minors, by foreign peacekeepers in the Central African Republic (CAR) between 2013 and 2015.

Passage: Merivale was the second son of John Herman Merivale (1770–1844) and Louisa Heath Drury, daughter of Joseph Drury, headmaster of Harrow. He was educated at Harrow School under George Butler from 1818 to 1824, where his chief schoolfriends were Charles Wordsworth and Richard Chenevix Trench. He took part in the Eton versus Harrow cricket match in 1824. In 1824 he was offered a post in the Indian civil service, and went for a short time to Haileybury College, where he did well in Oriental languages. Deciding against an Indian career, he went up to St John's College, Cambridge in 1826. Among other distinctions he came out as fourth classic in 1830, and in 1833 was elected fellow of St John's. He was a member of the Apostles' Club, his fellow-members including Tennyson, A. H. Hallam, Monckton Milnes, W. H. Thompson, Trench and James Spedding. Merivale was the main protagonist on the Cambridge side in instigating the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race held at Henley on Thames in 1829. He rowed at number four in the Cambridge boat in the race which Oxford won.  Link Information: Joseph Drury (11 February 1750 – 9 January 1834) Question: How old was Charles' maternal grandfather when his father was born? A:","output":"To find the answer, we need to use the information provided in the passage and the linked information. From the passage, we know that Charles Merivale's father, John Herman Merivale, was born in 1770. Charles' mother is Louisa Heath Drury, and her father is Joseph Drury. From the linked information, we know that Joseph Drury was born on 11 February 1750. Now, we need to find how old Joseph Drury was when John Herman Merivale was born in 1770. To calculate Joseph Drury's age at that time: 1770 (John's birth year) - 1750 (Joseph's birth year) = 20 So, Charles' maternal grandfather, Joseph Drury, was 20 years old when his father, John Herman Merivale, was born."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: where is ciliated epithelial tissue found in the body??","output":"Ciliated epithelial tissue is a specialized type of tissue found in various locations throughout the human body, characterized by the presence of hair-like structures called cilia on their surface. These cilia play a crucial role in numerous processes, such as filtering and moving substances, and supporting the respiratory function. The following are some major areas where ciliated epithelial tissue can be found in the body: 1. Respiratory System - One of the most significant locations of the ciliated epithelial tissue in the human body is the respiratory system. It lines the airways such as trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The ciliated epithelium in the respiratory system is typically composed of pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells, featuring microscopic cilia on their surface. These cilia function to move and filter mucus, dust, and other foreign particles trapped in the mucus layer, helping to keep the airways clean and free of any debris and germs. Eventually, the mucus is either coughed up or swallowed and digested in the stomach, preventing infections that could arise from the build-up of pathogens. 2. Female Reproductive System - In the female reproductive system, ciliated epithelial tissue is found lining the fallopian tubes (oviducts). This tissue features both ciliated and non-ciliated columnar epithelial cells. The presence of cilia in the oviduct plays a critical role in moving the ovum (egg) from the ovary to the uterus. The coordinated motion of the cilia, along with the muscular contractions of the fallopian tubes, helps facilitate the journey of the ovum as well as the sperm during fertilization. 3. Male Reproductive System - The epididymis, part of the male reproductive system involved in sperm maturation and storage, is also lined with ciliated epithelial tissue. The ciliated epithelium in the epididymis is composed of pseudostratified columnar cells with cilia and stereocilia that play a fundamental role in supporting the movement and absorption of testicular fluid and nutrients, which aids in sperm maturation and transport. 4. Ventricles of the Brain - Ciliated epithelial cells are found in the ependymal layer that lines the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. The cilia help in the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is vital for proper brain functioning. The motion of cilia ensures the appropriate circulation and distribution of CSF through the brain, providing nutrients, removing waste products, and cushioning the nervous system structures. 5. Nasal Cavity - Ciliated epithelium can also be found in the nasal cavity, specifically in the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages. Similar to the respiratory tract, the cilia found in the nasal cavity help to clear mucus secretions and filter out any foreign particles and pathogens, thereby maintaining proper respiratory hygiene and preventing infections. In summary, ciliated epithelial tissue plays crucial roles in several human body functions. It is primarily found in the respiratory system, female and male reproductive systems, ventricles of the brain, and the nasal cavity. These tissues perform essential tasks like moving and filtering substances, protecting against infections, and facilitating important biological processes, making them vital components of the human body's overall function."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Israel in Crisis - Army Leaderless It was one of those things that while not technically illegal was as the editor of the Salt Lake City Tribune once said, “much like drinking water from a toilet bowl, dumb, distasteful and when observed embarrassing.” A land grab cost Maj. General Yoav Galant the top job in Israel’s Army and a reputation earned over more than 3 decades of military service. Like a lot of scandals it started with something that was unsavory behavior; the actual nail in the coffin was lying about it. Essentially, a few years ago, he built a big very fancy house, a parking lot, and some other stuff on a large plot of land. Only problem is he didn’t technically own all of the land. According to reports here he exploited a very complicated part of Israeli law that allowed him build on the land 2-years-ago the media picked up the story but it was confusing and nobody really cared. The government however launched an investigation into what happened and according to the Special Prosecutor in the case Galant lied. Again nobody said much until Defense Minister Ehud Barak appointed Galant “Chief of Staff,” the Israeli Military’s top job. The media went crazy looking into exactly what happened with that house, the land, and the parking lot. How could someone have the Military’s top job who couldn’t tell the truth about his house? Nobody had a good answer for that and finally the Prime Minister stepped in and pulled the nomination. Now comes a major problem. Galant was supposed to take office February 14th. The current Chief of Staff has to leave February 14th. That wouldn’t be a huge problem ordinarily but right now isn’t an ordiary time in the Middle East. On Israel’s southern boarder the Jewish State’s most important ally, Egypt, is descending into chaos. On the Northern border, Hezbollah just took over Lebanon and to the East King Abdullah is fighting to keep control of Jordan. 12 days from now Israel’s Military will be leaderless. Either problem isn’t good but combining the crisis in the Middle East and the crisis of not being able to simply tell the truth has Israel in a rather precarious stop. Of course, Barak could take over, he is a military hero, as is his boss the Prime Minister but this isn’t wartime, yet, so they named a new guy. They are going to the bench, pulling out from retirement the General that Barak passed over when he named his friend Galant as Chief of Staff. Wonder what his house looks like? What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text highlights a significant crisis in Israel's military leadership and the country's geopolitical context. The central issue is the dismissal of Maj. General Yoav Galant from consideration for \\"Chief of Staff\\" - the top post in Israel’s Army - due to personal scandals. Galant's reputation was marred by a scandal where he reportedly exploited a complicated law to build property on land he did not own, lying about it when questioned during investigations. When the media picked up on this story, public outcry escalated, forcing the Prime Minister to withdraw Galant's nomination. The timing of the crisis becomes particularly problematic as Israel's military would be without a designated leader amidst a turbulent geopolitical environment. Countries around Israel, such as Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan, are going through their respective crises, adding urgency and concern to the leadership vacuum within the Israeli military. The scheduled transition on February 14th is further complicated by Galant's withdrawal. The text ends by hinting at a potential solution, where Israel is considering bringing back a retired general, passed over in favor of Galant, to take on the role of Chief of Staff. However, this situation has left Israel in a precarious position, as evidenced by the complicated circumstances surrounding Galant's botched installation and the search for a replacement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Prior to creating the Asterix series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series Oumpah-pah, which was published in Tintin (magazine) magazine. Astérix was originally serialised in Pilote magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959. In 1961 the first book was put together, titled Asterix the Gaul. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966s Asterix and the Big Fight sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days. How many more of the fifth book were sold than the fourth and first combined?","output":"To determine how many more of the fifth book were sold than the combined sales of the first and fourth books, we first need to identify the sales figures for each book. 1. The first book, \\"Asterix the Gaul\\": 6,000 copies sold. 2. The fourth book: 150,000 copies sold. 5. The fifth book: 300,000 copies sold. Now, we need to calculate the combined sales of the first and fourth books: First book sales + Fourth book sales = 6,000 + 150,000 = 156,000 copies. Next, we subtract the combined sales of the first and fourth books from the sales of the fifth book to see how many more copies of the fifth book were sold: Fifth book sales - (First book + Fourth book sales) = 300,000 - 156,000 = 144,000 more copies.

In 1514, Sultan Selim I, nicknamed \\"the Grim\\" because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis (Qizilbash), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that \\"the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\"[page needed] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East, especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which included much of the region. With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389). The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France.

Turkish people (), or the Turks (), also known as Anatolian Turks (), are a Turkic ethnic group and nation living mainly in Turkey and speaking Turkish, the most widely spoken Turkic language. They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the speakers of Turkic languages. Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire. In addition, a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe.  The ethnonym \\"Turk\\" may be first discerned in Herodotus' (c. 484–425 BC) reference to Targitas, first king of the Scythians; furthermore, during the first century AD., Pomponius Mela refers to the \\"Turcae\\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \\"Tyrcae\\" among the people of the same area. The first definite references to the \\"Turks\\" come mainly from Chinese sources in the sixth century. In these sources, \\"Turk\\" appears as \\"Tujue\\" (), which referred to the Göktürks. Although \\"Turk\\" refers to Turkish people, it may also sometimes refer to the wider language group of Turkic peoples.  In the 19th century, the word \\"Türk\\" only referred to Anatolian villagers. The Ottoman ruling class identified themselves as Ottomans, not usually as Turks. In the late 19th century, as the Ottoman upper classes adopted European ideas of nationalism the term \\"Türk\\" took on a much more positive connotation. The Turkish-speakers of Anatolia were the most loyal supporters of Ottoman rule. Answer the following questions: 1. What did the word \\"Türk\\" refer to in the 19th century? 2.

Rowling was much lower on the Forbes list. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Wealth of Words: E.L. James Outshines J.K. Rowling in Earnings Introduction: When it comes to the world of literature, few names are as instantly recognizable as J.K. Rowling, the mastermind behind the Harry Potter series. However, it seems that the world of wizardry and witchcraft may have been outshone by a controversial contender: E.L. James, the author of the \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" trilogy. In an interesting twist, James tops the charts with her estimated earnings of 95 million this year, while Rowling trails behind. Step 1 - Compare the earnings of the authors: E.L. James has had a blockbuster year, raking in a whopping 95 million, according to estimates compiled by Forbes. This staggering figure demonstrates the immense financial success of her \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" series, which caters to an adult demographic. On the other hand, J.K. Rowling, who created one of the most successful children's book franchises of all time, has earned a comparatively lower total this year, placing her further down on the Forbes list. Step 2 - Highlight the controversial nature of \\"50 Shades of Grey\\": \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is no stranger to controversy, with its explicit content and tumultuous relationships far from traditional storylines. Nevertheless, the series has resonated with millions of readers worldwide, resulting in its financial success. It questions whether the nature of this work and its far-reaching impact has contributed to E.L. James surpassing the iconic J.K. Rowling in yearly earnings. Step 3 - Mention the adaptation of both series into other forms of media: Both the \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" and the Harry Potter series have transcended their books, spawning successful film adaptations. The \\"50 Shades\\" movies, featuring tantalizing chemistry between protagonists Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, have seen box office success. Similarly, the Harry Potter films attracted hordes of avid fans and carried a worldwide appeal, yet Rowling's earnings this year do not match that of James. Step 4 - Suggest possible reasons for the disparity in earnings: It's hard to pin down an exact reason for E.L. James' greater earnings compared to J.K. Rowling. Some factors that could contribute to this disparity include James' grip on the adult demographic, the film adaptation's earnings, and the timing of her book releases. Additionally, J.K. Rowling's philanthropy may also play a role in her lower earnings, as she is known for her generous donations to various charitable causes. Conclusion: In conclusion, the overwhelming success of E.L. James and \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" has led her to outshine J.K. Rowling in terms of earnings this year. While the Harry Potter series remains a beloved classic, the adult-focused and controversial nature of James' books may have played a part in her fascinating rise to the top of the literary world. As the world of literature expands and evolves, it will be intriguing to see whether authors such as E.L. James continue to hold their places on the list or if other newcomers rise to challenge the status quo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh, or the king. He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids. The \\"Cups and Balls\\" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today. The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic. Actually, one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests  even built magic devices into their temples. These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues' mouths. This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful. Magic, however, was not well accepted before the 1800s. Magicians were thought of as freaks  and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people's views and attitudes about magic. It was also because of Robert Houdin that many magicians were able to add Dr. or MD to their names. Today magicians try hard to find new ways to show their practiced skills. Magic is now entertainment for families all over the world. Question: Which of the following statements is true? Options: A: Magic began about 3,700 years ago.

Question: While attending the garden party, how is Holmes disguised? Movie plot title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The picture begins with Moriarty and Holmes verbally sparring on the steps outside the Old Bailey where Moriarty has just been acquitted on a charge of murder due to lack of evidence. Holmes remarks, \\"You've a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it, pickled in alcohol, to the London Medical Society\\". \\"It would make an impressive exhibit\\", replies Moriarty. Later Holmes and Watson are visited at 221B Baker Street by Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino). She tells him that her brother Lloyd has received a strange note - a drawing of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck - identical to one received by her father just before his brutal murder ten years before. Holmes deduces that the note is a warning and rushes to find Lloyd Brandon. However he is too late, as Lloyd has been murdered by being strangled and having his skull crushed. Holmes investigates and attends a garden party, disguised as a music-hall entertainer, where he correctly believes an attempt will be made on Ann's life. Hearing her cries from a nearby park he captures her assailant, who turns out to be Gabriel Mateo, out for revenge on the Brandons for the murder of his father by Ann's father in a dispute over ownership of their South American mine. His murder weapon was a bolas. Mateo also reveals that it was Moriarty who urged him to seek revenge. Holmes realises that Moriarty is using the case as a distraction from his real crime, a crime that will stir the British Empire - an attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. Holmes rushes to the Tower of London to prevent the crime, and during a struggle Moriarty falls, presumably to his death. In the end, Ann is married and Holmes tries to shoo a fly by playing his violin, only to have Watson swat it with his newspaper remarking, \\"Elementary, my dear Holmes, elementary.\\"[3] A:","output":"While attending the garden party, Holmes is disguised as a music-hall entertainer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: A storm is brewing in the northeastern Pacific basin. This storm has resulted in a cyclone. The radius of outermost closed isobar is measured to be 1.5 degrees of latitude.  and a hint : There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft).  Please answer this question : Given the cyclone increases in size will the measurement of its outermost isobar have increased or decreased?","output":"If the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its outermost isobar will also increase. This is because the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI) is one of the metrics used to measure the size of a storm. As the storm expands and covers a larger area, the outermost isobar that encloses the region experiencing a specific atmospheric pressure will also expand, resulting in an increased radius. An increase in the ROCI signifies that the cyclone's influence is extending over a larger area, and it is also indicative of the overall size of the storm system. In general, larger storms can impact more significant areas for more extended periods, thereby leading to potentially higher damage caused by intense winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. To summarize, given that the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its outermost closed isobar will also increase, reflecting the expansion of the storm system and its potential impact on larger areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.

We're solving this equation: -143 * d + 3916 = 1342 for 'd'. It might look a bit scary, but we'll do it together. First, we want to move the numbers without 'd' to the other side of the equation. So, let's subtract 3916 from both sides: -143 * d = 1342 - 3916 Now, to subtract these numbers, it goes like this:      1342  - 3916 _______  - 2574  So we have: -143 * d = -2574 Finally, we want to find 'd'. To do that, we need to get rid of the -143 that's multiplying 'd'. Let's divide both sides by -143: d = -2574 / -143 When we divide two negative numbers, we get a positive result: d = 18 And there we have it! The answer is d = 18.

They not only disturb our peace, but may also pose security threats in some instances. Fortunately, modern smartphone technology has made it relatively easy for users to block numbers and take back control of their privacy. In this article, we'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to block a number using the Phone or Text app on your device. Step 1: Open the Phone or Text app To start the process, locate and open the Phone or Text app on your smartphone. Both apps come pre-installed on almost all smartphones and are usually found on the home screen or within the app drawer. Step 2: Open a call or text message from the number you want to block In the Phone app, navigate to the 'Recent calls' tab or 'Call history' section. Scroll through the list of recent calls and find the number you wish to block. If you're using the Text app, open the conversation thread containing the unwanted text messages from the number you want to block.

This will open a context menu that gives you access to more options. Step 4: Tap People Options (for text messages only) If you are blocking a number from text messages, you'll need to tap on the 'People Options' button at this stage. This button might be labeled differently depending on the device or messaging app version you are using. Some common alternatives include 'Message Options,' 'Details,' or 'Chat Settings.'

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.

Understand the task: You need to classify the sentiment of a given response into one of the four categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Mixed (if the response contains both positive and negative sentiment). 2. Read the 'poster' sentence to get the context: \\"Mahalo nui loa to the Hawai'i Construction Alliance for your endorsement of Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard! -TeamTulsi\\" 3.

Check the package insert that came with your medication. If diarrhea or any changes in bowel frequency are listed as possible side effects, consult your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms.  Adderall has diarrhea listed as a side effect. Metformin, a common medication for diabetes, also cause significant diarrhea.  Check with your doctor if you are having significant GI symptoms while on metformin. Other common medications can cause diarrhea, including misoprostol, laxatives, and stool softeners. Alcohol can also cause diarrhea and may exacerbate bowel-related medical conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Stress may contribute to increased bowel movement frequency and can cause diarrhea. People often feel anxious about relationships, finances, education exams, or other big life events.  Avoid the stressors you are able to avoid. This can include changing your plans to avoid areas of high traffic, or avoiding a particularly difficult coworker. Treat your time as valuable. Learn to say no when someone asks you to help with a last-minute deadline or other activity that you really just don’t have time for. Communicate with respect. If your neighbor is running a basketball tournament out of their house and creating a traffic snarl in your neighborhood, politely ask the person to change their behavior. Perhaps they could encourage parents to carpool or park farther away. Be up front about how much time you can allocate to a project, conversation, or other activity. For example, if your coworker rushes up to you just as you’re about to leave for a meeting, politely tell them that you only have 5 minutes to listen. Forgive and move forward. Staying angry and holding a grudge takes energy – your energy. Talk with the person who has wronged you and honestly express your feelings. Know that their answer may or may not be what you want to hear. Sometimes shrugging your shoulders and moving on is the best thing you can do for you. Be adaptable and flexible. As important as it is to have a plan for many things, life always throws us curveballs.

This article: At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989.

Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \\"Amazing\\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.  - Hugo Gernsback (August 16, 1884  August 19, 1967), born Hugo Gernsbacher, was a Luxembourgish-American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine. His contributions to the genre as publisher were so significant that, along with the novelists H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes called \\"The Father of Science Fiction\\". In his honour, annual awards presented at the World Science Fiction Convention are named the \\"Hugos\\".  - Lloyd Arthur Eshbach (June 20, 1910  October 29, 2003) was an American science fiction fan, publisher and writer, secular and religious publisher, and minister.  - Experimenter Publishing was an American media company founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1915. The first magazine was \\"The Electrical Experimenter\\" (19131931) and the most notable magazines were \\"Radio News\\" (19191985) and \\"Amazing Stories\\" (19262005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones.  - Edward Elmer Smith (also E. E. Smith, E. E. Smith, Ph.D., E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith, Doc Smith, \\"Skylark\\" Smith, orto his familyTed; May 2, 1890  August 31, 1965) was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and an early science-fiction author, best known for the \\"Lensman\\" and \\"Skylark\\" series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera.  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Skylark Three is a science fiction novel by author Edward E. Smith , Ph.D. , the second in his Skylark series . Originally serialized through the Amazing Stories magazine in 1930 , it was first collected in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press .  - Fantasy Press was an American publishing house specialising in fantasy and science fiction titles. Established in 1946 by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach in Reading, Pennsylvania, it was most notable for publishing the works of authors such as Robert A. Heinlein and E. E. Smith. One of its more notable offerings was the Lensman series.

Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa,  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the drink made from sorghum and urwagwa in the cuisine that is based on local staple foods?, what is it ?

A billion-dollar oil company, headed by Sumner Murdock, sets forth on an exploration project in the North Pole that is recommended and managed by Michael Baldwin. The film opens with several dynamite blasts to break up the ice that's clogging up the deep-sea drilling rigs.  Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves.  He explains that while their activities at \\"Site A\\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \\"Site B\\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts.  Assuming that Ed was just hired to pull off a practical joke, Baldwin bursts into uncontrollable laughter. The next day, Ed arrives at the Baldwins' house in a modified World War II-era snowcat, explaining that he intends to take Michael and his family to North Pole City to prove that Santa Claus is real and reveal the damage that is being done.

Goal: To mix pumpkin and egg together, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"In order to mix pumpkin and egg together, there are multiple methods that can be employed based on the intended use of the mixture, such as incorporating the mixture into a recipe or creating a unique blend of flavors and textures. Considering that you have not specified a specific recipe or purpose, I will provide two reasonable methods: one for a cooked mixture and one for a raw mixture. Method 1: Cooked Pumpkin and Egg Mixture (Suitable for baked goods and dishes like pumpkin omelets) 1. Firstly, prepare the pumpkin by peeling and dicing it into small cubes. If you are using canned pumpkin puree, make sure to have it ready and measured. 2. In a mixing bowl, crack open the required number of eggs. Ensure that there are no eggshells in the bowl. 3. Whisk the eggs until the yolks and whites are well combined. 4. If you are using diced pumpkin, you may need to precook the pumpkin. You can do this by either boiling or steaming the diced pumpkin until it is tender. Alternatively, the pumpkin can be cooked in a skillet over medium heat with a small amount of oil or butter, stirring occasionally, until it is soft. 5. Once the pumpkin is cooked, fold it into the whisked eggs, making sure the mixture is evenly combined. 6. If working with pumpkin puree, you can simply add the puree directly to the whisked eggs, combining thoroughly. 7. If you're using this mixture in a recipe, such as a pumpkin omelet or a breakfast scramble, you can now cook the mixture per the recipe's instructions.  Method 2: Raw Pumpkin and Egg Mixture (Suitable for recipes like pumpkin pancakes, waffles, and smoothies) 1. For this method, it is strongly recommended to use pumpkin puree, as it makes it easier to mix with raw eggs. If using fresh pumpkin, cut and remove the skin, and then blend the pumpkin to create a puree. 2. In a mixing bowl, crack open the required number of eggs. Ensure that there are no eggshells in the bowl. 3. Whisk the eggs until the yolks and whites are combined. 4. Add the pumpkin puree into the whisked eggs, making sure to measure out the necessary quantity your recipe requires. 5. Mix both ingredients thoroughly, ensuring a consistent and smooth mixture. 6. Your raw pumpkin and egg mixture is now ready to be used in the recipes of your choice, such as pumpkin pancakes, waffles, muffins, or even in smoothies. Both methods have their benefits and are suited to specific culinary purposes. Method 1 offers a cooked pumpkin and egg combination, which is ideal for incorporating into recipes like omelets or scrambles, whereas Method 2 provides a raw mixture of pumpkin and egg, making it perfect for use in recipes like pancakes, waffles, and smoothies.

Dorothea Jordan, born as Dorothea Bland, was a renowned Irish actress and social figure famous for her numerous stage performances in comedies and tragedies. Dorothea Jordan was born in 1761 and commenced her acting career in her late teens. She met King William IV, then known as the Duke of Clarence, sometime around 1790, and the two began a long-term relationship that lasted for nearly two decades. Together, they had ten illegitimate children, who adopted the surname 'FitzClarence' – a compound derived from the Latin word 'filius', meaning 'son', and the Duke's title 'Clarence.' Their first child, born in 1794, was given the name George FitzClarence; Henry FitzClarence was their fourth child, born in 1801. Throughout their relationship, Dorothea maintained her acting career, and King William IV provided financial support for her and their children. Their relationship eventually came to an end in 1811, and shortly afterward, Dorothea Jordan moved to France to escape her financial problems in England. She was living in a precarious financial situation and was further burdened by debts incurred by her adult children from her first marriage. Unfortunately, Dorothea Jordan's situation deteriorated, and she died in poverty in Saint-Cloud, near Paris, France. The exact date of her death is debated; however, it is generally agreed that she passed away sometime in July 1816. In summary, Henry FitzClarence's mother, Dorothea Jordan, died in the year 1816. The details of her life not only reveal her personal challenges but also provide insights into the broader social context of the late 18th and early 19th centuries in England and France, as well as into the lives of the illegitimate children of British royalty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy.        Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines.        In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books.        Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources.        Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market.        The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades.

Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006.

[b]. boots were made of superior material..","output":"The thief was able to be sneaky in the boots, but not in the sandals, because the boots were made of superior material. This choice of footwear made all the difference in the success of his various heists and schemes, as it allowed him to navigate quietly and efficiently through different environments without drawing any attention to himself. The boots that the thief chose not only had the advantage of being made of superior material, but they were also tailored to his specific needs. Made with fine and supple leather, they perfectly molded to his feet, allowing him to move comfortably and without any restrictions. The leather, being of high-quality, also helped muffle the sound of his footsteps as it cushioned the impact of his stride on the ground. The soles of the boots were another key feature, designed with a flexible yet robust rubber material that provided excellent traction and grip, enabling the thief to swiftly scale walls and traverse slippery surfaces with ease. Furthermore, the boots were crafted with impeccable precision and attention to detail, ensuring not only a perfect fit but also a sleek and inconspicuous appearance. The color of the boots was carefully chosen to blend in seamlessly with the shadowy corners and alleyways that the thief often found himself navigating. With every step, the boots seemed to meld into the darkness, leaving no trace of the thief's presence behind. On the other hand, the sandals could not provide the same level of stealth and dexterity that the boots did. While they might have been made from a sturdy and high-quality material, such as a reinforced canvas or durable rubber, the inherent design of the sandals left much to be desired when it came to sneaking around unnoticed. Sandals, by nature, exposed the wearer's feet, making them more susceptible to injury or discomfort when traversing rough terrain or encountering sharp objects. Additionally, the construction of the sandals, with open gaps between the straps, created numerous opportunities for unexpected and unwelcome noise. The straps themselves, no matter how well-made, could rub against the wearer's foot, producing an audible sound that, in the thief's world, could mean the difference between a successful heist and being caught red-handed. Moreover, the general lack of padding or cushioning in the soles of most sandals meant that the thief's footsteps would likely be more pronounced when moving about on various surfaces. In the end, it was the boots, with their superior material and thoughtful design, that proved to be the ideal footwear choice for the thief. He knew that without them, his ability to effectively execute his clandestine operations would be significantly hindered or even impossible. The boots were a symbol of the thief's commitment to his craft, a reminder that even the smallest details can be the difference between success and failure in the world of thieves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: President Barack Obama launched his 2012 reelection campaign on Monday morning with a video testimonial from voters posted on his website and an email to supporters, echoing his innovative and oft-copied 2008 kickoff.      By inaugurating what could be the first 1 billion campaign in history so early, Obama has gotten the jump on a scattered GOP field reluctant to take the plunge and hits the starting line months earlier than George W. Bush did for his 2004 reelection bid.      Text Size -      +      reset VIDEO: Allen on Obama 2012 VIDEO: W.H. on 2012 POLITICO 44      The video – entitled “It Begins With Us” – is an effort to rekindle the grassroots fervor that propelled Obama into office and seemed to be a tacit acknowledgement that many of his supporters have been disappointed by the stuttering pace of change and the compromises Obama has made in the last two-and-half years.      The two-minute clip features a series of interviews with voters from around the country explaining why they plan to support the president. It doesn’t include Obama’s voice or any new film footage of him. But it was quickly followed by an Obama email in which the president explained the early start to the campaign.      “We’re doing this now because the politics we believe in does not start with expensive TV ads or extravaganzas, but with you — with people organizing block-by-block, talking to neighbors, co-workers, and friends,” Obama writes, explaining why the launch is coming more than 19 months before Election Day.      “And that kind of campaign takes time to build.”      Today’s announcement puts Obama well ahead of any potential Republican opponent in making his intentions clear. The lack of a clear GOP frontrunner so late in the cycle and the unwillingness of any potential opponent to commit is seen as a mixed blessing by Obama’s political brain trust.      On one hand, Republican disunity is always a plus for a sitting Democrat. On the other hand, the lack of an opponent forces the president to have a conversation about himself with himself – denying him the chance to contrast his record with that of a living, breathing conservative foil.      The launch also comes at middling moment of the Obama presidency. The economy is rebounding but still bad; Afghanistan and Iraq are winding down but Obama has accepted an ill-defined new mission in Libya; and the polls show him in the 42-to-48 percent approval range, basically where he’s been for most of his time in the White House.      Yet both the video and email offer a clear preview of Obama’s 2012 strategy, a hybrid of let-me-finish-the-job optimism combined with a warning about what the country would look like in the hands of a Republican president.      Nearly absent from Monday’s rhetoric is the “hope and change” theme that dominated Obama’s effort for four years ago – a recognition that the meme just wouldn’t float after his failure to deliver on some of his more high profile promises from 2008 such as closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, passing immigration reform, attacking global warming and ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan more quickly.      And the video made a conspicuous bow to independent voters who are unhappy with what Obama has done. “I don’t agree with Obama on everything, but I respect him and I trust him,” a man identified only as Ed from North Carolina says in the video.      Obama’s fundraising team has already had to answer a lot of tough questions in “listening” sessions around the country with top donors. And Obama himself tackles the issue of disaffection head-on in his statement.      “We’ve always known that lasting change wouldn’t come quickly or easily. It never does,” he writes. “But as my administration and folks across the country fight to protect the progress we’ve made — and make more — we also need to begin mobilizing for 2012, long before the time comes for me to begin campaigning in earnest.” ||||| It's official: President Barack Obama will run for reelection in 2012.      The president's intention to seek another term was announced in a video sent to supporters via email and text message on Monday. Over the weekend, multiple outlets reported that the launch of Obama's reelection campaign was imminent.      By filing papers with the Federal Election Commission, the president can begin fundraising for his 2012 operation. In 2008, Obama secured a staggering 750 million in his bid for the White House. ABC News reports that some believe he \\"may cross the threshold and could become the first 1 billion presidential candidate\\" next year.      Jim Messina will serve as campaign manager for Obama's reelection effort. He worked as deputy chief of staff to the president for two years until last January. Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post notes that many of the names who helped Obama win in 2008 will be on board to advance his second presidential campaign.      The president's 2012 headquarters will be based at One Prudential Plaza in Chicago. The location sits just a few blocks away from where he gave his victory speech in 2008 at Grant Park.      On Monday morning the Obama For America website greeted visitors, \\"This campaign is just kicking off. We're opening up offices, unpacking boxes, and starting a conversation with supporters like you to help shape our path to victory.\\" The site also includes a store with Obama-Biden stickers and apparel for sale.

(CNN) -- Soraya Bahgat, a Cairo-based HR executive and postgraduate student, was on her way to join Tahrir Square protests on November 25 when an unwelcome thought stopped her in her tracks. Mobs in the square had sexually assaulted women protesters there a week earlier, and reports of such incidents had become common enough for her to fear a repeat occurrence. \\"A panic attack gripped me and prevented me from going because I thought no woman should go through this,\\" said the 29-year-old. \\"It was almost two years since the Lara Logan incident,\\" she said, referring to the harrowing sexual attack on the CBS correspondent by a mob in Tahrir Square.","output":"The sentence ends with the account of Soraya Bahgat's thoughts and feelings on that day, highlighting the fear and high-risk situation for women protesters in Tahrir Square due to repeated incidents of sexual assaults. The article continues by explaining how Bahgat took matters into her own hands to address the issue of safety for women protesters. She founded an organization called Tahrir Bodyguard, which comprised of volunteers wearing bright yellow vests to form protective rings around female protesters and prevent sexual harassment. The group's presence acted as a deterrent to potential perpetrators, and they worked in collaboration with other organizations like Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment and Assault, which provided medical and psychological support to the victims. A broader discussion addressing the prevalence of sexual harassment in Egypt at the time commenced. Demonstrations and protests in public spaces had often empowered men to take advantage of vulnerable situations, and it was reported that over 99% of Egyptian women had experienced some form of harassment. The Egyptian government's lack of action and strict consequences for sexual harassment offenders further exacerbated the issue. In 2014, Egypt introduced new laws that specifically criminalized sexual harassment and enforced harsher penalties on convicted harassers, yet many believe that the real change can only come from society's attitude toward women and the need for respect, understanding, and consent in every interaction. Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of women-focused organizations, like Tahrir Bodyguard and Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment and Assault, in providing much-needed support, safety measures, and awareness about the rampant issue of sexual harassment in Egypt. It is through such collective efforts that change can be initiated and sustained, allowing women to feel safe and exercise their rights to free speech and peaceful protest without the fear of being harassed or assaulted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was raised in rural Kentucky and lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her widely known works include \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\", the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and \\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\", a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally.  - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\".  - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.  - In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - Phonaesthetics (from the \\"phn\\", \\"voice-sound\\"; and \\"aisthtik\\", \\"aesthetics\\") is the study of the inherent pleasantness (euphony) or unpleasantness (cacophony) of the sound of certain words, phrases, and sentences.  - The PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction, formerly known as the Bellwether Prize for Fiction is a biennial award given by the PEN American Center and Barbara Kingsolver to a U.S. citizen for a previously unpublished work of fiction that address issues of social justice. The prize was established by noted author Barbara Kingsolver, and is funded by her. Winning authors receive a 25,000 award and a publishing contract, from which they receive royalties.   - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  - Marjorie Kowalski Cole ( July 20 , 1953 -- December 4 , 2009 ) was a writer of poetry , short stories and novels . She won the 2004 Bellwether Prize ( for previously unpublished works of fiction which address issues of social justice ) with her first novel Correcting the Landscape .  - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.  - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.  - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities.  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - JUSTICE is a human rights and law reform organisation based in the United Kingdom. It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, the international human rights organisation of lawyers devoted to the legal protection of human rights worldwide. Consequently, members of JUSTICE are predominantly barristers and solicitors, judges, legal academics, and law students.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - PEN America Center (PEN), founded in 1922 and based in New York City, works to advance literature, to defend free expression, and to foster international literary fellowship. The Center has a membership of 3,300 writers, editors, and translators. PEN America Center is the largest of the 144 centers that belong to PEN International, the worldwide association of writers that defends those who are harassed, imprisoned and killed for their views. PEN America Center is one of two PEN centers located in the USA, the other is PEN Center USA in Los Angeles, it covers the USA west of the Mississippi.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.  - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.  - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.    What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'marjorie kowalski cole'?

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.

The Welsh Lib Dems want to replace tuition fee subsidies of up to £5,190 a year with maintenance grants of £2,500. Ms Williams said the policy was more affordable than the current system. The Lib Dems' own review of their 2015 general election defeat cited the U-turn on tuition fees as one of the reasons for their collapse from 57 seats in 2010 to eight. Taking questions from an audience on the BBC's Ask the Leader programme, Ms Williams said: \\"I can't get away from the terrible mistake my party made in the coalition in Westminster. \\"We made a promise which we could not keep, and that let people down. \\"It didn't matter that Labour introduced fees, [and] they'd raised them.

UKIP has said it would like to cut tuition fees, while the Greens have called for free university education across the UK. Summary:","output":"In a recent BBC TV election special, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams discussed the party's stance on tuition fees, describing the previous promise made by the party at Westminster as a \\"terrible mistake\\" that could not be kept. The Welsh Lib Dems now propose replacing tuition fee subsidies of up to £5,190 a year with maintenance grants of £2,500 for students, stating that this policy is more affordable than the current system. This change in policy comes in light of the party's general election defeat in 2015, where one of the reasons cited for their drop from 57 seats to eight was the U-turn on tuition fees. Regarding the new policy, Ms. Williams said it is crucial to be clear and upfront about what is affordable, avoiding making the same mistakes as the party's colleagues and offering a policy that is both affordable and deliverable. She emphasized that no student would be £2,000 a year worse off upfront, as the current support goes to institutions in England rather than directly to students. In comparison, Welsh Labour has decided against means testing for university tuition fee grants if the party stays in power after the upcoming election.

Article: THE EXPENDABLES: B      Meet “The Even Dirtier Dozen.” Everybody knows summer season is a big stupid-movie contest. But Sylvester Stallone’s “The Expendables” - or “Eat Shoot Kill” - is stupid and sort of fun. It’s a macho, hard-rocking, a**-kicking action movie that is completely over-the-top and unbelievably violent, but without being mean-spirited or overly sadistic in the way Stallone’s action films have often been.      In fact, it’s such dumb fun in a knuckle-dragging sort of way I think my friend the Incredible Hulk would like to say a few words about it. Go ahead Hulkie, the floor is yours.      “Hulk like ‘Expendables.’ It SMASH. Guns go BANG-BANG. Things go BOOM. Fire EVERYWHERE. Cars crash and make even MORE FIRE. HA-HA-HA. Hulk no like Rourke, though. Rourke NUTS.”      All right, Green Guy. That’s enough.      In “The Expendables,” Stallone, who also co-wrote the screenplay, plays a character who calls himself Barney Ross, while the aforementioned Mickey Rourke, fresh from his bit as the Russian villain in “Iron Man 2,” plays the all-too-appropriately-named Tool, a character whose entrance is an homage to “Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man” (1991).      Barney has so many tattoos he looks like he’s wearing a shirt when he isn’t. He has a cigar clamped permanently between his teeth, a ratty goatee and lots of guns. He’s also the seaplane-piloting head of a band of merry mercenaries.      They are martial-arts whiz Lee Christmas (the terrific Jason Statham), chopsocky typhoon Ying Yang (the legendary Jet Li), big lug Toll Road (Ultimate Fighting champion Randy Couture) and machine-shotgun-toting smart-aleck Hale Caesar (the always welcome and in one scene hilarious Terry Crews). Also along for the ride is Barney’s old pal Gunner (Stallone’s former screen rival Dolph Lundgren, looking like a mile of bad road).      These are the Expendables, a meaty amalgam of testosterone, hair dye, bad plastic surgery and firepower, and in an opening scene featuring dumb Somali pirates they blow a baddie in half.      Their latest mission, should they choose to accept it, is to bring down the fascist government of the tiny South American island of Vilena and rescue a hot local girl from the bad guys.      Chief among them is reptilian drug cartel head played by Eric Roberts, whose sister stars in the other big opener of the day “Eat Pray Love.” Dueling Roberts family values, anyone?      Trailers for “The Expendables” feature the appearance of Bruce Willis and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are in the film for about 30 seconds. In another scene, Stallone gets past a customs agent by claiming to be an ornithologist      In essence, “The Expendables” is John Irvin’s “The Dogs of War” (1980) meets Robert Aldrich’s “The Dirty Dozen” (1967), which is a good idea if you don’t have any ideas of your own. Plus, of course, Hulk likes “The Expendables.”      Things go BOOM.      Rated R. At AMC Loews Boston Common, Regal Fenway Stadium and suburban theaters.      (In addition to a frightening gallery of cosmetically altered faces, “The Expendables” is outrageously profane and violent.) ||||| How expendable is \\"The Expendables\\" ? That depends on who you are and why you're asking.If that sounds a little Zen-like, that's because the new action opera co-written and directed by and starring Sylvester Stallone exists in a \\"Twilight Zone\\" dimension of its own outside of normal critical time and space.In other words, if you want to see old-fashioned nonstop mayhem with stars so venerable that \\"The Leathernecks\\" (and I don't mean Marines) might be an alternative title, reviews are going to be superfluous. If you don't want to go, no review can change your mind. Certainly not this one.A cartoonish symphony of muscles, bullets, tattoos and cigars, \\"The Expendables\\" is so determinedly old-school that its brisk action and bracing explosions take place not in the real world but on a mythical South American island named Vilena. If it does nothing else, it will make you nostalgic for a time when its more august actors, including Bruce Willis and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in tiny cameos, were at least age-appropriate for their roles.With its roster of action stars listed on posters like a high-powered team of urologists — \\"Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Austin, Crews and Rourke\\" — \\"The Expendables\\" is also a place where lines like \\"Friends don't let friends die alone\\" and \\"Don't talk to me, cockroach\\" can find a happy home.\\"The Expendables,\\" in case you couldn't guess, are not urologists but top-of-the-line mercenaries whose motto is \\"If the money's right, we don't care what the job is.\\" Barney Ross (Stallone) is first among equals, followed by Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang ( Jet Li ), Gunnar Jensen ( Dolph Lundgren ), Toll Road (mixed martial artist Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). Names, like the rest of the film, not to be taken seriously.The gang is introduced by co-writers Stallone and David Callaham in a flashback involving the expeditious rescue of a group of hostages from Somali pirates. The Expendables turn out to have a penchant for bickering with one another, however, and Jensen has to be let go for attempting to murder a prisoner. They have standards after all.Back home, the gang members find themselves restive in civilian life. Christmas, a whiz with a knife, is especially irked that his girlfriend Lacy ( Charisma Carpenter ), inexplicably peeved at his disappearing for months at a time with zero explanation, has taken up with someone who's an even bigger lout than he is.So no one is unhappy when, in a scene that for no clear reason involves Schwarzenegger as yet another mercenary named Trench Mauser, the team gets offered a new job by the shadowy Mr. Church (Willis).The job means going down to that fictitious island and taking on not only the evil general who runs it (David Zayas) but also his nefarious American enabler (Eric Roberts) and his brutal right-hand man, Paine (Steve Austin).Ineptly disguised as members of the Global Wildlife Conservancy, Barney and Lee go down on a recon and find the island too hot for them to handle. The only bright spot is their local contact, the sultry Sandra (Giselle Itie), a woman with an agenda of her own. When Barney is forced to abandon Sandra in a tight spot, he vows to return.For the Expendables would have you understand that they are not just behemoths with biceps as big as the Ritz; they have hearts and souls and, yes, tarnished ideals. Their attitude is expressed by Mickey Rourke as Tool, a tattoo artist and retired Expendable who smokes a long-stemmed pipe and bemoans a woman whose suicide he walked away from years ago in Bosnia. Friends may not let friends die alone, but bogus philosophizing is apparently business as usual. ||||| Breaking out A-team for B-movie actioner      'THE EXPENDABLES' | Even Stallone & Co. can't stop this bomb      \\"The Expendables\\" is like no other movie I've seen this year.

Written by Dave Callaham and Stallone. Running time: 103 minutes. Rated R (for strong action and bloody violence throughout, and for some language). Opening today at local theaters.      And \\"The A-Team.\\"      All three of those films, and countless other entries in the genre, follow the same formula. You got your ragtag band of wisecracking, daredevil mercenaries who take on those suicidal missions no one in their right mind would even consider, and they never even blink as they pile up a body count numbering in the hundreds.      But hey, it's not about the money. It's never about the money. It's. What. They. Do. As the Voice-Over Guy in the trailer for \\"The Expendables\\" says, \\"It's the only life they've ever known.\\"      Well. I'm willing to bet it's not the life they knew in second grade, but you get the idea.      The reason I had reasonably high expectations for \\"The Expendables\\" as opposed to absolutely no expectations for \\"The A-Team,\\" is the cast, with Sylvester Stallone front and center, backed by an all-star action movie roster: everyone from Bruce Willis to Steve Austin to Mickey Rourke to Jet Li to Jason Statham to a cameo that would have been a lot more fun if they hadn't given it away in the trailer.      Too bad Stallone the director and co-writer couldn't have come up with a better vehicle for Stallone the aging action hero. \\"The Expendables\\" is a schlocky, tiresome, blood-spattered cliche of an action film -- the kind of movie with scene after scene pitting just a handful of anti-heroes against literally dozens of machinegun-wielding henchmen, and you know the henchmen don't stand a chance. Yawn. Take away the big-name cast, and this is the kind of straight-to-video movie you see buried in the bargain bins near the cash register at a convenience store, or playing on Channel 734 in the middle of the night.      The we've-seen-it-all-before plot has the frighteningly big-veined Stallone as Barney Ross, the leader of a gang of motorcycle-riding killing machines known as the Expendables. (Guess they knew \\"The Incredibles\\" was already taken.) I don't know how Barney got stuck with that vaudeville comic name, given that he runs with the likes of Gunnar Jensen (Stallone's old \\"Rocky IV\\" foe Dolph Lundgren), Yin Yang (Jet Li, still struggling with the English language), Toll Road (mixed martial arts star Randy Couture) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham). Not to mention Steve Austin as a pain-inflicting bad guy named Paine, and Mickey Rourke in all his wigged-out, whacked-out, perma-tanned, tattooed glory as Tool. That's right, Tool.      From the classic rock soundtrack to the wince-inducing puns to the unnecessary romantic detour, \\"The Expendables\\" follows the 1985 action-movie blueprint, with Ross leading a team of mercenaries hired by the CIA to take down a South American general-dictator and the American businessman (Eric Roberts) who's bankrolling the general's cocaine operation. \\"The Expendables\\" is at its campy best in scenes featuring those leather-skinned hams, Rourke or Roberts. (Too bad they don't have any scenes together.) In the midst of all the hard-R mayhem, Rourke has an extended closeup monologue in which he talks about how he lost what was left of his soul on a long-ago mission. It's either great or terrible acting, maybe a little of both.      And Roberts has a couple of priceless moments, including his commentary on the complications caused by the general's sexy rebel daughter: \\"Bad Shakespeare!\\" Uh-huh.      The violence in \\"The Expendables\\" is fast and furious, with Stallone favoring digital splatter moments from the Robert Rodriguez catalog, making you wince before you laugh at the gratuitous lunacy of it all. Heads explode, knives are lodged in necks and there's a lot of rapid-fire cutting during the endless parade of one-on-one battles. (In the middle of all that, there's an uncomfortably realistic water-boarding scene in which the general's daughter is tortured within an inch of her life. It's the movie's worst and ugliest moment.)      Stallone still has some charisma left, and all these guys know how to fight and how to deliver deadpan one-liners. But this is just a hyper-violent variation on \\"Grown-Ups.\\" Why get all these likable veteran actors together if you're just going to go through the motions? ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or key ideas in a story, article, video, or any other type of content.

The makers of The Coronation were able to tell Elizabeth where her father hid the most precious of the crown jewels during World War II, reports the BBC. The answer: inside a cookie tin. Specifically, a tin of Bath Oliver cookies, per the Washington Post. King George VI then ordered the tin itself buried under what was essentially an escape tunnel within Windsor Castle, just in case the Nazis invaded. The revelation came to light thanks to letters from the royal librarian to Queen Mary, the mother of George VI. Vanity Fair highlights other points from the documentary, including one from Elizabeth's childhood. It seems her father instructed her to write a report about his coronation, in order to help prepare her for her own in the future.

The Coronation, which aired on BBC One, offered viewers a glimpse into the history of the crown jewels, as well as the significance of the events surrounding the coronation ceremonies. During the course of the documentary, it is revealed that Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, had hidden the most valuable of the crown jewels during World War II in a decidedly unassuming location: a cookie tin. The personification of the saying, “the best hiding place is in plain sight,” this historical revelation reports that King George VI ordered the Bath Oliver cookie tin, which housed the precious jewels, to be secreted away within an escape tunnel at Windsor Castle. The king decided to take this course of action as a precautionary measure in case the Nazis were to invade England. The truth about the hiding place of these priceless artifacts came to light via a series of letters exchanged between the royal librarian and Queen Mary, the mother of King George VI. This hidden piece of history might have remained buried if not for the thorough research conducted by the makers of The Coronation. In addition to unveiling this fascinating secret, the documentary also delved into various aspects of the British monarchy. One such aspect was the experiences surrounding the coronations of previous kings and queens, with snippets of Queen Elizabeth's own account of her father's ceremony. In preparation for her future role as the monarch, King George VI had instructed his young daughter to write a report about his coronation. She highlighted the more tedious parts of the service, saying, \\"At the end the service got rather boring as it was all prayers,\\" followed by an anecdote about how she and her grandmother were counting the pages left, amused to find that the word \\"Finis\\" finally appeared at the end. The documentary provides an intimate and rare look at the inner workings of the royal family, and the lengths they have gone to in order to protect the precious symbols of their monarchy. It also underscores Queen Elizabeth's deep sense of duty, even from a young age, and how that has shaped her more than six decades on the throne. The Coronation not only offers an enthralling peek into previously untold stories of royal life but also gives viewers a deeper understanding and appreciation for the richness of British royal history and the indelible mark it has left on the nation. As our interest in the lives and experiences of the monarchy continues to grow, revelations like these serve to further captivate and enthrall both casual and dedicated enthusiasts of royal history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Arsenal left it late to stay top of the English Premier League title race as Niklas Bendtner and Theo Walcott scored in the last two minutes at the Emirates Wednesday to beat Cardiff City 2-0. The match looked headed for a draw until Danish international Bendtner converted from close range to break the deadlock and Walcott rounded off the job in injury time. With Manchester City and Chelsea both winning, the three points was vital for the Gunners, who were top heading into the New Year and maintained a one-point advantage over City. They are also an unexpected 11 points clear of reigning champions Manchester United whose recent revival came to a shuddering halt with a 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the late kickoff. Tottenham, who recently replaced Andre Villas-Boas with Tim Sherwood, moved up to challenging sixth place with a third win in four games for the new manager. They took the lead just before half time through recalled Emmanuel Adebayor after a smart counter attack and added a second through Christian Eriksen in the 66th minute. Danny Welbeck pulled one back within a minute and Tottenham had to ride their luck in the last few minutes, but it added up to a fourth defeat at Old Trafford for United under David Moyes. Earlier, Cardiff, without a manager since the sacking of Malky Mackay, restricted leaders Arsenal to few opportunities despite their domination. Jack Wilshere was denied a penalty in the first half and then struck the base of the post after the break until Bendtner reacted quickly to score after Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall saved superbly from Bacary Sagna's header. Former Manchester United star Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a guest of Cardiff owner Vincent Tan at the match, increasing speculation he will take over from Mackay. Second-placed City picked up their seventh straight win in all competitions in the early kick off, beating Swansea City 3-2 at the Liberty Stadium. City's Brazilian defender Fernandinho opened their account after just 14 minutes following a Samir Nasri corner, which was not cleared by the home defense. Swansea leveled in first half injury time when Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony headed home, but the expensively assembled visitors stopped up the pace after the break and his international teammate Yaya Toure restored their lead with a deflected effort near the hour mark. City's Aleksandar Kolarov crashed home what proved to be the clinching third eight minutes later before the impressive Bony grabbed a late consolation in injury time from long range. \\"It was a very good result because Swansea are a strong team here at home and also away,\\" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports. \\"I think the way we won today is very important for us.\\" Jose Mourinho's Chelsea also kept up the pressure with a 3-0 win at Southampton, started by a header from Fernando Torres, who was a threat throughout, on the hour mark. Second half substitute Oscar set up Willian for a fine second just 11 minutes later and rounded off a superb performance with the third goal. It left Chelsea two points adrift in third spot. Fourth-placed Liverpool, still smarting from successive narrow losses to Manchester City and Chelsea, stayed in touch, four points adrift, by accounting for Hull City, winning 2-0 at home. Daniel Agger put them ahead with a 36th minute header with Luis Suarez netting his league leading 20th of the campaign with a fine free kick after the break. At the other end of the table, Fulham were indebted to Dimitar Berbatov for their winner in the 2-1 home victory over fellow strugglers West Ham. Nicolas Anelka, under investigation by the English FA for his controversial goal celebration in the draw at West Ham, played 88 minutes for West Bromwich Albion in their vital 1-0 home win over Newcastle. Sunderland remained rooted to the bottom as Gabriel Agbonlahor's 15th-minute goal gave Aston Villa a 1-0 win at the Stadium of Light, while third-bottom Crystal Palace were held to a 1-1 draw by Norwich City. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- Arsenal beat Cardiff City 2-0 with late goals from Niklas Bendtner and Theo Walcott, maintaining their position at the top of the English Premier League. - Manchester City and Chelsea also won their respective matches, keeping pressure on Arsenal in the title race. - Manchester United experienced a setback in their recent revival, losing 2-1 at home to Tottenham Hotspur. - Tottenham's new manager Tim Sherwood sees a third win in four games, moving the team to sixth place. - Liverpool bounced back from two consecutive losses with a 2-0 victory over Hull City, staying fourth in the league. - Fulham secured a crucial win over fellow strugglers West Ham, with Dimitar Berbatov scoring the winning goal in a 2-1 victory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vivien Leigh (born Vivian Mary Hartley, and also known as Lady Olivier after 1947; 5 November 1913 - 8 July 1967) was an English stage and film actress. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her iconic performances as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of Tovarich (1963). After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley on 5 November 1913 in British India on the campus of St. Paul's School, Darjeeling. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (nee Yackjee; she also used her mother's maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in Scotland in 1882, while her mother, a devout Roman Catholic, was born in Darjeeling in 1888 and was of Irish descent. Gertrude's parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee (born 1840), a man of independent means, and Mary Teresa Robinson (born 1856), who was born to an Irish family killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in Kensington, London.  In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore as an officer in the Indian Cavalry, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund. At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting \\"Little Bo Peep\\". Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) then situated in Roehampton, southwest London. One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become \\"a great actress\\". She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in Dinard, Biarritz, San Remo and Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended A Connecticut Yankee, one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.  Vivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of \\"theatrical people\\", they married on 20 December 1932 and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman. On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, later Mrs. Robin Farrington. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How was that recieved by her parents?","output":"Vivien Leigh's desire to become an actress is not directly addressed in terms of her parents' reception in the provided information.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Michael Richard Pence (born June 7, 1959) is an American politician and lawyer serving as the 48th and current Vice President of the United States, since January 20, 2017. He previously was the 50th Governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017 and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. Born and raised in Columbus, Indiana, Pence graduated from Hanover College and earned a law degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law before entering private practice. After losing two bids for a U.S. congressional seat in 1988 and 1990, he became a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. Michael Richard \\"Mike\\" Pence was born June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Nancy Jane (nee Cawley) and Edward Joseph Pence Jr. (1929-1988), who ran a group of gas stations. His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph. His family were Irish Catholic Democrats. Pence was named after his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from County Sligo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island, following an aunt and his brother James, and became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois. His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare.  Pence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a BA degree in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a JD degree from the Indiana University's Robert H. McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis in 1986. While at Hanover, Pence joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he became the chapter president. After graduating from Hanover, Pence was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983.  In his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat. He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and has stated that he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. While in college, Pence became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the great disappointment of his mother. His political views also started shifting to the right during this time in his life, something which Pence attributes to the \\"common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan\\" that he began to identify with.  After graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice. He ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in 1988 and in 1990. In 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network.  Pence left the Indiana Policy Review Foundation in 1993, a year after beginning to host The Mike Pence Show, a talk radio program based in WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana. Pence called himself \\"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\\" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as outspoken as Limbaugh. The show was syndicated by Network Indiana and aired weekdays 9 a.m. to noon (ET) on 18 stations throughout the state, including WIBC in Indianapolis. From 1995 to 1999, Pence also hosted a weekend political talk show from Indianapolis. How did he get started in politics?","output":"Michael Pence got his start in politics thanks to his early inspiration from political figures like John F.

Question: North Korea’s release of three U.S. citizens may help pave the way for talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, but questions remain as to whether those talks will succeed. At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting.  The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as \\"black smokers\\". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.Large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around 2 °C (36 °F) and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometres (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles). Also on the seabed are manganese nodules formed of layers of iron, manganese and other hydroxides around a core. In the Pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the deep ocean floor. The minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly. Their commercial extraction for... A:","output":"Based on the context provided, seabed mining, specifically the extraction of minerals like manganese nodules, seafloor massive sulphide deposits, and methane clathrate, has advantages over land-based mining. These advantages include: 1. Lower infrastructure costs: Seabed mining equipment can be built at specialized shipyards, which could potentially reduce the overall cost of the infrastructure needed for mining operations compared to land-based mines. Also, several resources can be extracted from the seabed within close proximity, further lowering the costs. 2. Highly concentrated and high-quality resources: The seabed contains vast reserves of high-quality minerals, such as silver, gold, copper, lead, zinc, and other trace metals. Moreover, manganese nodules, which can cover up to 30% of the deep ocean floor in the Pacific, are highly concentrated resources that can be extremely profitable if successfully extracted. 3. Offshore oil and gas: The seabed contains large deposits of petroleum as oil and natural gas, which can be extracted using offshore platforms and drilling rigs. Although the extraction of these resources can be challenging due to harsh environments, it remains a significant advantage over some land-based mining operations. However, it is crucial to note that seabed mining comes with several disadvantages and risks, such as environmental damage, coastal erosion, technical difficulties posed by waves and tides, siltation of excavations, and washing away of spoil heaps. The long-term impact of seabed mining on marine ecosystems is not fully understood, and the high costs associated with developing deep-sea mining technologies are also a significant challenge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A shared interest in fashion and art further cemented their bond, as did their mutual passion for social causes. Over time, their friendship evolved into an almost sisterly connection, with each one readily defending the other from the various challenges that life threw at them. Their personalities, however, were as distinct as their physical similarities. Faye was the more outgoing of the two - constantly seeking adventure and drawn to new experiences. Her boundless energy often found her at the center of attention, her infectious laughter and quick wit captivating those in her company. Yuna, on the other hand, was more reserved but by no means withdrawn. Her warmth and kindness were a comfort to many, and herein lay a steely resolve that was all too easy to overlook. Yuna boasted a strong and unyielding sense of integrity, and as such, she was deeply committed to her ideals, tirelessly advocating for those around her. Indeed, it was rather amusing that when Faye decided to dye her hair purple - a bold and daring decision that perfectly encapsulated her free spirit - Yuna followed suit without hesitation. This act of solidarity only served to bolster their image as two halves of the same whole, and seeing Faye’s violet locks reflected in Yuna's tresses was nothing short of poetic. Subtle differences did exist between them, however. When closely compared, Yuna's eyes were slightly thinner and elongated, framed by delicately arched eyebrows. In addition, her nose boasted an elegant curve that gently tilted upwards at the tip - while not immediately noticeable, this feature heightened her overall sense of ethereal beauty. However, it was only when these characteristics were scrutinized that one could tell Faye and Yuna apart. Ultimately, the journey of these two extraordinary women was testament to the powerful bonds that can form between individuals who share a connection beyond physical similarities. Had it not been for the subtle differences in Yuna’s eyes and nose, the world might have been utterly convinced that they were speaking to the same individual. But despite their uncanny resemblance, Faye and Yuna possessed unique spirits, each an indelible force that complimented the other, leaving a mark on all those fortunate enough to cross their paths."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Umbrella troops kill many people on the freighter. Alice opens fire on the aerial armada and hits one airship, causing it to crash into Arcadia, resulting in an explosion that knocks her out and into the water. The fates of Chris, Claire, K-Mart and the rest of the people on board remains ambiguous.The story switches to a suburban housewife who appears to be Alice living with her husband Todd (Oded Fehr) and deaf daughter Becky (Aryana Engineer). Zombies attack, revealing the suburbia is actually Raccoon City during the contamination. Alice and Becky escape to the streets and are rescued by a student, Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), who lets them ride in her car. As the three escape, they are hit by a truck, knocking Rain unconscious while Alice and Becky escape.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Hollywood seeks divine inspiration with biblical epics With epic stories about Noah, Moses and Cain and Abel all due to hit our screens, is the Bible movie set to take over from the superhero film? Tom Brook examines the potential risks and rewards of the religious blockbuster. It was an intriguing image and it caught Twitter users' imagination – a massive wooden replica of Noah's Ark under construction in suburban New York. \\"I dreamt about this since I was 13,\\" tweeted Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky, whose epic film of Noah’s life is set for release next March. \\"And now it's a reality.\\" This enormous set is a rare extravagance in the age of CGI pictures. And in more ways than one, it looks back to an older style of movie-making. It heralds a flood of Hollywood films on biblical themes. There are two planned Moses pictures in the works, with Ang Lee and Ridley Scott rumoured as directors. Then there’s a Cain and Abel story in development. Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed last year they’d given approval for production to go ahead through Will Smith’s production company. Other religious films are also being incubated. Hollywood’s interest in biblical epics is to some extent cyclical – in the 1950s and early 60s they were a staple. Legendary filmmaker Cecil B DeMille made a big impact with The Ten Commandments in which Charlton Heston played Moses. Other biblical hits from the time included Solomon and Sheba, David and Bathsheba and Ben-Hur. These films dominated the box office. But not all the religious films from the era resonated with an audience. One of the best-known – The Greatest Story Ever Told – didn’t do well commercially. And several didn’t meet with the approval of reviewers. The New York Times critic wrote that the biblical epic King of Kings, narrated by Orson Wells, had “the nature of an illustrated lecture.” Recently interest in religious-themed films has been heightened as the Hollywood studios have, once again, come to realise there’s a potentially huge audience for biblical fare. Not necessarily earth-shattering news when you take into account that a Gallup poll conducted last year found more than 75 per cent of Americans identify with a Christian religion. But what’s got Hollywood’s attention in the past few weeks is the just-completed American TV series The Bible on the History Channel. This miniseries – which dramatised the Bible in five two-hour programmes – became a surprise blockbuster. It reached an audience of more than 13 million with its first episode – an unusually large viewing figure for a miniseries on cable TV. Reality TV impresario Mark Burnett, who co-produced the series with his wife actress Roma Downey, clearly thinks there’s a demand for religious entertainment. “We believe in the Bible, we believe in Jesus and that’s the number one subject right now in America. And that’s great!” he says. The success of the History Channel’s The Bible has animated studio executives. Paul Degarabedian, box office analyst for Hollywood.com, says: “I think that’s maybe the foremost thing on their minds right now: that if done properly Bible-based movies could potentially be moneymaking and profitable.” But catering to the growing interest in biblical adventures presents the Hollywood studios with a challenge: how to create a movie that will engage both secular audiences as well as those who strongly identify with their religious background? Screenplays have to be thoughtfully composed to reach audiences everywhere. It’s not an easy feat if you’re trying to reach a worldwide audience that includes people who practice very different religions. Making the right kind of religious films is difficult for the studios as Toby Miller, author of Global Hollywood 2, confirms. “It’s a big issue in overseas sales,” he says. “How Christian can you get? How Old Testament can you get? ” Hollywood has engendered heated controversies in the past when it has taken on religious stories. Biblical characters are seen as sacrosanct. California-based Brian Godawa, a filmmaker who writes and directs spiritual stories, has taken exception to the forthcoming film Noah. Based on his reading of the screenplay he says: “They’re turning it into a political propaganda piece for environmentalism. What they’ve done is made the meaning of the Noah story into something that’s not in the Bible.” He adds: “We’ll just have to wait and see what happens with Noah because if it’s as anti-biblical as I think religious people won’t want to see it.” Whether or not planned religious movies create criticism, Hollywood is not going to hold back given the promise of big box office rewards. Another strong factor encouraging the studios to explore biblical stories is that Hollywood’s big staple – the superhero films of recent years – may have run their course. “It’s true there isn’t much that is left to be mined but it is clear there is a massive appetite for that kind of story,” says Professor Miller. Religious epics, if carefully calibrated, could perhaps satisfy the appetites of the superhero audience. The studios have already peddled god-like superheroes and met with box office success. Take Thor – the Kenneth Branagh directed action-adventure released two years ago which took in more than 180m at the international box office. The character of Thor in the movie certainly had a religious dimension. As Professor Miller says: “Thor is a god, or a semi-god, able to go beyond the human norm and provide inspiration to the conventional person,” Paul Degarabedian believes given the right treatment all the excitement of the Bible – the events, battles and intrigue – could be fashioned into an appealing blockbuster. “That could be something that could totally cross over that would be cinematic, compelling, entertaining that could be huge if it’s done with the proper balance of secular style storytelling,” he says. But Brian Godawa is pessimistic, arguing that secular Hollywood doesn’t really understand religion. “The problem is that many people in Hollywood are not spiritually, religiously inclined – they don’t understand the Bible. They don’t understand Christianity or Judaism. They import their own views into it.” What some studio executives would like to see is a replication of the success of Mel Gibson’s 2004 religious epic The Passion of The Christ which depicted the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus. The film made more than 600m around the world. Despite considerable controversy – and charges of anti-Semitism – it was a religious film that did reach beyond the US Christian community. It also made headway in countries with large Muslim populations such as Egypt. But it was banned in other parts of the Muslim world for different reasons – partly because the crucifixion, so vividly depicted in the picture, contradicts the Koran. Some commentators see the success of The Passion of The Christ as specifically connected to both the socio-political climate in the US at the time it was launched and Mel Gibson’s stature. He personally financed the film which also benefitted from a very effective marketing campaign that relied heavily on church groups. Right now Hollywood is mired in soul-searching looking for new ways to reach audiences of all kinds both religious and secular. Religious epics remain risky ventures but they could be part of the answer – if done properly the payoff could be huge.

The company, famous for making cellphones with physical keyboards that were once so popular people nicknamed them Crackberries, has decided to stop making its own devices.      BlackBerry said on Wednesday that it will rely on partners to manufacture the phones, which will still have BlackBerry's look and feel.      The company announced a joint venture with an Indonesian telecom company that will start making them. BlackBerry plans to turn its attention to software, a move it has made gradually in recent years as sales of its phones have slid.      Shares of BlackBerry (BBRY) rose 4% in early trading after the announcement. But the stock price is well below its peak from several years ago.      BlackBerry was once the phone of choice for Wall Street traders, politicians and celebrities, thanks in part to its well-regarded security system. President Obama was spotted with a BlackBerry. So was Kim Kardashian West.      Related: Kim Kardashian's last BlackBerry Bold has finally died      But the company was too late to the touchscreen game, and customers left in droves for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, Samsung's (SSNLF) Galaxy and other devices running on Google's (GOOGL) Android system.      Even Microsoft (MSFT) has moved ahead of BlackBerry with its Windows Phones.      CEO John Chen has tried to turn the company around since joining in 2013. But even as he has pushed BlackBerry toward mobile and security software, apps and the plethora of connected devices known as the Internet of Things, BlackBerry has bled red ink, posted sharp sales declines and lost customers.      Chen has even done what was once unthinkable, opening the BlackBerry to other operating systems. The company now sells phones that run on Android. It also killed off its BlackBerry Classic line of phones this summer.      So Chen deserves credit for stabilizing BlackBerry and refocusing it on higher growth areas.      The company is also no longer in danger of going under, a legitimate concern investors had before he took control. BlackBerry now has about 2.5 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet -- money for a proverbial rainy day.      BlackBerry will need all the cash it can get. The company also reported Wednesday that its latest quarterly sales fell about 30% from a year ago.      And BlackBerry said that it expects to break even this fiscal year at best. That's still better than the loss analysts had forecast.      But if Chen can't get the company's sales growing again and return it to profitability, there could be more pressure on him to sell BlackBerry.      That's exactly what Chen has done in the past. He sold the struggling software company Sybase to SAP (SAP) for a hefty premium while he was CEO of Sybase.      There has been chatter about a BlackBerry sale for years.      The rumor mill may start turning again, though. BlackBerry also announced Wednesday that CFO James Yersh was stepping down and that he would be replaced by Steven Capelli, who worked with Chen at Sybase.      Chen and Capelli also worked together at Pyramid Technology in the mid-1900s, a company that was sold to Siemens under their watch.      So BlackBerry investors might be hoping that lightning will strike three times and Chen and Capelli can pull off another sale. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email      It’s official. BlackBerry Ltd., the Canadian company that invented the smartphone and addicted legions of road warriors to the “CrackBerry,” has stopped making its iconic handsets.      Finally conceding defeat in a battle lost long ago to Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., BlackBerry is handing over production of the phones to overseas partners and turning its full attention to the more profitable and growing software business. It’s the formalization of a move in the making since Chief Executive Officer John Chen took over nearly three years ago and outsourced some manufacturing to Foxconn Technology Group. Getting the money-losing smartphone business off BlackBerry’s books will also make it easier for the company to consistently hit profitability.      John Chen Photographer: Pau Barrena/Bloomberg      “This is the completion of their exit,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. “Chen is a software CEO historically. He’s getting back to what he knows best: higher margins and recurring revenue.”      Chen should be able to execute his software strategy as long as he keeps costs in line and maintains cash on the balance sheet, Gillis said.      BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, gained as much as 7.4 percent Wednesday, its biggest intraday jump since December. The shares were trading up 4 percent to C10.83 at 12:53 p.m. in Toronto.      Licensing Agreement      BlackBerry said it struck a licensing agreement with an Indonesian company to make and distribute branded devices. More deals are in the works with Chinese and Indian manufacturers. It will still design smartphone applications and an extra-secure version of Alphabet Inc.’s Android operating system.      “I think the market has spoken and I’m just listening,” Chen said in a discussion with journalists. “You have to evolve to what your strength is and our strength is actually in the software and enterprise and security.”      The new strategy will improve margins and could actually increase the number of BlackBerry-branded phones sold, Chen said, as manufacturers license the name that still holds considerable sway in emerging markets like Indonesia, South Africa and Nigeria.      “This is the way for me to ensure the BlackBerry brand is still on a device,” Chen said.      Although BlackBerry’s latest phone, the DTEK50, was already almost completely outsourced, the move is a big symbolic step for a company that once reached a market value of 80 billion. Today, it’s worth about 4.3 billion.      Keyboard Fans      Obama with his Blackberry in 2009. Photographer: Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images      When the BlackBerry 850 was released in 1999, it married a functional keyboard with e-mail capability and essentially ushered in the modern smartphone era. With a proprietary operating system known for its watertight security, the phones became ubiquitous and extended the workday onto commuter trains and into restaurants and homes. They were an instant hit with business executives and heads of state alike. President Barack Obama was fiercely committed to his, but finally ditched it earlier this year, reportedly for a Samsung.      In 2007, the iPhone debuted with its touchscreen interface and app store. People at first said they didn’t want to give up BlackBerry’s keyboard and simplicity. But the lure of apps eventually sent almost all its users to phones running Android or iOS.      “It was inevitable at this point; they didn’t have the unit volumes to sustain the business profitably,” said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “This is doubling down on the efforts to focus on software which is really what their strength is.” BlackBerry shipped only 400,000 phones in its fiscal second quarter, half what it sold in the same period last year. Apple sold more than 40 million iPhones last quarter.      Earnings Report      BlackBerry said software and services revenue more than doubled in the quarter from a year earlier to 156 million. Still, software revenue was down from the previous quarter’s 266 million, which Chen blamed on patent licensing deals that didn’t carry over into the quarter.      Adjusted earnings were at break-even, compared with analysts’ estimates for a loss of 5 cents. Revenue in the second quarter was 325 million, falling short of analysts’ projections for 390 million. For the full year, BlackBerry expects a loss of 5 cents or to hit break-even, compared with what it said was a current consensus of a 15-cent loss.      While investors appear to be relieved that BlackBerry finally threw in the towel on handsets, Chen will still have to prove that he can continue to expand the software business in an increasingly competitive space. So far, Chen managed to hit his fiscal 2016 target of pulling in 500 million in annual software-only revenue last March. The next milestone is to grow that by another 30 percent by March 2017.      Chen also aims to expand the margins of software products to around 75 percent from closer to 60 percent now, he said.      Competitive Threats      BlackBerry’s most important software is its device management suite, which helps companies keep track of their employees’ phones and make sure sensitive communication stays within the business. BlackBerry bought one of its key competitors, Good Technology, for 425 million last year, but the market is crowded.      “This doesn’t change the fact that there are still a lot of competitive threats,” Kanterman said in a phone interview. VMWare, IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp. all have device management products and are taking market share by bundling them in with other business-focused software they sell.      In some ways, it doesn’t make sense for BlackBerry to stay a public company.      Given its shriveled market value, it could be the right price for a private-equity takeover, or it could sell out piecemeal to a bigger company like Dell Technologies’ VMWare or Samsung.

Investors still largely value BlackBerry as a hardware company, not the software provider it has become, Chen said.      “As soon as that message is recognized, the stock will move to the right valuation,” he said.      — With assistance by Elliott Snyder |||||Summary:","output":"BlackBerry has stopped making its own phones, and will instead rely on partners to manufacture its devices while it focuses on software, a move the company has been gradually making over the past few years as sales have dropped.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer a question about the following article about Age of Enlightenment: A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas. Who wrote the Histoire naturelle des insectes?","output":"The Histoire naturelle des insectes, a work of natural history, was written by René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur. René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur was a prominent French scientist of the Age of Enlightenment, a period marked by the promotion and flourishing of intellectual and scientific ideas. His contribution to the scientific literature of this era, specifically in the field of natural history was significant, reflecting the increasing popularity and importance of such studies during this time.  The Histoire naturelle des insectes, which focuses on the natural history of insects, is a notable example of de Réaumur’s work. In the exploration and documentation of this topic, de Réaumur contributed to the knowledge and understanding of the natural world, extending the reach of scientific inquiry to include the smaller, often overlooked inhabitants of the natural world - insects.  Moreover, the increased importance and popularity of scientific literature such as de Réaumur's work during the Enlightenment illustrates the movement's emphasis on empirical observation and scientific method. As the article notes, fields covered by natural history became critical components of medicine, industry and education. The Histoire naturelle des insectes by de Réaumur is a testament to the scientific curiosity and spirit of the Enlightenment era, serving as an example of the scientific literature that characterized and fueled this powerful intellectual and cultural movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For dinner we ordered the Farro Risotto with Pork Belly (which I could not find), and the ravioli with foraged mushrooms and wild nettle. As a special of the night you could add a really rubbery lobster tail for a bargin price of only 15. Had to send the ravioli back, something was not right, the sauce was as tangy as a balsamic dressing. Not right for raviolis. The risotto, was something I have made at home, and left a ton to be disired. I wanted the crispy pork belly with my risotto, however they must have forgotten it because there was nothing to resemble the pork belly.

Given the question: Process: - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic -   Question: suppose more wind turbines are built happens, how will it affect less sulfur trioxide is formed.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"less effect Building more wind turbines will lead to an increase in the production of clean, renewable energy. As a result, there will be a reduced need for burning coal, which is a major source of sulfur emissions. With less coal being burned, there will be less sulfur combining with oxygen to form sulfur oxides. This in turn will lead to less sulfur trioxide being formed in the atmosphere. Consequently, the reaction of sulfur trioxide with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid will be diminished, making the rain less acidic. Overall, the increased use of wind turbines will have a positive impact on reducing the formation of sulfur trioxide, leading to a lessened effect on acid rain."},{"instruction":"Question: what fantasy american football means I found the following answer on Google: Due to the growth of the Internet, Fantasy football has vastly increased in popularity, particularly because Fantasy football providers such as ESPN, Yahoo, CBS, and the NFL itself are able to keep track of statistics entirely online, eliminating the need to check box scores and newspapers regularly to keep track of players.

Vitamin E antioxidant that prolongs the life of color  Could you correct the punctuation please?","output":"Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant that prolongs the life of color. Here's a more detailed and longer explanation: Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that is essential for maintaining good health. It is widely known for its skin and hair benefits, but it also plays a crucial role in protecting and preserving the vibrancy of colored hair. When hair is exposed to various environmental factors such as heat, sunlight, and pollution, its color can fade and lose its shine. This is where vitamin E comes into play. As an antioxidant, vitamin E helps combat the harmful effects of free radicals, which are molecules that cause oxidative stress and damage to hair cells. By neutralizing these free radicals, vitamin E helps maintain the hair's natural color and prolong its life. This, in turn, helps your hair stay vibrant and healthy, even when subjected to coloring treatments or other harsh chemicals. In addition to prolonging the life of color, vitamin E provides numerous other benefits to hair and scalp health. It helps strengthen hair roots, promotes hair growth, prevents hair breakage, and keeps your scalp moisturized. This is due to its ability to improve blood circulation in the scalp, which in turn stimulates hair follicles and encourages hair growth. So how can you make the most of vitamin E's hair-preserving properties? There are several ways to incorporate this vital nutrient into your haircare routine: 1. Ensure you consume a balanced diet that includes vitamin E-rich foods like almonds, peanuts, avocado, sunflower seeds, spinach, and olive oil. 2. Use hair care products that contain vitamin E, such as shampoos, conditioners, and leave-in treatments specifically formulated for color-treated hair. 3. Apply a vitamin E oil or serum directly to your hair and scalp. Massage the oil into your hair, concentrating on the ends and middle sections where the most damage occurs. Leave it on for a few hours or even overnight before washing it off. 4. Take vitamin E supplements if advised by your doctor. However, always consult a healthcare professional before introducing any supplements into your daily routine. In conclusion, vitamin E is an essential nutrient for maintaining healthy and vibrant colored hair. By incorporating it into your diet and hair care routine, you can protect your hair from damage, improve its texture and appearance, and prolong the life of your chosen color. This will result in beautiful, strong, and radiant hair that will stay vibrant for an extended period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ask what's included in the price. Essential things like chairs and tables may not be covered, said wedding planner Mayra Castillo of AaB Creates. Alcohol: If you're looking for the cheapest option, then say no to the open bar and just go with beer and wine. \\"A lot of people have this image of I want to toast with a champagne flute and have everyone wish me well,\\" Castillo said. \\"But with champagne, not every venue has that included and a lot of catering bills also sometimes don't have champagne included, so it's good for you to ask and make sure that that's what's included in your price per person.\\" Tax and gratuity: That's definitely something couples tend to forget about, Castillo said. When budgeting for your wedding party, keep in mind the recommended 20 percent service gratuity and sales tax—whatever it may be in your state. Most wedding items you're shopping for (cake, catering, flowers, etc.,) have a sales tax, and that adds to your bill. Summary:","output":"To save on wedding costs, consider the following: 1) Ensure the venue price includes essentials like chairs and tables. 2) Opt for beer and wine instead of an open bar, and check if champagne is included in the catering price. 3) Don't forget to include a 20% service gratuity and sales tax when budgeting for wedding items."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mary asked Rebecca what the chemical symbol for nitrogen was because  Possible answers:  *Mary could not remember..  *Rebecca could not remember..","output":"Mary asked Rebecca what the chemical symbol for nitrogen was because she was studying for a chemistry test that was scheduled for the next day. In class, they had been learning about the different elements and their symbols, as well as the ways in which these elements interacted with one another in various chemical reactions. Despite having dedicated a considerable amount of time to studying, Mary found that there were still some areas where her memory was foggy. One area where Mary felt she needed some assistance was in remembering the chemical symbols for various elements. Although she could recall some of the more common ones like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and carbon (C), she found that others were more difficult for her to remember. In particular, she was having trouble with the chemical symbol for nitrogen. Mary decided to ask her friend Rebecca for help because Rebecca was also in the same chemistry class and had always been known for her superior memory and ability to recall information quickly. She thought that Rebecca might have studied the chemical symbols in greater detail, and therefore might be able to easily help her with her query. When Mary posed the question to Rebecca, she hoped that Rebecca would be able to recall the information because of her strong memory skills. However, it turned out that Rebecca was also having difficulty remembering the chemical symbol for nitrogen. In fact, she was struggling with the same problem as Mary, and they soon realized that they were both unsure about this particular piece of information. Both girls decided that it would be beneficial to study together and consolidate their knowledge. As they sat down and went through their notes on the periodic table, they were able to determine that the chemical symbol for nitrogen was actually 'N'. This was a crucial piece of information that they needed to remember, given the importance of nitrogen in many chemical reactions and its significance within the environment, being a key element in Earth's atmosphere. The realization that they both had trouble remembering the same thing made them feel better about their situation. It was reassuring to know that they were not alone in their struggles and that other students were also grappling with the same concepts. As a result of their collaborative study session, Mary and Rebecca were better prepared for the upcoming chemistry test and were able to remember the chemical symbol for nitrogen, as well as many other important facts about the elements. In conclusion, even though Mary initially thought that Rebecca would know the answer right away, it became evident that both girls were having trouble remembering the chemical symbol for nitrogen. By working together and studying the material, they were ultimately able to determine that the symbol was 'N' and reinforce their understanding of chemistry. This collaborative approach not only built their knowledge but also strengthened their friendship, as they supported one another in their academic endeavors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \\"|||||\\". Your task is to summarize them. Input: The White House declined to comment on the criticism or on whether Mr. Obama has settled on him for the job. Administration officials said Mr. Obama would like to announce at least part of his second-term national security team this week.      Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, is viewed as a lock for secretary of state, while the choice for director of the Central Intelligence Agency has narrowed to two candidates — Michael J. Morell, the agency’s acting director, and John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s counterterrorism adviser.      Administration officials noted that there were other candidates for the Pentagon, including Michèle A. Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense, and Ashton B. Carter, the current deputy secretary at the Pentagon. Mr. Hagel, a Vietnam veteran who left the Senate in 2009 and now teaches at Georgetown University, declined to comment.      For the White House, it is the second time a candidate’s record has come under fire even before a nomination was announced.      Last week, Susan E. Rice, the ambassador the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after coming under weeks of withering assault by Republicans for statements she made after the deadly assault on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.      In the wake of Ms. Rice’s withdrawal, there have also been questions about whether Mr. Obama’s proposed national security team would lack diversity.      None of Mr. Hagel’s former Senate colleagues has come out against his candidacy. But on Tuesday, several Republicans predicted that he would face some blunt questions if nominated.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “I am concerned about some of his statements on Iran and Hamas and Israel,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said in an interview with Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper. “I’m sure that those issues will be explored in the nomination hearing, should he be nominated.”      Mr. Hagel is a friend and “was a fine senator,” added Ms. Collins, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, which will consider the nomination of a defense secretary to succeed Leon E. Panetta.      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Some officials on Capitol Hill predicted that if nominated, Mr. Hagel, 66, would not face anywhere near the opposition that scuttled Ms. Rice’s candidacy. He remains popular among his former colleagues.      But the steady drumbeat of criticism from Jewish and other pro-Israel groups is a problem for the White House and Mr. Hagel, who as defense secretary would have to engage regularly with Israeli leaders on American military aid and the Iranian nuclear threat.      “There is a very systematic effort going on, and these things can have an impact,” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the executive director of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group, which defends Mr. Hagel.      “It is simply beyond disturbing to think that somebody of Chuck Hagel’s stature and significant record of national service is being slandered in this way,” Mr. Ben-Ami said.      The criticism of Mr. Hagel is on two levels. The first is his voting record, which some analysts say has been soft on groups like Hezbollah and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He voted against designating the Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, they said, and refused to demand that the European Union designate Hezbollah a terrorist group.      “It is a matter of fact that a record like that is well outside the mainstream of both Democratic and Republican positions on such issues,” said Josh Block, the chief executive of the Israel Project, a pro-Israel educational group.      The second set of criticism centers on an interview Mr. Hagel gave in 2006 to Aaron David Miller, a longtime American diplomat, for a book he wrote on the Middle East peace process, “The Much Too Promised Land.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Speaking of groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which advocates for Israel, Mr. Hagel said, “The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here.” Critics faulted both his implication that lawmakers are bullied and his use of the phrase “Jewish” rather than “Israel,” suggesting that all advocates for Israel are Jewish. Senators from both parties have expressed discomfort with his choice of words.      In the interview, Mr. Hagel noted, “I’m a United States senator, not an Israeli senator.” While he said he supported Israel, “my first interest is I take an oath of office to the Constitution of the United States. Not to a president. Not a party. Not to Israel.”      Mr. Miller, now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that while Mr. Hagel’s past positions on Iran sanctions, Hamas and Hezbollah differed from the administration’s policies, it did not matter much since, as defense secretary, he would not be formulating policy in the Middle East.      “His brief will concentrate on when to project American military might,” Mr. Miller said, “and here his caution and experience in the Vietnam years coincide with where the president is.”      Based on talks with Mr. Hagel, Mr. Miller said he concluded that the former senator “believes in a special relationship with Israel, but not an exclusive one.”      “There should not be a litmus test of whether he is pro-Israel enough,” Mr. Miller said. “He is just independent enough to recognize that there are moments when U.S.-Israel interests don’t always align.” ||||| Prejudice—like cooking, wine-tasting and other consummations—has an olfactory element. When Chuck Hagel, the former GOP senator from Nebraska who is now a front-runner to be the next secretary of Defense, carries on about how \\"the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,\\" the odor is especially ripe.      Ripe because a \\"Jewish lobby,\\" as far as I'm aware, doesn't exist. No lesser authorities on the subject than John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, authors of \\"The Israel Lobby,\\" have insisted the term Jewish lobby is \\"inaccurate and misleading, both because the [Israel] lobby includes non-Jews like Christian Zionists and because many Jewish Americans do not support the hard-line policies favored by its most powerful elements.\\"      Ripe because, whatever other political pressures Mr. Hagel might have had to endure during his years representing the Cornhusker state, winning over the state's Jewish voters—there are an estimated 6,100 Jewish Nebraskans in a state of 1.8 million people—was probably not a major political concern for Mr. Hagel compared to, say, the ethanol lobby.      Enlarge Image Close Reuters A United States senator, not an Israeli one. In case there was any doubt.      Ripe because the word \\"intimidates\\" ascribes to the so-called Jewish lobby powers that are at once vast, invisible and malevolent; and because it suggests that legislators who adopt positions friendly to that lobby are doing so not from political conviction but out of personal fear. Just what does that Jewish Lobby have on them?      Ripe, finally, because Mr. Hagel's Jewish lobby remark was well in keeping with the broader pattern of his thinking. \\"I'm a United States Senator, not an Israeli Senator,\\" Mr. Hagel told retired U.S. diplomat Aaron David Miller in 2006. \\"I'm a United States Senator. I support Israel. But my first interest is I take an oath of office to the Constitution of the United States. Not to a president. Not a party. Not to Israel. If I go run for Senate in Israel, I'll do that.\\"      Read these staccato utterances again to better appreciate their insipid and insinuating qualities, all combining to cast the usual slur on Jewish-Americans: Dual loyalty. Nobody questions Mr. Hagel's loyalty. He is only making those assertions to question the loyalty of others.      Still, Mr. Hagel managed to say \\"I support Israel.\\" This is the sort of thing one often hears from people who treat Israel as the Mideast equivalent of a neighborhood drunk who, for his own good, needs to be put in the clink to sober him up.      In 2002, a year in which 457 Israelis were killed in terrorist attacks (a figure proportionately equivalent to more than 20,000 fatalities in the U.S., or seven 9/11s), Mr. Hagel weighed in with the advice that \\"Israel must take steps to show its commitment to peace.\\" This was two years after Yasser Arafat had been offered a state by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David.      In 2006, Mr. Hagel described Israel's war against Hezbollah as \\"the systematic destruction of an American friend, the country and people of Lebanon.\\" He later refused to sign a letter calling on the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. In 2007, he voted against designating Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization, and also urged President Bush to open \\"direct, unconditional\\" talks with Iran to create \\"a historic new dynamic in U.S.-Iran relations.\\" In 2009, Mr. Hagel urged the Obama administration to open direct talks with Hamas.      In fairness to Mr. Hagel, all these positions emerge from his belief in the power of diplomatic engagement and talking with adversaries. The record of that kind of engagement—in 2008, Mr. Hagel and John Kerry co-authored an op-ed in this newspaper titled \\"It's Time to Talk to Syria\\"—hasn't been stellar, but at least it was borne of earnest motives.      Yet it's worth noting that while Mr. Hagel is eager to engage the world's rogues without preconditions, his attitude toward Israel tends, at best, to the paternalistic.      \\"The United States and Israel must understand that it is not in their long-term interests to allow themselves to become isolated in the Middle East and the world,\\" he said in a 2006 Senate speech. It's a political Deep Thought worthy of Saturday Night Live's Jack Handey. Does Mr. Hagel reckon any other nation to be quite so blind to its own supposed self-interest as Israel?      Now President Obama may nominate Mr. Hagel to take Leon Panetta's place at the Pentagon. As a purely score-settling matter, I almost hope he does. It would confirm a point I made in a column earlier this year, which is that Mr. Obama is not a friend of Israel. Perhaps the 63% of Jewish-Americans who cast their votes for Mr. Obama last month might belatedly take notice.      Alternatively, maybe some of these voters could speak up now, before a nomination is announced, about the insult that a Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel would be. Jewish Democrats like to fancy their voice carries weight in their party. The prospect of this nomination is their chance to prove it.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy.  - Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a soft gray Group 2 alkaline earth metal, fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. The ion Ca is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved ion in seawater by both molarity and mass, after sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate. Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature. Calcium is produced in supernova nucleosynthesis.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.  - Sodium is a chemical element with symbol Na (from Latin \\"natrium\\") and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged atomthe Na cation. Its only stable isotope is Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.  - The alkaline earth metals are six chemical elements in column (group) 2 of the Periodic table. They are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). They have very similar properties: they are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - The chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl. It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents. Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells. Less frequently, the word \\"chloride\\" may also form part of the \\"common\\" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded. For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent CCl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.  - Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all Group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Hijiki (  ,  or  hijiki ) ( Sargassum fusiforme , syn . Hizikia fusiformis ) is a brown sea vegetable growing wild on rocky coastlines around Japan , Korea , and China . Hijiki has been a part of the Japanese diet for centuries . Hijiki is rich in dietary fibre and essential minerals such as calcium , iron , and magnesium .

The district attorney, Dan Callahan, on a hunting trip with Judge Leland Hoffman, is summoned back to the city to handle the murder investigation. Callahan and Hoffman both have political ambitions, eyeing the upcoming election for governor. The high-profile nature of the murder case persuades Callahan that it could vault him to the governor's office if he prosecutes it himself. He personally arrests the prime suspect, Thornwall, a wealthy man with political connections whose wife is the victim. Hoffman is assigned to be the judge in the case, which could impact his own political future.

His best-known works include the opera \\"Peter Grimes\\" (1945), the \\"War Requiem\\" (1962) and the orchestral showpiece \\"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\\" (1945).  - Henry Purcell (or ; c. 10 September 1659  21 November 1695) was an English composer. Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.  - Baroque music (or ) is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Vinod Kumar (Dilip Kumar) is an upright and honest man, who runs a newspaper named \\"Mashaal\\". Vinod exposes the ills in the society with help of his newspaper. Vinod's wife, Sudha (Waheeda Rehman), sees a vagabond named Raja (Anil Kapoor) and tries to instill some values and culture in him. Vinod is sceptical about this, but accepts when Raja tells them of his tragic childhood and comes to regard Sudha as a maternal figure. Finally, Vinod decides to help Raja by sending him to Bangalore to complete his education and become a journalist. During frequent meetings with Vinod and Sudha, Raja befriends Geeta (Rati Agnihotri), an aspiring journalist and an assistant in Vinod's paper, and they fall in love. During his investigations, Vinod finds that S.K. Vardhan (Amrish Puri), a wealthy and respected man in the society, is behind many malpractices. Vinod starts exposing S.K's illicit business of drug-trafficking and selling hooch. Initially, S.K. tries to buy Vinod's silence by bribing him, but when Vinod decides to stand up to S.K., the latter inflicts misery on Vinod by having him thrown out of his rented house via the landlord. That very night, Vinod's newspaper office is burnt down by S.K.'s men. Helpless, and on the streets, tragedy strikes Vinod and Sudha further when Sudha, who is ailing, dies on the road, leaving Vinod distraught and heartbroken. A disillusioned Vinod realizes that S.K. will always trump him, since people also support him. Instead of trying to expose S.K., Vinod now decides to follow S.K's footsteps in order to destroy him. Vinod, in association with Kishorilal (Saeed Jaffrey), starts producing illicit hooch and doing other illegal businesses to earn lots of money - the thing, Vinod retrospectively feels, he lacked, and the shortage of which led to the tragedies in his life. In a very short time, Vinod becomes a very rich man. All this time, Raja, who is in Bangalore for his studies, is blissfully unaware of these developments. The only other person exposed to this truth is Geeta, who has... Answer:","output":"\\"Beyond the Mashaal: A Quest for Justice\\" The title \\"Beyond the Mashaal: A Quest for Justice\\" captures the essence of the movie's plot – the struggle and transformation of Vinod, the founding editor of \\"Mashaal\\" newspaper, as he exposes the dark underbelly of society and confronts adversities brought upon by S.K. Vardhan, a malicious and powerful man. The title highlights the importance of the newspaper, Mashaal, as a beacon of truth and integrity and the journey it takes to bring about justice. The word \\"Mashaal\\" holds significance as it means \\"torch\\" in Hindi, symbolizing the newspaper's role in shedding light on the misdeeds and injustices within society. The title also depicts the protagonist, Vinod Kumar, whose life goes \\"beyond\\" the boundaries of the Mashaal to exact retribution upon the villainous S.K. Vardhan. \\"Beyond\\" is used to signify Vinod's transformation as he faces numerous challenges and the death of his wife Sudha, leading him to temporarily abandon his principles and turn to illicit activities in an attempt to bring down S.K. Vardhan. The term \\"Quest for Justice\\" highlights Vinod's ultimate goal to hold S.K. Vardhan accountable for his actions, no matter the personal cost or consequences Vinod may face. Furthermore, the title also emphasizes the various relationships and characters that evolve and intertwine throughout the story, such as the connection between Vinod's wife, Sudha, and the vagabond Raja, who later becomes a successful journalist, and the romance between Raja and Geeta, an aspiring journalist working at Vinod's paper. These relationships serve to underscore the theme of hope, redemption, and resilience, adding complexity and depth to the story. In conclusion, \\"Beyond the Mashaal: A Quest for Justice\\" is a fitting title for a movie depicting the trials and tribulations of Vinod and his fight to uncover corruption while navigating a treacherous world filled with deceit and moral ambiguity. The title encapsulates the essence of the plot, showcasing the importance of the Mashaal newspaper and the protagonist's journey as he battles the darkness within himself and society to bring about justice."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: How many slaves were living in Jamaica the year Rodin created his bust of Lord Howard de Walden? Passage:After succeeding to his family titles in 1899 he inherited further estates in 1901, including property in Marylebone, London and earned the title of 'Britain's wealthiest bachelor'. His family's wealth was initially derived from slavery and sugar estates in Jamaica, primarily Montpelier, Jamaica. He took a lease on Audley End House, Essex which had once belonged to his ancestors, in 1904 but reportedly never felt settled there. The artist Auguste Rodin created a bust of Lord Howard de Walden in 1906 which is held in the collection kept at the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia. In 1911, in preparation for his marriage, he leased Chirk Castle, Denbighshire, which became his main residence after WWI until 1946, and where he learned the Welsh language; he later served as president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales from 1931 to 1945.","output":"In order to answer the question \\"How many slaves were living in Jamaica the year Rodin created his bust of Lord Howard de Walden?\\", we need to determine the year the bust was created and then find information about the number of slaves living in Jamaica at that time.

When the movie started I couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see. They're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. It really does. Like the \\"director\\" took the family hi8 camcorder (before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. No script, just making it up as he went along. When I watched it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). At first I thought I'd hooked it up wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better, you know.

There was No salt on the table, which killed this dish completely.  Shrimp Cocktail - Shrimp were pretty tasteless, and although they had some sauces, there was no where near enough sauce for the amount of shrimp  Tomato Soup - Was good, but acidic, it needed a cream to break the acidity.  Bone-in Rib Eye - Way too fatty and tough.    Garlic Mashed - Good, esp with the Veal DemiGlace  Lobster Mac and Cheese - Good, very fishy flavor, if you like that.  it was  ok to me.  I have had This in other restaurants where it was not \\"lobster\\" enough.   This was not the case here.   The experience:  First, a different waiter than ours was retrieving plates near our table and dropped a plate on the floor, right next to us, glass shattered everywhere.  Hitting mine and my wife's bare feet and legs (We had Sandals on) The waiter didn't ask if we were ok, didn't apologize, he just acted as if nothing happened.  I was also worried that shards of glass maybe made it on our appetizer plates, because it was that explosive, but they did NOTHING about it.  My wife and I BOTH visibly checked our feet and legs and I had a knick on my leg from glass, the waiter saw us visually inspecting our feet and still said nothing.         Next, when I ordered the steak, Bone-in Rib eye,  I asked for Red Wine Reduction sauce and Herb Butter.  - When my steak was delivered, they forgot the Red Wine Reduction completely, and gave me what looked like Herb Butter, but chunkier.  Without testing it, I dolloped it on my steak and began spreading it, and noticed obvious Bleu Cheese chunks.  I tasted it and it was for SURE Blue Cheese, within the butter.   I did not order this of course, but I know Bleu Cheese for sure.   The waiter came back and I told him of the mistake, and he apologized, but also said they don't even have a Bleu cheese Butter, so he doesn't know how this happened.   He was good about it, but I did feel like they were calling me a bit of a lier as they mentioned a few times that they dont have Bleu cheese butter, and dont know that happened.   I cook... I know Blue cheese, AND, others on my table got the herb butter and it was completely different.     They did bring me a a new steak, BUT at that point I was eating after the rest of my party, and it was awkward.  To top it off, I was   Up to that point the best thing was the Red Wine Reduction, when they did bring it with my new steak.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What along with the Nevada Gaming Board signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas?\\" is \\"Hilton Hotels\\"?","output":"Yes, the correct answer to the question \\"What along with the Nevada Gaming Board signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas?\\" is \\"Hilton Hotels\\" as well as other established companies entering the gaming business. These legitimate companies along with Howard Hughes' investments brought new legitimacy to Las Vegas and helped draw a line between legal operations and mob-controlled casinos. This shift, in combination with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, signaled the decline of mob influence in the city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For example , the spin case allows only one magnetic dipole , but for spin - 1 particles magnetic quadrupoles and electrical dipoles are also possible . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"In order to determine whether these sentences are paraphrasing each other, I will compare their structure and meaning step by step. Sentence 1: - Begins with \\"For example\\" - Discusses the spin case allowing a magnetic dipole - For spin 1 particles, electric quadrupoles and magnetic dipoles are possible  Sentence 2: - Begins with \\"For example\\" - Discusses the spin case allowing only one magnetic dipole - For spin -1 particles, magnetic quadrupoles and electrical dipoles are possible Step 1: Both sentences start with \\"For example,\\" which indicates that the structure and overall intention may be similar. Step 2: Sentence 1 states that the spin case allows a magnetic dipole, while Sentence 2 specifies that it allows only one magnetic dipole. This slight difference implies the same core ideas, but with additional details provided in sentence 2. Thus, they are likely paraphrases. Step 3: Sentence 1 discusses properties of spin 1 particles where electric quadrupoles and magnetic dipoles are possible. Sentence 2 talks about properties of spin -1 particles where magnetic quadrupoles and electrical dipoles are possible. This reveals dissimilarity in the addressed particle properties, and in the associated dipoles and quadrupoles. Conclusion: Though the initial structure and focus on spin cases are similar, the sentences deviate in their descriptions of particle properties and associated dipoles and quadrupoles. Therefore, they are not paraphrases of each other, although they do share some common elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I heard that Cameron gave Carson his shirt back after washing it twice but still the stain didn't come out.  And I was wondering How would Cameron feel afterwards? The answer is:","output":"Cameron would likely experience a mix of emotions after returning the shirt to Carson despite washing it twice and not being able to remove the stain. These emotions could include frustration, disappointment, embarrassment, and possibly guilt. Let's take a closer look at each of these emotions and why Cameron may be experiencing them as a result of this situation. 1. Frustration: Cameron may feel frustrated for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they put in the effort to wash the shirt twice and were unable to remove the stain. Even if they tried different cleaning solutions and methods, they may feel like the time and energy invested in trying to fix the problem was wasted. Additionally, Cameron may be frustrated with the stain itself and its resiliency – something seemingly simple like a stain has resisted their best efforts to eliminate it. 2. Disappointment: Cameron likely returned the shirt to Carson with the intention of having it look as good as new. Instead, they had to give it back with the stain still present, which may leave Cameron feeling disappointed in both themselves and the situation. They may have hoped for a better outcome and might feel let down that they were unable to achieve it. 3. Embarrassment: If Cameron had promised or assured Carson that they would successfully remove the stain, they might feel embarrassed about having to admit that they were unable to do so. Depending on the situation, Cameron may worry about what Carson may think of them, their capabilities, or their sincerity in making the initial promise. This feeling of embarrassment could be heightened if other people were aware of the stain situation and the efforts Cameron had made to address it. 4. Guilt: Cameron may feel guilty for a few reasons. Firstly, if they initially caused the stain, they might feel a sense of responsibility for the damage and that they owe it to Carson to rectify the situation. Secondly, if they had previously assured Carson that they could remove the stain and failed to do so, they may feel guilty for not meeting Carson's expectations and potentially causing them further inconvenience or disappointment. Despite experiencing a range of emotions, it's essential for Cameron to remember that accidents happen and not every stain can be removed – especially given that they genuinely made an effort to fix the issue. Open communication between Cameron and Carson will be crucial in navigating the situation and finding a possible solution, such as compensating for the shirt or exploring further professional cleaning options."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Well, that's what Mark Zuckerburg, CEO and founder of Facebook, just said he would do. Zuckerburg and his wife Priscilla Chan promised to give 90% of their Facebook _ to society. Right now that is about 45 billion, and they plan to donate the money to things like science and education. Many billionaires have done similar things. Bill Gates, creator of Microsoft, made The Giving Pledge, an activity in which billionaires promise donate more than half of their wealth to charities. This started in 2010, and now 139 people from 15 countries joined it. But giving back and helping others isn't just for big billionaires. People like Zuckerberg, and Gates may have more to give, but people with less are doing it, too. Especially around the holidays, people want to do their part and give back to people who are less lucky than them. Schools may have food collections where people bring a few food items*, and together they can make a big donation to places like homeless people's homes. People also host special events like concerts of runs to be creative while raising money. Regular people donate whatever they can to US charities like the United Way and the American Red Cross.

Review: and self-conscious seams  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The given movie review sentence, \\"and self-conscious seams,\\" could suggest a negative connotation. To provide a detailed analysis of this phrase, it's essential to break down its components. Firstly, the term \\"self-conscious\\" typically indicates a sense of uneasiness, discomfort, or excessive concern about oneself. In the context of a movie review, this term might imply that the movie's elements, such as the plot, dialogues, or scenes, appear forced, overly cautious, or deliberately designed to draw attention. This may cause viewers to lose immersion and feel disconnected from the film's overall experience. Secondly, the word \\"seams\\" suggests the connections or bindings that hold together different elements or components. In terms of a movie, seams might refer to the narrative structure, transitions between scenes, or the way that multiple storylines or characters interconnect. When used negatively, it might imply that these connections are weak, disjointed, or too obvious. Thus, instead of seamlessly creating a coherent story, the film may struggle to maintain a smooth and cohesive flow, which can be an undesirable quality. In conclusion, based on the analysis of the terms \\"self-conscious\\" and \\"seams,\\" this movie review sentence leans towards a negative tone. The phrase suggests that the film in question suffers from a disjointed or forced narrative and that its elements do not merge well to create an engaging and immersive cinematic experience. However, it is worth noting that without more context, the ultimate interpretation of this sentence may vary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Warren Buffett this week donated 2.8billion of stock in his investment firm to five charities, as part of the billionaire's plan to give away nearly all of his wealth. Mr Buffett, 83, donated about 21.73million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway, the so-called Sage of Omaha's investment vehicle, a regulatory filing shows. About 16.6million shares, worth more than 2.1billion, went to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on education, health and poverty problems. Scroll down for video. Cool move: Warren Buffett eats an ice lolly. He has just donated nearly 3billion to charitable foundations. The rest went to four family charities, including a foundation named for his late first wife Susan and foundations for his children Howard, Peter and Susan. The 2.8billion is the most Buffett has donated to these charities, reflecting Berkshire's near-record share price, since he began making annual gifts in 2006. Mr Buffett still controls nearly 20 per cent of Berkshire's stock, which made him worth 65.8billion on Monday, the day the donation was made, according to Forbes magazine. Only Mexico telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim and Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and Berkshire director, were worth more, Forbes said. Thanks: Bill Gates, co-founder and co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which received shares in Berkshire Hathaway worth more than 2billion to invest in its charitable causes. Berkshire has more than 80 operating businesses and ended March with more than 146billion of stock and bond investments. Mr Buffett has run the Omaha, Nebraska-based company since 1965.

Stephanie Mack has revealed that she was so overcome. with emotion that she threw up the first time she went back into the home where. her husband killed himself. The widow of Mark Madoff said that she was also horrified to. still see the marks left by the dog leash on one of the beams which he used in. the hanging. Miss Mack said that she never intended to go back to. the apartment in Manhattan, New York, but did so along with their two children to give. them some ‘normalcy’. New home: Stephanie Mack revealed that she was so overcome with emotion that she threw up the first time she went back into the home where her husband Mark killed himself. In an interview she also revealed that for the first time. she is thinking about forgiving Bernie Madoff having previously said she would. ‘spit in his face’ if she saw him again. Miss Mack had vowed she would never set foot in her old. apartment in Manhattan after Mark’s suicide in 2010. He and his brother Andrew were the ones who turned in their. father in late 2008 over his £41 billion Ponzi scheme. He is now serving 150 years in jail for his crimes but the. fallout on his family has been even more devastating - with Mark unable to cope. with the pressure. Speaking to Harper’s Bazaar, Miss Mack, 37, said that. she decided to return to the SoHo loft with Audrey, five, Nicholas, three and. her own parents. New life: The widow of Mark Madoff said that she was also horrified to still see the marks left by the dog leash on one of the beams which Mark used in the hanging at their old home. She said: ‘I thought, you know, I need to bring, like,. normalcy back to their life? But when I got home and walked in the door, I threw up.’ Magazine: Stephanie Mack gave an interview in the 'Spring Fashion Issue' of Harper's Bazaar. Miss Mack had hired a builder to ‘cover up’ the steel. beam from which Mark hanged himself but unfortunately she could still see the. ‘scuff marks on the ceiling’. She said: ‘I mean, this is so gruesome, like, I guess from. hanging the dog leash over the thing. 'I don't know. And then the floor, from a. certain area, was really scratched up. I tried to figure out some clues and. stuff.’ Now living in a rented apartment in the Tribeca area of. Manhattan with her children, Miss Mack opened up about how Mark’s death. had affected them. She said they don’t talk about ‘Grandpa Bernie’ too much and. when asked about their father they say: ‘Daddy got a boo-boo on his brain that. made his heart stop.’ But more than a year after her husband’s death, Miss Mack  said that she was only now entertaining the idea of forgiveness. She said that in her gym class her instructor was talking. about how ‘if you don't have forgiveness, you're stuck’. She said: ‘I'm not going to be stuck. I'm going to move forward. I'm not going to let Bernie Madoff ruin my life anymore.’ Couple: More than a year after her husband Mark (right) died, Stephanie Mack said that she was only now entertaining the idea of forgiving her father-in-law Bernie. Family: Stephanie Mack's (left picture,. right) husband Mark Madoff (left picture, centre) committed suicide. after his father Bernie Madoff (right) was jailed - leaving two kids. including Nicholas (left picture, left) Last year Miss Mack gave an interview to ABC News in. which she said that if she saw Bernie she’d tell him ‘that I hold him. fully responsible for killing my husband, and I’d spit in his face’. 'I thought, you know, I need to bring, like, normalcy back to their life? But when I got home and walked in the door, I threw up' Stephanie Mack. She also wrote a bitter memoir titled ‘The End Of Normal: A. Wife’s Anguish, A Widow’s New Life’ in which she talked of how she coped with. the public humiliation of being part of America’s most notorious family. The book detailed how Bernie once eyed up her bottom. when she was pregnant with his grandchild and made crude jokes about how big it. was. Miss Mack also said that his wife Ruth was such a diet. freak she poured copious amounts of salt on food to stop her eating any more. than she deemed sufficient. Tragedy: Officials carry Mark's body out of his New York home after he was found hanged in December 2010. She is now calling herself 'Mack' as opposed to her former 'Madoff Mack' because she wants to avoid the hassle people give her. House of horror: The Manhattan apartment in which Mark Madoff was found hanged in SoHo, Manhattan. 'It just sucked to, like, pick up a prescription at the pharmacy and have someone say something,' she said. 'I don't feel ashamed anymore, but I don't want to have to hear it.' She chose the name Mack because of the M from Madoff and 'ACK', which is the airport code for Nantucket, the Massachusetts town where she and Mark loved spending time together. She told People magazine last October she felt ‘betrayed’ by Bernie and has not forgiven Ruth, or her husband’s brother Andrew, for allegedly abandoning Mark. Her late husband relentlessly followed news coverage about his father and failed in a 2009 suicide attempt, leaving a note saying his life was 'destroyed' and telling his dad: ‘F**k you’, she added. She told ABC that her daughter Audrey sometimes shouts ‘I love you, daddy!’ in the sky and recently asked her: ‘Why didn’t daddy take his cell phone with him when he died?’, reported People magazine. The couple wed in 2004 after meeting on a blind date when Miss Mack worked in fashion and Mark worked in finance. But she said his ‘handsome face aged overnight’ when Bernie was jailed. ‘The smile that made me fall in love with him disappeared altogether,’ she wrote in her book, adding that Mark would obsessively follow news reports in fear of being implicated in the scandal.

Now considering the other given options: - Players: This doesn't fit the context of being a \\"spot\\" or a location; it refers to the athletes participating in the game. - High School: While high school football games can be popular, they typically do not draw crowds as large as a hundred thousand people. - Texas and Oklahoma: These are states and do not denote a specific location or relevance to the football field being a popular spot. Hence, among all the options, \\"college campus\\" is the most logical choice as it provides the best context for a popular football field with a large crowd."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He needs to decide which research should get further funding.  Hint: Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research.

Article: It seems that all your friends' names on MSN have added a little green \\"I'm\\" symbol overnight. If you ask what is going on, someone will tell you it's a charity activity. Though this charity program has not yet officially begun for Chinese users, this little green symbol has proven popular among Chinese Windows Live Messenger users. Windows Live Messenger's official blog announced on March 1 that Microsoft was beginning an \\"I'm\\" program in the United States. Every time someone starts a conversation using \\"I'm\\", Microsoft shares a part of the program's advertising income with nine organizations devoted to social causes. With every instant message a user sends, it helps deal with things one feels most interested in, including poverty, child protection, disease and worsening environment. One only has to add a certain code next to one's name for the organization one would like to support. \\"*red'u\\" is for the American Red Cross, \\"*bgca\\" is for Boys & Girls Clubs of America and \\"*unicef\\" stands for the American branch of UNICEF. After a Chinese blogger named \\"hung\\" introduced this program on his blog on March 2, \\"I'm\\" entered the Internet in China with no actual support from Microsoft. Beijing-based Youth Weekend reported that famous IT blogger Keso regarded this program's rapid spread as a successful virus marketing case. He thinks that the success of the \\"I'm\\" program is because it's spread by users without being a bother to others. This answers why \\"I'm\\" has spread so rapidly across the Internet like a virus with almost no advertisement. However, Feng Jinhu from the press center for Microsoft China toldYouth Weekendthat the \\"I'm\\" project is only for Messenger users in the United States. Instant messages sent by Chinese users would not count. This has not affected Chinese Messenger users' interest in the little green symbol. These users hope their instant messages will actually contribute to charitable organizations someday. Question: The following descriptions about the \\"I'm\\" program are correct EXCEPT   _  .

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Where does Scout live in Go Set a Watchman?\\" is in \\"An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\".

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.

Options are: *description *entity *abbreviation *human *numeric *location","output":"The question \\"How many lawyers are there in the state of New Jersey?\\" is asking about a numeric entity.  The reason this question relates to a numeric entity is that it is seeking a specific number, which would indicate how many lawyers are present in New Jersey. A numeric entity refers to any question or statement that deals with numerical data or values. In this case, the value of interest is the count of lawyers within that location. Here's a brief explanation of why this question doesn't correspond to the other options listed: 1. Description: This option would pertain if the question was asking for a description of a lawyer's role or services in New Jersey or the legal landscape within the state. The question does not ask for such information and is primarily focused on a numerical value. 2. Entity: An entity refers to a thing, person, organization, or other objects. While the question does mention lawyers, it is not asking about an individual lawyer or a law firm but the number of professionals in that occupation. 3. Abbreviation: The question is not seeking the meaning or clarification of an abbreviation. It simply asks for a numerical count of lawyers in the state of New Jersey. 4. Human: Although the question is about lawyers, who are humans, the main focus of the inquiry is not about a specific person or their characteristics. Instead, it is about the total number of individuals in that particular profession. 5. Location: The question does mention a specific location, which is New Jersey; however, it does not inquire about details or information of that location itself. Instead, it revolves around a numerical value for the quantity of lawyers in New Jersey.

They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration. This narration mostly matches the prologue of Night of the Ghouls (1959), with one minor variation and an additional line. The phrase \\"world between the living and the dead\\" of the original is changed to \\"void between...\\". There is also a new line at the end: \\"A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world!\\"[1] The opening credits feature the image of \\"an immobile young woman clad in gold\\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).[1] Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff.[1] The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \\"Princess of the Night\\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.[1] As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames. The woman dances and strips before the flames of the cemetery.[1] The Black Ghoul then introduces the second dancer of the night, a street walker in life. While the...

The construction of the giant banana plant started 50 years ago by a mysterious figure known as \\"The Bananarchist.\\" Unbeknownst to the islanders, this individual sealed Torsillo's fate and left it on the brink of discovery when their story started. Act 1: Our protagonist, Mia, is a 12-year-old curious and lively girl who thrives on plucky adventures. She stumbles upon an ancient diary hidden away in her grandmother's dusty attic while rummaging through her belongings. Mia learns about Rossana, an enigmatic and legendary figure who founded the colossal banana plant that put Torsillo on the map. As Mia dives deeper into the diary, a secret about the founder comes to light. Rossana, known as \\"The Bananarchist,\\" was on a personal quest to discover the rarest, most magical banana species in the world, the \\"Golden Joy,\\" a prize that promises to unlock infinite joy and happiness. To protect her secret, she built the plant structure as a tribute to conceal her real purpose. Act 2: Intrigued, Mia joins forces with her best friend, Pete, a history and technology nerd. Together, they face a series of puzzles, riddles, and challenges, following the clues strewn throughout the diary. They discover that the \\"Golden Joy\\" harbors a secret recipe that, when consumed, brings euphoria and genuine contentment.

Act 3: Mia and Pete must race against time to unveil this once-in-a-lifetime discovery before the evil corporation takes over. They unravel the hidden connection between the ancient lore and Torsillo's contemporary secrets. Amidst action-packed scenes, teamwork, and a touch of magic, Mia and Pete reach the heart of \\"The Bananarchist's\\" hidden chamber. There, they are met with a choice - take the \\"Golden Joy\\" and share it with the world or destroy the recipe to prevent its nefarious exploitation. In the final act, they opt for the latter, sacrificing their dream of unlocking endless joy to keep the world from falling under the corporate control of TropicoTech. Their heroic actions echo true to the core values of Torsillo: happiness, integrity, and connection, values that the \\"Golden Joy\\" could never equal.

Which may sound odd coming from someone who ceaselessly praises love and sex, but it is true. I am not a fan. My mother and father were married in a small Baptist Church on Valentine’s Day in 1959. They are no longer together. They are still technically married but my father now lives in a residential care home for dementia patients and my mother lives alone. My father’s disease makes him angry and aggressive leaving my mother with blurred and fading memories of his kindness. It is a sad day for all those whose partners are transformed into strangers by illnesses. Some things aren’t fair. It is my step(ish) daughter’s birthday on Valentine’s Day (I am not married to my boyfriend so I can’t claim to be a step-mum and there is no other term for it). The end of my boyfriend’s marriage has put continents between him and his children. When he hangs up the phone after talking to his daughter, his eyes are dark with pain. It is a sad day for all those whose love is diluted by oceans. Some things can’t be changed. I remember the last Valentine’s Day I spent with my ex-husband. I was a couple of weeks away from moving out but I hadn’t told him yet. I felt sick and scared and heartbroken. My husband and I passed the entire day without speaking. As I stood on the edge of the cliff summoning up the courage to jump, I felt entirely alone. It is a sad day for all those whose love has withered away. Some things can’t be fixed.

Write a text based on \\"argentina denies suspending commercial ties with iran\\" Text:","output":"Title: Argentina Refutes Claims of Suspending Commercial Ties with Iran In recent news, the Argentine government has released an official statement debunking the rumors suggesting the suspension of commercial ties with Iran. This clarification comes in response to multiple reports circulating in local and international media, which implied possible economic fallout between the two countries. Argentina and Iran have a long history of trade relations, focusing primarily on commodities such as agricultural products, oil, and natural resources. By asserting that these connections have not been severed, both nations aim to ensure economic stability and maintain mutual trust. Unverified reports had previously insinuated that Argentina's relationship with Iran was on precarious ground, citing concerns about the latter's nuclear program and alleged support for extremist organizations. However, the Argentine government has taken a firm stance with its clarification, emphasizing that their primary focus remains bolstering economic cooperation and fostering diplomatic ties with the Islamic Republic. While both countries have faced their share of political turmoil, Argentina's economic landscape has experienced a special measure of instability in recent years. Its government has been working laboriously to revitalize the economy through various initiatives and by positioning itself as an attractive partner in international trade. In this context, maintaining healthy relations with Iran can be considered an essential aspect of Argentina's long-term economic strategy. Iran, on the other hand, has also been making efforts to expand its global trade. By cultivating alliances with key players, including Argentina, Iran can strengthen its footing on the international scene, despite ongoing disputes with Western nations over its nuclear program. In addition, the continuation of fruitful trade relations with Argentina can help mitigate some of the challenges Iran faces, such as economic sanctions imposed by the United States. Argentina's denial of suspending commercial ties highlights the larger issue of misinformation in today's hyperconnected world. Diplomatic relations between countries may sometimes be inaccurately portrayed in media or misinformation roadmaps, and it is crucial for governments to dispel these rumors quickly and effectively in order to avoid any unnecessary complications or misunderstandings. In conclusion, while there may be underlying concerns and differing political agendas between Argentina and Iran, both nations have shown a commitment to continue fostering economic ties and diplomatic cooperation. It is evident from Argentina's official statement that the two countries understand the importance of their partnership and will continue to support each other in the global market. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of open dialogue and factual information in sustaining diplomatic links. Argentina and Iran's joint rejection of rumors surrounding their commercial ties serves as a reminder that reinforcing sound international relationships is a collective responsibility, one that ultimately benefits every party involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Add baking soda to the wash. Add vinegar to the wash. Add a damp washcloth to the dyer. Shake your clothes.\\"","output":"Title: The Secret Sauce for Cleaner, Fresher Clothes using Baking Soda, Vinegar, and Damp Washcloth Introduction A popular saying amongst avid laundry enthusiasts is \\"when in doubt, use baking soda and vinegar.\\" Although it may seem like an old wives' tale, there's scientific evidence illustrating just how effective these two household items are when it comes to laundering clothes. In combination with some other easy laundering techniques, you can drastically improve the quality, appearance, and lifespan of your garments. This article explores the effectiveness of adding baking soda, vinegar, and a damp washcloth to your laundry routine. The Power Duo: Baking Soda and Vinegar 1. Baking Soda Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a mildly alkaline compound that can dissolve dirt, grease, and odors. This versatile ingredient is highly effective to use in laundry as it works to: - Enhance detergent performance: Baking soda helps your detergent work more efficiently by softening the water, enabling the detergent to target and remove dirt and stains more effectively. - Deodorize and freshen: Baking soda's alkaline nature neutralizes acidic odor molecules, getting rid of unpleasant smells on fabrics. - Brighten and whiten: The gentle abrasiveness of baking soda helps to remove dirt and stains that cause dullness, making colors more vibrant and whites whiter. 2. Vinegar Vinegar, specifically white vinegar, is an incredible solution for laundry care purposes. The weak acetic acid in vinegar works as an excellent natural cleaner. It helps to: - Remove lingering odors: Similar to baking soda, vinegar neutralizes unpleasant odors ensuring your clothes come out smelling fresh. - Soften fabric: Vinegar acts as a natural fabric softener, reducing static cling and leaving your clothes feeling softer to touch. - Prevent color fading: Adding white vinegar to your wash can help stabilize colors and prevent them from bleeding or fading. - Break down residue: Vinegar breaks down detergent residue, preventing that stiff sensation in your dried laundry. The Damp Washcloth Hack If you're tired of wrinkled clothes but don't have time for ironing or steaming, the damp washcloth hack is a quick and effective solution. Throwing a clean, damp washcloth into the dryer with your clothes produces steam, which smooths out wrinkles and helps reduce the time needed for your garments to dry. Putting it All Together 1. Add baking soda to the wash: To enjoy the benefits of baking soda, add half a cup of it during the wash cycle, along with your regular detergent. Avoid combining it with bleach, as it may cause a reaction. 2. Add vinegar to the wash: Pour one cup of white vinegar into the rinse cycle. Do not worry about the vinegar smell; it usually dissipates after drying. 3. Get a damp washcloth ready: After your clothes have gone through the washing cycle, wring out a clean washcloth, and moisten it with water.  4. Dry your clothes with the damp washcloth: Add the damp washcloth into the dryer along with the washed clothes. This method helps reduce wrinkles, static, and speeds up the drying time. Drying on low heat with shorter times also helps in reducing overall energy usage. 5. Shake your clothes: After the drying process, give each garment a vigorous shake. This will not only alleviate any remaining wrinkles but help in fluffing and softening your clothes as well. Conclusion Incorporating baking soda, vinegar, and a damp washcloth into your laundry routine is an easy, cost-effective way to achieve cleaner and fresher clothes without resorting to harsh chemicals. With these eco-friendly, non-toxic household items, you can make a positive impact on the environment while also keeping your wardrobe looking and smelling fantastic. So, next time you do laundry, don't forget this powerful trio to elevate your laundry game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain. With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels, a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum, Eastbourne was developed by the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries.  - An escarpment is a steep slope or long cliff that forms as an effect of faulting or erosion and separates two relatively level areas of differing elevations. Usually \\"escarpment\\" is used interchangeably with scarp (from the Italian \\"scarpa\\", shoe). But some sources differentiate the two terms, where \\"escarpment\\" refers to the margin between two landforms, while \\"scarp\\" is synonymous with a cliff or steep slope. The surface of the steep slope is called a scarp face.This (escarpment) is a ridge which has a gentle(dip) slope on one side and a steep (scarp) slope on the other side.  - Beachy Head is a chalk headland in East Sussex, England. It is situated close to Eastbourne, immediately east of the Seven Sisters.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - The South Downs National Park is England's newest National Park, having become fully operational on 1 April 2011.

Areas are designated in recognition of their national importance, by the relevant public body: Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, or the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. In place of AONB, Scotland uses the similar national scenic area designation. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty enjoy levels of protection from development similar to those of UK national parks, but unlike with national parks the responsible bodies do not have their own planning powers. They also differ from national parks in their more limited opportunities for extensive outdoor recreation.  - A national scenic area (NSA) is a conservation designation used in Scotland, and currently administered by Scottish Natural Heritage. NSAs are defined as having outstanding scenic interest or unsurpassed attractiveness.

Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas.  - Shoreham-by-Sea (often shortened to Shoreham) is a seaside town and port in West Sussex, England.  - Winchester is a city and the county town of Hampshire, England.

In week 14, the Lions hosted a rematch with their NFC North rivals the Minnesota Vikings. The Lions took an early lead which they never gave back after Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder fumbled the ball on the Vikings' first offensive play of the game and Stephen Tulloch picked it up in the end zone for a touchdown. The Lions added more points when Titus Young caught a Matthew Stafford pass and ran it in 57 yards for a TD, and added another seven when Brandon Pettigrew caught a 12-yard pass. The Vikings got on the board late in the first quarter when Visanthe Shiancoe caught a seven-yard pass from Ponder. In the second quarter, Detroit's defense scored again when Alphonso Smith intercepted a Ponder pass and ran it back 30 yards for a TD. Minnesota responded when Percy Harvin caught a six-yard touchdown pass. The Lions scored the final points of the first half when Jason Hanson kicked a 30-yard field goal. This was their first 31-point first half since 1985. After halftime, Vikings backup quarterback Joe Webb came into the game and ran in a touchdown himself from 65 yards out. In the fourth quarter, the Lions scored their only points of the second half when Hanson kicked his second field goal of the game, this one from 26 yards out. Minnesota responded with a two-yard TD catch by Toby Gerhart. After a defensive stop, the Vikings attempted a late comeback when they drove down the field in the final minute of the game, but Webb fumbled the ball after being sacked by DeAndre Levy on first and goal with nine seconds left, evading a facemask call, but handing the Lions the victory.

This study aims to review the miss rate of polyps both on the patient-level and on the polyp-level and to analyze the factors affecting the miss rate such as those related to the endoscopist, procedure, patient, and polyp.', 'From August 2011 to August 2013, patients who underwent elective second colonoscopy for resection of polyps, the sizes of which were not small enough to be resected by biopsy forceps alone at first colonoscopy, were enrolled retrospectively.', 'The miss rate on the patient-level was 59.2% (234/395) and on the polyp-level was 27.9% (578/2,068). There was no significant difference in the miss rate depending on the experience of the endoscopists or characteristics of the patients. In terms of the procedure, the miss rate was higher when the colonoscopy was performed in the afternoon (OR 1.632, p=0.046). It was found that the miss rate of polyps increased when the polyps were small (OR 4.595, p<0.001 in <5 mm/OR 3.447, p<0.001 in 5-10 mm), flat or sessile (OR 2.406, p<0.001 in flat/OR 1.768, p=0.002 in sessile), and located in the left colon (OR 1.391, p=0.007). Answer: The experience of endoscopists did not have influence on the accuracy of polyp detection. However, the fatigue of endoscopists in the afternoon is considered to render polyp detection less accurate. Also, the large curves and folds of the sigmoid colon are regarded as a reason for the higher miss rate of polyps in the left colon.

The crowd gasped with oohs and aahs when Chris Sheldon pulled his company’s new gadget from a silky black bag in front of hundreds of techies. “We are very proud to introduce the least-advanced NoPhone ever,” he said at a technology conference in Canada this month. The NoPhone is a plastic rectangle that looks like a smartphone but does absolutely nothing. More than 10,000 have been sold in the past two years for about 10 each. The latest model is simply a plastic package with nothing but air inside. Mr. Sheldon and his business partner, Van Gould, call it the NoPhone Air. “We took away the headphone jack. And then we took away everything else,” Mr. Gould said to the crowd. “It may look like nothing is in this packaging. But that’s what’s so beautiful about it.” As millions of people around the world race to buy Apple Inc. AAPL -0.01 % ’s new iPhone 7 and wireless AirPods headphones, Messrs. Sheldon and Gould are part of the growing smartphone-resistant counterculture. They were inspired to make the NoPhone, pitched as “a fake phone for people addicted to real phones,” after seeing everyone at a rooftop bar in New York glued to their smartphones. Other anti-smartphone converts have reverted back to flip phones and created vacation companies, mobile apps and fabric bags that block cell signals. Last week, superstar Kanye West tweeted: “I got rid of my phone so I can have air to create.” Singer Katy Perry replied: “unplug to connect.” Stand-up comedian Brett Kline got so frustrated with smartphone selfie sticks that he made a video of him snipping them with bolt cutters all over New York. It turned out to be a prank, with fake phones and actors as the victims, but the video has more than 1.3 million views on YouTube since Sept. 1. “Technology is making people sociopaths,” says Buddy Bolton, a comedian who recorded the selfie-stick clip-and-run incidents with Mr. Kline. Even the original human voice of Siri, the iPhone’s virtual assistant, in the U.S. says it is time for people to put down their smartphones. “Their minds are somewhere else, or they’re staring at their phones. And they don’t know how to relate to other humans,” says Susan Bennett, a voiceover actress. “Everybody is running around taking 15 million pictures of their own face.” The conference where Messrs. Sheldon and Gould unveiled the NoPhone Air on Sept. 10 took place at a summer camp about two hours west of Ottawa, where there was no cellphone reception and no devices allowed. Toronto lawyers Steven Pulver and Daniel Levine started the Fireside Conference in early 2015. They had attended dozens of tech conferences over the years and felt like smartphones were taking over. At most other events, says Mr. Pulver, you spend “half the time tweeting or having your head down in your phone.” The two men decided to create a technology gathering without technology. They worried last year that no one would show up to the first conference. Mr. Levine, 28 years old, says some people told them: “We can’t get away for a weekend and have no cellphone.” It turned out that the absence of cellphones led to social interactions many people weren’t used to. Without Google Maps, people had to ask for directions around the sprawling camp. Attendance at this year’s conference more than doubled to about 270 people. “You have to go up to a stranger, you might have to meet them, you might have to have a conversation,” says Mr. Gould, 30. “I think we had more eye contact this weekend than probably any time since we were children.” Douglas Duncan of the University of Colorado has studied the impact that technology can have on the classroom. He has tried desperately to keep students off their phones during his astronomy class. About 70% of college students use their phones during class, according to his research, and grades for those students are about a half-letter lower on average than for students who don’t use their phones. Last year, Dr. Duncan told students to download Flipd, an app that tracked their phone use during his lectures. He said he would get a report showing which students opened their phones and give extra credit of one percentage point to those who opened them the least. About a third of the class used them anyway. Phones are “pretty addicting,” he laments. Flipd’s marketing director, Alanna Harvey, says the free app has nearly 50,000 downloads. It was originally developed as a way for parents to limit children’s smartphone usage by locking down certain apps or the entire phone during preset times. Flipd soon realized adults were using it on themselves. “We had people asking us for more and more hours,” not just the one or two hours Flipd allowed at first, she says. “People were like: ‘I want 8 hours.’” Ms. Harvey, 25, has an iPhone, but it doesn’t have a data plan and she uses it only in areas with Wi-Fi access. Her primary device is a flip phone, which she started using to save money and kept because she liked having fewer distractions. “There’s only so much you can do,” she says. Joe Hollier thought even flip phones had too many features, so he created the Light Phone, a credit-card sized device that costs 100. The “phone away from phone,” as he calls it, lets users make and receive phone calls but nothing else. Calls are forwarded from the owner’s primary phone number. “Do I always want a computer in my pocket? Probably not,” says Mr. Hollier, 26, a Brooklyn, N.Y., artist turned tech entrepreneur. The Light Phone will be available later this year and has more than 6,000 presales so far. Matt McCausland found it hard to put down the NoPhone that was in his gift bag at the tech conference in Canada. He says he took at least 50 fake group selfies in two days. As a joke, “I would pull it out when you would normally pull your phone out,” pretending to answer an incoming call or order car service using Uber, says Mr. McCausland. “The ironic thing is it actually did set my mind at ease, so I wasn’t missing my phone anymore. My actual phone.” Write to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com Summary:","output":"Two guys made a pretend phone called the \\"NoPhone\\" that doesn't do anything, but looks like a smartphone.

Here is an article: As if things couldn’t have been worse for the vagrant whose face was chewed off by the horrifying “Miami Zombie,” doctors revealed Tuesday that he also had what appeared to be gunshot wounds — likely fired by the cops trying to save him. Ronald Poppo, 65, had two “mysterious” holes in his left chest when he was brought bleeding to Miami’s Jackson Memorial Hospital, apparently entry and exit wounds, doctors said. Maniac Rudy Eugene, who was not armed, was on top of Poppo when police opened fire to stop the gruesome attack on May 26. A stray bullet appears to have hit the victim, too. Poppo is recovering surprisingly well —eating, walking and even cheering on his basketball team, doctors said. They released two graphic photos of Poppo, showing him in a hospital gown walking down a hallway with help. His nose and right eye are gone, his left eyes remains under protective covering and his forehead and cheeks are a mass of bloody wounds. The bottom half of his face, from his salt-and-pepper mustache on down, appears okay. “He’s coping remarkably well,” trauma surgeon Nicholas Namias told reporters. “The guy has got to be a survivor.” Doctors said Poppo remembers the horrifying attack but has displayed a surprisingly upbeat attitude. “He’s a very nice guy, really. He’s charming,” Namias added. Just before the news conference, he told his doctors: “Go Heat!” The Miami Heat played Oklahoma City on Tuesday night in the first game of the NBA Finals. Poppo, who was blinded in the attack, has undergone three surgeries so far — including skin grafts — and will need more. “First, he needs to recover from the three surgeries he’s already had,” said plastic surgeon Wrood Kassira. He will remain hospitalized for “weeks at least,” Kassira added. The hospital has started a fund to collect donations for the destitute vagrant’s care. So far, they’ve raised 15,000. Doctors said they won’t know whether Poppo can be a candidate for a face transplant — a new procedure funded by the Defense Department — until his wounds heal. The bizarre attack on Poppo, a homeless alcoholic who graduated from Manhattan’s prestigious Stuyvesant High School, captured the sympathy of the world. He was reclining under a n overpass on Memorial Day weekend when a naked lunatic named Rudy Eugene beat him and chewed off 50% of his face. Eugene, 31, shed all his clothes and scattered ripped-out pages from the Bible he always carried as he walked along the MacArthur Causeway joining the city to Miami Beach, CBS reported. Eugene was shot and killed by police when he refused to stop attacking Poppo. An autopsy found no parts of Poppo’s face in Eugene’s stomach — contradicting accounts by appalled witnesses that the attacker was swallowing the pieces of flesh he ripped away with his teeth. The autopsy found traces of marijuana but no explanation for Eugene’s unusual behavior, although more tests are pending. Poppo’s estranged daughter, Janice Poppo DiBello, 44, had no comment on the new developments about her father’s condition when reached at her New Jersey home. With Jennifer H.

However, I can help you understand what translation is and how it works between Japanese and Serbian languages. Translation means changing words or text from one language to another. In this case, between Japanese and Serbian. Japanese is the language spoken by people in Japan, and Serbian is the language spoken by people in Serbia. Both languages have their unique alphabet and characters, so when translating, the words are changed from one language's alphabet and characters to the other language's alphabet and characters. When you want to translate something from Japanese to Serbian, you need a person or a tool, like a translator, to help you change the words from Japanese language to Serbian language, so people who speak Serbian can understand it. Punctuation marks, like commas, periods, and question marks, are important too because they help us understand when one sentence (or thought) ends, and another begins. For a five-year-old, imagine that you have a toy or picture that you want to show your friend, but your friend speaks a different language. You ask an older brother, sister, or a teacher to help explain your toy or picture to your friend in the language they understand.

Produced by Roger Pusey, and assisted by Ted De Bono, this version of the song was first included on the 1984 compilation Hatful of Hollow. On 28 October 1983, the \\"Manchester\\" version was released in the UK in 7\\" and 12\\" formats, reaching number 25 in the UK charts. The record sleeve uses a still frame from Jean Cocteau's 1949 film Orphée, featuring French actor Jean Marais. The song was later included as a bonus track on the cassette version of the band's debut album The Smiths in the UK, and subsequently on all American versions. Following the 1989 bankruptcy of Rough Trade, WEA Records purchased the Smiths' back catalogue. In 1992 WEA re-issued the band's catalogue, and all subsequent pressings of The Smiths have incorporated \\"This Charming Man\\". WEA re-released the single itself in 1992 to support the Best...

The reissued single reached number 8 on the British singles chart, the band's highest chart placing.In December 1983, DJ François Kevorkian released a \\"New York\\" mix of the single on Megadisc records. Kevorkian geared the song for nightclub dancefloors. The track was intended to be pressed in limited numbers for New York club DJs.

They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Which crop would be more beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? Answer:","output":"Crop A would be more beneficial to farmers, as it is herbicide tolerant and would allow for improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

(CNN) -- A grand jury has brought felony charges against three Dallas, Texas, police officers who were caught on patrol car dashboard cameras beating a motorcyclist after a chase, prosecutors said Thursday.  Officers Paul Bauer and Kevin Randolph were charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant, a charge that carries a five-year minimum prison term, in the September 5 beating of motorcyclist Andrew Collins. A third officer, Henry Duetsch, was charged with third-degree felony of tampering with physical evidence, said Jamille Bradfield, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney's office.  Bauer was also charged with assault and with official oppression, both misdemeanors. Randolph -- who was fired for failing probation after the incident -- was charged with official oppression and tampering with a governmental record, another felony.  There was no immediate response to the charges from the three defendants.  Prosecutors say Bauer and Randolph spotted Collins sitting on his motorcycle on a sidewalk the night of September 5. He drove off when the officers shined a spotlight on him, and they began pursuing him. An internal investigation found that Bauer and Randolph disregarded an order to stop the chase, with one of the officers saying, \\"Keep us going. I'm going to kick the s--- out of him.\\"  Collins eventually stopped, and when the officers spotted him, Bauer struck the bike with his patrol car.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that created the Oviri ceramic?, using the article: Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Paul Gauguin is the name of the person who created the Oviri ceramic. He was primarily a painter and began working with ceramics around 1886 under the mentorship of French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. Gauguin's experience in Tahiti influenced his creation of the Oviri ceramic, as he depicted themes of melancholy, death, and the Tahitian concept of faaturuma in his artwork. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894 after returning from Tahiti and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Halmstad Municipality (\\"Halmstads kommun\\") is a municipality in Halland County on the Swedish west coast, in which the city Halmstad is the seat.  - Timber framing and \\"post-and-beam\\" construction are methods of building with heavy timbers rather than dimensional lumber such as 2x4s. Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east.

Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Halmstad is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of Nissan in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast. Halmstad is the seat of Halmstad Municipality and the capital of Halland County. The city had a population of 92,797 in 2012, out of a municipal total of over 90,000 (18th most populous - 2012). Halmstad is Sweden's 20th-largest city by population and located about midway between Gothenburg (the second most populous) and Malmö (the third). It is Europe's northernmost city with a lot of timber framing architecture.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund.

The current generation of VAs are consumer products like Apple Siri, Google Now, Microsoft Cortana. Smaller innovators like Viv Labs are pursuing a less hardware or operating system dependent architecture. In the enterprise marketplace VA capabilities feature in technologies like IBM's Watson and Amelia from IPsoft. In 2014, there has been a surge in acquisitions of related artificial intelligence technologies by all the major technology companies.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Omnivore is a consumption classification for animals that have the capability to obtain chemical energy and nutrients from materials originating from plant and animal origin. Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well.  - The pig-footed bandicoot (\\"Chaeropus ecaudatus\\") was a small marsupial of the arid and semi-arid plains of Australia. The distribution range of the species was later reduced to an inland desert region, where it was last recorded in the 1950s; it is now presumed to be extinct.  - Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka.  - Bandicoots are a group of about 20 species of small to medium-sized, terrestrial marsupial omnivore in the order Peramelemorphia. They are endemic to the AustraliaNew Guinea region.  - The Peramelidae family of marsupials contains all of the extant bandicoots . One known extinct species of bandicoot , the pig - footed bandicoot , was so different from the other species , it was recently moved into its own family . Four fossil peramelids are described . They are found throughout Australia and New Guinea , with at least some species living in every available habitat , from rainforest to desert .  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.  - The order Peramelemorphia includes the bandicoots and bilbies: it equates approximately to the mainstream of marsupial omnivores. All members of the order are endemic to the twin land masses of Australia-New Guinea and most have the characteristic bandicoot shape: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, very large upright ears, relatively long, thin legs, and a thin tail. Their size varies from about 140 grams up to 4 kilograms, but most species are about the weight of a half-grown kitten: somewhere around one kilogram.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania.

Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say.

Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well.

Built high on the center of Galveston Island, away from the deadly storms of the Gulf, away from the noise and stink of the port. White servants and negro slaves. Fair-haired women to sit at the piano in his parlor. Dark-skinned women to open their legs to him in the secrecy of the night... He sat up in a sweat. I will think no evil thoughts, he told himself. Outside, the sun rose over New Orleans. Horse-drawn carts creaked and rattled through the streets, and chickens complained about the light.

Q:Process:  - Determine the weather where you are going - Pack essential items in your suitcase such as underwear/socks - Pack weather appropriate clothing in the suitcase - Always bring a jacket or two - Always bring one semi-formal outfit for a nice dinner - Zip up the bag and be ready to go.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are less electrical signals in the brain happens, how will it affect you pack less of the most appropriate clothes.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process as listed is a set of very concrete steps but when considering the perturbation hypothesis, it's essential to understand that it speaks of \\"less electrical signals in the brain.\\" This perturbation seems to refer to a possible decrease in cognitive function or attention.  If, for example, it's interpreted as a lesser cognitive function, that could affect the decision-making capacity, memory recall, or attention to detail - all of which could impact the packing process.  1. Determine the weather: This first step would likely remain unchanged even with less electrical signals in the brain. One would simply check a weather application or website to determine the weather at the intended destination, which doesn't require a significant amount of cognitive processing. 2. Pack essential items: This step might be impacted by a decrease in electrical signals in the brain, as one must remember what the essential items are. If one's memory or decision-making faculties are impaired, they might forget to pack some essentials. 3. Pack weather-appropriate clothing: This step could require some decision-making, which could be affected by reduced cognitive function. Depending on the severity of the decrease in brain signals, one might pack less suitable clothing. 4. Always bring a jacket or two: This is more of an automatic step that if previously learned should not require high cognitive resources, therefore this would not be significantly affected. 5. Always bring one semi-formal outfit: Similar to the above point, it's an automatic action, as long as the person remembers that this is part of their packing routine.  6. Zip up the bag and go: This final step would not get affected as it doesn't need much cognitive resources. In summary, the perturbation may affect steps where judgment, decision-making, or memory recall are necessary. For those tasks that are routine or do not require significant cognitive function, the process would likely be unaffected. However, any potential effects would largely depend on how severe the decrease in electrical signals is, and how it specifically impacts cognitive function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Countless homes were destroyed and lots of people became homeless after the earthquake which is believed to have a magnitude of 7. The quake was not as serious as the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in 2008 that left more than 70,000 people dead in the Wenchuan area. But villagers who work in Chengdu, about 100 miles away, hurried back home Sunday morning, many on foot, the lucky ones on motorbikes, to check on their homes. Song Yuanqing, 43, a worker, arrived back after a 22-hour trip and found his house was still there but had already been very unstable . \\"We would like to do something, but we can't do anything,\\" Mr. Song said as he sat with neighbors around an outdoor fire built by the village leader in his backyard. In all, the government sent about 7,000 soldiers and People's Armed Police officers to the earthquake-hit area. By Saturday evening, there were so many rescue workers in the area that the government asked volunteers to stop coming. Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, flew to the area and slept in a tent on Saturday evening in Lushan County. The earthquake shook Sichuan Province at 8 a.m., when people were getting up a little later than usual because schools and universities were closed. \\"We were just getting up and getting dressed in our dormitory when the building shook, and I looked outside from our window and saw a row of houses had collapsed,\\" Xu Yan, 22, a student at the Agricultural University in Ya'an, said in a telephone interview. \\" _ .\\" The Chinese government said early Sunday that the death toll was 174, and about 5,700 people had been injured.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions you asked are not the same; they address two different aspects of Quora – one is related to the collapsing of answers and reviews, while the other involves appealing a Quora Moderation decision. Let's discuss each topic separately and in detail: 1. Why are answers and reviews on Quora collapsed? Answers and reviews on Quora can be collapsed for several reasons, mainly to ensure the content provided adheres to the platform's guidelines and policies. Collapsing means that the answer or review is hidden from public view. The collapse of content can occur due to the following reasons: a. Violation of Quora's policies and guidelines: If the content is found to be abusive, offensive, or it contains plagiarism, then it may be collapsed. Quora has strict guidelines in place to maintain a respectful and constructive environment for its users.  b. Low-quality content: Quora values high-quality and informative answers. If the answer is poorly written, offers no valuable information, or it is too brief and fails to address the question, it is more likely to be collapsed. c. Unverifiable or speculative content: If an answer contains information that can't be verified or is purely speculative, there's a chance that it will be collapsed to maintain the standard and credibility of the platform. d. Spam or promotion: Quora is not a platform for self-promotion or spam. If an answer or review contains links to commercial websites, affiliations, or if it serves as an advertisement, it can be collapsed. e. User reports or flags: If other users on the platform find the answer or review offensive or inappropriate, they can report it. Based on the number of reports, the Quora Moderation team may decide to collapse the content. 2. How do I appeal a Quora Moderation decision? If you believe that your content was collapsed in error or you have a disagreement with the moderation decision, you can appeal it. Here are the steps to appeal a Quora Moderation decision: a. First, you need to find the email notification from Quora, informing you about the collapsed answer or review. This email will contain a link to the content. b. Once you have located the link, click on it. You should be redirected to the collapsed content on Quora's website or app. c. Below the collapsed content, you will see an option to appeal the decision. Click on \\"Appeal\\" to begin the process. d. A form will be displayed, asking you to provide a reason for your appeal. Here, you can explain why you believe the collapsed content is in line with Quora's guidelines and policies, or describe the corrections you've made to the content. e. After submitting the appeal form, Quora Moderation will review your request. You will receive an email notification once the decision is made. Please note that the appeals process may take some time, depending on the volume of requests the Moderation team is handling. In conclusion, the two questions you asked address different aspects of using the Quora platform: one relates to the reasons behind the collapsing of content, while the other focuses on the process of appealing a moderation decision."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Even the Lord of the Flies was entirely erased from the movie, the subject that the book is titled after has been left out! That's just totally unacceptable. The beast, which was just as important to the meaning of the book as the Lord of the Flies, was totally changed. The pilot (who shouldn't be there to begin with) was the beast and after the boys found him, that was it, the beast was gone. Imagine what Sir William Golding thought of it...

Article: Photo: Getty      Australia’s Liberal Party government has announced that it will soon be illegal to purchase anything over 10,000 AU (7,500 US) with cash. The government says it’s, “encouraging the transition to a digital society,” and cracking down on tax evasion. But not everyone is happy with the move.      “This will be bad news for criminal gangs, terrorists and those who are just trying to cheat on their tax or get a discount for letting someone else cheat on their tax,” Treasurer Scott Morrison said in a speech announcing the government’s new budget. “It’s not clever. It’s not OK. It’s a crime.”      Advertisement      The ban starts on July 1, 2019 and any payment over 10,000 will have to be made by check or credit/debit card. The government will enforce the measure by allocating roughly 300 million for what it calls the Black Economy Standing Taskforce. The goal is to drum up about 3 billion in new tax revenue over the next four years.      As The Guardian points out, one of the biggest targets for the new task force will be the illicit tobacco trade. Australia has the highest tax on cigarettes in the world, with an average pack costing about 40 AU (30 US). But there’s a huge black market for cigarettes, which comes from both stolen goods and smuggling from outside the country. Taxes aren’t paid on cigarettes until the point of sale, so theft from tobacco warehouses is unusually common in Australia.      Australians have a strange relationship with cash—strange in the sense that they still use it. Roughly 37 percent of all commercial transactions in Australia are made using cash. That number is just 32 percent in the U.S. and 15 percent in Sweden. Many Swedes are angry about its slow move to a cashless society, arguing that going completely digital causes security concerns. And India began phasing out a whopping 86 percent of its currency in November of 2016 by invalidating 500 and 1,000-rupee notes as legal tender.      Advertisement      But there are also regional quirks that make the Australian government more prone to crack down on cash. For instance, it’s almost impossible to find a 100 bill in circulation in Australia. The Reserve Bank of Australia still prints the 100, so where do they all go? The rarity of the 100 note (nicknamed The Kermit for its green color) is attributed to both massive hoarding overseas as well as being the preferred method of payment for organized crime in Australia. Some Australian economists has even floated the idea of phasing out the Kermit, but there’s been significant pushback from the public.      While a ban on cash purchases over 10,000 may not seem like a big deal for the average person, plenty of small businesses are upset about the plan.      “It’s going to screw me—95 percent of my business is cash collections,” Paul Thomas, owner of Commander Security Services in Sydney, told News Corp this week. “On a monthly basis, we could process and move up to 4-5 million—either picking up cash, processing and EFT-ing it to customers’ accounts, or recarrying it from customers to their bank branch.”      Advertisement      Today it’s any sum over 10,000 in Australia, but anyone with their eyes open can see where this is going. We should expect governments to move away from cash over the next decade, just as currency anarchists continue to insist that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are the real future.      Researchers in the 1970s predicted that a widespread debit card system would be the perfect surveillance tool. And they weren’t exactly wrong. What they didn’t predict was what happens when a completely digital economy gets hacked. Equifax’s recent loss of so much personal data on virtually half of all Americans could feel like just a prelude to many more snafus to come.      [News Corp and The Guardian] ||||| This article is over 6 months old      Australians will face a crackdown on cash-in-hand payments in an attempt by government to reduce money laundering and tax evasion.      The Turnbull government has turned its attention to the “black economy” in an attempt to raise billions of extra dollars and intends to limit cash payments for purchase goods and services to 10,000.      The measure was announced in Tuesday’s budget, which introduced a suite of tax integrity measures aimed at individuals and companies.      The complete 2018 Australian budget: choose what matters to you Read more      “The black economy undermines community trust in the tax system, gives some businesses an unfair competitive advantage, puts pressure on margins of honest businesses, and often includes exploitation of vulnerable employees through the underpayment of wages and loss of entitlements,” said Kelly O’Dwyer, the financial services minister.      The government’s largest black economy measure is a crackdown on illicit tobacco, which it expects to raise 3.6bn over the next four years.      It says the three main sources of illicit tobacco in Australia are smuggling, leakage from licensed warehouses, and illicit domestic production. To combat this, it will create an illicit tobacco taskforce with powers to prosecute organised crime groups at the centre of the illicit tobacco trade.      It will introduce permits for all tobacco imports (except tobacco imported by travellers within duty-free limits), and require tobacco importers to pay all duty and tax liabilities upon importation. That is a change from the current system where tobacco can be imported and stored in licensed warehouses prior to taxes being paid.

The government is also moving to add to previously announced measures to make sure income earned in Australia, can be taxed by Australia.      As part of the cash-in-hand crackdown the government will introduce an economy-wide cash payment limit of 10,000 to reduce money laundering and tax evasion, to apply from 1 July 2019.      It means transactions over 10,000 will have to be made through an electronic payment system or cheque when purchasing goods or services.      Transactions with financial institutions or consumer to consumer non-business transactions will not be affected.      The government is unsure how much money the measure will raise, however.      Meanwhile, in other measures, the government says companies will no longer be allowed to claim deductions for payments to their employees, such as wages, where they have not withheld any amount of PAYG from the payments, despite PAYG withholding requirements applying.      Never mind lofty talk of ‘tax reform’. This budget is about political survival | Katharine Murphy Read more      It will also remove deductions for payments made by businesses to contractors where the contractor does not provide an ABN and the business does not withhold any amount of PAYG.      For foreign investors, the government will crackdown on the use of so-called “stapled structures”.      It wants to make sure income earned in Australia, can be taxed by Australia. Those additional measures include strengthening the so-called “thin capitalisation” rules, which are meant to stop companies loading up on debt to shift profits offshore.      The government also wants to strengthen its anti-tax avoidance rules.      The measure will raise 400m in revenue over four years. ||||| Australians who try to use more than 10,000 in cash to buy goods will be banned under a crackdown by the Federal Government aimed at stopping money launderers and organised crime.      The Government last night announced the plan to make it illegal to use more than 10,000 in cash to buy anything.      Those wanting to spend up big will have to use either electronic transfer services or a cheque to make a purchase.      It is understood there was a push-back within the Government at the 10,000 limit, with some West Australian MPs arguing it should be higher.      However, in the wake of the Commonwealth Bank’s money laundering allegations, which involved the withdrawal of more than 10,000 through ATMs, the Government stuck with the new limit.      It will apply to purchases of goods and services from businesses. Transactions with financial institutions or between consumers for non-business transactions will be exempt.      Revenue Minister Kelly O’Dwyer said the limit would start from July 1 next year.      “This cash payment limit will capture high-value transactions and help stamp out opportunities for criminals to launder the proceeds of crime into goods and services, or for businesses to hide transactions to reduce their tax liabilities,” she said.      The move is in response to the Government’s Black Economy Taskforce, which also backed measures to bar firms with a dodgy tax record from tendering for big Federal contracts.      Firms looking to win a contract worth more than 4 million will need to show evidence of a “satisfactory tax record”.      The Government will sink an extra 319 million into the Tax Office to help develop new ways to target the black economy.      Data matching will also be increased in a package the Government says could net it 3 billion in extra tax over four years. Also helping will be the illegal tobacco trade. Better policing of so-called chop-chop tobacco and payment of excise is expected to reap 3.6 billion. ||||| Share on twitter      Share on Google Plus Su-Lin Tan by Farmers, brokers and real estate agents are sceptical of the government's proposals to crack down on the cash economy, including a 10,000 limit on cash payments from July. They claim existing monitoring and policing are easy to get around and do not fear warnings about increased scrutiny unless they are backed by tough new measures while bigger businesses such as real estate agencies will not be affected as they have eradicated \\"cash payments\\". \\"Everyone knows it goes on,\\" said a senior real estate agent, who did not wish to be named. Another real estate agent said the crackdown wouldn't be effective unless it was backed by sophisticated high-technology monitoring.      Many real estate agents said cash payments were used to reduce the offer price so the buyer could pay less stamp duty and lower capital gains tax. Advertisement      Cash limits can also be circumvented by making numerous cash payments rather than a lump sum, or withdrawing just under 10,000 over two days, according to another agent. \\"I'm sceptical until I see the detail,\\" he said. For many agents who deal with foreign buyers of property – once known for buying apartments with suitcases of cash – such as Chinese luxury agency Black Diamondz, the practice of accepting cash is no longer used. \\"If someone comes to us with cash, they have to deposit it into our trust account at the bank, explaining to the bank the purpose of the money,\\" Black Diamondz founder Monika Tu said.      \\"Very few agents, especially major ones, take cash anymore.\\" If the cash is deposited into a private local bank account, agencies will accept bank cheques, Ms Tu adds. Another agent/broker ASX-listed N1 Holdings, who also deals with a lot of foreign, particularly Chinese, buyers, confirmed bank cheques were becoming the norm with these buyers. The federal government has introduced an economy-wide cash payment limit of 10,000, applying to payments made for goods and services from July 1, 2019, as part of a crackdown on the \\"black economy\\".      The government also said it was consulting on how it would limit cash payments to 10,000, to get around some of the loopholes which exist. The Tax Office had already made inroads into clamping down the cash economy, tax specialists said. It was identifying retailers who \\"only\\" accepted cash and had recently announced matching data of every motor vehicle sale over 10,000 to taxpayer records. Horticultural farmers, who are regularly targeted with large cash payments for fruit crops, such as grapes, also doubted how an economy-wide payment limit would work. ||||| The Australian Taxation Office is set to target cleaners and couriers, in a massive blitz on the 'black cash' economy.      A SYDNEY small business owner claims the government’s ban on cash payments over 10,000 will “demolish” the company he has spent four years and half a million dollars building, leaving it “worthless overnight”.      In Tuesday’s Budget, the government announced it would ban cash payments to businesses for goods and services over 10,000 as part of a broader crackdown on the 50 billion “black economy”.      The change will take effect from July 1, 2019, after which transactions over the threshold will have to be made through electronic transfer or by cheque. Paul Thomas, owner of Commander Security Services, Bankstown in Sydney’s west, believes the move will effectively kill off the cash-in-transit industry.      “It’s going to screw me — 95 per cent of my business is cash collections,” Mr Thomas said. “On a monthly basis, we could process and move up to 4-5 million — either picking up cash, processing and EFT-ing it to customers’ accounts, or recarrying it from customers to their bank branch.”      The 40-year-old said he had around 50 to 60 customers, nearly half of which were car yards. “All of my customers are legit operators, high-end car yards, money transfer depot stations,” he said.      Mr Thomas says the 10,000 limit will cause some businesses to stop accepting cash altogether, eliminating the need for armoured vans and security guards, with courier companies able to transport paperwork to banks.      He doesn’t accept Treasurer Scott Morrison’s claim that the move will be “bad news for criminal gangs, terrorists and those who are just trying to cheat on their tax or get a discount for letting someone else cheat on their tax”.      He argues the existing money laundering watchdog, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, was “put in place for this very reason” and was “not being used to its full extent”.      “At the end of the day it should be the discretion of the person,” he said. “If they’ve got the cash and it’s by legitimate means, they should be allowed to buy things with it. It’s legal tender.”      Mr Thomas said he had spoken to at least three other small businesses in his industry who were concerned but added: “Whether they openly admit it like I am. It basically is a life-and-death thing for me.      “I have a fleet of two armoured and five soft-skin vehicles, I employ three full-timers and two casuals, I’ve spent 300,000 of my personal money and blood, sweat and tears which I would never be able to get back if this goes ahead.”      He has written to his local member, Liberal MP Angus Taylor, and says he will reach out to Labor and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson.      “I would be pursuing compensation,” he said. “It’s a struggle as it is to run your own business, with the cost of everything to keep it alive. I’ve struggled through, I’m still alive, now I’m being kicked in the teeth.”      Revenue and Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer, who has led the Government’s cash crackdown, was unmoved.      “If what he said is correct, it is proof positive of the need for the Government to take strong action on the black economy,” she said, while stressing she could not comment on individual circumstances.      A spokesman for Ms O’Dwyer added that the Government would be consulting on the scope of the measure over the coming days and “welcomes any comments from people affected by this measure”. A consultation paper will be released shortly.      On Tuesday, the Government announced an additional 318.5 million in funding to create the new multi-agency Black Economy Standing Taskforce, which it expects to bring in an extra 3 billion in revenue over the next four years.      The group will continue the work of the existing Black Economy Taskforce, which made a number of recommendations in its final report including the cash payment limit. “There is a strong sense of community outrage at the inequality and unfair disadvantage created by the black economy,” chair Michael Andrew said.      “I hope that by creating an efficient, level playing field we can lower taxes, treat all businesses and workers fairly, increase community services or reduce debt if all Australians operate within the rules.”      In its response, released on Budget night, the Government said it agreed with or supported the majority of the recommendations, including potentially requiring wages to be paid into bank accounts, effectively outlawing cash-in-hand payments.      The Government said it was “encouraging the transition to a digital society”. While cash would “still remain a legitimate means of purchasing goods and services”, advances in digital technology were increasingly providing a viable alternative.      “Electronic transactions also offer a number of benefits for Australians, often being safer, easier and more cost-effective,” it said. “Consumer preferences are already driving this change with Australians being amongst the highest users of digital transactions in the world.”      Cash payments have fallen from 69 per cent of Australian transactions in 2007 to just 37 per cent in 2016, and Aussies are the world’s biggest users of tap-and-go technology.      “Despite Australians embracing this change, there is a small cohort of people who continue to rely on cash to enable or fund their participation in the black economy,” the response said.      “Australia is not alone in contemplating a cash limit. A number of other countries such as France, Portugal, Greece, Spain, Italy and Belgium have cash limits varying from 1600 to 4800. Israel and the UK have also been reported to be contemplating or consulting on cash limits.”      frank.chung@news.com.au |||||Summary:","output":"The Australian Liberal Party government has announced plans to make any purchase over 10,000 AUD (7,500 USD) illegal to make with cash starting as of July 1, 2019. The rationale behind this decision is to encourage a transition towards a more digital society and to tackle tax evasion. The government intends to allocate around 300 million for the program called the Black Economy Standing Taskforce to enforce the ban on large cash payments. While many view these changes as unfavorable, Treasurer Scott Morrison suggested that criminal gangs, tax evaders, and terrorists would be the ones most affected by the policy. He also notes that it will start to expose businesses and individuals who are participating in the black economy. It is believed that this will helo bring in around 3 billion of tax revenue over the next four years. An interesting point to note is that a significant portion of all commercial transactions in Australia are still conducted in cash (around 37%). One of the biggest concerns related to Australia's policy regarding cash is the prevalence of the 100 AUD note, which is apparently mostly used in criminal activities and often hoarded overseas.  Many small businesses have voiced their disagreement with the planned changes, arguing that they will significantly hinder their operations. Alongside those criticisms, however, comes an acknowledgement of the growing trend towards a cashless society globally. India, for example, began phasing out large portions of its currency in 2016, and Sweden continues to move steadfastly towards complete digitization of its economy. One concern commonly raised with regards to increasing digitization is the potential for security breaches. In this matter, researchers have predicted that a wide-scale debit card system could pose a perfect tool for surveillance. However, what they did not forecast was the impact of hacking in a fully digital economy. Recent events, such as the Equifax hack where almost half of all Americans had their personal data exposed, underscore these vulnerabilities. Despite these potential pitfalls, this move by the Australian government reflects a broader global trend towards cracking down on the 'black economy'. Evolving from a cash-based to digital economy can help increase transparency, reduce money laundering, and ensure that income earned within a country can be effectively taxed by it. At the end of the day, however, ensuring a smooth transition that does not unduly impact businesses or consumers will be vital to the success of such sweeping legislation changes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A more detailed and accurate answer would be: General Electric's (GE) diverse business portfolio includes various segments, ranging from aviation, power, renewable energy, and oil and gas to healthcare, transportation, and lighting. Over the years, the company has been consistently adapting and restructuring its businesses. Financial services used to be an integral part of GE's revenue, primarily through GE Capital. However, after the 2008 financial crisis, GE decided to reposition itself as a more focused industrial company and as a result, began divesting its GE Capital assets to other financial institutions. As of the end of 2020, GE has significantly reduced its financial services footprint, representing only a small fraction of their total revenue. Based on the 2020 annual report, GE Capital's revenue accounted for approximately 9.0 billion, which is about 12% of GE's total revenue of ~79.6 billion in the same year. Hence, currently, around 12% of GE's revenue is derived from financial services provided by GE Capital. However, note that these figures are subject to change due to the ongoing restructurings and market conditions that affect GE's diverse business segments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: The 19-year-old woman whose hospitalization exposed a shocking Austrian incest case is recovering well and wants to see the ocean and a pop concert, her doctors and a family lawyer said Wednesday. Dr. Albert Reiter, who treated Kerstin, is confident Kerstin will make a full recovery in time. She and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life, they said. Kerstin Fritzl, whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in April for multiple organ failure, is now well enough to speak, stand and walk with assistance, her doctors said. Doctors said that \\"little novelties\\" such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives. Kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by British singer Robbie Williams, said Dr. Berhold Kepplinger, director of the clinic where the family is living. He described how excited Kerstin was to hear Robbie Williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down. It was then, Kepplinger said, that doctors became confident Kerstin can become fully healthy and develop normally. Her immune system has improved, and she is continuing to have physiotherapy, including strengthening exercises, he said.  Watch doctors describe what happened when the teen opened her eyes ». The two parts of her family -- those who were locked in a basement, like Kerstin, and those who lived above ground, apparently unaware of the abuse of their mother and siblings -- are getting to know each other again, the doctors and the family's lawyer said. \\"We are so glad that things have turned out so positively so far,\\" said lawyer Christoph Herbst, who appeared at a news conference at a hotel near Amstetten, west of Vienna, where Kerstin and her family are recovering. Kerstin is the oldest daughter of an incestuous relationship between Elisabeth, 43, and Elisabeth's father, Josef Fritzl, 73, according to police. He is awaiting trial. Police say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly, fathering seven children with her. Six of the children survived. Kerstin fell unconscious in April, and Elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention. Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten, where staff grew suspicious and called police, who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse. Kerstin was suffering from kidney, lung, and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital, said Dr. Albert Reiter, director of the hospital. Doctors were able to turn her health around, but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks, he said. Doctors started reducing Kerstin's medication May 12, allowing her to emerge from the coma, he said. Three days later, she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers, he said, and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat. Her mother was at Kerstin's bedside regularly, and doctors credited that with helping Kerstin's health improve. On Sunday, Kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them, he said. Kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby. \\"It was a special moment where, walking, we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life,\\" Reiter said. Kerstin and two of her brothers, ages 18 and 5, had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother, never seeing daylight. A television was their only contact with the outside world. The other three children Josef Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken as infants to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife, who says she had no idea her daughter was being held captive. In recent weeks, the wife and the three children have had several meetings with Kerstin and the others formerly held in the basement. The doctors said that all are receiving therapy and are getting to know each other. \\"It is clear that [the two sides] have a different temper of life,\\" Kepplinger said. \\"These different ways of living, the two parts of the family, still have to come to some agreement.\\" Still, the entire family is \\"very happy\\" to be reunited, Herbst said. \\"This is an incredible drawing-near to each other. There is incredible joy among them,\\" he said. \\"It is wonderful to see the way they are living together.\\" He appealed to the public and the media to give the family privacy. There continues to be \\"big ambivalence\\" about the \\"grandfather issue,\\" as Kepplinger called it, and therapists are helping the family members cope with the complicated relationship they have with each other and with Fritzl, who is now behind bars.","output":"A 19-year-old girl named Kerstin, who was held captive for years, is recovering well after being hospitalized.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist. The geologist, Hartley Ferrar, was a 22-year-old recent Cambridge graduate who Markham thought \\"might be made into a man.\\" Marine biologist Thomas Vere Hodgson, from Plymouth Museum, was a more mature figure, as was the senior of the two doctors, Reginald Koettlitz, who, at 39, was the oldest member of the expedition.

Also, the headset jacks mounts are held in place soley by the cheap and flimsy solder joints on the circuit board, which is unacceptable for the type of traffic a cordless phone experiences. Two out of three headset jacks on my system had become non-functional after 18 months of normal use. My sister had a similar experience with a completely different VTech model. There is no indication from VTech that this design sloppiness has been addressed in subsequent models, so no more VTech in my future.

Since you'll be well above the average person's line of sight, the person hunting for you will likely be too busy checking all the usual ground-level spots to figure out where you've gone.  If you're perched on one of the lower branches, don't let your feet dangle where they can be seen. The same basic rules of hiding apply when you're in a tree: remain quiet and still. Rustling leaves can be a dead-give away. You don't actually have to get inside the bush. In most situations, simply getting low and staying behind it will be good enough. Just like with trees, though, avoid making any sudden movements that might cause the bush to shake, or you could end up blowing your cover. Watch out for bushes with thorns or spiky leaves. If you're not careful, you could get scraped up as you climb in or out. These places tend to be dark and a little scary, which means the person looking for you is less likely to venture into them after you. Best of all, there's often so many tools, vehicles, and pieces of equipment around that you'll have access to multiple hiding spots within your hiding spot.  Don't hide in a shed or garage on someone else's property. You could get in trouble if you're caught trespassing. It's not a good idea to hide underneath a car or truck, either. On many houses, the areas under the front and back steps have open spaces built into them for storage. Look for a way to get under the porch or deck of the house where you're laying low. There may be a small door or gate, or you may be able to squeeze into an opening around the edge of the house. Watch out for potentially dangerous creatures while you're down below. Dark, damp spaces are often home to snakes, spiders, mice, and other creepy-crawlies. Fallen leaves make excellent natural camouflage. Dive into a freshly-raked mound and pull the loose leaves on top of yourself until you're completely concealed. Your friends will never suspect a thing—unless you decide to pop out and scare them senseless!  Drop a rock or stick into the leaf pile before you climb in to make sure there are no wild animals already hiding in it. Leaf piles can be breeding grounds for mold and bacteria, especially when they're wet, so avoid completely covering your face and try not to spend too much time inside. Darkness is the ultimate concealment. If you have nowhere else to post up, stick to the shadows, where you'll be practically invisible to your pursuers. Even if you're not completely blocked from view, you'll still be able to fade into the background and move stealthily from place to place.  Wearing dark clothes will help you blend in with your surroundings even more. If the person looking for you is using a flashlight, try to find a large object to stand behind when they get close.

If a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review. The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.

The peak has a nice central position in the Annapurna range . It is easier to climb than both Hiunchuli and Singu Chuli which also are trekking peaks of the Annapurna . The ascent requires ice climbing equipment . A climbing permit from the NMA costs  350 USD for a team of up to four members .  - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Hiunchuli () is a peak in the Himalayas of central Nepal. The mountain is an extension of Annapurna South. Between this peak and Machapuchare is a narrow section of the Modi Khola valley that provides the only access to the Annapurna Sanctuary.   - A waterfall is a place where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of drops in the course of a stream or river. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.   - Ice climbing is the activity of ascending inclined ice formations. Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls, frozen waterfalls, and cliffs and rock slabs covered with ice refrozen from flows of water. For the purposes of climbing, ice can be broadly divided into two spheres, alpine ice and water ice. Alpine ice is found in a mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed in an attempt to summit a mountain. Water ice is usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows. Alpine ice is frozen precipitation whereas water ice is a frozen liquid flow of water. Most alpine ice is generally one component of a longer route and often less technical, having more in common with standard glacier travel, while water ice is selected largely for its technical challenge. Technical grade is, however, independent of ice type and both types of ice vary greatly in consistency according to weather conditions. Ice can be soft, hard, brittle or tough. Mixed climbing is ascent involving both ice climbing and rock climbing.  - Ice flow. Perhaps the most conspicuous consequence of glacier flow, icefalls occur where the glacier bed steepens and/or narrows. Most glacier ice flows at speeds of a few hundred metres per year or less. However, the flow of ice in an icefall may be measured in kilometres per year. Such rapid flow cannot be accommodated by plastic deformation of the ice. Instead, the ice fractures forming crevasses. Intersecting fractures form ice columns or seracs. These processes are imperceptible for the most part; however, a serac may collapse or topple abruptly and without warning. This behavior often poses the biggest risk to mountaineers climbing in an icefall.  - The Annapurna Sanctuary is a high glacial basin lying 40 km directly north of Pokhara. This oval-shaped plateau sits at an altitude of over 4000 metres, and is surrounded by a ring of mountains, the Annapurna range, most of which are over 7000 metres. With the only entrance a narrow pass between the peaks of Hiunchuli and Machapuchare, where run-off from glaciers drain into Modi Khola River, the Sanctuary was not penetrated by outsiders until 1956. Because of high mountains on all sides, the Annapurna Sanctuary receives only 7 hours of sunlight a day at the height of summer. The unique combination of heights and depths on the 5-7 day trek into the Annapurna Sanctuary give rise to an extraordinary variety of ecosystems. The south-facing slopes are covered in dense tropical jungles of rhododendron and bamboo, while the north-facing slopes, in the rain shadow, have a drier colder climate similar to that of the near-by Tibetan Plateau.  - The Himalayas, or Himalaya, (or ) are a mountain range in Asia separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau.  - Annapurna South, also called Annapurna Dakshin or Moditse, is a mountain in the Annapurna Himal range of the Himalayas, and the 101st-highest mountain in the world. It was first ascended in 1964, and is tall. The nearby mountain Hiunchuli is in fact an extension of Annapurna South.  - Singu Chuli (also known as Fluted Peak) is one of the trekking peaks in the Nepali Himalaya range. The peak is located just west of Ganggapurna in the Annapurna Himal. A climbing permit from the NMA costs 350 USD for a team of up to four members. The peak requires ice climbing equipment.  - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.  - Machapuchare, Machhapuchchhre or Machhapuchhre, is a mountain in the Annapurna Himalayas of north central Nepal. It is revered by the local population as particularly sacred to the god Shiva, and hence is off limits to climbing.  - Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Due to the length and extended endurance required and because accidents are more likely to happen on descent than ascent, Rock Climbers do not usually climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to downclimb, especially on the larger multiple pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional Rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.  - Mixed climbing is a combination of ice climbing and rock climbing generally using ice climbing equipment such as crampons and ice tools. Mixed climbing has inspired its own specialized gear such as boots which are similar to climbing shoes but feature built in crampons. Dry-tooling is mixed climbing's most specialized skill and has since evolved into a \\"sport\\" unto itself.  - A trekking peak is a mountain under that is considered climbable by anyone with a moderate amount of mountaineering experience and skills. While some can be climbed without crampons or an ice axe, most require use of this equipment.   - Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of the body to ascend a steep object. It is done recreationally, competitively, in trades that rely on it, and in emergency rescue and military operations. It is done indoors and out, on natural and manmade structures.

Which boy will less likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school?  Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses. They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping.  Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate  , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test.

Clean and dry both the wood and leather surfaces thoroughly to ensure optimal adhesion. 3. Measure and cut the leather: Measure the wood surface where the leather padding will be attached. Transfer these measurements to the leather, and carefully cut to size using a sharp utility knife or leather shears. 4. Adhesive selection: Choose an adhesive that is specifically designed for bonding leather and wood, like a polyurethane adhesive or a heavy-duty contact cement. These adhesives offer a strong bond, versatility, moisture resistance, and flexibility. 5. Apply the adhesive: Both the leather and the wood surfaces need an even layer of adhesive. Use a brush or a small applicator and spread it uniformly, covering the entire surface area. Follow the adhesive manufacturer's instructions for proper drying times and ideal application conditions. 6. Bond the leather to the wood: Align the leather piece over the wood, making sure it covers the surface correctly. Press the leather firmly onto the wood, working from the center outward to avoid trapping air bubbles. You can use a rubber roller or a flat tool to apply even pressure across the leather to ensure proper adhesion. 7. Trim and finish the edges: If any excess leather material extends beyond the wood, trim it carefully using a sharp utility knife. You may want to protect the wood by placing a shield, like a thin piece of cardboard, between the blade and the wood surface. 8. Attach fasteners (optional): In addition to adhesive, you can use various fasteners to further secure the leather padding, such as decorative upholstery tacks, brass or stainless steel screws, or leather straps. When using fasteners, ensure even spacing and alignment for an aesthetically pleasing result. Pre-drill any necessary holes and attach the fasteners following the manufacturer's instructions. 9. Finishing touches: To give your leather padding project a professional touch, consider adding a trim or edge stitching to the perimeter of the leather, protecting the edges from wear. You can either hand-stitch or use a leather sewing machine. 10. Condition and maintain the leather: Since leather is a natural material, it requires regular care and maintenance to keep it looking beautiful and to prolong its lifespan. Apply a high-quality leather conditioner and protectant to keep the padding soft, supple, and protected from damage. Clean and condition the leather as needed. By following these steps, you will be able to securely attach a leather padding to wood, ensuring a comfortable and personalized finish to your furniture or woodwork."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question...when did ad start being used in dates??","output":"The term \\"AD\\" stands for \\"Anno Domini,\\" which is Latin for \\"In the Year of the Lord.\\" It is used in the context of dating years in the Gregorian calendar, specifically to designate the years following the birth of Jesus Christ. The purpose of the AD dating system is to establish a consistent, worldwide chronology by referencing events relative to the birth of Christ. The concept of AD and its introduction into dating systems can be traced back to the early medieval period, primarily attributed to the efforts of the Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus. Living in the 6th century, Dionysius was responsible for developing a new method of calculating the date of Easter, which was then a critical religious celebration for the Christian Church. During Dionysius' time, the prevalent system of dating years was based on the Roman calendar, which used the founding of the city of Rome (traditionally 753 BC) as its reference point and counted years as \\"AUC\\" (Ab Urbe Condita, which means \\"From the Founding of the City\\"). As Dionysius was developing his method for calculating the date of Easter, he decided to replace the AUC system with a more Christian-based one. He did this by calculating the date of Christ's birth and introducing the concept of the Anno Domini era. According to Dionysius' calculations, the birth of Jesus occurred in the year 1 AD, and everything before that point would be \\"BC\\" (Before Christ). This new dating system gradually gained acceptance and was adopted by various scholars, historians, and ecclesiastical authorities. By the 9th century AD, the use of the Anno Domini era became widespread across Europe, especially after the Venerable Bede, an influential English monk, employed this dating system in his historical works. It is important to note that Dionysius' calculations regarding the birth of Jesus have been widely discussed and debated, with many scholars asserting that his estimates may have been off by a few years. Despite this debate, the AD system is the most globally accepted system for dating years today. In recent times, there has been a push to use the terms \\"CE\\" (Common Era) and \\"BCE\\" (Before the Common Era) as secular, non-denominational alternatives to \\"AD\\" and \\"BC,\\" respectively. These terms serve the same function as AD and BC but aim to be more inclusive and neutral with respect to religious beliefs. To sum up, the AD dating system was first introduced in the 6th century by the Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus and gained widespread acceptance by the 9th century. Although the exact accuracy of the system's starting point has been debated, it has become the most universally adopted method for dating years in the Gregorian calendar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment I stepped in until my last bite, the entire experience was impeccable. The Gourmet Retreat truly deserves all the praise it has been getting lately, and I am joining the chorus to sing its accolades. The ambience of the restaurant was warm, inviting, and elegant. The soft lighting gave it a romantic touch, and the meticulously arranged tables and chairs provided ample space for diners to enjoy their meals comfortably. The well-curated artwork adorned the walls, adding to the upscale and refined atmosphere. The service was exceptional and exceeded my expectations. The waitstaff were attentive, knowledgeable, and more than willing to make personalized recommendations to suit our preferences. They were quick and efficient in refilling water glasses, clearing empty plates, and attending to any other needs. They allowed us to set the pace of the meal, never making us feel rushed or ignored. Now, let's talk about the pièce de résistance: the food. The Gourmet Retreat offers a diverse menu, catering to a wide range of palates. For starters, we indulged in the truffle-infused mushroom soup, which had an astounding depth of flavor, and the heirloom tomato salad, which was refreshing and beautifully plated. Each bite showcased the skill and artistry of the chefs. For the main course, I had the pan-seared Chilean sea bass served atop a delicate saffron risotto, while my partner opted for the rosemary crusted rack of lamb. The sea bass was cooked to perfection – tender, flaky, and moist, while the risotto was creamy and packed with rich flavors. The lamb was equally impressive, cooked to our requested temperature, with the rosemary crust adding a touch of herbs that complemented the lamb's natural taste. The accompanying seasonal vegetables were cooked to perfection and not overpowered by unnecessary seasoning. Dessert was the proverbial cherry on top of the cake. We shared the decadent chocolate soufflé, which had a satisfyingly gooey center, accompanied by a side of velvety vanilla ice cream. The presentation was elegant, and the flavors were balanced and indulgent. In terms of pricing, The Gourmet Retreat is on the higher side, but well worth the expense. The quality of the food, the presentation, and the service undeniably justified the price tag. In conclusion, my experience at The Gourmet Retreat was exceptional, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply want to treat yourself to an evening of exemplary cuisine and service, this restaurant should be at the top of your list. Kudos to the entire team for creating such a culinary gem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What is funny? The short answer is: Who knows? The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances   are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \\"in\\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa  . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you. Because that's what it feels like. What do you say if you realize your joke upset someone? Apologize as briefly and as sincerely as you can, and hope that someone changes the subject. Try saying: \\"I'm sorry. I should have known better\\" or \\"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\\" What do you do if people don't get your joke or don't appear to find it as funny...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This is a film which had eluded me thus far but, now that I've watched it, emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style. As usual with the DivX format, the viewing was far from ideal  marred by the occasional video and (mostly) audio glitches  but, given that the film is still unavailable on R1 DVD, this will have to do for the moment. Since the film's reputation is quite high within the genre itself, I assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a well-known actor in the lead. Anyway, the belated entrance of the film's nominal star  Franchot Tone  packs quite a wallop (especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first)! Tone was a underrated actor  he was rarely given meaty roles, and this may well be his best (making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous). The female lead  Ella Raines, who would later feature in BRUTE FORCE (1947) as well as Siodmak's own THE SUSPECT (1944) and THE STRANGE AFFAIR OF UNCLE HARRY (1945)  is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss (Alan Baxter) innocent of his wife's brutal murder. Other key supporting parts are essayed by Thomas Gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator, and Elisha Cook Jr.  the genre's quintessential fall guy  as an ill-fated \\"ladies' man\\" of a percussionist. Like BRUTE FORCE's Jules Dassin, Siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction  all tilted angles and terrific set-pieces, including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which Cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishly-attired Raines (who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail). Another great, lengthy sequence is the one in which Raines follows a bartender (another uncooperative witness) around the streets of New York  which results in his being mowed down by a car!  Notable, too, is the trial sequence  which is entirely depicted through the audience's reaction so that judge, jury, witnesses and D.A. are never actually seen (although the judge's voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor Samuel S. Hinds). The centerpiece of the film is the scene in which Gomez and Tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved, with the inspector's put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug Tone \\"dizzy spells\\". The suspenseful climax finds Raines alone with Tone in his apartment, where she discovers evidence of his guilt  and he confesses to having had an affair with Baxter's wife, but killed her when she wouldn't desert her husband for him.

They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer?  Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jeff has experienced an adolescent growth spurt during puberty, which has caused him to grow much taller than his best friend Jeremy. The rapid growth, controlled by testosterone, has resulted in an increase in height of about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year on average in males. Additionally, growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt, and muscles may continue to develop and gain strength even after growth in height is finished. Considering the changes Jeff has undergone and the physical demands of both basketball and soccer, it is plausible to infer that Jeff would play basketball better due to his size. Basketball as a sport generally favors taller players as it involves scoring by shooting the ball into a hoop that is elevated 10 feet off the ground. The height advantage would allow Jeff to have better reach, make shots more easily, and be more effective in defense while blocking and rebounding against opponents. On the other hand, soccer primarily involves using the lower body to maneuver the ball around the field and score goals. Although height can be an advantage in some aspects of soccer, such as aerial duels and goalkeeping, it is not as significant a factor as it is in basketball. Soccer places a greater emphasis on cardiovascular endurance, agility, and lower body strength, all of which are not solely determined by height. In conclusion, given Jeff's increased height and muscle growth during puberty, he would likely excel more in basketball than in soccer due to the advantages that his size provides in the sport."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Flies (which reproduce and lay maggot eggs) breed mainly in decaying meat and fish. Never allow excess meat and fish into your trash to decrease the chances of maggot infestation. Here are a couple solutions for attacking the source of the problem:   Make meat stock using excess bones and meat. Dump the leftover bones into a pot of boiling water, add a few bay leaves and spices, and set to simmer for at least an hour. Save some of the meat/bones in a separate refrigerator (or freezer) until garbage day, and then dump it all at once. Your meat won't spoil as easily if it's refrigerated or frozen. If you have to throw excess meat and fish in the garbage, wrap them in paper towels before you toss them. If flies can't get at them, they'll have a difficult time laying eggs. Essential oils repel flies. Dilute 4 to 5 drops of any essential oil in a spray bottle filled with water and lightly spray affected areas. You can also spray a dry cloth with the diluted oil and use it to apply the mixture. Mix 1 part vinegar with 2 parts water into a bowl. Afterward, dab a cloth into it and scrub the inside and outside of the trash can. Wipe it down with a dry cloth when you're finished and let it dry in the sun or a dry room before putting a new bag in.  Keep on top of emptying your trash cans whenever they are full and clean them at least once a week. Always insulate with garbage bags to avoid bits and scraps of food becoming lodged in your trash can. Add a couple drops of your favorite essential oil to your detergent when you choose to clean the trash. if you think the maggot infestation has affected it. Turn off the fuse that controls your garbage disposal and use pliers or tongs to remove any trapped pieces of food. Afterward, dilute 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid bleach into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and pour it slowly into your disposal.  Run your garbage disposal for a longer period of time when you use it. This will help ensure that all the food is properly disposed of. Avoid letting grease down your sink drain. Maggots really like moisture, so take it away from them. Make sure your trash bags aren't leaky and wipe away moisture that does make it to the bottom of the bin as soon as possible. Keep food preparation areas and other maggot-friendly regions dry as often as you can. Keep a few silica packets (which come with new shoes) at the bottom of your trash. Silica is a natural absorbent, so it draws away moisture effectively. Mothballs are chemically treated orbs that are filled with insecticides. If you place 1 or 2 mothballs in the proximity of affected areas, such as the bottom of your trash can, they can be effective at repelling and killing intruders.  Moth balls and carcinogenic and toxic, so only use them if you've tried all of the other methods above. Never place them near food. Summary:","output":"To avoid maggot infestation, properly dispose of meat and fish, use essential oils as repellents, regularly clean trash cans, and maintain dry environments in food preparation areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"Dear Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of this resolution, entitled \\"Sudan and South Sudan: Situation after the 2011 Referendum\\". In English: Dear Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of this resolution, which is titled \\"Sudan and South Sudan: The Situation After the 2011 Referendum\\". This resolution addresses the ongoing political and humanitarian challenges faced by both Sudan and South Sudan following their separation in 2011 as a result of a referendum. The decision to create an independent South Sudan was supported by a majority of 98.83%, which was widely expected due to the long-standing ethnic, cultural, and political divides between the north and south of the country. Since the secession of South Sudan, both countries have faced significant challenges in terms of political stability, economic development, and security. In particular, the relationship between the two countries has been fraught with tension, and there have been numerous incidents of armed conflict along their shared border. Both nations have struggled with internal strife as well, with various rebel groups, militias, and local grievances leading to outbreaks of violence and episodes of civil unrest. The resolution seeks to address the critical challenges faced by Sudan and South Sudan by advocating for increased international efforts to support the peace and stability of the region. Some of the key points raised in this resolution include: 1. Encouraging both the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to reach diplomatic agreements on the remaining outstanding issues, such as border demarcation, the status of Abyei, and the sharing of resources, particularly oil revenues. 2. Supporting the ongoing peace talks and the implementation of peace agreements, such as the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS) and the 2019 Juba Peace Agreement.  3. Calling for a renewed commitment from international partners and donors to provide humanitarian assistance and development aid to both countries to help alleviate the suffering of their respective civilian populations and contribute to long-term stability and development. 4. Urging the governments of Sudan and South Sudan to respect and uphold human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law, and to combat impunity for war crimes and other serious human rights abuses. 5. Encouraging regional and international cooperation to address cross-border challenges, such as the influx of refugees, human trafficking, and transnational organized crime. In conclusion, by voting in favor of this resolution, I believe that the international community must recognize the critical challenges faced by both Sudan and South Sudan and prioritize efforts towards promoting peace, stability, and development in the region. This includes supporting diplomatic initiatives between the two countries, as well as providing assistance in humanitarian aid and development programs. It is my hope that with continued international support and engagement, both countries can overcome their challenges, and ultimately, their peoples can enjoy the security, dignity, and prosperity they deserve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt.  Question: \\"How were the American lower class's views of wealth and fine possessions different from those of the European lower class?\\" Response: \\"American lower class found wealth and fine possessions morally good while European lower class deemed it immoral\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question by highlighting the difference in views regarding wealth and fine possessions between the American and European lower classes.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Question: What two contracts did Hughes secure with the Army Air Forces? Title: The Aviator Movie plot: The Aviator has no opening credits other than the title. The film begins in 1913 with nine-year-old Hughes being bathed by his mother, who warns him of disease: \\"You are not safe.\\"The film next shows him in 1927, as a 22-year old preparing to direct Hell's Angels. Hiring Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to run Hughes Tool Co, while he oversees the flight sequences for the film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting the film realistically, even re-shooting the dogfight himself. By 1929, with the film finally complete, when The Jazz Singer is released, Hughes re-shoots the film for sound, costing another year and 1.7 million. Nevertheless, Hell's Angels is a huge hit, and Hughes makes Scarface and The Outlaw. However, there is one goal he relentlessly pursues: aviation. During this time, he also pursues Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). The two go to nightclubs, play golf and fly together, and as they grow closer, move in together as well. During this time Hepburn becomes a major support and confidant to Hughes, and helps alleviate the symptoms of his obsessive-compulsive disorder. As Hughes' fame grows, he is seen with more starlets.Hughes takes an interest in commercial-passenger travel, and purchases majority interest in Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA), the predecessor to Trans World Airlines. In 1935, he test flies the H-1 Racer but crashes in a beet field; \\"Fastest man on the planet,\\" he boasts to Hepburn. Three years later, he flies around the world in four days, shattering the previous record by three days. Meanwhile, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), owner of Pan American Airlines, and Senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) worry over the possibility that Hughes might beat them in the quest for commercial expansion.

Here is a goal: make cold brew coffee How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To make cold brew coffee, we will follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Choose the right coffee beans Select high-quality coffee beans for the best cold brew experience. Beans with a medium or dark roast, and low acidity are ideal for a smooth and bold taste. Step 2: Measure the coffee beans Determine the coffee-to-water ratio. A recommended ratio is 1:4 or 1:5 (1 part coffee to 4 or 5 parts water). For example, if you want to make 4 cups of cold brew, you would need 1 cup of coarsely ground coffee beans and 4 cups of water. Step 3: Grind the coffee beans Grind the coffee beans on a coarse setting. The grind should resemble the texture of sea salt for optimal extraction. Step 4: Combine coffee grounds and water Add the coarsely ground coffee to a large airtight container. Slowly pour the cold water over the coffee grounds, ensuring all the grounds are wet. This is to make sure that the coffee is fully submerged and evenly saturated for proper extraction. Step 5: Stir the mixture Gently stir the coffee and water mixture to fully combine. This helps start the extraction process and ensures uniform steeping. Step 6: Cover and refrigerate Seal the container tightly and place it in the refrigerator to steep. The recommended steeping time is between 12 to 24 hours. A longer steeping time will result in a stronger, more concentrated flavor. Step 7: Strain the coffee After the steeping period, remove the container from the refrigerator. Place a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth, a coffee filter, or a nut milk bag over a large jar or bowl. Slowly pour the coffee mixture through the sieve to separate the grounds from the liquid. Discard the coffee grounds. Step 8: Dilute and serve The resulting liquid is a coffee concentrate. Dilute the concentrate with water or milk to your preferred taste (typically, a 1:1 ratio). Add ice and any desired sweeteners or flavorings, and enjoy your homemade cold brew coffee.

The smallest of the bunch have lower or higher boiling points?    Assuming that:  Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points, so they are liquids or waxy solids at room temperature. The answer is:","output":"The smallest alkenes have higher boiling points. To elaborate, alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing carbon-carbon double bonds. The boiling point of a substance is related to the strength of the intermolecular forces present between its molecules. In alkenes, the primary intermolecular force is van der Waals interactions or London dispersion forces. As the size of the alkene (number of carbon atoms) increases, the molecular weight also increases. This in turn leads to a larger surface area and stronger van der Waals interactions between the molecules, which require more energy to overcome. Consequently, larger alkenes have lower boiling points because these stronger forces require more energy to break. On the other hand, smaller alkenes have fewer carbon atoms, lower molecular weight, and weaker van der Waals interactions. This means they have less surface area to interact with other molecules, which results in a higher boiling point due to the weaker forces involved. In summary, smaller alkenes have higher boiling points compared to larger alkenes, as their weaker van der Waals interactions require less energy to overcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The students in a school in Shanghai will go to the USA with his parents during the Spring Festival. \\"Overseas touring has always been a dream for me,\\" he said happily. Nowadays, Chinese people enjoy longer holidays, such as the three \\"Golden Week Holidays\\"(the Spring Festival, May Day and National Day). They have more time to travel. Rising incomes also make travelling abroad realistic for ordinary Chinese people. Nearly 7 million Chinese travelled overseas in 2001, according to the National Tourism Administration . The most common problem travellers face is how to choose the best routes . By the end of 2002, Chinese citizens were allowed to travel to 19 foreign countries and regions at their own expense. The top 10 places included Hong Kong, Macao and Thailand. European countries are also becoming increasingly popular. \\"More and more Chinese people have shown interest in travelling to Europe, particularly France and Finland,\\" said Tan Wen, a general manager of China Youth Travel Service. \\"Sooner or later, there will be a peak  in European tours.\\" Another consideration is choosing the right travel agencies and finding the best price. The China Consumers' Association(CCA,)offered tips to consumers on choosing the right travel agencies to help prevent a relaxing vacation from turning into a costly disaster. \\"Price should not be the single most important factor in choosing a travel agency,\\" said Zhang Yuanchao, CCA vice-secretary general. Consumers are advised to choose large State travel agencies with good reputations and official approval to organize overseas tour groups. Zhang's association dealt with more than 5, 000 complaints about travel agencies  last year. And the majority of the complaints were about _ in travel routes, bad tour guides, and forced shopping.

To that end, he selected two time periods, time A and time B. Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B?  Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. The answer to this question is:","output":"Time B. In the year two thousand (Time B), fossil fuels are used in large quantities compared to the year one thousand (Time A) when the use of fossil fuels was not very common. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the last names of the two people hired to join Opeth after De Farfalla and Nordin left?, using the article: Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997. Although..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The last names of the two people hired to join Opeth after De Farfalla and Nordin left are López and Méndez.

Q: das dauert jetzt einfach wirklich zu lange.... . Vorweg: auch ich bin ein großer Fan von der Serie und meine schlechte Bewertung bezieht sich wirklich nicht auf den Inhalt dieses Meisterwerks. Aber wenn ich diese Wartezeiten berücksichtige und dann noch den horrenden Preis betrachte, dann ist das für mich einfach nur mehr Frotzelei. Die Aufsplittung der ganzen Serienstaffeln in zwei Teilboxen lässt als einziges logisches Argument nur Geldschneiderei zu (oder fällt   jemanden ein Argument ein warum das sinnvoll sein sollte?), hat sich aber schon durchgesetzt und da die zweite Staffel schon nur mehr geteilt erhältlich war, hätte ich mich jetzt stark gewundert, wenn das diesmal anders wäre. Der Preis ist wie gesagt unverschämt, aber die eigentliche Frechheit ist doch wirklich die Wartezeit - nach so langer Zeit erst hat man sich endlich dazu durchgerungen, die Serie auf DVD zu veröffentlichen, nachdem sie im tollen RTL2 Spätabendprogramm erstausgestrahlt wurde. Wenn man bedenkt, dass in vielen Ländern schon jetzt ein Erscheinungstermin von allen vier Staffeln in einer wunderschönen Sammleredition feststeht, wird man doch glatt ein wenig neidisch. Auch ich gehöre zu den Leuten, die jedes mal einen Smiley aufsetzen, wenn sie stolz an ihren DVD-Regalen vorbeigehen und die Sammlereditions begutachten können. Doch schön langsam habe ich das Gefühl, dass diese Freude noch eine lange Zeit auf sich warten lässt, wenn man sich bei der vierten Staffel ebenso viel Zeit lässt wie bei der dritten.

Review translation:  It's just taking too long now... . First of all: I'm also a big fan of the series and my bad rating is really not related to the content or this masterpiece. However, when I take these waiting times into account and then consider the horrendous price, it's just pure annoyance for me. The splitting of the entire series into two part-boxes allows only for money-grabbing as the only logical argument (or can anyone think of an argument why this should be useful?), but it has already been established and since the second season was only available in separate parts, I would be very surprised if it were different this time. The price is, as I said, outrageous, but the real impudence is the waiting time - after such a long time they finally decided to release the series on DVD after it was first aired on RTL2's late-night program. Considering that all four seasons are already scheduled for release in a gorgeous collector's edition in many countries, one can't help but be a little envious. I also belong to the people who put on a smile every time they proudly walk past their DVD shelves and inspect the collector's editions. But slowly I have the feeling that this joy will be waiting a long time if the fourth season takes as much time as the third. It would be very nice if everything could go a little faster - and be a bit cheaper ;) - because this policy will not exactly increase sales figures - in any case, I will not buy the season.

Ronan, a Democratic Party member, had been serving in the capacity of a representative for the 6th district of the state of Illinois but for some reason, he departed from the office. His exit from the role, referred to as \\"vacation\\", could have been for several reasons like end-term, personal reasons or retirement, the specifics of which have not been provided in the triple.  Upon Mr. Ronan's departure, a replacement was sought for this important legislative role. George W. Collins, also part of the Democratic party, was the individual who filled in the vacancy left by Ronan, hence being his \\"successor\\". The transition suggests a continuum in political ideology for the representation of the 6th district, seeing as both the predecessor and successor hailed from the same political party. This changeover is significant for many reasons. The individuals who represent districts in state and national legislatures play a critical role in shaping policy and making legislative decisions that would impact the citizens residing in their specific districts. Additionally, the succession of political offices also gives us insight into the political dynamics, party dominance and shifts in power within a particular region. Yet, it would be important to research further into each of their political careers, their individual contributions and their influence on Illinois' 6th district to fully appreciate the magnitude of such a changeover. The study of their policies and agendas, any significant legislation they might have passed, community reform enacted during their time and the overall political, economic and social health of the district under their tenure would paint a more comprehensive picture of this triple's real-world implications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information:  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Firth of Tay (Scottish Gaelic: Linne Tatha) is a firth in Scotland between the council areas of Fife, Perth and Kinross, the City of Dundee and Angus, into which Scotland's largest river in terms of flow, the River Tay empties. The firth has a maximum width of at Invergowrie.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - A strath is a large valley, typically a river valley that is wide and shallow (as opposed to a glen, which is typically narrower and deep).  - Ben Lui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laoigh) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, at the head of Glen Fyne.

The section of the River Tay nearby is a popular location for canoeing and fishing .  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The River Tay is the longest river in Scotland and the seventh-longest in the United Kingdom. The Tay originates in western Scotland on the slopes of Ben Lui, then flows easterly across the Highlands, through Loch Dochart, Loch Iubhair and Loch Tay, then continues east through Strathtay (see Strath), in the centre of Scotland, then southeasterly through Perth, where it becomes tidal, to its mouth at the Firth of Tay, south of Dundee. It is the largest river in the UK by measured discharge. Its catchment is approximately , the Tweed's is and the Spey's is .  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Rannoch Moor (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach\\") is an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends from and into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute.

There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information. In Scotland registration counties are used for land registration purposes.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.

The 2008 United States Open Championship, often referred to as the U.S. Open, was the 108th edition of the prestigious golf tournament. It took place from June 12 to June 16, 2008, at the Torrey Pines Golf Course, located in La Jolla, California, which is a neighborhood of San Diego. This was the first time that Torrey Pines had hosted the U.S. Open, and it proved to be a memorable event. Tiger Woods, one of the most celebrated golfers in the history of the sport, put forth an incredible performance despite a serious knee injury. Throughout the tournament, Woods made remarkable shots and clutch putts, battling both the challenging course and his physical pain. He underwent reconstructive surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) just two days after the tournament ended. During the final round on Sunday, June 15, Woods needed a birdie on the 72nd hole to force a playoff with Rocco Mediate, who had finished his round with a one-stroke lead. In a dramatic moment, Woods sank a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th green, tying the score and leading to an 18-hole playoff on Monday. The playoff round was equally thrilling, with both Woods and Mediate locked in a tense battle. The two players ended the playoff with matching scores of even-par 71, forcing a sudden-death playoff. On the first sudden-death hole, the par-4 7th, Woods made a par while Mediate had a bogey, finally securing Woods' victory in the 2008 U.S. Open. This win marked Tiger Woods' 14th major championship in his illustrious career and his third U.S. Open title, having previously won in 2000 and 2002. The victory is considered one of the most memorable and heroic in the history of the tournament, given Woods' perseverance in the face of a severe injury. His triumph in the 2008 U.S. Open highlights his extraordinary talent, determination, and mental fortitude on the golf course."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Spanish:","output":"09 - 1006 - Boletines de noticias televisivas en la época de Franco. En la época de Franco, los boletines de noticias televisivas eran de gran importancia en la sociedad española y cumplían múltiples funciones. Los boletines de noticias eran utilizados como un medio para informar a la población sobre los acontecimientos nacionales e internacionales, así como para moldear la opinión pública de acuerdo con los intereses del régimen. Durante el período del franquismo, España estuvo bajo la dictadura de Francisco Franco desde 1939 hasta su muerte en 1975. En esta época, la censura y el control de la información por parte del gobierno fue una práctica común. Las autoridades controlaban de cerca los medios de comunicación, incluyendo los boletines de noticias televisivas, con el objetivo de mantener a la población informada de acuerdo a la visión del régimen. Los boletines de noticias de la época de Franco eran conocidos como el 'No-Do' (Noticiarios y Documentales), que era un noticiero de carácter obligatorio emitido en todas las salas de cine y en la televisión. El No-Do estaba compuesto por una serie de noticias nacionales y extranjeras seleccionadas por el gobierno, además de otras secciones de carácter propagandístico que buscaban exaltar los logros del régimen y promover los ideales del franquismo. La televisión en España, bajo el control estatal, se utilizaba como instrumento de propaganda y medio para moldear la opinión pública. Los boletines de noticias televisivas tenían una estructura definida y controlada por el gobierno, lo que garantizaba la difusión de mensajes específicos y la promoción de valores asociados al régimen. La objetividad y la neutralidad en la presentación de las noticias no era una prioridad, ya que las noticias eran seleccionadas y presentadas de forma que apoyaran los ideales del franquismo. El acceso a la información internacional estaba limitado durante esta época, ya que el régimen de Franco controlaba la importación de periódicos, libros y otros materiales informativos extranjeros. Esto implicaba que los boletines de noticias televisivas eran una de las principales fuentes de información para la población española. A pesar del control y la censura ejercida por el gobierno, los boletines de noticias televisivas en la época de Franco cumplían una función importante en la sociedad española. La televisión fue ganando popularidad en España durante los años 60 y 70, lo que contribuyó a que el público tuviera un mayor interés en los eventos locales y globales. Además, aunque las noticias eran presentadas desde la perspectiva oficial del régimen, la presencia de noticias internacionales permitía a la población española estar al tanto de algunos de los acontecimientos globales más relevantes del momento. En resumen, los boletines de noticias televisivas en la época de Franco funcionaban como una herramienta de propaganda y control de la información por parte del régimen. Aunque la objetividad y la libertad de expresión estaban limitadas, estos boletines permitían a la población estar informada y, en cierta medida, conectada con el mundo exterior."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Burning fossil fuels increases the carbon in the atmosphere.

The original movie, The Odd Couple, has some wonderful comic one-liners. The entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat-freak Felix Ungar and funny, obnoxious, slob Oscar Madison. This paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful TV series of all time as well as countless, not anywhere near as good, imitations. The Odd Couple movie has some wonderful jokes about Oscar's apartment and his sloppy habits. He says, \\"Who wants food?\\" One of his poker player buddies asks, \\"What do ya got?\\" Oscar says, \\"I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches.\\" \\"What's the brown?\\" It's either very new cheese or very old meat!\\" I also love the line about Oscar's refrigerator, \\"It's been out of order for two weeks, I saw milk standing in there that wasn't even in a bottle!\\" There is no question that Walter Matthau's Oscar Madison is a joy to watch on screen. He's almost as good as Jack Klugman's version in the TV series. The problem with the movie is Jack Lemmon's Felix Ungar. Jack makes a very, very, honest effort at the role. The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and down-trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical. Tony Randall's performance in the series, brought the kind of humor, warmth, and sensitivity, to Felix's character, which Lemmon's portrayal lacks. Tony's Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time. However, in the TV series, it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline. Jack's Felix Ungar, (note the different spelling) in the movie, seems to never be happy, fun, or interesting. The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall, all the time. The movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time, the \\"famous\\" meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever! One of the other great examples of Felix's \\"little notes\\" on Oscar's pillow will be remembered forever. However, there are some darker sides where Oscar goes over the top, His \\"crying\\" near the end after bawling out Felix, and a scene involving Felix's Linguine dinner, (although lightened by a funny line.) seem more depressing than comical. Perhaps there wasn't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie. The beginning 20 minutes are very boring. The same issue occurs with Felix's conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters. The movie's ending is predictable and too pat. There's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other. The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger, rather than comedy, unless you are watching the great scenes described above. It appears that Jack Lemmon's monotone persona of Felix brings the film down, rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters. It really took the 1970's TV series to make The Odd Couple the best that it could be. The original film is still very good. However, the TV series is much better. Choose your answer.

Review: I bought this saw because of all the reviews written here--and have not been disappointed. It is a great tool, and I'm headed out to the lumber yard today to buy some wood to build sutff with my hot new Bosch. My only gripe is that the kit comes with ten or so blades, but with no explanation about what material they are designed to cut. The manual's full instruction about how to choose speed, cut type, and blade amounts to, \\"you'll figure it out.\\" I sure would appreciate more \\"how to cut\\" advice, as I have so far been unable to get a square cut with curves on a treated pine 2 X 6. I expect it's my technique, not the saw. But still, I'd like to know more about how to really master this wonderful piece of equipment. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review can be regarded as mostly positive. The reviewer expresses satisfaction with the saw and its functionality, expressing enthusiasm about using it for future projects. They were persuaded to purchase the saw due to the compelling reviews of others, further suggesting a typically positive perception of the product in the market. The reviewer appreciates the tool's high quality, stating that they are not \\"disappointed,\\" and is even excited about the purchase, describing their new Bosch saw as \\"hot\\". The user also plans to go out and purchase more material (wood) to work with, underlining the satisfaction and desire to actively utilize the saw. This positive sentiment suggests they find the saw reliable and practical. However, the problems the reviewer faces seem to be regarding a lack of instruction or guidance rather than an issue with the saw itself. They are unable to understand what types of material the included blades are designed to cut. Further, they mention that the manual's instruction on how to select speed, cut type, and blade are vague and unhelpful, as the bulk of it seems to be reducing complex processes to a sentence that translates to \\"figure it out yourself\\". The reviewer's frustration around getting a perfect square cut with curves on a treated pine 2 X 6 also stems from this lack of guidance as they assume it might be a problem with their technique and not the saw itself. Despite these difficulties, the reviewer still considers the saw a \\"wonderful piece of equipment\\" and desires to \\"master\\" it instead of dismissing it. This sentiment confirms that they still regard the product positively, albeit with a desire for more support and guidance to fully maximize its potential. In conclusion, while the reviewer does point out some discontent arising from a lack of detailed instructions and guidance to utilize the saw to its full potential, overall the review leans significantly more towards being positive due to the high praise and appreciation for the quality and workability of the saw."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).  After reading the above, is \\"Fujian\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the current name of the Province that the eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to?\\"?

What is the best way to: How do you decorate a cake without frosting?","output":"Decorating a cake without frosting can present a challenge, but it's not impossible to create a beautiful and visually appealing cake. Here are steps to achieve this: 1. **Consider the type of cake**: The type of cake you're working with should be your starting point. If it's a simple sponge, pound, or chocolate cake, the decoration could mainly revolve around adding ingredients that compliment the flavor. 2. **Using Confectioners' sugar for decoration**: One very simple way to decorate a cake without frosting is to dust it with confectioners' (powdered) sugar. This is especially effective if the top of the cake has a detailed design that can be highlighted with the sugar. You can use stencils to make intricate patterns using powdered sugar. You first need to let the cake cool completely, and then you can use a sieve to lightly dust the top. 3. **Adding fruits**: Adding fresh fruits on top of the cake can make it visually appealing and enhances the flavor. Berries like strawberries, blueberries, gooseberries or slices of tropical fruits like kiwi, pineapple can be arranged in a pattern or simply scattered on the top of the cake. Ensure that the fruits are fresh, clean, and dry before adding them to the cake. 4. **Using nuts and seeds**: Coarsely chopped or sliced almonds, pistachios, walnuts, or seeds like sesame seeds and flax seeds add a lovely texture and a natural hearty touch to your cake. Toasting them lightly before adding enhances the flavor. 5. **Decorate with coconut**: If your cake flavor complements coconut, consider sprinkling unsweetened shredded coconut over the top of your cake. 6. **Edible flowers**: If you want to make the cake very attractive and interesting, consider using edible flowers. They can add a touch of elegance to your dessert. 7. **Chocolate/caramel drizzle**: For a chocolate or caramel lover, a drizzle of these over the top can look appealing. Remember to do this just before serving so its doesn't make your cake soggy. 8. **Cocoa Powder**: Similar to powdered sugar, cocoa powder can be sifted over the cake to give it a sophisticated finish. 9. **Using a cake topper**: This can be a very convenient option. There are thousands of designs available online to suit just about any occasion or theme. 10. **Cream or Custard**: Serve the cake with a side of whipped cream or custard. This is not technically decorating, but it does add to the overall presentation, and can somewhat substitute for the creaminess of frosting. All the steps primarily depend on the flavor of the cake and personal preference. It also relies on the occasion and theme, if any. Allowing the cake to cool down before decoration is crucial as it prevents the toppings from melting or getting soggy. Finally, balance is key. You want to add to the cake's visual appeal and flavor without overwhelming it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer this question: Which African capital is named after a US President?","output":"The African capital that is named after a US President is Monrovia, which is the capital city of Liberia. Monrovia is named in honor of James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States, who served from 1817 to 1825. Monroe was an influential figure in the establishment of Liberia as a colony for freed African-American slaves. Liberia, located in West Africa, was founded in the early 19th century by the American Colonization Society (ACS), a group of American abolitionists, politicians, and philanthropists who believed that the best way to address the issues faced by African-Americans in the United States was to help them establish a colony in Africa. Their goal was to provide freed slaves with an opportunity to escape the racial discrimination and inequality they experienced in the US by establishing a new life in Africa. The American Colonization Society acquired land in West Africa and established Liberia, encouraging African-Americans to emigrate there and establish a new and free society. In 1822, the ACS founded the city of Monrovia, which was later incorporated in 1824. The city was named in honor of James Monroe because of his support for the ACS and his role as a key proponent of the colonization policy. Monroe believed that establishing a colony for former slaves in Africa would not only help to reduce racial tensions in the US but also promote the abolitionist cause by showing that freed slaves could thrive and create a successful society in their own right. Today, Monrovia is the largest city in Liberia, with a population of over 1 million people. It serves as the nation's economic, political, and cultural center. Liberia, as a country, still maintains close ties with the United States, using the US dollar as their official currency alongside the Liberian dollar, and adopting a similar government structure, with the three branches of government mirroring those in the US. In conclusion, Monrovia is the African capital named after a US President, specifically James Monroe. The city was founded by the American Colonization Society as part of their efforts to establish a colony for freed African-American slaves. Monroe supported the cause and played an essential role in the early development of Liberia, with his legacy continuing to shape the country to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Pinky and the Brain is an American animated television series. It was the first animated television series to be presented in Dolby Surround and the fourth collaboration of Steven Spielberg with his production company, Amblin Television, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation. The characters first appeared in 1993 as a recurring segment on Animaniacs. It was later picked up as a series due to its popularity, with 65 episodes produced. As with Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain was scored by a team of talented composers, led by Emmy-Award-winning composer Richard Stone. This team included Steven Bernstein and Julie Bernstein, who also orchestrated and sometimes conducted the 40-piece orchestra. The recordings were done on Stage A on the Warner Bros lot, the same stage (and with the same piano) where Carl Stalling recorded his Looney Tunes music. The theme music for Pinky and the Brain was composed by Richard Stone with lyrics by Tom Ruegger.  Two versions of the opening sequence and theme, with slightly different lyrics, were used during Animaniacs shorts. In the first version, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot (voiced respectively by Paulsen, Harnell, and MacNeille) popped up in the lab and sang the theme while letting the two mice out of their cage. The second, later version had the singers off-camera as the Brain picked the lock on the cage door with a small needle to free himself and Pinky. On the Pinky and the Brain show, the theme gained an additional two verses and was sung by Harnell, Dorian Harewood, Jim Cummings, and Paulsen.  The score sometimes includes references to classical music. For example, in the episode where the Brain builds a new Papier-mache Earth, the theme from the 2nd and 4th movements of Dvorak's 'New World Symphony' can be heard throughout the episode. The episode Napoleon Brainaparte makes frequent reference to the French anthem, La Marseillaise, while in the episode in which Pinky becomes the artist \\"Pinkasso\\" Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition can be heard. Who made the music for Pinky and the Brain?","output":"The music for Pinky and the Brain was scored by a team of talented composers, led by Emmy-Award-winning composer Richard Stone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They both started the experiment with pure water, and had to perform different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. At the end of the experiment, both of them measured the concentration of hydronium ions present in their reaction mixtures. Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present, while Sabrina had a low concentration present in her mixture.  and a hint : If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass.  Please answer this question : Which person's mixture, Alexiev's or Sabrina's, would taste less sour at the end? Answer:","output":"Sabrina's mixture would taste less sour at the end, as it has a lower concentration of hydronium ions, indicating a higher pH value and making it less acidic than Alexiev's mixture."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.
