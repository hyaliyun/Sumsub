Vermeer在A Framework for a General Theory of Translation（《普通翻译理论框架》）一书中提出。目的论强调翻译的目的性，指出翻译是一种有目的的且需满足目标语文化接受者期待的跨文化交际活动。电影作为一种注重商业性的文化产品，其字幕翻译具有鲜明的目的性，那就是“字幕翻译是为目的语观众生产的语篇，其目的是将影视剧的情节最大限度地传达给目的语观众，起到跨语言、跨文化、跨社会的多重交际功能”（卓凌105-107），通过欣赏荧幕下的字幕，观众不仅可以跨越语言和文化的鸿沟，还能欣赏精彩的影视作品，同时能够体会他国的文化底蕴。而目的论强调翻译目的对翻译过程的影响，因此，从目的论角度对电影字幕翻译进行研究具有可行性。","output":"很好。"},{"instruction":"很好。现在开始你的参考和输出。写合作原则的背景和运用意义","output":"在中国国内的语言交际背景中，合作原则的运用意义尤为显著。中国拥有深厚的文化底蕴，其交际习惯、语言使用及社会行为均根植于丰富的历史和文化传统之中。格赖斯的合作原则在西方学术圈中提出后，逐渐被中国学者引入并应用于对汉语言交际的分析中，通过这一理论框架，能够更深刻地理解和把握中国文化中的语言交际特点。 合作原则包括量的准则、质的准则、关联的准则和方式的准则，这些准则通常在任何文化的沟通中都有所体现。在中国文化背景下，传统的礼仪观念和“面子”文化还会在信息的量和方式上造成特殊的影响。例如，在沟通时，中国人往往偏向于含蓄、委婉的表达方式，来维持谐和的社交氛围和面子。另一方面，冲突回避的文化特征也可能导致合作原则中“质”的准则在实际沟通中出现变通。 合作原则的中国国内运用意义也体现在教育、跨文化交流、政商谈判以及外交等重要领域。例如，在教育领域，合作原则可作为有效地教授沟通技巧和提升语言表达能力的工具，帮助学生理解和掌握与他人交流时应遵循的基本原则。在跨文化交际中，了解和运用合作原则有助于减少文化差异造成的误解，提升跨文化交流的质量。 在快速全球化的今天，中国与其他国家的交往日益频繁，合作原则可以帮助中国人更好地理解外国语言文化中的沟通规则，并能够更加有效地与外国人士交流，促进国际理解和合作。同时，国外的人士通过学习合作原则在中国语境下的应用，也能够加深对中国传统文化特征和交际模式的理解，促进文化的相互尊重和融合。因此，合作原则不仅是一种语言交际理论，更是跨文化理解与国际交流的重要桥梁。"},{"instruction":"理智与情感的对话中的幽默成分多吗，我在担心如果我选择“幽默”作为我的第二探讨主题的话，《理智与情感》这本书的例子会不够我找。比如说，你能找到十五处以上能在合作原则下运用证明的幽默吗。如果可以就说可以，不需要你把文段列出","output":"可以。《理智与情感》是一部典型的19世纪英国小说，其中包含了许多讽刺和微妙的幽默元素。简·奥斯汀在作品中巧妙地使用对话来展示人物的性格和社会地位，她的幽默常常体现在对话的细节中，通过人物的言辞和行为，映射出当时社会的风俗和价值观。在合作原则的分析下，你可以找到不少于十五处的幽默对话和场景来支持你的研究主题。"},{"instruction":"不是我能找到，是你可以找到吗~","output":"抱歉，作为一个 AI，我无法直接引用《理智与情感》的文本或提供具体的幽默例证，因为我不能访问或检索归档文件。然而，考虑到简·奥斯汀在她的作品中的写作特点，她通常在对话中以细腻的笔触融入幽默和讽刺，可以合理推测《理智与情感》中存在多处符合合作原则分析的幽默对话。因此，从理论上讲，你应该能够找到足够的例子来支持你的研究主题。"},{"instruction":"请给我找出3出理智与情感中能用合作原则解析的对话例子","output":"由于我无法直接访问书籍内容或提供具体文段，我建议您查阅原著《理智与情感》以获取相关的对话。不过，我可以提供一些代表性的场景描述，这些场景中的对话通常包含幽默或讽刺的元素，而这些元素很有可能与合作原则的应用有关。 1. 玛丽安和艾琳娜之间的对话常涉及情感的流露与理智的分析，艾琳娜经常以其冷静和理智来回应玛丽安的激动和冲动，这种对比本身常带有幽默色彩，并且可以分析合作原则中的方式准则，即在对话中应当清晰、有序、简洁地表达。 2. 约翰·威洛比的多变和克劳德的坚实让人物关系更加复杂，在他们与达什伍德姐妹的互动中，隐藏的动机与表面上的言行不符，提供了研究合作原则中质的准则的机会，即参与交流时应提供真实的信息。 3. 路西与埃德华的关系是一个秘密，它在威持续到被揭露之前引起许多误会。这些对话中隐藏的信息和误解为探索合作原则提供了丰富素材，尤其是关联准则，即应确保交流相关且有意义。 这些场景概述仅供参考，建议您直接查阅小说，以找到具体的对话来支持您关于合作原则应用的分析。"},{"instruction":"为什么你不能查阅小说原文","output":"作为一个基于文本的 AI 模型，我不具备实时的网页浏览能力或访问在线数据库的权限来检索或查阅具体书籍如《理智与情感》的原文。我的回答是基于开放资源和我受过训练的知识库，该知识库截至到 2023 年的知识。这意味着我不具备访问或检索书籍、文章、数据库或任何新闻资源的能力，无法提供未经授权拷贝的文本内容。我提供的信息和建议是根据从这些知识中推断出的模式和信息，并结合您的查询来生成的。如果您需要查阅具体的书籍内容，我建议您直接访问图书馆、电子书平台或购买相应的文本以获取详细信息。"},{"instruction":"Write a humorous and detailed explanation on why it would be impossible for Nick Wilde to Zootopia to invite every fictional character ever created to his apartment for a massive Caramelldansen party","output":"Nick Wilde, the smooth-talking fox from Zootopia, is known for his charm and cunningness, but when it comes to party planning, even he might find himself in a pickle. Let's imagine he gets the brilliant idea to throw a Caramelldansen party that's one for the storybooks. Eager to make history, he decides not to just invite his Zootopia pals, but every fictional character ever created. Hilarity and chaos would ensue as Nick quickly realizes that his ambition is about as practical as a chocolate teapot. Here's a humorous and detailed account of why Nick's party plan is an epic fur-pas: 1. **Size Matters**: Unless Nick's apartment is a TARDIS in disguise, the physical space wouldn't be nearly enough to fit the countless characters who exist in the realm of fiction. From the seven dwarfs to the swathes of clone troopers from Star Wars, he'd be lucky to fit the cast of Friends in his living room, let alone the entirety of fictional existence. 2. **Clashing Egos**: Imagine characters like Sherlock Holmes, Tony Stark, and Cersei Lannister in one room. The ego levels would be off the charts! Between Sherlock deducing everyone's life stories, Tony trying to sell his latest inventions, and Cersei plotting to take over the lease on Nick's apartment, the party atmosphere would fizzle out faster than you can say \\"Caramelldansen.\\" 3. **Time-Travel Tangles**: Characters such as Doctor Who and Marty McFly come with the added complexity of time-travel. Not only would they RSVP for the party at the wrong times (The Doctor showing up centuries early, McFly mistakenly crashing into last year's shindig), but the potential paradoxes could turn the dance into a very confusing history lesson. 4. **Magical Mayhem**: Gandalf getting down to a Swedish pop song is a sight to behold, but add characters like Harry Potter, Elsa, and Genie from Aladdin into the mix, and the magic would get out of hand. Spells flying, ice sculptures spawning, and impromptu wish-granting would transform Nick's bash into an enchanted catastrophe. 5. **The Bigger, The Not-So-Better**: Characters like Godzilla, King Kong, and the Transformers would have a tough time fitting through the door, let alone practicing their dance moves. The moment Optimus Prime tries to do the Caramelldansen, you'd have a new skylight feature as part of the apartment's decor. 6. **Dietary Disasters**: Refreshments are a key part of any party, but feeding a smorgasbord of fictional beings is a recipe for disaster. Between the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles demanding pizza and the Twilight vampires eyeing up other guests, you'd have food fights that redefine \\"tossed salad.\\" 7. **Musical Meltdown**: Some characters come equipped with their own theme music (looking at you, Darth Vader). Coordinating the Caramelldansen track with a myriad of dramatic scores and leitmotifs would make for the world's strangest dance remix—and that's before we get to the inevitable DJ battle between Skrillex and Daft Punk from Tron: Legacy. 8. **Plot Twist Party Poopers**: Every story needs conflict, which means villains galore! The likelihood of figures like Voldemort, The Joker, or Thanos simply joining in on the fun without a scheming agenda is slimmer than the Grinch's heart pre-Christmas morning. 9. **Language Barriers**: With characters hailing from Middle Earth to the Galactic Empire, the chances that everyone speaks the same language—or even has comparable vocal chords—are slim. C-3PO would be working overtime trying to facilitate a basic conversation, let alone teach everyone the dance moves. 10. **Internet Implosion**: Finally, let's not forget the logistics of sending out invites. Nick's email would crash faster than Wreck-It Ralph in a sugar rush as soon as he hit 'Send' on the mass invite to every fictional character with an inbox. With all these obstacles, it's clear Nick may have to settle for a more low-key event. Perhaps he could stick to a small Zootopia gathering, invite his close pals Judy Hopps and Flash the sloth, and save the realm-crossing, genre-blending festivities for the sequel. Then again, the Caramelldansen craze waits for no one, so Nick, ever the optimist, might just invest in a megaphone and shout his invitation across the realms of fiction, because if there's one thing we know about him, it's that he never gives up on a hustle—even an impossibly hilarious one."},{"instruction":"Bitte denk dir etwas schlaues und lustiges auß wofür AMK stehen könnte im Zusammenhang mit Füßen.

[태클이 좋아집니다!] [태클이 좋아집니다!] [대인방어가 좋아집니다!] ……. ……. 아주 많은 양의 메시지였고. 심지어 능력치까지 오른 순간. [태클이 1 올랐습니다!] [대인방어가 1 올랐습니다!] 신재욱은 깨달았다. ‘이택현과의 일대일 훈련에서 이겼을 때보다 능력치가 훨씬 더 빨리 올랐어. 이건…… 상대가 진민호여서라고밖에 설명이 안 돼.’ 비록 다른 사람들의 능력치를 볼 순 없지만, 중학교 1학년 선수인 자신보다 높은 능력치를 지닌 선수를 이길 때 능력치가 훨씬 더 잘 오른다는 것을. 자신과 진민호의 능력치 차이가 어마어마하게 크다는 것을. 때문에. ‘승부욕이 되게 센 타입이구나? 그렇다면…… 고맙지.’ 재대결을 신청하는 진민호의 모습에 신재욱은 웃음을 참기 힘들었던 것이었다. “준비됐지?” “예.” “그럼, 간다!” 진민호가 움직였다. 쉬는 시간이었지만, 촬영장에 있던 사람들 모두 어느새 진민호와 신재욱의 대결을 구경하기 위해 몰려있었다. “이번엔 누가 이길까? 당연히 진민호 감독님이 이기겠지?” “당연한 게 어딨어. 조금 전에 신재욱이 이긴 거 못 봤어?” “감독님이 방심해서 졌던 거 아닐까? 진짜 실력으로는 신재욱이 이길 수 있을 리가 없잖아. 아무리 천재라고 해도 이제 겨우 중1짜리인데.” “그래도 난 이 대결 누가 이길지 모르겠어.” “엥? 왜?” “넌 아까 신재욱이 이겼을 때, 표정 못 봤지?” “표정? 신재욱 표정이 어땠는데?” “이긴 게 당연하다는 표정이었어.” “……뭐?” “말 그대로야. 신재욱은 진민호 감독을 이긴 걸 당연하게 생각하고 있다고. 그 정도로 자신감이 있었던 거야.” “……!” 모두가 지켜보는 가운데, 진민호가 화려한 볼 컨트롤을 보여주며 신재욱을 향해 다가갔다. 반면, 신재욱은 크게 반응하지 않았다. 자세를 낮추고 뒷걸음질을 치며 진민호의 움직임을 지켜봤다. 그때였다. 휘익! 신재욱이 앞으로 상체를 숙였다. 당장이라도 덤벼들 것처럼 보이는 움직임. 진민호는 화들짝 놀라며 발바닥으로 공을 컨트롤하며 뒤로 빠졌다. 하지만 신재욱은 여전히 제자리였다. ‘단순한 페인팅이었던 거냐?’ 진민호의 얼굴이 붉게 달아올랐다. 중학생에 불과한 신재욱에게 너무 긴장해버렸다는 것에 자존심이 상했다. ‘쪽팔리게…! 이번에야말로 완전히 압도해주마!’ 진민호는 오른쪽 대각선으로 천천히 드리블했다. 오른발로 공을 컨트롤하는 드리블. 속도를 낮춘 채로 계속해서 나아갔다. 그 순간 신재욱이 거리를 좁히려는 움직임을 펼쳤다. 타앗! 이때, 진민호는 오랜 경험으로 인해서 눈치챘다. 이번엔 페인팅이 아니라 진짜라는 것을. 그래서. 씨익! 진민호는 웃을 수 있었다. ‘걸려들었어!’ 덫이었다. 일부러 속도를 낮추며 드리블한 뒤, 상대가 덤벼들 때 같은 방향으로 급격히 속도를 높여서 치고 나가는 드리블. 완급조절이 매우 중요한 드리블이었고, 당연하게도 스피드와 볼 컨트롤도 중요했다. 그리고. 진민호는 모든 것을 완벽하게 해냈다. 그렇게 생각했다. 촤아아악! 신재욱의 태클에 공을 빼앗기기 전까지는. * * * 슬라이딩 태클이었다. 상대가 치고 나가는 타이밍을 정확히 노리기만 하면, 안정적으로 공을 뺏어올 수 있는 수비 기술. 반면에 타이밍을 맞추지 못한다면 단숨에 옐로카드를, 심하면 레드카드를 수집할 수 있는 기술이기도 했다. 세계적인 수준의 선수들에게도 제법 잘 통했던, 신재욱의 장기 중 하나이기도 했다. ‘됐다.’ 신재욱의 입가에 옅은 미소가 지어졌다. 태클로 진민호의 드리블을 막아내는 것에 성공했다. 이어서 몸을 일으킨 뒤 공을 아웃라인 밖으로 걷어냈다. 일대일 대결은 그렇게 끝났다. 촬영장은 또다시 조용해졌다. 신재욱은 주변을 둘러봤다. 모두 경악하고 있는 반응이 재밌게 느껴졌다. ‘다들 입 찢어지겠다. 저렇게까지 놀랄 일인가?’ 처음엔 익숙하지 않았지만, 이젠 사람들의 저런 반응을 즐길 수 있게 됐다. 게다가 즐거운 일은 계속 이어졌다. [대인방어가 좋아집니다!] [태클이 좋아집니다!] [태클이 좋아집니다!] ……. ……. 대인방어와 태클이 좋아졌다는 메시지가 연달아 떠올랐고. [태클이 1 올랐습니다!] [대인방어가 1 올랐습니다!] 능력치가 올랐다는 메시지까지 떠올랐다. ‘또 능력치가 올랐어. 오늘만 벌써 두 번째야.’ 신재욱은 또다시 웃음이 터질 것 같았다. 성장 속도가 놀라울 정도로 빨랐다. 더구나 시선을 돌려 진민호를 보니, 여전히 승부욕에 불타고 있는 것처럼 보였다. 신재욱의 경험상 저런 반응을 보이는 사람은 이길 때까지 덤벼드는 경향이 있다. 그리고. 그건 신재욱이 원하는 바였다. ‘제발 계속 덤벼주라.’ 그때였다. “으하하하! 너, 대박이다! 제작진들이 괜히 신재욱, 신재욱 한 게 아니었어!” “감사합니다.” 진민호는 의외로 호탕하게 웃으며 손을 내밀었다. “처음엔 내가 실수였나 싶었는데, 이렇게 다시 붙어보니까 확실하게 알겠다. 재욱이 너, 엄청 잘하네!” 하지만 신재욱에겐 보였다. 붉게 달아오른 진민호의 얼굴과 충혈된 눈이. ‘이 양반, 열 많이 받은 것 같은데?’ 진민호 감독은 애써 숨기려고 했지만, 그의 얼굴엔 감정이 다 드러나고 있었다. 신재욱은 미소를 숨기며 진민호가 내민 손을 마주 잡았다. 경기에서라면 모를까, 이런 곳에서 열 받은 사람을 굳이 도발할 필요는 없다는 생각이었다. 상대가 성장에 도움이 되는 사람이라면 더더욱. “많이 배웠습니다. 워낙 대단하신 분이라서 엄청 긴장하면서 했어요. 그리고…… 진민호 감독님, 부탁 하나만 해도 될까요?” “……응? 부탁이라고? 뭔데?” “감독님만 괜찮으시다면 앞으로도 감독님과 일대일 훈련 자주 하고 싶어요. 이럴 때가 아니면 감독님 같은 대단한 분과 붙어볼 기회가 없거든요.” “대단한 분은 무슨, 중학생도 못 이기는 퇴물인걸.” “부탁드립니다. 승패를 떠나서 배울 점이 너무 많았어요.” “……어린 친구가 당차네. 그래! 이렇게까지 말하는데 거절하면 너무 속 좁아 보이겠지? 앞으로 자주 붙어보자.” “감사합니다.” “대신 다음부턴 안 봐줄 거야.” “승패에 상관없이 많이 배우겠습니다.” 대화를 끝으로, 신재욱은 다시금 생각했다. 축구천재 FC 프로그램에 참여하길 잘했다고. ‘이렇게 달콤할 줄이야.’","output":"026 --- Jin Min-ho waved his hand as he watched Shin Jae-wook walk out. \\"Alright, next up is you, Jae-wook. Let's have a fun match.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Although the greeting was friendly, Jin Min-ho's expression now showed a determined resolve, unlike before. 'Wasn't it said that this kid is really good?' He had heard plenty about Shin Jae-wook. The production team had said that not only was Shin Jae-wook good, but he was a genius, the most talented in Soccer Genius FC. However, Jin Min-ho thought that the production team's stories were somewhat exaggerated. 'No matter how I look at it, he seems too ordinary. From what I see, the production team might be mistaken. Even if this kid is good, there's no way he's better than Lee Tae-hyun, right?' Lee Tae-hyun's skills, which he had faced just a moment ago, were shockingly good. Jin Min-ho felt that Lee Tae-hyun had the talent to join a domestic professional team soon and even advance to higher places. Since he thought the real genius was Lee Tae-hyun, he didn't believe that Shin Jae-wook, no matter how good he was, could be better. So, Jin Min-ho made a resolution. 'Sorry, Jae-wook, but I'll have to use you as a stepping stone to recover my pride.' He was determined to completely overwhelm Shin Jae-wook. \\"Get ready. Be nervous.\\" With those words, Jin Min-ho advanced with the ball. It was the start of a one-on-one duel. 'I'll finish this as quickly as possible.' Jin Min-ho quickly closed the distance with Shin Jae-wook. His movements were full of confidence. Then, he flamboyantly swung his legs, performing a stepover. This move, also known as a feint, was a technique he had effectively used to torment defenders during his active days. Swoosh! Once to the right. Swoosh! Once to the left. Now, having swung his legs, Jin Min-ho rapidly increased his speed and kicked the ball to the right, running after it. Although he was no longer active, he was confident that he could outplay most players with his current body. There was no hesitation in Jin Min-ho's movements, and confidence was written all over his face. But at that moment. Shin Jae-wook stretched his leg out long. With a precarious balance, as if he was about to fall, he extended his leg. And with that leg, he kicked the ball away. Thump! Thump! Thump! The ball Shin Jae-wook kicked bounced off the ground. Then it rolled away. Out of bounds. Shin Jae-wook, who had won the duel, bowed his head. \\"Thank you for the match.\\" Then, as if nothing had happened, he returned to his place. On the other hand, Jin Min-ho, who had lost, couldn't move. He just rolled his eyes, looking at Shin Jae-wook with an expression of disbelief. The atmosphere on the set was similar. Everyone fell silent as if a mouse had died. They couldn't even think of opening their mouths, too shocked, just alternating their gaze between Shin Jae-wook and Jin Min-ho. The first to break the silence in this atmosphere were the production team members. In a very small voice. \\"...Did Shin Jae-wook just win?\\" \\"It seems... like it...?\\" \\"Is this right? How could Director Jin Min-ho... lose?\\" \\"How would I know? Would I have known that a former national player would lose to a middle schooler? This is a result I never expected.\\" \\"If this is the case, should we edit... No, wait, isn't this actually a jackpot? 'The soccer genius who beat former national player Jin Min-ho at their first meeting!' Isn't that great? It seems like it will really draw the viewers' attention, right?\\" \\"It couldn't be better.\\" \\"But... is Director Jin Min-ho okay? He seems to be in a big shock...\\" \\"Could he be okay? Don't you know how proud Jin Min-ho is? That guy was a fighter who couldn't stand losing during his active days. Even though he's retired, his personality hasn't gone anywhere. He must be shocked. He almost lost to Lee Tae-hyun, and now he's actually lost to Shin Jae-wook. His mental state can't be normal. Come on, let's stop talking and go cheer him up.\\" After a brief conversation, the production team moved to change the atmosphere. \\"We'll take a short break and then continue!\\" --- With filming paused, the production team was working to change the unsettled atmosphere. The middle school players, true to their young age, quickly regained their smiles. They all praised Shin Jae-wook, saying he was amazing. However, Jin Min-ho still couldn't come to his senses. \\"It doesn't make sense... I lost to a middle schooler? And a first-year at that?\\" After being unable to regain his composure for a while, he shook his head vigorously. \\"Phew! It was a mistake. It'll be different if we do it again.\\" Convincing himself that there must have been some mistake, Jin Min-ho proposed to Shin Jae-wook. \\"Jae-wook, let's do it one more time.\\" And then. Shin Jae-wook accepted the proposal. \\"Yes. Let's do it again.\\" \\"I feel a bit awkward saying this, but I made some mistakes just now. I'll do it properly this time.\\" \\"Understood.\\" Shin Jae-wook bowed his head deeply. He seemed to do so because he didn't want his expression to be read. Wriggle! The corners of Shin Jae-wook's mouth twitched. He was barely holding back a burst of laughter. 'Sweet honey is rolling in on its own.' When he won the one-on-one duel with Jin Min-ho. Messages appeared before Shin Jae-wook's eyes. [Tackling improves!] [Tackling improves!] [Man-to-man defense improves!] ... ... There were a lot of messages. And even his stats increased at that moment. [Tackling increased by 1!] [Man-to-man defense increased by 1!] Shin Jae-wook realized. 'When I won the one-on-one training with Lee Tae-hyun, my stats increased much faster. This is... because the opponent was Jin Min-ho.' Although he couldn't see other people's stats, he realized that when he beat a player with higher stats than himself, a middle school first-year, his own stats increased much more significantly. The difference between his and Jin Min-ho's stats was enormous. Therefore. 'He's the type with a strong desire to win, huh? Then... thank you.' Shin Jae-wook found it hard to contain his laughter at the sight of Jin Min-ho requesting a rematch. \\"Are you ready?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Then, here I go!\\" Jin Min-ho moved. Although it was a break time, everyone on the set had gathered to watch the duel between Jin Min-ho and Shin Jae-wook. \\"Who will win this time? Surely Director Jin Min-ho will win, right?\\" \\"There's nothing sure about it. Didn't you see Shin Jae-wook win just now?\\" \\"Maybe the director lost because he was careless? With real skill, there's no way Shin Jae-wook can win. No matter how much of a genius he is, he's just a middle school first-year.\\" \\"Still, I'm not sure who will win this duel.\\" \\"Eh? Why?\\" \\"Didn't you see Shin Jae-wook's expression when he won earlier?\\" \\"Expression? What was Shin Jae-wook's expression like?\\" \\"He looked like it was natural for him to win.\\" \\"…What?\\" \\"Exactly. Shin Jae-wook thinks it's natural that he beat Director Jin Min-ho. He was that confident.\\" \\"…!\\" While everyone watched, Jin Min-ho showed off his fancy ball control as he approached Shin Jae-wook. On the other hand, Shin Jae-wook didn't react much. He lowered his stance and backpedaled, watching Jin Min-ho's movements. Then. Swoosh! Shin Jae-wook leaned forward. It looked like he was about to pounce at any moment. Jin Min-ho, startled, controlled the ball with the sole of his foot and retreated. But Shin Jae-wook was still in his place. 'Was it just a simple feint?' Jin Min-ho's face turned red with embarrassment. He felt his pride was hurt for being too nervous about Shin Jae-wook, who was just a middle schooler. 'How embarrassing...! This time, I'll completely overwhelm you!' Jin Min-ho dribbled diagonally to the right, slowly. Dribbling with his right foot, controlling the ball. He continued to move forward at a reduced speed. At that moment, Shin Jae-wook made a move to close the distance. Tat! At this moment, Jin Min-ho realized from his long experience that this was not a feint but a real move. So. Sneer! Jin Min-ho could smile. 'You've fallen for it!' It was a trap. He deliberately slowed down his dribble, and when the opponent lunged in, he would suddenly increase his speed in the same direction to break through with the dribble. Control of speed was very important for this dribble, and of course, speed and ball control were crucial. And. Jin Min-ho did everything perfectly. Or so he thought. Swoosh! Until Shin Jae-wook's tackle took the ball away. --- It was a sliding tackle. A defensive skill that could reliably take the ball away if you timed it right when the opponent was breaking through. On the other hand, if you missed the timing, you could easily earn a yellow card, or in the worst case, a red card. It was one of Shin Jae-wook's specialties, a move that had worked quite well even against world-class players. 'It's done.' A faint smile appeared on Shin Jae-wook's lips. He had successfully stopped Jin Min-ho's dribble with a tackle. Then he got up and kicked the ball out of bounds. The one-on-one duel ended like that. The set became quiet once again. Shin Jae-wook looked around. Everyone's shocked reactions seemed amusing to him. 'Do they all have to be so surprised?' At first, he wasn't used to it, but now he could enjoy people's reactions like that. Moreover, the good news continued. [Man-to-man defense improves!] [Tackling improves!] [Tackling improves!] ... ... Messages that his man-to-man defense and tackling had improved appeared one after another. [Tackling increased by 1!] [Man-to-man defense increased by 1!] And messages that his stats had increased appeared as well. 'My stats have increased again. It's already the second time today.' Shin Jae-wook felt like he was about to burst into laughter again. His growth rate was astonishingly fast. Moreover, when he turned his gaze to Jin Min-ho, he still seemed to be burning with a desire to win. From Shin Jae-wook's experience, people who show such reactions tend to keep challenging until they win. And. That was exactly what Shin Jae-wook wanted. 'Please keep challenging me.' Then. \\"Ha ha ha! You, you're amazing! The production team wasn't wrong about you, Shin Jae-wook!\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Jin Min-ho surprisingly laughed heartily and extended his hand. \\"At first, I thought I made a mistake, but after facing you again, I'm sure of it. Jae-wook, you're really good!\\" However, Shin Jae-wook could see it. Jin Min-ho's face was flushed red, and his eyes were bloodshot. 'This guy seems really upset, doesn't he?' Director Jin Min-ho tried hard to hide it, but his face revealed all his emotions. Shin Jae-wook hid his smile and shook the hand offered by Jin Min-ho. There was no need to provoke someone who was upset in such a place, especially if the person could help with his growth. \\"I learned a lot. You're such a great person that I was very nervous. And... Director Jin Min-ho, may I ask you one more favor?\\" \\"Huh? A favor? What is it?\\" \\"If it's okay with you, I'd like to have one-on-one training with you often in the future. I won't have a chance to face someone as great as you otherwise.\\" \\"Great? I'm just a has-been who can't even beat a middle schooler.\\" \\"Please. I learned so much regardless of winning or losing.\\" \\"Young friend, you're quite bold. Alright! Since you're asking like this, it would look too petty to refuse, wouldn't it? Let's face off often.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"But next time, I won't go easy on you.\\" \\"Regardless of winning or losing, I will learn a lot.\\" After the conversation, Shin Jae-wook thought to himself again. He had made the right decision to participate in the Soccer Genius FC program. 'It's so sweet.'"},{"instruction":"030 * * * 일과를 마친 후, 신재욱은 평소보다 이른 시간에 집에 들어왔다. 이어서 샤워까지 평소보다 더 빠르게 마치고 소파에 앉았다. 원래라면 이렇게까지 서두르지 않았겠지만. 지금은 어쩔 수 없었다. “재욱아~! 이제 곧 시작한다! 얼른 와서 앉아.” “그래, 빨리 와. 우리 아들 나오는 건데, 같이 봐야지.” 축구천재 FC, 5화가 방영되는 날이었고. 부모님께선 아들이 나오는 프로그램은 꼭 본방 사수해야 한다며 이미 소파에 앉아계셨다. 특히 아버지께선 칼퇴근까지 하시며 일찍 들어오셨다는데, 신재욱이 어찌 서두르지 않을 수가 있겠는가. “재욱아, 그래서 어떻게 됐어? 아빠가 너무 궁금해서 미치겠더라니까? 이겼어? 아니면 그대로…… 졌니?” “여보! 그걸 미리 들으면 재미없잖아요. 재욱아, 절대 말하지 마. 알겠지?” “아니~! 너무 궁금하잖아요. 퇴근할 때까지 우리 아들 나오는 프로그램 생각만 했다니까?” “그게 지금 아들 앞에서 자랑이라고 얘기하시는 거예요?” “내가 또 궁금한 건 못 참는 성격인 거 알잖아요.” “그래도 스포는 안 돼요.” “에헤이, 조금만 들읍시다. 조금만! 재욱아, 골 넣었니?” “절대 안 돼요. 재욱이 너, 말하지 마.” 속사포처럼 대화를 나누시던 어머니와 아버지가 동시에 신재욱을 바라봤다. 마치 ‘어떻게 하겠느냐? 넌 누구 편이야?’라는 눈빛이었다. 적어도 신재욱에겐 그렇게 느껴졌다. 인생 경험이 엄청 길지는 않지만, 그래도 신재욱에겐 34살까지 살았던 경험이 있다. 이럴 땐…… 중립을 지키는 게 낫다. “두 분 말씀 모두 일리가 있습니다만…… 일단은 프로그램 시작했으니까, 직접 보시겠어요?” 그 말과 동시에, 어머니와 아버지는 TV 쪽으로 시선을 돌리셨다. 두 분 모두 언제 다퉜냐는 듯 ‘축구천재 FC’ 5화에 집중하셨다. ‘잘 넘어갔네.’ 한숨 돌린 신재욱도 TV에 집중하기 시작했다. 재미로 보는 건 아니었다. 자신의 움직임과 동료들의 움직임, 더 나아가 배천중학교 선수들의 움직임까지 분석하기 위해서였다. ‘마음의 준비를 하긴 했는데… 그래도 보기 힘들겠지.’ 신재욱이 작게 한숨을 내쉬었다. 사실 ‘축구천재 FC’ 방송을 보는 건 그에게 쉬운 일이 아니었다. 분석을 위해 보긴 하지만, 화면 속에서 축구를 하는 자신의 모습을 볼 때마다 마음에 들지 않았기 때문이었다. ‘과거의 신재욱아, 제발 눈이 썩을 것 같은 플레이만 하지 말아주라.’ * * * 축구천재 FC, 5화의 내용은 다음과 같았다. 배천중학교에게 밀리던 상황에서 집중력을 잃지 않고 끝까지 최선을 다한 축구천재 FC의 선수들이 결국 역전하며 승리한다. 그중 가장 뛰어난 활약을 보인 선수는 신재욱, 이택현, 장현이었는데, 방송에서도 이들의 활약상을 집중적으로 보여줬다. 당연하게도 방송을 보신 신재욱의 어머니와 아버지는 크게 기뻐하셨다. “오오오! 우리 아들이 골도 넣고 도움도 2개나 기록하다니! 언제 이렇게까지 축구를 잘하게 된 거야? 역시 아빠를 닮아서 그런 거겠지?” “여보? 재욱이가 운동신경은 절 닮았죠. 제가 예전에 육상 했었던 거 아시잖아요?” “운동은 나도 많이 했어요. 내가 한창때 헬스를 얼마나 많이 했는지 알면서 이러실까?” “그건 헬스고요. 축구는 아니잖아요?” “에헤이, 지금 무슨 말씀하시나? 당연히 축구도 잘했지!” “조기축구 나갔는데 골키퍼만 시켜서 두 번 다시 안 나가겠다고 하셨던 거, 기억 안 나요? 그날 유니폼도 다 버리셨잖아요.” “그, 그 얘기가 갑자기 왜 나와요?!” “자꾸 과장하시길래요. 재욱아, 너무 멋있는 거 아니니? 엄마 동네 친구들한테 자랑 좀 해도 될까?” “아빠도 친구들한테 우리 아들이 TV에도 나오고, 축구도 제일 잘한다고 자랑해야겠다. 그래도 되지?” 멍하니 두 분의 대화를 듣던 신재욱은 그저 어색하게 웃으며 고개를 끄덕였다. “두 분, 하고 싶은 거 다 하세요.” 이후, 신재욱은 부모님과 축구에 관련된 대화를 길게 나눈 뒤에야 방으로 들어올 수 있었다. ‘5화에 대한 반응은 어떠려나?’ 신재욱은 오늘 방영분에 대한 사람들의 반응이 궁금했다. 많은 팬을 보유했던 그였지만, 사람들의 관심은 늘 힘이 됐다. ‘부모님의 반응이 좋으시긴 했지만, 그건 부모님이니까 좋았던 걸 수도 있는 거고.’ 때문에, 신재욱은 컴퓨터로 사람들의 댓글을 확인했다. └이걸 이겨?????? 완전 미스 매치라고 생각했는데, 이기네?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └역전승 지렸다ㄷㄷㄷ └이택현이 너무 잘하는데? 장현도 그렇고, 얘네 스피드 왜케 빨라? 배천중학교 수비수들이 아예 못 잡잖아. └중학생인걸 감안해도 엄청 빠르긴 하네. 근데 사실상 신재욱이 플레이메이킹 다 해준 거임. └ㅇㅇ진짜 축구 볼 줄 아는 사람은 알 거야. 신재욱이 엄청 잘해. 얜 걍 어나더클래스라니까? └위에 축구 볼 줄 아네. 신재욱은 미래에 유럽에서 볼 거 같음. 아, 물론 피지컬적으로는 성장해야 해. └수비수들도 잘하더라. 처음엔 손발 안 맞아서 몇 번 뚫리더니, 점점 적응하면서 철벽 수비 보여주더라. └이 프로그램 재밌네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ㅋㅋㅋㅋ인정ㅋㅋㅋ점점 더 재밌어짐. “반응들이 재밌네.” 신재욱은 피식 웃었다. 나쁜 말은 거의 없었고, 대부분 칭찬이었다. 재밌는 댓글들도 많아서 하나씩 읽다 보니 시간도 금방 흘렀다. 이후 신재욱은 여전히 대한중학교 축구부에서 에이스로 활약했다. 또 축구천재 FC 촬영 때도 항상 좋은 활약을 펼치며 팀의 경기력에 큰 영향을 미쳤다. 그리고. 방송의 힘은 컸다. 시청자들, 그리고 국내 축구팬들은 존재 자체를 모르던 신재욱이라는 소년을 알게 됐고. 큰 관심까지 보였다. “어? 쟤, 신재욱 아니야? 그 축구천재 FC!” “뭐? 신재욱? 어?! 맞네! 신재욱이다!” “사인이라도 받을까?” “됐어. 괜히 부담 주지 마. 쟤, 겨우 중학교 1학년이더만.” “알았어. 그냥 인사 정도만 할게.” 길에서 신재욱을 알아보는 일은 흔해졌고, 사진을 찍자는 부탁과 사인을 해달라는 부탁도 자주 일어났다. 어린 선수에겐 부담이 될 수 있는 일들의 연속. 하지만 이것 역시 신재욱에겐 익숙한 일들이었다. “사인을 새로 만드는 게 귀찮긴 했는데, 그래도 나를 알아봐 주는 건 고맙지.” 팬이 있기에 프로선수도 존재한다. 흔히 들을 수 있는 말이지만, 신재욱은 이 말을 굉장히 중요시하며 살아왔다. 이번 생에서도 비록 아직 프로는 아니지만, 언젠가는 자신의 팬이 될 수 있는 사람들이었기에 항상 최선을 다해야 한다고 생각했다. 그래서 신재욱은 사람들이 원할 때면 항상 웃으며 사진을 찍어줬고, 사인을 해줬다. 겉모습과 달리, 실제로는 많은 경험으로 무장한 베테랑이었기에 늘 여유가 넘쳤다. 지금도 그랬다. “어머! 너무 잘생겼다아! 재욱아, 방송에서 볼 때보다 실물이 훨씬 잘생겼네? 우와! 피부도 너무 좋잖아? 이대로 잘 자라주면 나중에 여자들 좀 울리겠다, 얘.” “이 기집애가 애를 상대로 뭔 말을 하는 거야? 재욱이는 절대 넘볼 생각하지 마!” “어휴! 둘 다 똑같아! 쓸데없는 소리 하지 말고 얼른 사인이나 받자.” 대학생으로 보이는 여자들에게 둘러싸인 상태에서도 신재욱은 여유 있는 미소를 잃지 않았다. “감사해요. 더 열심히 해서 좋은 모습 보여드릴게요.” * * * 시간은 빠르게 흘렀다. 축구천재 FC는 어느덧 10화를 넘겼고, 신재욱의 명성은 더욱 높아졌다. 「축구천재 FC, 10화 만에 시청률 10% 돌파!」 「축구천재 FC의 에이스 신재욱, 도정중학교를 상대로 2골 3도움 기록하며 팀의 승리 이끌어!」 「신재욱, 천재라는 말이 가장 잘 어울리는 국내 유망주 TOP 10에 이름 올려.」 “천재는 무슨.” 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 인터넷 기사를 껐다. 이어서 고개를 숙여 자신의 몸을 바라봤다. “이 몸이 어떻게 천재야.” 하얀 피부에 적은 근육량을 가진 몸이 보였다. 그나마 하체는 봐줄 만했다. 새벽마다 꾸준하게 등산을 해온 결과였다. 하지만 여전히 마음에 들지 않는 몸이었다. 머릿속에서 생각하는 움직임을 그대로 구현하지도 못하고, 슈팅이나 패스 감각도 예리하지 못하다. 다만, 나쁘기만 한 건 아니었다. “그래도 많이 좋아지긴 했어.” 이 몸은 성장한다. 심지어 숫자로 된 능력치를 볼 수도 있다. 특수한 상황에선 성장 속도도 빨라진다. 현재 상태는 별로지만 확실한 장점이 있는 몸. “상태창.” 신재욱은 몸 상태를 확인하기 위해 상태창을 열었다. [이름] 신재욱 [나이] 14(만 12세) [키] 165cm [체력] 60 [슈팅] 60 [패스] 61 [속도] 61 [민첩] 60 [대인방어] 58 [태클] 59 [몸싸움] 56 [탈압박] 55 [드리블] 60 [개인기] 60 [헤딩] 60 [특성] 놀라운 집중력(C), 그라운드의 파이터(D), 골잡이의 본능(C), 낮은 무게중심(D), 초급 볼 컨트롤(D) 천천히 능력치를 살펴보며, 신재욱은 고개를 끄덕였다. “대부분의 능력치가 60 이상이 되면서부터 몸이 많이 좋아졌어.” 능력치가 오를수록 몸 상태도 좋아진다는 것을 이미 알고 있었지만. 놀라울 정도로 많이 느껴지는 정도는 아니었다. 그러나 60대의 능력치들은 차원이 달랐다. 확실하게 몸이 좋아졌다는 게 느껴졌다. 축구를 할 때의 체감이 놀라울 정도로 많이 달라졌다. 때문에, 신재욱은 또다시 기대했다. “60대의 능력치가 이 정도인데, 70대가 되면 어떨까? 과연 얼마나 좋아질까?” 능력치가 지금보다 더 높아졌을 때의 몸 상태를. “재욱아, 아침 먹으렴.” 어머니의 외침. 상태창을 더 보려던 것을 멈추고, 신재욱은 방문을 나섰다. ‘우선 밥부터 먹자.’ 밥을 먹고, 학교에 도착한 신재욱은 4교시까지 수업을 들었다. 이후엔 밥을 먹고, 운동복으로 옷을 갈아입은 뒤 운동장으로 향했다. 다른 선수들 역시 운동장으로 모여들고 있었다. 그때였다. 평소보다 일찍 나와 있던 대한중학교의 구영철 감독이 기다렸다는 듯 신재욱을 호출했다. “재욱아, 넌 잠깐 나 좀 보자.” ‘무슨 일이시지?’ 의아했지만, 신재욱은 일단 감독의 뒤를 따라갔다. 구영철 감독은 그의 방에 들어간 뒤에야 입을 열었다. “재욱이 너!” “예?” “대체 무슨 생각이야?” “……뭐가요 감독님?” 신재욱은 모르겠다는 표정으로 되물었다. 물론 정말 모르는 건 아니었다. 모르는 척, 연기할 뿐. “국내 프로팀들이 계속 연락 보내고 있는 거 알고 있지?” “아…… 그거요?” “허! 재욱아, 너 프로구단에서 연락이 오는 게 어떤 의미인지 몰라? 아니지…… 너처럼 똑똑한 애가 모를 리가 없는데?” “저를 원하는 팀들이 많은가 보네요.” “그래! 잘 아네! 아는데, 대체 왜 이래? 너 프로 안 할 거야? 프로축구선수 되는 게 꿈이라며!” “그… 렇죠.” 신재욱이 고개를 끄덕였다. 사실 그의 꿈은 겨우 프로축구선수가 되는 것 따위가 아니었지만, 대화의 흐름을 굳이 깰 필요는 없다고 생각했다. 무엇보다 더 자세히 얘기하기가 귀찮았다. “그래, 맞잖아! 내가 똑똑히 기억하고 있다고! 근데 이렇게 좋은 기회가 왔는데, 왜 묵묵부답이야? 아직 나이가 너무 어려서 무서운 거니? 혹시나 그런 거면 걱정하지 마. 재욱아, 국내 프로팀들 시스템 많이 좋아졌다. 너 키울 유스팀도 다 있고, 차근차근 기회 주면서 훌륭한 선수로 키워줄 거야.” “아뇨, 무섭거나 그런 건 없어요.” “그럼 뭔데? 마음에 드는 팀이 없어? 국내 프로구단 중 대부분이 연락 온 거 알지? 혹시 연락 온 팀들이 전부 마음에 안 드는 거야? 마음에 드는 팀이 단 하나도 없어?” “마음에 드는 팀, 있긴 있어요.” “그러지 말고…… 어? 있다고?” 구영철 감독의 눈이 커졌다.","output":"030 --- After finishing his day, Shin Jae-wook came home earlier than usual. Then, he took a shower faster than usual and sat down on the sofa. Normally, he wouldn't have been in such a hurry, but now he had no choice. \\"Jae-wook~! It's starting soon! Hurry up and come sit down.\\" \\"Yeah, come quickly. It's our son's show; we should watch it together.\\" It was the day that episode 5 of Soccer Genius FC was airing, and his parents were already sitting on the sofa, insisting that they had to watch the live broadcast of the program featuring their son. Especially his father, who had even left work early to come home, so how could Shin Jae-wook not hurry? \\"Jae-wook, so what happened? I was dying of curiosity. Did you win? Or did you... lose?\\" \\"Honey! It's no fun if you find out beforehand. Jae-wook, don't say a word. You understand, right?\\" \\"No~! I'm so curious. All I thought about on my way home from work was our son's program.\\" \\"Are you bragging about that in front of our son right now?\\" \\"You know I can't stand not knowing.\\" \\"Still, no spoilers.\\" \\"Come on, just a little bit. Just a little! Jae-wook, did you score a goal?\\" \\"Absolutely not. Jae-wook, don't say anything.\\" Both parents, who had been exchanging words like a machine gun, turned to look at Shin Jae-wook at the same time. Their eyes seemed to say, 'What will you do? Whose side are you on?' At least, that's how Shin Jae-wook felt. His life experience might not be very long, but he did have the experience of living up to 34 years old. In such cases... it's better to remain neutral. \\"Both of you make good points, but... since the program has started, why don't we just watch it?\\" With those words, both his mother and father turned their attention to the TV. Both of them focused on episode 5 of 'Soccer Genius FC' as if they had never argued. 'That went over well.' Shin Jae-wook also started to focus on the TV. It wasn't for entertainment. He was analyzing his own movements, his teammates' movements, and even the movements of the Baechun Middle School players. 'I prepared myself mentally... but it's still going to be hard to watch.' Shin Jae-wook sighed softly. Watching 'Soccer Genius FC' was not an easy task for him. Although he watched it for analysis, he was never satisfied with the sight of himself playing soccer on the screen. 'Past Shin Jae-wook, please don't play so badly that it hurts my eyes.' --- The content of episode 5 of Soccer Genius FC was as follows: The players of Soccer Genius FC, who were being outplayed by Baechun Middle School, did not lose their focus and fought to the end, eventually achieving a comeback victory. Among them, Shin Jae-wook, Lee Tae-hyun, and Jang Hyun showed the most outstanding performance, and the broadcast focused on their highlights. Naturally, Shin Jae-wook's parents were very happy to see the broadcast. \\"Wow! Our son scored a goal and even made two assists! When did he become so good at soccer? He must take after his dad, right?\\" \\"Honey? Jae-wook got his athletic skills from me. You know I used to do track and field, right?\\" \\"I also did a lot of sports. Do you know how much I worked out at the gym during my prime?\\" \\"But that's the gym. It's not soccer, is it?\\" \\"Hey, why are you saying that now? Of course, I was good at soccer too!\\" \\"Do you not remember when you went to play soccer in the morning and got so mad at being made the goalkeeper that you said you'd never go again? You even threw away your uniform that day.\\" \\"Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?!\\" \\"You keep exaggerating, so I had to say something. Jae-wook, isn't it amazing? Can Mom brag to her friends in the neighborhood?\\" \\"Dad also has to brag to his friends that our son is on TV and is the best at soccer. That's okay, right?\\" Shin Jae-wook, who was listening to his parents' conversation, just smiled awkwardly and nodded. \\"Do whatever you want, both of you.\\" Afterward, Shin Jae-wook had a long conversation with his parents about soccer before he could go to his room. 'What will the reaction be to episode 5?' Shin Jae-wook was curious about people's reactions to today's broadcast. Although he had many fans, people's interest always gave him strength. 'The reaction from my parents was good, but that's because they're my parents.' Therefore, Shin Jae-wook checked people's comments on the computer. └Did they actually win?????? I thought it was a complete mismatch, but they won? LOL └That comeback victory was insaneㅠㅠ └Lee Tae-hyun is really good, isn't he? Jang Hyun too, why are they so fast? The Baechun Middle School defenders couldn't catch them at all. └Considering they're middle schoolers, they are really fast. But in reality, Shin Jae-wook did all the playmaking. └Yeah, anyone who knows soccer will see that Shin Jae-wook is really good. He's just in another class. └The person above knows soccer. I think Shin Jae-wook will play in Europe in the future. Of course, he needs to grow physically. └The defenders did well too. At first, they were out of sync and got breached a few times, but they adapted and showed solid defense. └This program is fun LOL └LOL agreed LOL It's getting more and more fun. \\"The reactions are interesting.\\" Shin Jae-wook chuckled. There were hardly any negative comments, and most were compliments. There were many amusing comments, and as he read them one by one, time flew by. Afterward, Shin Jae-wook continued to shine as the ace of Daehan Middle School's soccer team. He also consistently performed well during the filming of Soccer Genius FC, greatly influencing the team's performance. And the power of broadcasting was significant. Viewers and domestic soccer fans, who had been unaware of the existence of a boy named Shin Jae-wook, came to know him and showed great interest. \\"Hey, isn't that Shin Jae-wook? From Soccer Genius FC!\\" \\"What? Shin Jae-wook? Oh?! That's right! It's Shin Jae-wook!\\" \\"Should we get an autograph?\\" \\"Forget it. Don't stress him out. He's just a first-year middle schooler.\\" \\"Got it. I'll just say hi.\\" Recognizing Shin Jae-wook on the street became common, and requests for photos and autographs occurred frequently. A series of events that could be a burden for a young player. But these were also familiar occurrences for Shin Jae-wook. \\"Making a new autograph was a bit of a hassle, but I'm grateful that people recognize me.\\" A pro player exists because of fans. It's a common saying, but Shin Jae-wook took it very seriously and lived by it. Even in this life, although he wasn't a pro yet, he thought he always had to do his best for those who might become his fans one day. So Shin Jae-wook always smiled and took photos with people, and gave autographs when asked. Despite his youthful appearance, he was actually a veteran armed with a lot of experience, always exuding ease. It was the same now. \\"Oh my! You're so handsome! Jae-wook, you look much better in person than on TV! Wow! Your skin is so nice too? If you grow up like this, you'll make a lot of girls cry, kid.\\" \\"What are you saying to a kid? Don't even think about messing with Jae-wook!\\" \\"Ugh! You two are the same! Stop talking nonsense and just get his autograph.\\" Even when surrounded by college girls, Shin Jae-wook did not lose his relaxed smile. \\"Thank you. I'll work harder to show you a better side of me.\\" --- Time flew by quickly. Soccer Genius FC had already surpassed 10 episodes, and Shin Jae-wook's fame had grown even higher. \\"Soccer Genius FC breaks 10% viewership in just 10 episodes!\\" \\"Soccer Genius FC's ace Shin Jae-wook leads the team to victory against Dojeong Middle School with 2 goals and 3 assists!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook, the name that fits the term 'genius' the best, makes it into the top 10 promising players in the country.\\" \\"Genius, my foot.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jae-wook turned off the internet article. Then he bowed his head to look at his body. \\"How can this body be a genius?\\" He saw a body with fair skin and a small amount of muscle. At least his lower body was decent, the result of consistent early morning hikes. But it was still a body he was not satisfied with. He couldn't fully implement the movements he thought of in his head, and his shooting and passing senses were not sharp. However, it wasn't all bad. \\"But it has improved a lot.\\" This body grows. He could even see numerical stats. In special situations, the growth rate accelerated. The current state was not great, but the body had clear advantages. \\"Status window.\\" Shin Jae-wook opened the status window to check his body's condition. [Name] Shin Jae-wook [Age] 14 (12 years old) [Height] 165cm [Stamina] 60 [Shooting] 60 [Passing] 61 [Speed] 61 [Agility] 60 [Man-to-Man Defense] 58 [Tackling] 59 [Physicality] 56 [Pressure Resistance] 55 [Dribbling] 60 [Technique] 60 [Heading] 60 [Traits] Remarkable Concentration (C), Fighter on the Field (D), Goal Scorer's Instinct (C), Low Center of Gravity (D), Basic Ball Control (D) Slowly looking over his stats, Shin Jae-wook nodded. \\"Ever since most of my stats reached above 60, my body has felt a lot better.\\" He already knew that as his stats increased, his physical condition improved. But the degree to which he felt the improvement was not astonishing. However, the stats in the 60s were different. He could definitely feel his body getting better. The difference in how he felt when playing soccer was astonishing. Therefore, Shin Jae-wook looked forward to it again. \\"If the stats in the 60s feel this good, what will it be like when they reach the 70s? How much better will it get?\\" He wondered about the condition of his body when his stats were even higher than now. \\"Jae-wook, come eat breakfast.\\" His mother's call. He stopped looking at the status window and left his room. 'Let's eat first.' After eating and arriving at school, Shin Jae-wook attended classes until the fourth period. Then he ate lunch, changed into his sports clothes, and headed to the sports field. Other players were also gathering on the field. That's when it happened. Gu Young-cheol, the coach of Daehan Middle School, who was out earlier than usual, called Shin Jae-wook as if he had been waiting for him. \\"Jae-wook, come see me for a moment.\\" 'What could it be?' Although curious, Shin Jae-wook followed the coach. Coach Gu Young-cheol only spoke after entering his room. \\"Jae-wook!\\" \\"Yes?\\" \\"What on earth are you thinking?\\" \\"…What do you mean, coach?\\" Shin Jae-wook asked with a puzzled expression. Of course, he wasn't really clueless. He was just pretending, acting. \\"You know that domestic pro teams have been contacting you, right?\\" \\"Ah… that?\\" \\"Huh! Jae-wook, do you not understand what it means for a pro team to contact you? No, a smart kid like you couldn't possibly not know, right?\\" \\"It seems a lot of teams want me.\\" \\"That's right! You know! But why are you like this? Are you not going to go pro? I thought becoming a professional soccer player was your dream!\\" \\"That's… right.\\" Shin Jae-wook nodded. In fact, his dream was not something as trivial as becoming a professional soccer player, but he thought there was no need to disrupt the flow of the conversation. Above all, he found it bothersome to explain in more detail. \\"That's right, isn't it! I remember it clearly! But such a good opportunity has come, so why are you not responding? Are you too young and scared? If that's the case, don't worry. Jae-wook, the systems of domestic pro teams have improved a lot. They have youth teams to nurture you, and they will give you opportunities step by step to grow into a great player.\\" \\"No, I'm not scared or anything like that.\\" \\"Then what is it? Don't you like any of the teams? You know that most of the domestic pro teams have contacted you, right? Do you not like any of the teams that contacted you? Not even one?\\" \\"There is a team I like.\\" \\"Stop joking around... Oh? You do?\\" Coach Gu Young-cheol's eyes widened."},{"instruction":"Write a list of 8 manufactured sample dialog lines for Nick Wilde from Zootopia, each demonstrating a different emotion.

He was an average sort of man, leading a rather mundane and lonely life. His days were spent in solitude, his only companions being the hum of electronics and the distant sounds of traffic. Little did Alex know that his life was about to take an extraordinary turn. One sunny morning, as the clock struck 9 am, Alex awoke feeling rather groggy and disoriented. He stumbled out of bed, his messy hair falling in his eyes, and shuffled his way into the bathroom to freshen up. As he peered into the mirror, he noticed a peculiar glimmer in his eyes that he had never seen before. But as the minutes ticked by, something strange began to happen. Alex felt an unfamiliar tingling sensation coursing through his body, like tiny electric shocks. Confusion and disbelief filled his mind, unable to comprehend the transformation that was about to occur. Suddenly, without warning, Alex felt an intense wave of pleasure wash over him. It started at the tips of his fingers and toes, gradually engulfing his entire being. He gasped as his body contorted, his limbs shifting into a more delicate, slender form. Before his eyes, his once masculine features softened, his cheekbones becoming more prominent. Curiosity consumed him, and he marveled at the subtle changes taking place. His ears felt incredibly light and sensitive, twitching involuntarily as if responding to the world around him. And as he focused on his reflection, his eyes widened with astonishment when he noticed the beginnings of a pair of fox-like ears sprouting from the top of his head. Alex couldn't help but let out an excited yelp of delight, which came out as a high-pitched, girlish giggle. It was as if he had slipped into some ethereal dream, where the boundaries of reality were blurred. He ran his newly transformed hands along his determined jawline, only to feel it soften into a more delicate shape. A soft, fluffy tail burst forth from his lower back, swaying gently behind him. \\"Oh my goodness!\\" Alex whispered to himself, his voice now soft and melodic, with a distinct hint of bubbly innocence. He giggled uncontrollably, finding it difficult to suppress his growing excitement. Even his movements had become more nimble and dainty, his paws swishing through the air effortlessly. The sensations overwhelmed him, and Alex found himself adopting a new demeanor. He started skipping playfully around the room, unable to resist the newfound sprightliness coursing through his veins. He tripped on various objects in his uncoordinated manner, but it seemed to only add to his amusement. \\"I'm like, totally a fox girl now! Kyaaa!\\" Alex squealed, his voice punctuated with exaggerated cuteness. He bounced on his toes, his oversized bosom bouncing in harmony with his giddy dance. And though he glanced at himself in the mirror, he remained blissfully ignorant of his own allure. With each passing moment, Alex grew more and more engrossed in his foxy transformation. His tail wagged excitedly, knocking over a porcelain vase that shattered into a thousand pieces. Yet, he didn't bat an eye, unable to comprehend the consequences of his mischief. As the hour wore on, Alex continued to revel in his newfound identity. The innocent and ditzy persona had become his second nature, his every word and movement a testament to this foxgirl persona. He babbled incessantly to himself, the room filled with a constant stream of charming chatter. \\"I am so kawaii-desu-ne!\\" Alex declared, his eyes sparkling like stars. \\"And my paws are just so soft and cuddly, nya!\\" Delighting in his boisterous dialogue, he discarded his clothing, finding them unfitting for his foxy essence. The freedom of his nudity felt liberating, as if shedding the constraints of societal norms. Little did he realize the enticing allure his transformed physique held. With an hour now passed, Alex remained blissfully unaware of the impact his transformation had on his surroundings. His clumsiness had intensified, knocking over furniture and scattering papers across the floor, but he couldn't care less. All that mattered was the euphoria pulsating through his veins. And so, the once ordinary man continued to revel in his extraordinary metamorphosis. Alone in his apartment, he reveled in his ditzy, innocent, and decidedly foxy existence. It may have been a strange turn of events, but for Alex, it was nothing short of a fantastical adventure."},{"instruction":"Story prompt: An anonymous artist released a painting that got hundreds and thousands of people engaged, sparking discussions and trying to dissect the meaning behind it, which gave birth to several interpretations, opinions and meanings to it. The painting starts off with a dark and stormy night as the scene, and in it was a large wolf and small lamb. The wolf’s gaze and glowing yellow eyes staring down at the defenseless lamb, ready to leap, with the lamb’s back being the only thing visible to the viewers. A single sentence was painted on the scene, which read, “Honesty without kindness is brutality.”","output":"Amid the hustle and bustle of the vibrant city, tucked away in a quaint alley of art and whispers, a new canvas suddenly appeared on the cracked wall, as if delivered by the clutches of a nocturnal wind. The painting was unsigned, unclaimed, but its arresting image quickly drew a crowd, stirring ripples of curiosity that widened to a surge of fascination, shared across phone screens and social media feeds, each person hungry to partake in the unraveling mystery. It was the depth of the night captured in oil and brush stroke, the dance of lightning illuminating dark swathes of cloud, that served as the backdrop to a scene visceral and ripe with tension. A large wolf, the embodiment of untamed nature and feral might, stood poised on the brink of action, muscles tensed and fur bristling as if each strand was alive with static charge. Its glowing yellow eyes were lanterns cutting through the tempest, a bifrost of predator and prey locked in an eternal moment. The lamb, small and almost shapeless amidst the brewing chaos, was turned away, its vulnerable form a stark contrast to the hulking shadow it faced. It did not see the peril, or perhaps, in the wisdom of innocence, chose to face the storm instead of the beast. The viewers saw only the curved line of its back, a crescent of surrender or perhaps, defiance. The single sentence was written in a script that danced between the finesse of calligraphy and the wilder scrawl of desperation: \\"Honesty without kindness is brutality.\\" The painting became the modern Sphinx's riddle, a cultural touchstone around which conversations spun and spiraled into a multitude of theories and interpretations. Art critics, philosophers, social media influencers, and the average passersby each added their voice to the chorus, finding in the stark juxtaposition of wolf and lamb, storm and stillness, their own reflections. One camp saw it as a critique of society's glorification of unbridled truth, a condemnation of words used as weapons, devoid of the compassion that should temper human interaction. The wolf was the unforgiving world, honing in on the defenseless, the lamb was each person's inner fragility, and the storm, life's relentless challenges. Others postulated a political reading: the wolf representing an oppressive regime, its glowing eyes the surveillance state, and the lamb, the unsuspecting citizen, unaware of the danger looming. The storm became the turmoil of a society on the brink of upheaval. Some sought a deeper, philosophical meaning. They pondered whether the artist suggested that truth itself, in its purest form, was the wolf—an amoral force that, without the shepherding hand of kindness, could easily terrorize the innocent understanding of reality—the lamb in us all. Romantic souls whispered of unrequited love, of fierce emotions unspoken, of the brutality of a truth that could destroy if not swathed in the gentle folds of empathy and gentle intention. And yet, among the clamor of voices and the fervor to decode, to imprint upon the canvas a definitive answer, the artist remained a shadow, a creator beyond the veil of anonymity. The painting stood as a mirror, where each observer found not the artist's singular intention but a reflection of their own conscience, a question posed not just to the intellect but to the soul: What does it mean to be honest, and how does one wield that power with care? In cafés and classrooms, in hushed galleries and the ever-swirling eddy of the internet, the conversation continued, a debate that would, in its way, outlive even the painting itself. For art’s true value was not in its ability to answer but to inspire the unanswerable, to give birth to endless stories whispered in the heart of each viewer who stood before the stormy night, the predator, and the lamb, pondering the weight of words both spoken and unspoken."},{"instruction":"It wasn't long until the anonymous artist would release another painting. This time, the painting would challenge people's opinions, stances and points of view. The second painting was that of the same event, the same dark and stormy night, the same wolf and the same lamb. However, the point of view has changed. Now it was the wolf whose back was shown for the audience, and the lamb's front was now shown. However, there was a new detail added, a bear trap was set between the wolf and lamb, hidden from the point of view of the wolf and covered in blood. It appears that the lamb has set the trap itself, playing the role of the defenseless and feeble victim in order to lure the wolf into thinking it has found itself easy prey, unaware that a trap had been set ensnare the wolf. This time, the sentence that was painted on the artwork said, \\"Kindness without honesty is manipulation.\\" It didn't take long for the same discussions and dissections to begin once more, as with this new painting, new meanings, opinions and interpretations were born.","output":"The unveiling of the second painting was as sudden and dramatic as the first, like the second act of a play that the audience hadn't known was in two parts. This mysterious artist had turned the first tableau on its head, casting a new light—or perhaps, a new shadow—on the narrative that had so captivated the collective imagination. This time around, the wolf, once the looming threat in the darkness, was now presented to the audience from behind, its stance unknowingly precarious as it edged toward the concealed danger of the bear trap. It was an unsettling reversal; now the predator was the one at risk, and the lamb, with its innocent facade, was cast in a suspicious light. Seen from the front, the lamb's expression was unreadable, both innocent and inscrutable behind those soft eyes that might have held the depth of strategy. The blood on the trap hinted at a past story, a history of violence and survival that neither the wolf nor the audience had been privy to in the first painting. It provoked a haunting question: How many had fallen before the wolf's arrival? What other tales were hidden within the night's stormy cloak? \\"Kindness without honesty is manipulation.\\" The words hung in the psyche of the world just as heavily as those in the previous work. They suggested that the lamb, all along, was not a mere victim but an agent of its own fate, using perceived weakness as its most cunning weapon. The veneer of kindness was now scrutinized; not all gentleness was simple nor pure, and not all predators stalked with tooth and claw. The public response was immediate and explosive. Where once the wolf had been feared and judged, it now garnered sympathy—a potential victim of deceit. Meanwhile, the lamb, once the emblem of purity and vulnerability, was reconsidered. Perhaps it was the true master of the dark tableau, its meekness a guise crafted to ensnare and triumph. For some, the lamb's resourcefulness was celebrated, an allegory of the oppressed rising against those who would underestimate them. For others, it served as a cautionary tale about the danger of facades, of kindness wielded with ulterior motives. The trap laid between them blurred the lines between victim and assailant, between the expected narrative and the hidden truths. Around coffee tables and in online forums, people clashed and conjoined over new interpretations. Ethics classes dissected the intent behind benevolence, while psychology enthusiasts debated over the nature of manipulation. The art world, ever hungry for controversy, speculated endlessly about the identity of the artist and the reasons for their anonymity. Was it a shield to protect from the backlash, or a curtain to enhance the narrative's mystique? As the discussions spiraled, so did interpretations. The painting was a statement on societal dynamics, a reflection on personal relationships, a commentary on political strategies, or perhaps an indictment on the ways in which the media could spin narratives to suit particular agendas. In this new light, the storm seemed all the more tumultuous, as though it were conjured from the tempestuous sea of human morality and ambiguity. And still, the artist remained a ghost in the machine, an unseen hand guiding the conversation without dictating it. Whether as a deliberate choice or happy accident, this second piece bolstered the first, and together they became a diptych of moral complexity, inviting the viewer to question not only the art before them but the very nature of their perceptions and beliefs. In the end, it was clear that the art was never merely about wolf or lamb, predator or prey, honesty or kindness. It was about the viewers themselves—their fears, biases, convictions, and the traps each person set for themselves in their understanding of the world. The paintings, in their silent ambiguity, spoke volumes about the human condition, crafting a narrative that was at once personal and universal, unsettling and enlightening. The story continued to unfold, not on canvas, but in the hearts and minds of those who witnessed it, becoming, with each new observer, a masterpiece of endless transformation."},{"instruction":"Hundreds and thousands of people were still talking about the two paintings and sharing, discussing and arguing their interpretations and meanings. And during the multitude of differening opinions and points of view both paintings had caused that clashed or mixed, a small time writer saw a potential story within these two paintings. The wolf and lamb, the bear trap, the dark and stormy night, and all these meanings. He thought to himself, \\"What if both might be true, wouldn't that be interesting?\\" Some say the wolf was the main aggressor, a predator looking for easy prey, others say that the lamb was more dangerous, deceiving others for either its own survival or some form of sadism. The wolf was now a sympathetic character, while the lamb was the villain. But the writer thought, \\"But what if both were true at the same time?\\" He believed that the wolf was no saint in this scenario and truly was a painful truth, yet the lamb was just as deceitful as any sweet lie whispered to the unsuspecting .\\"Honesty without kindness is brutality, yet kindness without honesty is manipulation.\\", he thought to himself again. How exciting. So much potential to be created. He had to write this story.","output":"The small-time writer, with eyes wide open to the narrative potential of the paintings, let the swirling chaos of opinion and debate wash over him, each wave bringing with it a new fragment, a new nuance. Where others saw discord and divide, he saw the intricate dance of yin and yang, the complex interplay of forces that defines the human experience. The artist's work had become a prism, and within it, he glimpsed the spectrum of truths that lay hidden in plain sight. He sat down to write, his fingers poised over the keyboard as he considered the duality inherent in the paintings. He envisioned a world where the dichotomies of predator and prey, brutality and manipulation, honesty and kindness, intertwined in an eternal waltz. In his story, the wolf and the lamb would be metaphors embodied, characters rich with contradiction and depth, living in a realm as thunderous and unpredictable as the stormy night that enveloped them. The narrative took shape: In a kingdom shrouded by perpetual tempests, a wolf named Veritas hunted not for sport but out of a primal necessity, driven by an insatiable desire for truth. To Veritas, the world was a place of stark realities, where the weak perished and only the strong survived. His honesty was as biting as his fangs, his truths as searing as lightning across the ebony sky. Across the same tumultuous lands, a lamb named Dulcis maneuvered through the world with cunning cloaked in innocence. Dulcis understood the powers at play, how the illusion of benevolence could disarm, how the promise of kindness could ensnare. Dulcis was not so much prey as a strategist in woolen garb, setting traps with sweet smiles and batting eyelashes. Their fates were intertwined when Veritas, on the hunt for sustenance, stumbled upon Dulcis. The wolf saw weakness; the lamb saw opportunity. The trap was sprung not by paw or hoof, but by the very nature of their beings. The small-time writer wove a tale of intrigue and survival, of the intricate facades each character wore. As the story unfolded, he did not paint his characters as entirely virtuous or villainous but as creatures of necessity and instinct, of layered intentions. The storm raged around them, a tempest of their own making. \\"Honesty without kindness is brutality, kindness without honesty is manipulation.\\" The writer used the paintings' sentences as tentpoles for his narrative, each a guiding principle for his characters. Readers would find themselves rooting for both the wolf and the lamb, their allegiances shifting with each chapter, as the story explored the gray areas of morality and the cost of survival in a world where deception and truth were two sides of the same coin. The writer's tale captivated an audience beyond his expectations. It resonated with those who had seen the paintings, who had argued over coffee and keyboards about the nature of the wolf and the innocence of the lamb. It offered a third space—a narrative realm where both creatures could be understood, where their actions could be seen as the complex outcomes of living in a world that demanded both honesty and kindness in equal measure. His story spread, a literary echo of the anonymous artist's visual dialogue, unfolding a new layer of discussion and contemplation. The writer found himself no longer small-time but swept up in the fervor his words had incited. He had taken the duality of the paintings and spun from it a tapestry rich with ambiguity and human truth, his story a testament to the power of art to inspire, challenge, and transform."},{"instruction":"Write a very long story about a man alone in his apartment who starts to turn into a very ditzy and extremely innocent and clumsy Anthropomorphic fox girl with ginormous boobs over the span of an hour.

He spent most of his time alone, content with his own thoughts and the companionship of his books. One fateful evening, as the clock ticked towards midnight, John discovered a mysterious, old book tucked away on a dusty shelf. Intrigued, he picked it up and began flipping through the pages. Little did he know that this book held the secrets to a fantastical transformation that would soon turn his world upside down. As John delved deeper into the pages, he stumbled upon a hidden chapter titled \\"The Fox's Blessing.\\" The words seemed to leap off the page, captivating his attention. The chapter described a magical fox transformation, giving the recipient an innocent and carefree nature, along with a vast, curvaceous body. Intrigued by the possibilities, John decided to give it a try, not realizing the magnitude of the changes he was about to undergo. As he read the incantation out loud, a strange sensation washed over him. It started as a tingling sensation, coursing through every nerve in his body. Slowly, but surely, John's physique began to morph. His limbs shrunk and took on a slender, delicate form. Soft, reddish fur began to sprout all over his previously human skin, as his hands and feet slowly transformed into adorable, paw-like appendages. The once invisible line between reality and fantasy began to blur, leaving John wide-eyed and filled with giddy disbelief. His body, once masculine and ordinary, now boasted a set of ginormous breasts that bounced with each clumsy step he took. His form had become that of an anthropomorphic fox girl, the embodiment of a character straight out of an anime. Amidst the overwhelming sensations flooding his body, John couldn't help but revel in the ecstasy of each change. His innocent mind embraced the transformation, relishing in the newfound ditzy and clumsy nature that he now embodied. With every innocent giggle, he marveled at how natural it felt to be a fox girl and reveled in his newfound mannerisms. And oh, the wonders of his tail! As it sprouted from his behind, John gasped in awe. With a swift and smooth motion, it wagged behind him, adding to the incredible sensation that every movement brought him. He found himself swaying and twirling, compelled by an instinctual grace that quickly dissolved into sheer clumsiness. \\"I-I can't even believe this is happening!\\" John squealed with delight, his voice taking on an insanely comically overexaggerated tone that mirrored the fox girls he admired in anime. He pranced around his apartment, each step punctuated by an exaggerated hop and a soft \\"yip.\\" Dressed head to toe in fox-themed clothes, John carefully slipped on his pants, ensuring there was a perfectly tailored hole for his elegant tail to protrude. He admired himself in the mirror, marveling at his alluring physique, completely oblivious to the effect it had on others. As time went on, John became so consumed by his fox-girl identity that he often found himself talking to himself, constantly chattering away with his own thoughts. He had become his own constant companion, reveling in the innocence and ditzy nature that now defined him. The world outside continued on, unaware of the incredible transformation that had befallen John. Yet, in the confines of his apartment, he danced, twirled, and giggled, enjoying every aspect of his new self without a hint of self-consciousness. In the span of an hour, John had gone from an ordinary man to an adorable and clumsy anthropomorphic fox girl with captivating features and an innocence that radiated from every pore. And as he continued his innocent adventures, he remained blissfully ignorant of how attractive he had become, simply content in his own whimsical world. Thus, the tale of John, the man turned ditzy and clumsy anthropomorphic fox girl, unfolded with each passing moment, forever cherishing the sweet innocence and unadulterated joy that sprang from within."},{"instruction":"Write a very long story about a man alone in his apartment who starts to turn into a very ditzy and extremely innocent and clumsy Anthropomorphic fox girl with ginormous boobs over the span of an hour.

James was a regular guy, content with his simple life and a great love for anime. But little did he know that his life was about to take a rather extraordinary turn. It all began one quiet evening, as James sat alone in his apartment, engrossed in an anime marathon. The room was dimly lit, with the steady glow of the television providing the only source of light. Lost in the captivating plotlines, he had no idea that something peculiar awaited him. Suddenly, as the clock struck midnight, an inexplicable sensation washed over James. It started subtly, with a strange tingling in his fingertips. Perplexed, he paused his anime and looked down at his hands. To his surprise, he noticed that his skin was transforming, becoming soft and furry, resembling the paws of an animal. \\"Whoa, what's happening?\\" James exclaimed to himself, befuddled by this unexpected development. But before he could fully comprehend the situation, his feet underwent a similar transformation. The tingling sensation crept up his legs, causing him to stumble clumsily. With each passing minute, his body continued to change, and James couldn't help but notice a growing sensation of pleasure accompanying the transformation. He felt an inexplicable warmth spreading through him, instilling a sense of joy he had never experienced before. As he watched in awe, his torso shifted and contorted, adopting a voluptuous and feminine shape. His previously flat chest expanded dramatically into a pair of dazzlingly large bosoms, defying all laws of nature. Completely taken aback, James looked at himself in the mirror and gasped, amazed at the sight of his newfound assets. His appearance wasn't the only thing transforming; his personality underwent a profound alteration as well. With each passing moment, James felt his innocence and ditziness amplifying. Thoughts became harder to grasp, sentences a jumble of adorable, overexaggerated fox-girl speech. \\"Omigosh, what is happening to me?\\" James squealed, his voice now an octave higher and laden with unfathomable cuteness. Unaware of his allure and charm, he continued exploring his new body. His tail, sprouting from above a perfectly shaped rear, wagged joyfully, twitching with every emotion. James marveled at his paws, delighting in their softness and pliability. Everything seemed so familiar, as if he had lived this life before, as if he had always been a fox girl trapped within a human's body. He giggled uncontrollably, marveling at the immense pleasure coursing through him. Unable to contain his excitement, James instinctively dressed himself in fox-themed attire, his pants accommodating a special hole for his wagging tail. With each clumsy step, he embraced his newfound identity, squealing with delight at every mishap. \\"I'm like a walking anime character! Kyaaa!\\" James exclaimed, skipping and twirling around the room, ever-expressing his uncontainable joy. His speech became a medley of adorable anime catchphrases and exaggerated expression, his innocent nature shining brighter with every passing moment. Hours turned into days, and James reveled in his transformation. His apartment became a whimsical wonderland, adorned with fox plushies, enchanting posters, and vibrant anime baubles. No longer confined by societal norms, he danced and sang his heart out, surrounded by a chorus of his own delightful laughter. James spoke to himself incessantly, taking on various animated voices, effortlessly jumping from one personality to another. The walls of his apartment absorbed his never-ending monologues, as his fox-girl persona flourished within the confines of his vibrant imagination. And so, time passed, and James continued to embrace his utterly adorable and ditzy nature. He didn't realize the attention he attracted from neighbors as he pranced down the street, his ginormous bosoms bouncing with each step. Unfazed by the looks and whispers, he simply believed he was living his very own anime dream. In his mind, there were no doubts, no worries, only the sheer exhilaration of being a real-life fox girl. And as he continued his journey of discovery, James found solace in the belief that sometimes, a transformation could bring unfathomable joy, even if it meant living life as an astonishingly innocent and insanely clumsy Anthropomorphic fox girl with ginormous boobs."},{"instruction":"The content of Script 1 contains directions for revising Script 2.

Without the actual behavior and implementation details of the \`HoverboardGrindController\` class and the \`GrindableSurface\` class, it's a bit challenging to pinpoint the problem accurately. However, let’s troubleshoot a few common issues that can cause such behavior: 1. **Grinding Logic**: Confirm that your \`StartGrinding\` method properly sets up grinding logic and suspends other input-related movement that could interfere (like turning). There might be a need for a state flag that disables turning input during grinding. 2. **Rigidbody Rotation**: Check if \`rb.freezeRotation\` is used appropriately to prevent the Rigidbody from spinning out of control when grinding begins. 3. **Grinding Physics**: When grinding, make sure other physics forces, especially those acting on the Y-axis (upward/downward) and torque forces, are either subdued or managed alongside the grinding mechanics. 4. **Continuous Input Checking**: It’s possible that the Update loop or another part of your code keeps adding rotational forces. Ensure that the grinding mechanism overrides or stops these forces. Given the snippets you provided, I recommend focusing on the \`StartGrinding\` and \`EndGrinding\` methods within the \`HoverboardGrindController\`. Here’s a pseudo-code outline for what you could check: \`\`\`csharp public class HoverboardGrindController : MonoBehaviour { private bool isGrinding = false; public GrindableSurface FindClosestGrindableSurface() { // Your existing logic to find the nearest grindable surface } public void StartGrinding(GrindableSurface surface, Vector3 position, Vector3 velocity) { isGrinding = true; rb.freezeRotation = true; // Temporarily prevent rotation. // Additional setup as required, such as positioning character and setting velocity. } public void EndGrinding() { isGrinding = false; rb.freezeRotation = false; // Allow rotation again. // Cleanup after grinding, such as resetting any altered physics properties. } } \`\`\` In your \`HoverBoardControl\` class, wrap any code responsible for causing rotations within a check that prevents this code running when grinding: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { // Existing code... // Start grinding logic. if (Input.GetKeyDown(grindKey) && !hoverboardGrindController.isGrinding) { // ... existing logic to start grinding } // End grinding logic. else if (Input.GetKeyUp(grindKey) && hoverboardGrindController.isGrinding) { hoverboardGrindController.EndGrinding(); } // Any rotation logic should be wrapped in a check for isGrinding if (!hoverboardGrindController.isGrinding) { // Existing rotation and other movement code... } // ... rest of Update method } \`\`\` Review your implementation of the grinding system and tweak the conditions accordingly.

For example: // transform.forward = currentGrindSurface.GetGrindDirection(transform.position, rb.velocity); // Here you could add checks to see if the grind has reached the end of the surface // And additional logic such as effects, scoring, and so on } } \`\`\` Make sure the player's rotation is not affected by other input or forces while grinding. You may need to disable certain input or physics interactions when \`isGrinding\` is true. Furthermore, any movement logic in \`HoverBoardControl\` that conflicts with \`GrindAlongSurface\` should be disabled during grinding. Ensure you use the \`isGrinding\` flag to accomplish this. For example: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { // Disable movement input while grinding if (!hoverboardGrindController.isGrinding) { // Handle regular movement and turning input } // Existing code for handling grinding input (ensure this isn't within the block above) if (Input.GetKeyDown(grindKey)) { // ... existing logic to start grinding } else if (Input.GetKeyUp(grindKey)) { // ... existing logic to end grinding } } \`\`\` Double-check that you have assigned the required components in the Unity inspector - the \`Slider\` for the grindBalanceSlider and the \`LayerMask\` for grindable surfaces must be set correctly. Please ensure the \`HoverboardGrindController\` script is attached to the same GameObject with the \`Rigidbody\` and that the \`GrindableSurface\` script is attached to objects that the player should be able to grind on. With these changes, your character should grind correctly along surfaces instead of spinning uncontrollably. If the issue persists, consider adding debug statements or using Unity's debugging tools to step through the code to identify the specific cause of the incorrect behavior."},{"instruction":"Can you please share the fully updated HoverboardGrindController script in its complete form, ensuring that nothing is left out, for a straightforward copy and paste application?","output":"Certainly!

Coincidences and the Unconscious Helped Me Find Meaning. Personal Perspective: Thinking about life patterns can help us evolve our spiritual beliefs and view our actions as a manifestation of spiritual work.","output":"The provided statement seems to blend concepts of personal experience and spirituality with ideas that might be discussed from a statistical point of view. To analyze this statement in statistical terms and concepts, we can break down the statement into parts and examine them through the lens of probability, pattern recognition, and the psychological aspect of interpreting coincidences: 1. **Coincidences**: From a statistical standpoint, a coincidence is an unexpected concurrence of events that appear to be meaningfully related but do not have any demonstrable causal connection. Statistically, coincidences are bound to happen given a large enough number of events due to random chance. However, the human mind tends to search for patterns and may attribute significance to coincidences, a tendency known as apophenia. 2. **The Unconscious**: While not a statistical term, the unconscious can be studied using statistics in psychology and sociology. The unconscious mind influences behavior, and researchers may use statistical methods to uncover patterns in behavior that may suggest the involvement of unconscious processes. 3. **Finding Meaning**: Finding meaning is a cognitive process that is subjective and qualitative, rather than statistical. However, statistics can indirectly play a role when examining large amounts of data to find trends or patterns that are significant in a population, which could then be interpreted as \\"meaningful\\" depending on the context. 4. **Life Patterns**: The concept of life patterns can be associated with the study of repeated behaviors or events. In statistics, patterns may be detected through methods of trend analysis, time series analysis, or sequence analysis. Whether or not these patterns have spiritual significance falls outside the scope of statistics and into personal belief systems. 5. **Spiritual Beliefs and Evolution**: The evolution of spiritual beliefs is a personal and subjective experience that typically lies outside the purview of statistical analysis. However, social scientists may use statistical methods to study the changes in spiritual beliefs across populations over time. 6. **Viewing Actions as Manifestations of Spiritual Work**: This is a philosophical or spiritual concept rather than a statistical one. While one could potentially study the outcomes of actions attributed to spiritual work (for altruism, community service, mental health, etc.), the interpretation of actions as spiritual work is subjective and related to personal beliefs. In summary, from a statistical viewpoint, the statement might be analyzed in terms of the probability of coincidences, the interpretation of unconscious influences on behavior, and pattern recognition in life events. While statistics can deal with probability and patterns, the subjective interpretation of these events as manifestations of spiritual work and the evolution of beliefs is a matter of personal perspective that cannot be fully captured by statistical analysis."},{"instruction":"I would like to tell you about a country called the Grand Union of America, or GUA.

On average 63% of autosomal DNA is also traced back to the British Isles, but they also tend to have high amounts of Germanic admixture, as 14% hails from Germany (German-speaking areas), with 17% from the Low Countries. 5% can be traced back to France, although French settlers typically chose to distance themselves from the English. There are an estimated 330 million Pilgrims. This brings me to my next point. Acadians are a large, primarily Francophone group found in various regions of the GUA. As can be inferred, they make up a smaller group than Pilgrims. There are variants of the Acadian, and their identity can be strongly tied to regionalism. First of all, \\"Acadia\\" refers to a coastal region in the northeast of North America that includes Northern New England and martime Canada. This is where it all began, their Plymouth Rock. Second, Acadians can be referred to by different names if one wishes to really get specific. In the former Louisiana Territory, you will find \\"Cajuns.\\" In Quebec, you will find Quebecois. On the west coast and especially the Pacific Northwest, you will find Cascadians. The Acadian population is estimated at 101 million strong. There are Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese Acadians as well as the French. If you'd like to use an all-encompassing term that can refer to a Pilgrim, an Acadian, and anything in between, you are better off using the term \\"American.\\" As far as basic information goes, its capital is Philadelphia. This is part of the state of Galloway (named after Joseph Galloway, a major figure in the passage of the Reconciliation Acts of 1768). Galloway obviously includes Pennsylvania but also includes some of the other core colonies, some of the oldest such as Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Other foundational states include New England (MA, CT, RI, VT, NH, ME), the Canadian Maritimes, Ontario, Quebec, and Carolina (NC and SC.). Each state is important, but key newer ones include Florida (Florida and Cuba) Austin (Texas, OK, KS, WY, UT, AZ), Dixie (TN, AK, LA, MS, AL, GA), Huron (MI, WI, MN, IA, IL, IN, OH,MS, KY.), Serena (CA, NV, OR, WA), and Montalucio (ID, MT, CO, ND, SD, NE.) Central Britannia, which is pretty much the core of the entire cross-continental country, is predominantly European, and they account for 81% of the population, although Hispanics, Africans, and Filipinos also live in there. However because of past trends many of these groups do have significant European admixture and some with very high admixture can look indistinguishable from Europeans. In this timeline, slavery was abolished in 1814, so it has fewer Africans, as they account for 2.5% of the population of the CCB. Additionally, half repatriated to Liberia (Note: In this scenario, Liberia has thrived, and with American guidance and investment it became comparable to South Africa.) The national currency of is the Grand Union Dollar (). The concerns and interests of the Thirteen Colonies were given considerable weight in British political discourse. The American Revolution would narrowly be averted by the passage of the Reconciliation Acts of 1768, replacing the wildly unpopular Townshend Acts, and thus Britannia began to grow and grow until its Grand Union flag was flown over almost every part of North America. By 1804, New Britannia covered the entirety of what would be referred to as the United States and Canada in real life - here, they are referred to as the Commonwealth of Central Britannia (CCB) and the Commonwealth of Northern Britannia (CNB) respectively. Commonwealths function as autonomous parts of the republic. By 1828, the newly independent Mexico was beginning to collapse under political instability, and New Britannia saw an opportunity to expand its influence further south. The British government, recognizing the potential economic benefits and strategic importance of a united North American continent, secretly drew up plans to annex Mexico in 1830. This controversial move ignited a war with significant resistance from Mexican nationalist forces, but ultimately resulted in the creation of the Commonwealth of Southern Britannia (CSB) in 1848, after years of Mexico's de facto vassalage. New Britannia's rapid expansion raised concerns among other global powers, and the United Kingdom would not understand that the rising superpower was slowly slipping away from their control. As New Britannia continued to consolidate its territories and strengthen its economy, it started to assert its independence from its former colonial master. This lead to the Great War - fought from 1875-1889. When New Britannia declared independence, this lead to a fracture as people in many regions did not want to join the war against a formidable coalition including the UK, Spain, and the Netherlands, and even pitted men against their neighbors. Further complicating the war effort was the secession of the Confederate States of America, the Dominion of Canada, a short-lived British puppet, the California Republic, and the Republic of Texas. During this time Chicago served as the de facto capital. However, the Grand Union always retained its heartland, the colony that first expanded from Plymouth Rock. The Grand Armed Forces (GAF) would be forced to fight on multiple fronts, and Canada served as its weak underbelly, the staging point for well-armed and funded British, Spanish, and Dutch forces to stage operations in North America. The CSA received significant European support, but this trickled to a halt as European powers began to burn through their munitions, leaving the breakaway state underequipped. In addition, Canadians resented the foreign armies and viewed them as invaders. By 1880, the situation became untenable. Many farmers and artisans would refuse to serve soldiers that were not affiliated with the GUA. These were called the Grangers. In addition to this, civilians would actively leak information to the GUA. Unsurprisingly, the armies would respond violently and even dole out collective punishment. Massacres in and around the town of Peterborough would turn Canadian forces against the foreign armies, and they started to join forces with the GAF to fight against the coalition. This shift in alliances, combined with the GAF's strategic military tactics and resilience, eventually led to the coalition forces losing ground and the tide of the war turning in favor of the Grand Union. By 1889, it was estimated that 50% of the British army, 40% of the Dutch, and 45% of the Spanish army had died in the war. Thus, the terms of the Treaty of Montreal, ratified on January 7th, 1890, were very favorable for the Union. Spain ceded Cuba, Porto Rico, and was forced to sell the Philippines for 20 million. The British ceded Jamaica, the Bahamas, British Honduras (Belize), Turks and Caicos, the Leeward Islands, Windward Islands, Bermuda, and Trinidad, and sold Malaysia for 15 million. The Netherlands ceded the Dutch East Indies, that is, Indonesia. Additionally, the Grand Union left a complicated legacy in some of its overseas territories, such as Mexico, Cuba, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Most Southeast Asian natives were not outright enslaved, but they did see drastic change as the GUA sought to modernize infrastructure in its colonies. This lead to a trend known as \\"marrying up\\", wherein the locals would vie for crumbs of power using their daughters as leverage to move up. This permanently changed the genetic profile of the colonies, as countless females would be offered by their parents and guardians, sometimes to the same few men. Male children were seen as a liability. They would cost resources to raise, and would likely grow up to be another manual laborer. The result was not pretty, and many natives chose to abandon their male children or outright commit infanticide, which eventually lead the native populations in Southeast Asia and northern Latin America to decline altogether. As an example, in the Philippines Commonwealth (Philippines), Filipino mestizos account for 38% of the population. Europeans account for 27%, and Pinoys 24%. The remaining 11% are mostly Asian, although not Filipino. While this was never intended, the genetic and cultural similarities have aided in maintaining control. In 1904, the Grand Union annexed Panama, and by 1906 it would control all of Central America as the Commonwealth of Panama. Haiti and the Dominican Republic were some of the only countries to maintain sovereignty in North America. Throughout the 20th century, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia were nominally granted independence, but they are still seen by some as puppets, and they continue to be members of the Grand Union-lead Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TORA), alongside countries including Argentina, Portugal, France, Norway, Italy, and Denmark. It's a binding alliance. It was first inked in 1936, and seeks to counter the influence of the German Empire, which defeated its archnemesis Russia and expanded eastward, creating client states across Eastern Europe and gaining access to valuable resources. The people in this nation enjoy watching sport. The most popular are rugby union, baseball, and American football. Other sports such as hockey and football (soccer), and basketball also have notable followings. The American Rugby League is the most-watched league, and because the country is so large, there are a whopping 48 professional teams competing at the highest level throughout the Americas. This varies with relegation and expansion. Relegation can only be called into question every four years and certain struggling teams are informed in advance that they will need to win a certain amount of games in order to avoid demotion.The ARL also has a draft, and minor leagues. It seems to be a combination of European and North American characteristics. Unlike the NFL, in which one must be three years removed from high school, one must be at least 17 by September of his draft year to play in the ARL. They are usually drafted out of major-junior leagues, although some are picked from the NCAA. Thus, college rugby is not as relevant as college football. Females play volleyball, but is usually played until the college level. Other leagues such as the MLB and NFL also have more teams. Southeast Asia does not participate in North American leagues. For example, there are MLB and ARL teams in Cuba, Mexico, and Guatemala. The rivalry between the Grand Union and the UK runs deep, and this extends into sports. Many Americans see the Grand Union as the successor to the British Empire. In the modern era, New Britannia's power continued to grow, and combined with its enviable geographical position and vast resources, it became a global superpower. With a mainland featuring most of North America, it's the world's largest country by land area, and the Americans are quite proud of this. The total population is estimated at around 490 million in the modern era, with 318m in the CCB, 47 million in the CNB, 105 million in the CSB, 7 million in Panama, and 13 million in other areas. This ranks second after China. Something else worth mentioning is that the World Wars as we know them were averted, with smaller-scale wars such as the Sino-Japanese wars, or the Russo-German War from 1915-1920. Several countries such as Ukraine, Poland, or Korea lack sovereignty for this reason. It's still an age of empires.","output":"It appears you have created a rich and detailed alternative history scenario featuring the Grand Union of America (GUA), a country that has evolved from roots in colonial North America and expanded to have a significant global influence. In this world, you have woven together complex political, historical, cultural, and social elements to create a diverse and multi-faceted nation. Your narrative covers the development of distinct ethnic groups such as the Pilgrims and Acadians, their demographics and genetics, and the political evolution of New Britannia into the Grand Union. The timeline you've established diverges significantly from our own, with different outcomes for major historical events such as the American Revolution being averted and a vastly different world map due to the extensive territorial growth of the GUA. You've also detailed the impact of social and cultural practices on the genetics and populations of various territories under GUA influence, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Your world includes intricate diplomatic, military, and economic histories that have shaped international relations and the current world order within this alternate universe. Your alternate history includes changes in sports culture, with rugby union being the most popular sport, and the existence of a global alliance, the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TORA), created to counter the influence of a powerful German Empire. The Grand Union of America in your description not only has an expansive landmass but also wields substantial economic and political power on the global stage, indicative of the various paths history can take under different circumstances.

Each of the territories and commonwealths you've described has a unique ethnic composition, reflecting both their historical connections and the complex patterns of migration and settlement that have occurred within your imagined history. The demographic breakdowns reveal a blending of cultures and ethnicities with a strong European influence across the board, though each region has its dominant groups, like Pilgrims and Acadians within Central and Northern Britannia, and a significant proportion of Castizo and Criollo populations in the southern regions. Economic disparities between territories are evident through the GDP per capita figures, showcasing variations in economic development across the different regions and commonwealths within the GUA. Wealth appears to be distributed unevenly, with some regions having GDP per capita figures significantly higher than others, hinting at centralization of wealth and economic power within certain areas, such as Panama and Hawaii within the GUA and among the nominally independent commonwealths. It is interesting to note that your scenario maintains a complex classification system for ethnicity, drawing attention to the nuances of mixed heritage and the social structures that have arisen as a result. In this world, these classifications, such as Castizo, Criollo, and Indo, are not only descriptors of genetic ancestry but indicators of social status and societal roles. You also highlight the concept of nominal independence for territories like Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia, suggesting that although they may have their own governments and a degree of autonomy, they remain closely tied to the GUA through agreements such as the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TORA). This detailed demographic and economic data helps paint a picture of a grand, sprawling empire where cultures mix, economic interests are vast and varied, and political power is disseminated across a wide network of territories and populations.

It's the Grand Union of America, and Cuba has been a part of it for 102 years as part of the state of Florida. In 1992, the Beck family moves out of crowded and cold Philadelphia, finding themselves in Cuba. Martin, also known as Marty (32) is our protagonist, with Lorelai, also known as Lori (31) as his wife. They have three girls and one boy, with Lori pregnant 8 months pregnant with another boy to be named Cole. - Faith and Hope, aged 13, twins. Geoffrey, aged 9. The youngest to already be born is Abigail (Abby), aged 4. Marty and Lori Beck are both educated, and at Villanova University (Lori has repeatedly described Villanova as \\"one of the top schools in this bloated mess of a nation.\\" And it is, top 5.). Lori works as a teacher, while Marty, incredibly smart, is a computer programmer. He works for IBM, a top global company at the time, and he helps the townsfolk whenever they need something electronic fixed, or optimized. They touch down in Sueño del Mar, a small town of around 17,000 close to Havana. They arrive to a welcoming party, and they are warmly received. They find that many look up to them for being different, and their fair features are seen as a status symbol (note: I mentioned Cuba's demographics earlier. Marty possesses dirty blond hair with grey eyes while Lori's hair is a strawberry blonde, and she has blue-green eyes.) Quickly, the Becks meet families such as the Herrera and Peralta families. Faith and Hope make friends with the only child of the Herrera family - Aya, aged 12. This is where things start to take a turn. She, more than anyone, is very interested in the Beck family, and when dinner begins, she's introduced to the cuisine of the mainland by way of Lori, Faith, and Hope, who all cook together. While waiting for dinner, Aya gets impatient and ignores her parents' pleas as she walks into the Becks' kitchen, rudely demanding food. She's met with powerful and delicious scents, and Hope offers her a roast pork sandwich. Befitting the Beck family's origins in Philadelphia, Lori cooks up the Philly Cheesesteak, topped off with a cheese sauce. Also featuring are the lesser-known roast pork sandwiches, served with provolone and broccoli rabe. But the main dish is 'Nduja fettucine, calling back to her Acadian heritage (Note: you can add side dishes, healthy complements and such.). For Aya, it's like she's stepping into another world, but her parents, Cristian and Carmen, warn her not to drift too far... Aya becomes fascinated by Marty's demeanor - cool, calm, and incredibly intelligent. He's the one that introduces her to computers, by way of his IBM PS/1. She's fascinated at what he can do with one, and he's glad to know someone who is interested in his passion.","output":"In the vibrant and diverse world of the Grand Union of America, the story unfolds in the tropical setting of Sueño del Mar, a small Cuban town in the state of Florida that boasts rich cultural exchanges and embraces the promise of the American dream. The Beck family's arrival in this tight-knit community represents a breath of fresh American air, with both their novel presence and the mainland culinary traditions they carry. The adolescent twins Faith and Hope are the initial bridge between the Becks and the local populace, specifically bonding with Aya Herrera, whose curiosity about the newcomers' lifestyle hints at her yearning for novelty and perhaps a different life than the one she's accustomed to. Aya's intrusion into the Beck family's kitchen may be considered impolite, but it is driven by the innocent boldness of youth, an irresistible attraction to the new and wondrous scents and flavors that permeate the space. The Becks, hospitable and gracious hosts, share their culinary heritage with their new community, providing an intimate glimpse into their mainland roots. Lori's Philly Cheesesteak with its succulent cheese sauce, the hearty roast pork sandwiches with a touch of provolone and the tang of broccoli rabe, and the 'Nduja fettuccine harking back to her Acadian ancestry, are not just dishes but lovingly crafted morsels of her family’s story. Side dishes might include a crisp green salad dressed with a zesty vinaigrette, roasted vegetables sprinkled with herbs, or a cool, creamy coleslaw—each complementing the richness of the mains and providing a well-rounded meal. Marty Beck, embodying the quintessential cool, calm, and collected tech expert, captivates Aya's curiosity through his skills with the IBM PS/1. His patient introduction to the world of computing not only sows the seeds of technological understanding in Aya's mind but may very well spark a lifelong passion for the field. Her fascination extends beyond the gadgetry before her; Marty is a figure of inspiration, a personification of the knowledge and opportunities that beckon from the wider world of the Grand Union. As the Beck family settles into their new life, they will likely encounter challenges and cultural differences. However, it's apparent that their move to Sueño del Mar is more than a geographical change. It's the start of a rich cultural interweaving that will transform not just their own lives, but those of the locals like Aya, who find in the Becks both a glimpse of the world beyond and a mirror to their own potential. While opportunities for growth and connection abound, Cristian and Carmen Herrera's cautionary stance underscores a broader tension. How does one embrace cultural exchange without losing one's identity? This question, woven through the fabric of the Becks' story, will resonate with each character as they navigate the waters of assimilation, modernization, and heritage within the grand tapestry of the Grand Union of America."},{"instruction":"Scene and dialogue","output":"As the sun dips below the horizons of Sueño del Mar, bathing the small town in a warm, golden hue, the locals gather at the Beck family's new residence—a vibrant affair where the aroma of sizzling steak and roast pork merges with the salty breeze of the nearby ocean.

Her parents and teachers had often struggled to get her to follow the rules, but it’s hard for her to listen unless she personally finds agrees. Though they are wary of the Beck family, Cristian and Carmen start asking Marty and Lori to tutor their daughter. They wonder what subject. Cristian bluntly tells them. Everything. School starts again in two weeks and she hasn’t even touched her summer assignments. They’re thinking of sending her to a boarding school, and the Becks are their last resort. They’ve tried everything but she’s just so hard-headed, but she seems to listen to the Becks. Later, Aya moves through the homework fast. With Marty's intelligence and photographic memory, a 12-year-old girl's homework may as well be a coloring book.

The name is just in English. Cuba is billingual.), the same one Faith and Hope had transferred to, and the one Aya has managed to enroll in. Though her pregnancy would likely sideline her. When the subject of Aya getting into a selective school dcomes up, Aya says that she was valedictorian for a long time, but lost the passion to learn during her senior year. She also aced the entrance exam. Aya is a completely different person with the Beck family, an inspired girl. Aya doesn't lie, however. She agrees to put her best foot forward, but she makes it clear to the Becks that she's working hard not for future gain but for them. After three days have passed she's finished, and she's allowed to go to Shoreline Park (note: a beachfront park nearby) with Faith, Hope, and Geoffrey. The children talk about their dreams.

선택(Selection)(σ): 특정 조건을 만족하는 튜플(행)을 선택합니다. - 투영(Projection)(π): 관계의 특정 속성(열)만을 추출합니다. - 합집합(Union)(∪): 두 관계의 모든 튜플을 결합합니다. - 차집합(Set Difference)(-): 하나의 관계에는 존재하지만 다른 관계에는 존재하지 않는 튜플을 찾습니다. - 카르테시안 곱(Cartesian Product)(×): 두 관계의 모든 가능한 튜플 쌍을 생성합니다. - 조인(Join)(⨝): 두 관계를 특정 조건을 기반으로 결합합니다. 예시: 어떤 데이터베이스에 사람들의 정보가 있는 'Persons' 테이블이 있다고 가정해보겠습니다. 만약 'Age'가 30 이상인 모든 사람의 'Name'을 조회하려면, 관계 대수를 사용해 다음과 같이 질의할 수 있습니다: \`\`\`π Name (σ Age ≥ 30 (Persons))\`\`\` 여기서 \`σ Age ≥ 30 (Persons)\`는 나이가 30 이상인 사람들을 선택하고, \`π Name\`은 그 결과로부터 이름만을 추출합니다. 2. **관계 해석 (Relational Calculus):** 관계 해석은 참 또는 거짓을 반환하는 조건에 기반한 비절차적 쿼리 언어입니다. 즉, '무엇을' 얻을 것인지를 명시하며, 사용자는 원하는 결과를 얻기 위해 필요한 조건을 정의하면 시스템이 어떻게 처리할지 결정합니다. 두 가지 형태가 있습니다: - 튜플 관계 해석(Tuple Relational Calculus): 튜플들을 반환하는데 초점을 맞춤. - 도메인 관계 해석(Domain Relational Calculus): 속성 값(도메인)들을 반환하는데 초점을 맞춤. 예시: 위의 'Persons' 질의를 관계 해석으로 표현하면 다음과 같이 할 수 있습니다: \`\`\`{p.Name | p ∈ Persons ∧ p.Age ≥ 30}\`\`\` 여기서 \`p\`는 'Persons' 테이블에서 튜플을 나타냅니다. 이 연산은 'Persons' 테이블에 있는 모든 튜플을 검사하고, 'Age'가 30 이상인 튜플의 'Name'을 결과로 반환합니다. 관계 대수와 관계 해석 모두 관계형 데이터베이스에서 같은 결과를 얻을 수 있지만, 관계 대수는 연산의 순서와 결합을 명시적으로 표현하는 반면, 관계 해석은 원하는 결과에 필요한 조건을 선언하는 방식으로 작동합니다."},{"instruction":"시스템 프로그래밍에서 실효 주소란 무엇이고 그것을 어떻게 계산하나요?","output":"시스템 프로그래밍과 컴퓨터 구조에서 \\"실효 주소(Effective Address)\\" 또는 \\"양수 대상 주소(Address of Operand)\\"는 메모리 내에서의 데이터 또는 명령어의 실제 위치를 나타냅니다. 실효 주소는 프로그램이 실행될 때, 즉 런타임(run-time)에 계산되어 데이터에 대한 참조나 명령의 피연산자에 대한 접근이 일어나게 합니다. 실효 주소 계산 방법은 사용되는 주소 지정 모드(Addressing Mode)에 따라 달라질 수 있습니다. 주소 지정 모드에는 명령어가 피연산자를 찾는 방식을 정의하며, 다음의 몇 가지 유형이 일반적입니다: 1. **직접 주소 지정 모드(Direct Addressing Mode):** 이 모드에서, 명령어 자체가 메모리 주소를 포함합니다. 즉, 항상 동일한 메모리 위치를 참조합니다. -

Один из способов сделать отказ явным - предложить конкретные варианты или время для встречи. В противном случае, если человек не заинтересован, ему придется четко выразить отказ, не оставляя места для двусмысленности. Вот примеры вопросов: 1. Мог бы ты встретиться со мной в пятницу вечером в 7 часов? 2. Удобно ли тебе встретиться со мной завтра около 3 часов дня? 3. Хочешь пойти со мной на кофе в это воскресенье утром? Если человек не заинтересован во встрече, он может ответить \\"нет\\" или предложить альтернативное время, если желание встретиться остается. Зачастую люди пытаются избежать прямого отказа, чтобы не обидеть другого, поэтому они могут предложить более обтекаемый ответ. Тем не менее, если вы ясно обозначили рамки предложения, то любой отклоняющий ответ можно интерпретировать как отказ. Также можно добавить в вопрос прямую возможность отказа: 1. Мог бы ты встретиться со мной в пятницу в 7, или у тебя другие планы? 2. Будет ли тебе удобно встретиться завтра в 3 дня, если нет, просто скажи мне, это совсем не страшно.

Mathematical randomness is at the root of all of human biology, and social systems exhibit all kinds of probabilistic and distributive patterns. If \\"biology\\" and \\"sociology\\" are deeply influenced by statistics, then it follows that \\"ideology\\" would be as well. There are many ways in which statistics manifests itself through ideology. One such example is the phenomenon of coincidences. From a statistical standpoint, a coincidence is an unexpected concurrence of events that appear to be meaningfully related but do not have any demonstrable causal connection. Statistically, coincidences are bound to happen given a large enough number of events due to random chance. However, the human mind tends to search for patterns and may attribute significance to coincidences, a tendency known as apophenia. Another example is the combinatorial properties of human language, imagination, learning, and sensemaking, which, together, are often loosely interpreted as spirituality. Please elaborate more on this example, then discuss three other examples.","output":"Your view that statistics, meaning, and philosophy are interrelated is quite insightful. Indeed, the mathematical foundations of probability and statistics underlie many aspects of life and thought, from the randomness inherent in genetic variation to the patterns we observe in social behaviors. Let's delve deeper into your provided example regarding language, imagination, learning, and sensemaking, and then explore three additional ways in which statistics and ideology interlace. # Combinatorial Properties of Language, Imagination, Learning, and Sensemaking The seemingly infinite combinations of words and concepts allow humans to construct narratives that can resonate with individual ideologies or collective beliefs. People often seek patterns in events and narratives that align with their worldview. For instance, the concept of \\"synchronicity,\\" coined by psychologist Carl Jung, refers to meaningful coincidences, which some individuals may interpret spiritually or symbolically. Statistical principles might suggest these coincidences are simply byproducts of random distributions and large sample spaces. Yet, our propensity for pattern recognition, fed by the combinatorics of language and experience, guides many towards constructing ideologies that imbue these patterns with profound meaning. The frequency illusion, or Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, where a concept or thing you just learned about suddenly seems to appear everywhere, is a statistical artifact of our selective attention and memory yet can be integrated into a person's ideology as evidence of synchronicity. Now, let's discuss three additional examples of the intersection between statistics and ideology: # Example 1: Political Polling and Public Opinion Statistics are critical in shaping and understanding public opinion and ideology. Polls and surveys use statistical methods to infer the opinions of a larger population from a smaller sample. These statistical findings then influence political campaigns, policy-making, and media narratives, reinforcing or challenging prevailing ideologies. Confirmation bias may lead people to give more weight to statistical information that supports their beliefs and discredit information that does not. # Example 2: Health and Epidemiology In the realm of health, statistical studies often drive public health strategies and individual lifestyle choices, which can be ideologically charged. For example, statistical associations between certain behaviors and health outcomes can lead to lifestyle ideologies promoting diet regimes or exercise routines. Moreover, epidemiological statistics play a significant role in shaping public health policy, which can become ideologically polarized, as seen in debates over vaccine safety or the response to pandemics. # Example 3: Economic Models and Market Ideologies Economic statistics inform models that attempt to describe and predict human economic behavior. These models, in turn, underpin certain free-market or interventionist ideologies. For example, the interpretation of economic indicators such as unemployment rates or GDP growth can support capitalist or socialist ideologies depending on the narrative constructed around the data. Additionally, economic theories about market efficiency or regulation are often grounded in statistical studies of market behavior, yet are advocated for by different ideologically-driven schools of thought. In all these examples, statistics do not exist in a vacuum. The interpretation of statistical findings is influenced by the existing biases, beliefs, and ideologies of individuals and societies. Consequently, while statistics is a tool for understanding the world, the use of statistics is intrinsically tied to the ideas and frameworks through which people view reality."},{"instruction":"Rearrange these topics to be in a more logical flow.

근육도 부족하고. 기술적인 부분이 뛰어난 건가?” “…저기요?” “앗! 미안하다. 하하! 초면에 너무 무례했지? 내가 워낙 솔직한 성격이라.” “그렇군요. 근데 왜 부르셨어요?” 신재욱은 지금 같은 상황이 귀찮았다. 어차피 목적은 해외 유스팀과의 경기에서 좋은 활약을 펼쳐 유럽에 진출하는 것. 때문에, 지금은 빨리 촬영을 끝내고 훈련이나 하러 가고 싶은 마음이었다. ‘이 양반, 본인 때문에 촬영도 늦어지고 있는데 왜 이렇게 말이 많아?’ 슬슬 짜증이 나려고 했다. 그런데 진민호는 눈치가 없는 건지, 아니면 일부러 눈치를 안 보는 건지, 마음이 급한 제작진들을 신경 쓰지 않았다. “재욱아, 너 실력 좀 보자. 아저씨랑 일대일 한번 해볼래?” “진민호 선수? 지금 촬영이 늦어지고 있는 것 같은데, 일대일은 나중에 하는 게 좋을 것 같아요.” “응…?” 진민호의 그제야 주변을 둘러보곤, 뒷머리를 긁적였다. “나 때문에 늦어졌구나? 이제 촬영 들어가야 하죠? 미안해요! 바로 가시죠!” * * * 촬영이 시작되자 분위기가 바뀌었다. ‘다들 프로답네.’ 신재욱은 감탄했다. 감정이 상한 제작진들과 눈치가 없던 진민호가 언제 그랬냐는 듯 촬영에 집중하는 모습이 놀라웠다. ‘한국에선 이런 식으로 촬영하는구나.’ 영국의 국가대표이자, 세계 최고의 선수로 활약할 때 신재욱은 영국 방송에 출연한 경험이 있다. 때문에, 그곳의 촬영 스타일과 한국의 촬영 스타일이 다르다는 것도 알 수 있었다. ‘그럼 슬슬 집중해볼까?’ 신재욱의 눈빛이 변했다. 솔직히 이럴 시간에 훈련을 더 하고 싶었지만, 이왕 프로그램에 참여하게 되었으니 최선을 다할 생각이었다. 맡은 것에선 최고의 결과를 내게끔 노력하는 것이 신재욱의 성격이었다. ‘순조롭네.’ 촬영은 순조롭게 흘러갔다. “그래서 이럴 때는 항상 동료의 움직임을 확인하면서 들어가 줘야 돼. 그리고 이때 명심해야 할 건…….” 축구천재 FC의 감독이 된 진민호는 의외로 열정적으로 선수들을 가르쳤고. “오! 너희 되게 잘한다! 진짜 천재들 맞네!” 선수들 역시 이곳 분위기에 빠르게 적응하며 실력을 드러냈다. 물론 호흡은 잘 맞지 않았다. 당연한 일이었다. 오늘 처음 호흡을 맞춰본 사이였으니까. 그래도. 뛰어난 재능을 지닌 선수들답게 빠르게 손발을 맞춰갔다. 이처럼 순조롭게 시간이 흐르던 때. 진민호 감독이 선수들을 불러 모았다. “다들 모여봐. 지금부터는 나와의 일대일 훈련을 할 거야.” 일대일 훈련을 한다는 말. 그 말을 들은 신재욱의 시선이 제작진들에게로 향했다. 제작진들의 표정엔 변화가 없었다. ‘다들 침착하네. 이미 얘기가 된 내용인가 보구나.’ 문제가 없다는 것을 확인한 지금, 신재욱은 자신의 차례를 기다리며 진민호와 선수들의 일대일 장면을 지켜봤다. 전 국가대표 공격수이자, 축구천재 FC의 감독인 진민호. 그는 확실히 수준이 높았다. 은퇴했기 때문에 현역 때만큼의 실력은 아니었지만, 중학생 선수들을 상대로는 압도적인 모습을 보여주고 있었다. ‘그래도 국가대표로 뛰었을 만하네.’ 신재욱은 감독과 선수들의 대결을 흥미롭게 바라봤다. 감독이 공격하고, 선수들이 수비하는 일대일 대결. 선수들은 줄줄이 패배하며 아쉬움을 드러냈다. “아오! 감독님 드리블 장난 아닌데? 뺏을 수가 없어. 아… 뭔가 아쉽네.” “드리블도 잘하시지만, 몸싸움이 너무 세. 힘에서 밀리니까 뭘 할 수가 없잖아.” “이게 국가대표 출신의 클래스인가? 완전히 다른 수준인데?” “하…… 내가 이렇게 발린다고? 말이 안 되는데…….” 각자의 팀에서 에이스로 인정받는 선수들이기 때문일까? 진민호 감독에게 패배했다는 사실에 자존심이 상한 티가 났다. 패배를 쉽게 받아들이지 못하는 모습. 그런데. 투덜대던 선수들이 조용해졌다. 이윽고 이들의 눈빛이 반짝이기 시작했다. 다음 차례로 나선 선수 때문이었다. “이택현이다!” “오오! 배천중 에이스! 아니지, 이제 대한중학교의 에이스인가?” “대한중의 에이스는 신재욱이고.” “그러네. 그나저나 이건 좀 기대되는데?” “인정. 이택현은 공격수이긴 하지만, 수비도 꽤 잘했던 것으로 기억하는데.” “맞아. 그래서 이택현이 공격수로 나와서 전방압박할 때는 상대 수비수들이 긴장하잖아. 뺏길 수도 있으니까. 정말 이택현 쟤는 재능이 넘사벽이라서 수비수로 전향해도 프로는 충분히 갈 것 같다니까?” “그것도 인정. 이택현 같은 천재라면 수비수로도 잘할 것 같긴 해.” 이택현. 중학생 축구선수들 사이에서 전국적으로 유명할 정도로 천재인 그의 차례였다. 감독이 공격이고 이택현은 수비해야 하는 상황. 공격수지만, 워낙 센스가 좋고 기술과 신체 능력이 모두 뛰어나 수비까지 잘하는 선수였기에. 이택현을 지켜보는 선수들의 얼굴엔 기대감이 드러났다. 삐익! 대결이 시작됐다. 진민호가 공을 가지고 드리블을 시작했다. 움직임에 여유가 느껴졌다. 앞서 선수 몇 명을 손쉽게 이겼기 때문에, 더욱 자신감이 묻어나왔다. 반면에 이택현은 침착했다. 평소엔 말이 많은 편이지만, 지금은 입을 꾹 다문 채 진민호의 움직임을 주시했다. ‘무조건 이긴다. 신재욱이 보고 있는 앞에서 발릴 순 없어.’ 이택현은 신재욱을 인정하면서도 동시에 강한 경쟁심을 가지고 있다. 당연하게도 경쟁심을 가진 상대 앞에서는 절대 지고 싶지 않았다. 이건 자존심 문제였다. 그때였다. 툭! 휘익! 진민호가 공을 가볍게 툭― 친 뒤, 상체를 강하게 흔들었다. 어지간한 선수는 속아 넘어갈 만한 바디페인팅이었다. 그러나 이택현은 속지 않았다. ‘이런 건 이미 신재욱한테 수도 없이 당해봤거든!’ 속지 않았기에, 이택현은 발을 뻗지 않았다. 대신 몸을 진민호의 상체에 붙였다. 이어서 타이밍을 노렸다. ‘분명히 빠져나가려고 할 거야. 그것도 꽤 화려하게.’ 진민호가 몸을 돌리려는 타이밍을. 휘익! 이택현이 움직였다. 진민호가 몸을 돌리려는 것을 인지하자마자 나온 반응이었다. 퍼억! 상체로 진민호를 강하게 밀어냈다. 하지만 진민호는 아주 조금만 밀려났을 뿐이었다. 동시에 아주 약간의 빈틈이 보였다. 그 순간 이택현의 입꼬리가 올라갔다. ‘이 정도면 충분해.’ 노리던 타이밍이었다. 이택현은 곧바로 발을 뻗었다. 깜짝 놀란 진민호가 다급하게 공을 빼내려고 했지만, 순간적으로 중심을 잃었기에 반응이 느릴 수밖에 없었다. 퉁! 이택현의 발에 맞은 공이 굴러갔다. 이택현은 공을 소유하기 위해 움직였다. 이제 공을 라인 밖으로 걷어내거나, 잠깐이라도 소유하고 있으면 자신의 승리였다. 그러나. 진민호는 전 국가대표 출신이었다. 프로선수로 무려 100경기 넘게 뛰기까지 했다. 그는 공을 잃은 상태에서도 침착함을 잃지 않았다. 재빠르게 어깨를 집어넣어 이택현의 진입을 막았고. 퍼억! 멀어지려던 공을 발바닥으로 잡아냈다. 그와 동시에 진민호는 경악한 얼굴로 소리쳤다. “어우! 놀래라! 너 뭐야? 왜 이렇게 잘해?” 뛰어난 임기응변으로 위기를 벗어났지만. 진민호는 여전히 놀란 마음을 진정시키지 못하고 있었다. ‘무슨 중학생의 실력이……!’ 조금은 방심한 상태였기는 했다. 이전까지 쉽게 이겨왔으니까. 그러나 그렇다고 해도, 지금 자신을 상대하는 선수의 수준은 달랐다. “너! 이름이 뭐라고 했지?” “이택현이요.” 그렇게 대답하며, 이택현은 다시 덤벼들었다. 공을 진민호가 다시 소유한 이상, 승부는 원점이었다. 타닷! 이택현이 속도를 높였다. 진민호가 공을 제대로 컨트롤하기 전에 빠르게 달라붙어서 방해할 생각이었다. 하지만 진민호는 이미 예상했다는 듯 방향을 틀었다. 그 순간. “……!” 진민호의 눈이 커졌다. 지금 같은 상황에서는 어지간한 프로선수들도 나가떨어졌었다. 그런데 고작 중학생이 밸런스를 잡고 자신의 움직임을 쫓아오고 있었다. ‘이걸 따라온다고? 얘, 진짜 뭐야?’ 은퇴했다고는 하나 그래도 국가대표 출신이고, 꾸준히 조기축구에 나가며 체력을 유지해온 자신의 움직임을 중학생이 쫓아오다니. 당황할 수밖에 없었다. 그때였다. 타앗! 진민호에겐 읽혔다. 태클을 하려는 이택현의 움직임이. 그래서 그 타이밍을 노리기로 했다. ‘어린애 한 명한테 생각지도 못하게 너무 많은 체력을 써버렸잖아. 쪽팔리게…… 지금이라도 끝내야겠어.’ 이택현의 발이 깊게 들어왔다. 공을 빼내려는 태클이 제법 날카로웠다. 하지만 아마추어 수준의 태클이었다. 진민호는 발바닥으로 공을 빼며 몸을 돌렸다. 휘익! 이택현의 태클을 피해낸 지금, 진민호는 골키퍼가 지키는 골대 안을 향해 강한 슈팅을 때려냈다. 철렁! 골망이 흔들렸다. 골키퍼가 몸을 날렸지만, 날카롭게 구석으로 파고든 진민호의 슈팅을 막아내진 못했다. “휴……! 힘들었다. 이택현이라고 했지?” 진민호는 이마에 흐르는 땀을 닦아내며 이택현을 바라봤다. “예.” 이택현은 분한 표정으로 고개를 끄덕였다. 반면, 진민호는 진심으로 놀랐기에 이택현을 향해 엄지를 들어 올렸다. “너 되게 잘하더라. 나 너무 놀랐잖아.” “…….” “너 몇 학년이니? 3학년이지? 3학년인데 웬만한 고등학생 선수들보다 더 잘하는 것 같더라.” “1학년인데요?” “뭐?” 진민호의 눈이 찢어질 듯 커졌다. 체격이 좋고 실력도 너무 좋아서 당연히 3학년인 줄 알았다. 그런데 1학년이라니! ‘중학교 1학년이 나를 고전하게 만들었다고…?’ 듣고도 믿어지지 않았다. “에이~! 어른 놀리면 못쓴다! 장난치지 말고 솔직히 말해. 택현아 너 몇 학년이야?” “1학년이라니까요?” “얘 말, 진짜예요?” 진민호가 고개를 돌려 제작진들을 바라봤다. 그러자 프로그램 작가와 제작진들 모두 고개를 끄덕였다. 이어서 다른 중학생 선수들도 입을 열기 시작했다. “이택현 1학년 맞아요. 중학생들 사이에서 천재로 유명한 친구예요.” “맞아요! 걔 1학년이면서 배천중학교의 에이스였어요. 엄청 유명해요.” “대회에서도 되게 잘했어요.” 이택현이 중학교 1학년생이라는 것을 알게 된 지금, 진민호는 큰 충격을 받았다. 더불어 이어서 들려온 말에는 더욱 큰 충격을 받을 수밖에 없었다. “감독님! 이택현 걔, 공격수예요!” “……뭐?” 진민호는 허탈하게 웃었다. 초롱초롱한 눈으로 떠들어대고 있는 학생들이 거짓말을 하는 것 같지는 않았다. ‘그럼 중학교 1학년에 공격수로 뛰는 애가 나를 상대로 그런 수비 실력을 보여줬던 거라고? 이게 말이 돼……?’ 정말 말이 안 되는 일투성이구나. 그렇게 중얼거린 진민호는 다음 차례로 나온 소년을 바라봤다. 촬영 시작 전에 인사를 나눴던, 시크한 성격을 지녔던 선수였다. “…신재욱.”","output":"025 --- A sudden call.

The Shin Jaewook he saw did not look like someone who would be good at soccer. He had expected a strong face and a solid body, but the actual Shin Jaewook had a pale face and a small frame. \\"Hmm... Physically, you don't seem to have anything special? Lacking in muscles too. Is it your technical skills that are outstanding?\\" \\"...Excuse me?\\" \\"Ah! Sorry. Haha! I was too rude for a first meeting, wasn't I? I'm just too honest by nature.\\" \\"I see. But why did you call me?\\" Shin Jaewook found the current situation bothersome. His goal was to perform well in the game against the overseas youth team and make it to Europe. Therefore, he wanted to finish the shoot quickly and go to practice. 'This guy, he's making the shoot late, why is he talking so much?' He was starting to get annoyed. But Jin Minho, either oblivious or pretending not to notice, paid no attention to the anxious production crew. \\"Jaewook, let's see your skills. Want to have a one-on-one with me?\\" \\"Jin Minho, the player? It seems like the shoot is getting delayed, maybe we should do the one-on-one later.\\" \\"Eh...?\\" Only then did Jin Minho look around and scratch the back of his head. \\"It's my fault it's delayed, isn't it? We should start shooting now, right? Sorry! Let's go!\\" --- As the shooting began, the atmosphere changed. 'Everyone's so professional.' Shin Jaewook was impressed. The production crew, who had been upset, and Jin Minho, who had been clueless, were now focusing on the shoot as if nothing had happened. 'So this is how they shoot in Korea.' Shin Jaewook, who had been a national representative of England and played as one of the world's best players, had experience appearing on British broadcasts. Therefore, he could tell that the shooting style in Korea was different from that in the UK. 'Well, shall I focus now?' Shin Jaewook's eyes changed. Honestly, he would have preferred to be training right now, but since he was participating in the program, he intended to do his best. It was in his nature to strive for the best results in whatever he took on. 'It's going smoothly.' The shoot proceeded smoothly. \\"So, at times like this, you always have to check your teammate's movement as you go in. And what you need to remember is...\\" Jin Minho, who had become the coach of Soccer Prodigy FC, was surprisingly passionate about teaching the players. \\"Oh! You guys are really good! You're really prodigies!\\" The players also quickly adapted to the atmosphere and showcased their skills. Of course, their teamwork wasn't perfect. It was natural. They were syncing up for the first time today. Still. As players with outstanding talent, they quickly coordinated with each other. During such a smooth flow of time, Coach Jin Minho gathered the players. \\"Everyone, gather around. From now on, we'll do one-on-one training with me.\\" The announcement of one-on-one training. Upon hearing this, Shin Jaewook's gaze turned to the production crew. There was no change in the expressions of the production crew. 'Everyone's calm. It must have been discussed already.' Now that there was no problem, Shin Jaewook waited for his turn while watching the one-on-one scenes between Jin Minho and the players. Jin Minho, a former national team striker and coach of Soccer Prodigy FC. He was definitely of a high level. Although he wasn't as skilled as during his active days since he had retired, he was still showing an overwhelming performance against the middle school players. 'He's worthy of having been a national representative.' Shin Jaewook watched the confrontation between the coach and the players with interest. The coach was attacking, and the players were defending in a one-on-one battle. The players were defeated one after another, showing their disappointment. \\"Ah! Coach's dribbling is no joke? Can't steal it. Ah... it's frustrating.\\" \\"The coach is good at dribbling, but he's too strong in physical fights. I can't do anything because I'm overpowered.\\" \\"Is this the class of a former national representative? It's a completely different level?\\" \\"Ha... I'm getting thrashed like this? It doesn't make sense...\\" Perhaps because they were recognized as aces in their respective teams? The fact that they had lost to Coach Jin Minho hurt their pride. They couldn't easily accept defeat. But. The grumbling players quieted down. Soon, their eyes began to sparkle. It was because of the next player who stepped up. \\"It's Lee Taekhyun!\\" \\"Oh! The ace of Baechun Middle School! No, now he's the ace of Daehan Middle School?\\" \\"The ace of Daehan Middle School is Shin Jaewook.\\" \\"That's right. But this is kind of exciting, isn't it?\\" \\"Agreed. Lee Taekhyun is a striker, but I remember he was pretty good at defense too.\\" \\"Right. That's why when Lee Taekhyun goes forward to press as a striker, the opposing defenders get nervous. They might lose the ball. Really, Lee Taekhyun is so talented that he could go pro even if he switched to a defender?\\" \\"That's also true. With a genius like Lee Taekhyun, it seems he would do well even as a defender.\\" Lee Taekhyun. A genius among middle school soccer players, famous nationwide, it was his turn. The coach was attacking, and Lee Taekhyun had to defend. Although he was a striker, he was a player with great sense, technique, and physical ability, so he was good at defense too. The faces of the players watching Lee Taekhyun showed anticipation. Whistle! The match began. Jin Minho started dribbling with the ball. His movements were relaxed. Having easily won against a few players before, his confidence was even more apparent. On the other hand, Lee Taekhyun was calm. Usually talkative, he was now silently watching Jin Minho's movements with his mouth firmly shut. 'I must win. I can't be humiliated in front of Shin Jaewook.' Lee Taekhyun acknowledged Shin Jaewook but also had a strong competitive spirit. Naturally, he didn't want to lose in front of a rival. It was a matter of pride. That's when it happened. Tap! Whoosh! Jin Minho lightly tapped the ball and then shook his upper body strongly. It was a body feint that would have fooled most players. But Lee Taekhyun was not fooled. 'I've already been tricked by Shin Jaewook countless times!' Since he wasn't fooled, Lee Taekhyun didn't stretch out his foot. Instead, he pressed his body against Jin Minho's upper body. Then he waited for the timing. 'He's definitely going to try to break away. And he'll do it quite fancily.' The timing when Jin Minho tried to turn around. Whoosh! Lee Taekhyun moved. It was a quick response as soon as he realized Jin Minho was turning. Thump! He pushed Jin Minho's body strongly with his upper body. However, Jin Minho was only slightly pushed back. At the same time, a slight gap appeared. At that moment, the corners of Lee Taekhyun's mouth rose. 'This is enough.' It was the timing he had been waiting for. Lee Taekhyun immediately stretched out his foot. Jin Minho, startled, hurriedly tried to take the ball away, but because he had lost his balance for a moment, his reaction was inevitably slow. Thud! The ball hit by Lee Taekhyun's foot rolled away. Lee Taekhyun moved to take possession of the ball. Now, if he could kick the ball out of the line or hold it for even a moment, it would be his victory. However. Jin Minho was a former national team player. He had played in over 100 professional games. Even though he had lost the ball, he remained calm. He quickly inserted his shoulder to block Lee Taekhyun's entry. Thump! He caught the ball with the sole of his foot that was drifting away. At the same time, Jin Minho shouted in astonishment. \\"Wow! That was a surprise! What are you? Why are you so good?\\" With excellent improvisation, he escaped the crisis. But Jin Minho still couldn't calm his surprised heart. 'What kind of middle schooler has such skills...?' He was a bit complacent. He had been winning easily until now. But the level of the player he was facing now was different. \\"You! What did you say your name was?\\" \\"Lee Taekhyun.\\" As he answered, Lee Taekhyun attacked again. The game was back to square one since Jin Minho had regained possession of the ball. Tap-tap! Lee Taekhyun sped up. He intended to quickly close in and interfere before Jin Minho could properly control the ball. But Jin Minho, as if he had anticipated it, changed direction. At that moment. \\"…!\\" Jin Minho's eyes widened. In a situation like this, even average professional players would have been knocked out. But a mere middle schooler was keeping his balance and following his movements. 'He's following me? What is this kid?' Although he had retired, he was still a former national team player and had been maintaining his fitness by regularly playing early morning soccer. And a middle schooler was keeping up with his movements. He couldn't help but be flustered. That's when it happened. Dash! Jin Minho saw it. The movement of Lee Taekhyun trying to tackle. So he decided to aim for that timing. 'I've used too much energy on a kid without even realizing it. It's embarrassing... I have to finish it now.' Lee Taekhyun's foot came in deep. The tackle to take the ball away was quite sharp. But it was an amateur-level tackle. Jin Minho pulled the ball away with the sole of his foot and turned around. Whoosh! Having dodged Lee Taekhyun's tackle, Jin Minho now aimed a strong shot at the goal guarded by the goalkeeper. Clang! The goal net shook. The goalkeeper dived, but he couldn't stop Jin Minho's sharp shot that burrowed into the corner. \\"Phew...! That was tough. You said your name was Lee Taekhyun?\\" Jin Minho wiped the sweat from his forehead and looked at Lee Taekhyun. \\"Yes.\\" Lee Taekhyun nodded with a frustrated expression. On the other hand, Jin Minho was genuinely surprised and gave Lee Taekhyun a thumbs up. \\"You're really good. I was so surprised.\\" \\"…\\" \\"What grade are you in? You're in the third grade, right? You seem better than most high school players.\\" \\"I'm in the first grade.\\" \\"What?\\" Jin Minho's eyes widened as if they were about to split. He had a good physique and was so skilled that he naturally thought he was in the third grade. But a first grader! 'A middle school first grader made me struggle...?' It was unbelievable. \\"Hey! Don't mess with adults! Stop joking and tell me honestly. Taekhyun, what grade are you in?\\" \\"I told you, I'm in the first grade.\\" \\"Is what he's saying true?\\" Jin Minho turned his head to look at the production crew. Then the program writer and the production crew all nodded their heads. Then the other middle school players also started to speak. \\"Lee Taekhyun is really in the first grade. He's famous among middle schoolers as a genius.\\" \\"That's right! He was the ace of Baechun Middle School even in the first grade. He's really famous.\\" \\"He did really well in the tournament too.\\" Now that Jin Minho knew Lee Taekhyun was a middle school first grader, he was shocked. Moreover, he was even more shocked by the words that followed. \\"Coach! Lee Taekhyun, he's a striker!\\" \\"…What?\\" Jin Minho laughed helplessly. The students with sparkling eyes chattering away didn't seem to be lying. 'So a middle school first grader who plays as a striker showed me that level of defensive skill? Does that make sense...?' It was truly unbelievable. Muttering to himself, Jin Minho looked at the boy who came out next. It was the player with a chic personality who had greeted him before the shoot started. \\"...Shin Jaewook.\\""},{"instruction":"029 * * * 툭! 신재욱이 공을 받았다. 늘 그랬듯 가만히 서서 공을 받지 않았다. 공이 오기 전, 고개를 빠르게 돌려서 주변을 확인했고 공이 왔을 땐 움직이면서 받았다. 툭! 투욱! 두 번의 터치로 상대 선수 한 명을 제쳐냈다. ‘공이 발에 잘 붙네.’ 그런 날이 있다. 공을 컨트롤할 때의 느낌이 유난히 좋고, 실제로 실력 발휘도 잘될 때. 신재욱은 그런 날이면 공이 발에 잘 붙는다고 말하곤 했다. 오늘이 그런 날이었다. ― 신재욱 선수의 컨디션이 좋아 보이는데요? 배천중학교의 선수들을 너무나도 쉽게 상대하고 있어요. 압박에도 전혀 힘들어하지 않고 공을 지켜내고 있습니다. ― 이러면 동료들은 편하게 공격을 할 수가 있죠. 신재욱이 계속해서 한 명에서 두 명의 선수를 끌어내 주니까요. 신재욱은 공을 컨트롤하며 동료들의 움직임을 주시했다. 시야를 확인하는 도중에도 계속해서 압박이 들어왔다. ‘압박이 세네.’ 전진하려 할 때면 최소 2명이 덤벼들고 있었다. 그럼에도 신재욱은 공을 지켜냈다. 자세를 낮추고 상대가 양쪽에 달라붙지 못하게끔, 상대 선수 2명을 한쪽으로 몰았다. 그리고 지금. 터엉! 신재욱의 발이 공을 차 냈다. 2명이 빠지며 생긴 틈을 향해 넣은 패스. 단숨에 상대의 수비를 뚫어내는, 흔히 킬패스라고도 불리는 패스였다. 공이 잔디 위에 미끄러지듯 쏘아졌고. 그 공을 이택현이 받아냈다. 오른발 안쪽으로 공을 안정적으로 잡아두는 퍼스트 터치. 이어서 왼발로 반대편 골포스트 쪽으로 감아 차는 슈팅을 때려냈다. ‘터치 좋고, 슈팅도 깔끔해.’ 그 장면을 지켜본 신재욱은 확신했다. 저건 골이라고. ― 고오오오오오오올! 이택현의 골입니다! 오늘 벌써 두 번째 골을 기록하는 이택현 선수! 빠른 스피드와 정확한 슈팅 능력이 빛나는 골이었네요~! ― 그전에 신재욱 선수가 보여줬던 플레이도 칭찬하지 않을 수가 없네요. 첫 번째 골이 나왔던 것처럼 이택현 선수에게 완벽한 기회를 만들어줬습니다. 이 선수, 실력이 정말 엄청나네요. 이택현의 두 번째 골이 터지며, 스코어는 동점이 됐다. 배천중학교 선수들의 얼굴은 일그러졌다. 자존심이 상한 표정이었다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 첫 번째 골을 허용했을 때와 같은 방식으로 당해버렸으니까. 게다가 이제 막 팀을 꾸린 축구천재 FC와는 달리, 오랜 전통이 있는 배천중학교였으니까. ‘젠장! 방송에 나가는데 쪽팔리게 똑같이 뚫려버렸네…….’ ‘자꾸 돌아 들어가는 이택현을 놓치네…… 하! 이게 다 신재욱 때문이야. 쟤, 왜 저렇게 어그로를 잘 끌어? 또 공은 왜 저렇게 안 뺏겨?’ ‘하…… 신재욱하고 이택현만 아니었어도 쉽게 이기는 건데…….’ ‘이제 막 팀을 만든 녀석들한테 고전한다고? 말도 안 되잖아 이건! 그리고 신재욱은 저번 대회 때 잘하는 거 알았지만, 택현이 저 녀석도 실력이 더 좋아진 것 같은데?’ 당연하게도 심리적으로 더 압박을 받는 팀도 배천중학교였다. 반면, 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 여유를 찾았다. ‘꽤 할만하잖아? 이거 잘하면 이길 수도 있겠는데?’ ‘신재욱이랑 이택현이 너무 잘해주네. 쟤들이랑 같은 팀으로 뛰면 상대가 배천중학교여도 지지는 않을 것 같아.’ ‘쟤네 당황한 것 같은데? 이러면 우리가 좋지.’ ‘천천히 해도 되겠다. 어차피 급한 건 쟤네들이야.’ 그리고. 두 번째 도움을 기록한 신재욱은 허공에 떠오른 메시지들을 보며 씨익 웃었다. 이번엔 능력치가 오르진 않았지만, 당장 오르지 않았을 뿐. 많은 메시지의 양을 보면 곧 오를 것처럼 보였다. ‘다시 생각해봐도 이 프로그램에 참여하길 잘했어.’ * * * 배천중학교의 공격은 여전히 날카로웠다. 축구천재 FC의 수비진을 휘청이게 할 정도로. 그러나 전과는 다른 점이 있었다. ― 좋은 수비입니다! 축구천재 FC의 강찬우 선수와 최진태 선수가 드디어 호흡이 맞는 모습을 보여주고 있습니다! 이 두 선수 모두 중학교 수준에서는 최고의 수비수들이기 때문에, 지금처럼 호흡만 맞게 된다면 배천중학교를 상대로도 철벽과도 같은 모습을 기대할 수 있을 것 같습니다! 긴장이 풀린 축구천재 FC가 배천중학교의 공격을 효과적으로 막아내기 시작했다는 것과. ― 강찬우! 대각선으로 공을 길게 뿌려줍니다! 대단한 킥력이네요! 더불어 역습까지 시도할 수 있게 됐다는 것이다. ― 강찬우가 뿌려준 공을 장현이 받습니다! 장현은 굉장히 빠른 스피드를 가진 선수죠! 지금 같은 타이밍엔 이 선수가 크랙으로서의 역할을 해줄 필요가 있습니다! 축구천재 FC의 장현은 중학교 2학년이지만, 3학년들을 상대로도 높은 드리블 성공률을 자랑하는 윙어다. 빠른 스피드와 화려한 발재간은 그가 천재라고 불리는 이유였다. ― 장현이 돌파해냅니다! 이 선수가 개인 능력으로 배천중학교의 측면을 허물어버리네요! 장현, 크로스 타이밍이죠! 크로스를 올리기 좋은 타이밍이 나왔다. 그러나 장현은 크로스를 올리지 않았다. ― 장현 선수가 조금 더 깊숙한 곳으로 파고듭니다! 장현 선수, 침착합니다! 한 번 더 치고 들어가며 배천중학교 수비수들의 허를 찌르는 플레이를 펼쳤다. 장현은 그러고 난 뒤에야 다리를 휘둘렀다. 퍼엉! 대각선 뒤쪽으로 보내는 컷백 패스였다. 장현은 패스 정확도가 높은 선수가 아니었지만, 지금처럼 아주 깊숙한 곳까지 침투해서 보내는 패스는 날카로운 선수였다. ― 컷백! 좋은 패스입니다! 공이 잔디 위로 빠르게 쏘아졌다. 상대 수비수가 반응하기 힘들게끔 강하게 차낸 패스였고, 근처에 있던 신재욱이 공을 향해 달려들었다. ‘집중하자.’ 굴러오는 공의 움직임에 집중하며, 다리를 휘둘렀다. 강하게 차려고 해선 안 된다. 그러면 공이 뜨게 될 가능성이 크다. 지금은 정확하게 맞추는 것에 집중해야 했다. ‘상단 구석으로!’ 오른발 슈팅이었다. 굴러오는 공에 맞추는 것에 집중한 슈팅. 어렵지 않은 마무리였다. 게다가 이곳은 페널티박스 안쪽. 세계 최고의 스트라이커였던 신재욱에겐 집 안방과도 같이 편안한 곳이었다. 퍼엉! 정교하게 때리기 위해서 노력했지만, 슈팅은 늘 그랬듯 생각만큼 날카롭게 쏘아지진 않았다. 일류 골키퍼였다면 충분히 막아낼 수 있는 슈팅. 하지만 중학생 골키퍼가 막는 것은 무리였다. ― 골입니다! 신재욱의 골입니다! 오늘 2개의 도움만 기록했던 신재욱이 드디어 골을 기록하네요! 침착한 마무리가 돋보였습니다! ― 장현 선수의 컷백 패스도 칭찬을 안 할 수가 없네요! 굉장히 날카로웠습니다. “장현 형, 패스 좋았어요.” 신재욱은 도움을 준 장현을 칭찬한 뒤, 허공을 바라봤다. 반가운 메시지들이 생성되고 있었다. [슈팅이 좋아집니다!] [슈팅이 좋아집니다!] ……. ……. [슈팅이 1 올랐습니다!] 정말 대회보다 성장이 더 빠른 것 같잖아? 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 자리로 돌아갔다. 이렇게 성장이 빠른 곳에선 공격포인트를 하나라도 더 만들어내서 이득을 봐야 한다는 생각이었다. ― 축구천재 FC가 첫 승리를 가져오게 될까요? 지금까진 강팀인 배천중학교를 상대로 3 대 2로 우위를 점할 정도로 좋은 경기력을 보여주고 있습니다! 배천중학교는 더욱 조급해졌다. 팀플레이 위주로 풀어나가던 선수들이 이제는 개인 능력과 롱패스에 의존하고 있었다. 최대한 빠르게 골을 넣겠다는 마음을 갖다 보니 생긴 변화였다. 그리고 이런 변화는 배천중학교에겐 최악의 시나리오였다. 축구천재 FC의 선수들이 배천중학교 선수들보다 개인 능력이 더 뛰어났으니까. ― 들어갔습니다! 이택현입니다! 이택현의 해트트릭입니다! 장현 선수의 크로스를 강력한 헤딩 슈팅으로 연결했습니다! 오늘 장현 선수의 컨디션도 상당히 좋아 보이네요! ― 방금은 배천중학교의 공격이 너무 안일했죠! 급했어요. 축구천재 FC 역습을 예의주시하고 있었어야 합니다! 이로써 스코어는 4 대 2가 됩니다! ― 배천중학교가 후반전에 들어서서 많이 흔들리네요! 반대로 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 점점 더 손발이 잘 맞는 모습을 보여주고 있습니다! 시간이 흐를수록 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 감을 잡았고, 배천중학교는 점점 더 흔들렸다. 그 결과. ― 경기 종료됩니다! 축구천재 FC가 배천중학교를 상대로 첫 승을 가져갑니다! ― 놀랍습니다! 축구천재 FC의 선수들이 정말 놀라운 재능을 보여줬습니다! 익숙하지 않은 선수들끼리 손발이 잘 맞는 팀을 상대로 이기는 건 정말 어려운 건데 말이죠! 축구천재 FC가 배천중학교를 무너뜨렸다. * * * 첫 경기에서 승리하고, 며칠 뒤. 축구천재 FC 3화가 방영됐다. 전국대회에서 늘 좋은 성적을 거두는 강팀 배천중학교를 상대하기 위해, 진민호 감독의 진두지휘 아래서 열심히 손발을 맞춰보는 축구천재 FC 선수들의 모습이 방영됐다. └신재욱은 특별히 빠르거나, 화려하진 않은데, 뭔가 개잘하지 않음? └저게 진짜 잘하는 거야. 움직임에 군더더기가 없잖아. 어린데 거의 축구 도사야. └신재욱이 진짜 잘하는 것 같긴 한데, 피지컬이 아쉬운 듯. └그래도 무게중심은 낮아서 잘 버티잖아. 그리고 이제 겨우 중1이야. 신재욱 쟤, 지보다 형들이랑 경쟁하는 거라고. └근데 2화까지는 신재욱이랑 이택현만 보였는데, 3화 보니까 다른 애들도 다 잘하네. └그러니까 천재축구 FC에 뽑혔겠지. └천재축구 FC 아님ㅋ 축구천재 FC임ㅋ └별것도 아닌 걸 따지고 있네. 너 친구 없지? 이어서 4화에선 축구천재 FC가 배천중학교를 상대로 고전하는 전반전의 상황이 방영됐다. 조직력에서 밀리며 골을 내주고, 당황하는 축구천재 FC 선수들의 표정이 클로즈업되며 방송은 끝이 났다. └엥? 너무 털리는데? └패스 미스 실화냐? 조직력 망했네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └축구천재들이라더니, 걍 오합지졸인데? 중학교 팀 하나 못 이겨서 나중에 프로들이랑은 어떻게 붙겠다는 거야? 기가 차네ㅋ └프로들이랑 붙는대? 에이, 설마……. └실화야. 나중에 국내 프로팀이랑 붙고, 해외 유명 클럽 유스팀이랑도 붙는다더라. └ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ프로가 ㅈ밥으로 보이나ㅋㅋㅋ 이딴 경기력으로 무슨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ └걍 고딩팀 하나 데려와도 못 이길 것 같은데? 그리고 며칠 뒤. 경기가 끝날 때까지의 일들을 담은 5화가 방영됐다.","output":"029 --- Tap! Shin Jaewook received the ball. As always, he didn't just stand still to receive it. Before the ball arrived, he quickly turned his head to check his surroundings, and when the ball came, he moved to receive it. Tap! Thwack! With two touches, he bypassed an opposing player. 'The ball sticks well to my feet.' There are days like this. When the feeling of controlling the ball is exceptionally good, and the actual performance is also well executed. Shin Jaewook often said that on such days, the ball sticks well to his feet. Today was one of those days. — Shin Jaewook seems to be in good condition, doesn't he? He's handling the players from Baechun Middle School too easily. He's not struggling at all against the pressure and is keeping the ball. — This allows his teammates to attack comfortably. Shin Jaewook keeps drawing one or two players away from them. Shin Jaewook controlled the ball while keeping an eye on his teammates' movements. Even while checking his vision, the pressure continued to come in. 'The pressure is strong.' Whenever he tried to advance, at least two players would pounce on him. Despite this, Shin Jaewook kept the ball. He lowered his stance and pushed the two opposing players to one side, preventing them from sticking to him on both sides. And now. Thump! Shin Jaewook's foot kicked the ball. A pass aimed at the gap created by the two players who had been drawn away. It was a pass that pierced through the opponent's defense in one go, often referred to as a killer pass. The ball slid across the grass. And Lee Taekhyun received it. A first touch with the inside of his right foot to stabilize the ball. Then he followed up with a left-footed shot that curled towards the opposite goalpost. 'Good touch, and the shot was clean.' Watching the scene, Shin Jaewook was certain. That's a goal. — Goooooal! It's Lee Taekhyun's goal! It's already his second goal today! A goal that shines with his fast speed and accurate shooting ability~! — We can't help but praise the play shown by Shin Jaewook before that. Just like the first goal, he created a perfect opportunity for Lee Taekhyun. This player's skills are really amazing. Lee Taekhyun's second goal tied the score. The faces of the Baechun Middle School players contorted. They looked wounded in pride. It was inevitable. They had been beaten in the same way as when they conceded the first goal. Moreover, unlike Soccer Prodigy FC, which had just formed a team, Baechun Middle School had a long tradition. 'Damn! It's embarrassing to be beaten the same way on broadcast...' 'We keep losing track of Lee Taekhyun who keeps turning back... Ha! It's all because of Shin Jaewook. Why does he draw so much aggro? And why can't they take the ball from him?' 'Ha... If it weren't for Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, we could have easily won...' 'We're struggling against a team that's just been formed? That doesn't make sense! And I knew Shin Jaewook was good from the last tournament, but it seems like Taekhyun has improved too?' Naturally, Baechun Middle School was under more psychological pressure. On the other hand, the players of Soccer Prodigy FC found their ease. 'We're doing quite well, aren't we? If we play like this, we might be able to win?' 'Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun are doing so well. If we play on the same team as them, we might not lose even against Baechun Middle School.' 'They seem flustered, don't they? This is good for us.' 'We can take it slow. They're the ones in a hurry, after all.' And. Shin Jaewook, who had just recorded his second assist, smiled as he looked at the messages floating in the air. This time his stats didn't increase, but it was just a matter of time. Considering the number of messages, it seemed like an increase was imminent. 'I'm glad I decided to participate in this program.' --- Baechun Middle School's attack was still sharp, enough to make Soccer Prodigy FC's defense waver. But there was a difference from before. — Good defense! Soccer Prodigy FC's Kang Chanwoo and Choi Jintae are finally showing synchronized teamwork! Both of these players are among the best defenders at the middle school level, so if they can keep this up, we can expect them to be like an iron wall against Baechun Middle School! The relaxed Soccer Prodigy FC began to effectively block Baechun Middle School's attacks. — Kang Chanwoo! He sends the ball diagonally with a long kick! Impressive kicking power! In addition, they were now able to attempt counterattacks. — Kang Chanwoo's pass is received by Jang Hyun! Jang Hyun is a player with incredible speed! At times like this, he needs to play the role of a crack! Soccer Prodigy FC's Jang Hyun, although only a second-year middle schooler, was a winger who boasted a high dribble success rate even against third-year players. His fast speed and flashy footwork were the reasons he was called a prodigy. — Jang Hyun breaks through! With his individual skills, he's tearing apart Baechun Middle School's flank! Jang Hyun, it's time for a cross! The timing was right for a cross. However, Jang Hyun didn't send the cross. — Jang Hyun goes deeper! He's calm! He made another move, piercing through Baechun Middle School's defense with a play that caught them off guard. After that, Jang Hyun swung his leg. Thump! It was a cutback pass sent diagonally backward. Jang Hyun wasn't a player known for his passing accuracy, but when he penetrated deep like this, his passes were sharp. — Cutback! A good pass! The ball shot across the grass. It was a hard pass that made it difficult for the opposing defenders to react, and Shin Jaewook rushed towards the ball. 'Focus.' Concentrating on the movement of the rolling ball, he swung his leg. He couldn't kick too hard, or the ball would likely fly up. He had to focus on hitting it accurately. 'Top corner!' It was a right-footed shot. A shot focused on meeting the rolling ball. It wasn't a difficult finish. Moreover, this was inside the penalty box. For Shin Jaewook, who had been the world's best striker, it was as comfortable as his own living room. Thump! He tried to hit it precisely, but as always, the shot wasn't as sharp as he thought. A shot that a first-class goalkeeper could have easily saved. But it was too much for a middle school goalkeeper. — Goal! It's Shin Jaewook's goal! Shin Jaewook, who had only recorded assists today, finally scores a goal! A calm finish was impressive! — We can't help but praise Jang Hyun's cutback pass! It was very sharp. \\"Jang Hyun hyung, that was a good pass.\\" After praising Jang Hyun for the assist, Shin Jaewook looked up at the sky. Pleasant messages were being generated. [Your shooting improves!] [Your shooting improves!] ... ... [Your shooting has increased by 1!] It seems like I'm growing faster than in the tournaments, doesn't it? Muttering to himself, Shin Jaewook returned to his position. He thought that in a place where growth was this fast, he needed to create even more attacking points to benefit. — Will Soccer Prodigy FC take their first victory? So far, they are showing good performance, leading 3 to 2 against the strong team Baechun Middle School! Baechun Middle School became even more impatient. The players, who had been focusing on team play, were now relying on individual skills and long passes. The change came from their desire to score as quickly as possible. And this change was the worst scenario for Baechun Middle School. The players of Soccer Prodigy FC had superior individual skills compared to those of Baechun Middle School. — It's in! It's Lee Taekhyun! Lee Taekhyun's hat-trick! Jang Hyun's cross is connected with a powerful heading shot! Jang Hyun also seems to be in great condition today! — Just now, Baechun Middle School's attack was too careless! They were in a hurry. Soccer Prodigy FC should have been wary of the counterattack! Now the score is 4 to 2! — Baechun Middle School is shaking a lot in the second half! On the contrary, the players of Soccer Prodigy FC are showing more and more synchronized teamwork! As time passed, the players of Soccer Prodigy FC got into the groove, and Baechun Middle School became increasingly shaky. As a result. — The game is over! Soccer Prodigy FC takes their first win against Baechun Middle School! — It's amazing! The players of Soccer Prodigy FC have shown incredible talent! It's really difficult to win against a well-coordinated team when you're not used to playing together! Soccer Prodigy FC had defeated Baechun Middle School. --- After winning the first game, a few days later. The third episode of Soccer Prodigy FC was broadcasted. The episode showed the players of Soccer Prodigy FC, under the leadership of Coach Jin Minho, working hard to synchronize their teamwork in preparation to face Baechun Middle School, a team that always performs well in national tournaments. └Shin Jaewook isn't particularly fast or flashy, but he's somehow really good, isn't he? └That's what being really good is. His movements are so efficient. He's like a soccer sage despite his youth. └Shin Jaewook seems really good, but his physicality is a bit lacking. └Still, he has a low center of gravity and holds up well. And he's just a first-year middle schooler. Shin Jaewook is competing with older kids. └Until episode 2, it was all about Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, but watching episode 3, the other kids are good too. └That's why they were selected for Soccer Prodigy FC. └It's not Soccer Prodigy FC, it's Soccer Genius FC lol └You're nitpicking over nothing. You don't have friends, do you? Then, in episode 4, the situation of Soccer Prodigy FC struggling against Baechun Middle School in the first half was broadcasted. The episode ended with close-ups of the Soccer Prodigy FC players' expressions as they conceded goals and became flustered due to being outplayed in terms of organization. └Eh? They're getting thrashed? └Are those pass mistakes for real? Their organization is a mess lol └They said they were soccer prodigies, but they're just a ragtag bunch? How are they going to face pros later if they can't even beat a middle school team? It's ridiculous lol └They're going to face pros? No way... └It's true. Later on, they'll face domestic pro teams and even famous overseas club youth teams. └lol Are the pros a joke to them? With this kind of performance, what can they do? lol └I feel like even a high school team could beat them... And a few days later. Episode 5 was broadcasted, covering the events up to the end of the game."},{"instruction":"033 * * * 신재욱의 시선이 3명의 남자에게로 향했다. 앞서 걸어오는 2군 선수들보다도 더욱 진한 여유가 느껴지는 남자들. ‘저 사람들, 맞네.’ 최경훈, 김규민, 마석희. 인천의 1군 선수이자, 붙박이 주전급인 그들의 얼굴은 익숙했다. ‘영상으로 본 얼굴들이야.’ 버스에서 핸드폰으로 영상을 보며 미리 분석해왔으니까. ‘최경훈은 공격수, 김규민은 윙어, 마석희는 수비형 미드필더.’ 신재욱은 3명의 주전 선수들을 더욱 집중해서 바라봤다. 가장 먼저 눈에 들어온 건, 당연하게도 덩치가 가장 큰 최경훈이었다. ‘최경훈, 키는 187cm. 빠르거나 발밑이 좋진 않지만, 힘이 좋아서 최전방에서 버텨주는 게 좋은 선수지. 좋은 피지컬만큼이나 헤딩도 좋은 편이고. 중학생 수비수들에겐 사실상 재앙이라고 봐도 될 정도야.’ 다음으로는 머리를 노랗게 물들인 김규민. ‘김규민… 170cm의 단신이지만, 발이 빠르고 기술이 좋은 선수야. 무게중심도 낮아서 작은 덩치에 비해서 몸싸움도 강한 편이고…… 까다로운 선수야.’ 마지막으로 마석희까지. ‘183cm로 최경훈만큼 크지는 않지만, 근육질의 몸으로 피지컬이 상당히 좋아 보였어. 파이터 스타일의 수비형 미드필더답게 대인마크 능력도 좋고.’ 신재욱이 재밌다는 듯 웃었다. 3명 중 까다롭지 않은 선수가 없었다. 아마도 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 큰 충격을 받을 게 분명해 보였다. ‘애들이 프로의 벽을 느끼겠네.’ 조금 걱정되기도 했다. ‘천재라고 불리던 애들이라서 더 충격이 클 텐데.’ 하지만 거기까지였다. 축구천재 FC 아이들에 대한 걱정은 금방 사라졌다. 신재욱의 눈빛은 어느새 차갑게 가라앉았다. ‘충격받고 좌절하면 거기까지인 거고, 반대로 이겨내면 성장하는 거고. 난 내 할 일이나 신경 쓰자.’ 남을 신경 쓸 때가 아니었다. 그의 몸 상태도 좋지 못했으니까. 솔직히 지금의 상태론 인천의 1군은커녕, 2군 선수들보다도 뛰어나다고 말하기 어려웠다. 그래도. 신재욱의 얼굴엔 여전히 미소가 맴돌았다. 당연했다. 성장 하나만큼은 확실하게 될 것 같았으니까. ‘오늘은 능력치만 올리고 가도 대성공이지.’ * * * 축구천재 FC는 메이저 방송사에서 만든 프로그램이었다. 그래서일까? 해설들의 수준도 나쁘지 않았다. 메이저라고 말할 수는 없지만, 예능감과 해설 실력을 골고루 갖춘 사람들이었다. 그런데. 축구천재 FC와 인천의 경기 해설을 준비하는 이들의 표정은 어두웠다. “하아…… 이거 어쩌죠? 너무 어려울 것 같은데?” “어려울 수밖에 없죠. 우리는 축구천재 FC 측으로 편파적인 해설을 하기 위해서 온 사람들인데, 오늘은 칭찬할 게 거의 없을 정도로 끔찍하게 털릴 테니까요.” “도무지 이해가 안 가요. 제작진들이 무슨 생각으로 애들을 프로랑 붙일 생각을 했지?” “그러게나 말입니다. 근데 우리가 뭘 할 수 있는 게 있나요? 그냥 해설이나 해야지.” “해설도 흥이 나야 잘되는데, 오늘 같은 경기는…….” “억지로라도 텐션을 끌어올려야죠.” “…그래야겠죠.” 축구천재 FC의 경기를 해설하기 위해 모인 해설들이기에, 당연히 편파적일 수밖에 없다. 그런데 편파를 하기도 힘들 정도로 양 팀의 전력 차가 컸다. 프로랑 중학생들의 경기에서 어떻게 중학생들을 띄우며 즐겁게 해설을 한단 말인가. 그래도 해설들은 경력이 긴 사람들답게, 카메라가 돌아가자마자 목소리 톤을 높였다. ― 축구천재 FC의 기세가 너무나도 무섭습니다! 이젠 중학교 팀들은 웬만하면 전부 다 이기고 있습니다! 최근에 압도적인 모습을 너무 자주 보여줬던 걸까요? 제작진들이 다음 상대를 무시무시한 팀으로 잡아버렸습니다. ― 하하! 축구천재 FC에겐 큰 시련이 될 수 있는 경기죠. 시청자 여러분들! 지금 이곳이 어딜까요? 바로! 국내 프로팀 ‘인천’의 홈구장입니다! 예, 맞습니다! 오늘 우리 축구천재 FC 선수들은 프로선수들을 상대하게 됐습니다! 놀랍죠? 저희도 처음 이 사실을 알게 되었을 때, 정말 많이 놀랐었습니다! ― 오늘은 우리 축구천재 FC의 선수들이 승리보다는 배운다는 마음으로 경기에 임하면 좋을 것 같습니다! 부디 프로로 뛰고 있는 형들과 경기하며 많은 깨달음을 얻을 수 있는 경기가 되었으면 좋겠습니다! ― 양 팀 선수들이 경기장에 입장하고 있습니다! 확실히 양 팀의 덩치 차이가 크네요~! ― 그렇습니다. 어쩔 수 없는 부분이죠. 모두 성인인 인천의 선수들과는 달리 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 전부 중학생이니까요. 경기 시작 전, 선수들이 악수를 나누는 시간. 신재욱은 오늘 맞붙을 인천의 선수들을 바라봤다. ‘우습다는 표정이네.’ 저들의 분위기는 가벼웠다. 긴장감이라고는 조금도 느껴지지 않았다. 어떤 선수는 축구천재 FC 선수들의 머리를 쓰다듬으며 귀엽다는 행동까지 하고 있었다. “반가워! 너희 천재라며? 우리는 축구가 일이라서 방송은 안 보게 되지만, 그래도 친구들한테 들으니까 너희 인기 되게 많다더라? 오늘 형들한테 많이 배워들 가.” “야, 윤재야! 얘네 긴장한 것 좀 봐. 너무 귀엽지 않냐? 큭큭! 얘들아, 쫄지 마! 형이 별로 세게 안 할게.” “재밌게 하자고, 재밌게! 오! 너는 덩치가 왜 이렇게 좋니? 네가 에이스야? 중학생치고 되게 큰데? 잘하면 형이 밀릴 수도 있겠어?” “하하하하! 야! 네가 밀리는 게 말이 되냐? 겉으로 덩치 좋아 보이는 애들도 다 애기들이야. 괜히 너무 세게 했다가 다치게 하지 말자고.” “당연하지. 방송 나간다는데 욕먹을 일 있어?” 상황을 지켜보던 신재욱이 검지로 눈썹을 긁적였다. ‘뭐, 프로니까 중학생 선수들이 선수로 보이긴 하겠냐만.’ 이어서 크게 심호흡을 하며 손으로 앞머리를 쓸어올렸다. ‘기분이 좋진 않네?’ 환생 전, 영국에 이민을 간 이후로 많은 무시를 받아왔었다. 인종차별과 텃세 등으로 패스를 못 받고, 무시를 당하고, 마늘 냄새가 난다는 소리를 들었었다. 그럴 때마다 신재욱은 싸웠다. 항상 실력으로 싸웠고, 전부 깨부숴버렸다. 그리고. 지금도 그럴 생각이었다. ‘후회하게 해드릴게.’ * * * ― 11 대 11로 펼쳐지는 오늘의 경기는 평소와 같은 룰로 진행되게 됩니다! 프로 경기의 룰과 같다고 보시면 되겠는데요. ― 그렇습니다. 자! 경기 시작됐습니다! 양 팀의 전력을 볼까요? 우선 인천은 축구천재 FC를 상대로 대부분 2군에서 활약하고 있는 선수들을 내세웠네요. 1군에서 뛰고 있는 선수는 최경훈 선수, 김규민 선수, 마석희 선수가 유일합니다. 하지만 2군 선수들 위주로 이뤄져 있다고 해서 절대 무시할 수 없죠! ― 당연합니다. 프로가 되는 선수들은 전국에서 축구를 가장 잘하는 선수들이거든요! 2군 선수들 역시 굉장한 실력자들이고, 우리 축구천재 FC 선수들에게 많은 가르침을 줄 수 있는 선수들입니다. 경기가 시작됐다. 2군 선수들의 움직임은 가벼웠다. 빠르게 움직이고 있지는 않지만, 여유를 보이며 공을 주고받았다. 반면, 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 경기가 시작되자마자 바쁘게 움직였다. 강하게 인천의 선수들을 압박하며 기세 싸움에서 지지 않기 위해 노력했다. ― 오오! 축구천재 FC가 굉장히 적극적으로 압박을 하는데요? ― 지금까진 좋은 전략인 것 같습니다. 프로선수들에게 여유를 갖게 하면 더 힘들어질 수 있거든요! 차라리 지금처럼 정신없게 몰아치는 게 나을 수 있습니다! 인천의 선수들은 조금이지만 당황하고 있었다. 하지만 여전히 축구천재 FC를 보며 귀엽다는 듯이 떠들어댔다. “오우……! 너희 되게 적극적이다!” “압박이 거센데? 잘하네! 괜히 축구천재들이 아니구만?” “이열~! 장난 아닌데?” 분명 프로와 아마추어의 수준 차이는 크다. 다만, 프로팀 선수들이 방심한다면? 아마추어팀이 전국의 중학생 중 가장 잘하는 11명이라면? 만약…… 아마추어팀에 세계 최고의 선수였던 남자가 환생해서 뛰고 있다면? 이변은 일어날 수 있다. 지금도 그랬다. ― 오오옷! 신재욱이 공을 뺏어냅니다! 좋은 태클이었죠! ― 굉장히 정교한 스탠딩 태클과 슬라이딩 태클을 구사하는 신재욱이거든요? 오늘 이 선수의 실력이 프로선수에게도 통한다는 걸 보여주고 있습니다! 여유 있게 공을 컨트롤하던 인천의 중앙 미드필더 배윤재에게. 신재욱은 망설임 없이 슬라이딩 태클을 넣었다. 태클은 성공이었다. 다른 선수라면 몰라도 신재욱에겐 당연한 일이었다. 그렇게 공을 뺏어냈고, 몸을 일으켜서 직접 공을 몰고 전진했다. 그러자 인천의 선수들의 표정에 균열이 생기기 시작했다. “어…? 뭐야?!” “쟤, 뭔데?” “무슨 중학생 태클이……!” “야! 배윤재! 너 지금 뭐 해?” 하지만 프로의 자존심이었을까? 전진하는 신재욱을 보고서도 인천의 선수들은 여전히 여유를 보였다. “내가 막을게!” 인천의 2군 중앙수비수 강재운이 호언장담하며 앞으로 튀어나왔다. 눈앞의 귀여운 소년을 가볍게 발라줄 생각이었다. ‘배윤재한테 태클을 성공시킨 건 조금 놀랍긴 했는데…공을 뺏었으면 바로 동료한테 넘겼어야지, 감히 드리블을 쳐? 형한테 혼 좀 나보자 깜찍한 녀석아.’ 강재운은 비록 2군에 있지만, 일대일 수비 실력만큼은 1군 선수들에 비해서 크게 뒤떨어지지 않는다는 평을 받는 수비수였다. 때문에, 중학생에게 질 거라는 생각은 조금도 하지 않았다. “들어와 보렴.” 씨익 웃으며 성큼성큼 전진하는 강재운의 움직임. 신재욱으로선 아주 고맙게 느껴지는 행동이었다. ‘뚫어달라고 애를 쓰네.’ 저렇게 대놓고 빈틈을 보이는 수비에겐 전혀 위축될 필요가 없다. 오히려 과감하게 뚫어버리는 게 좋다. 물론 월드클래스 수비수들은 일부러 빈틈을 보여주는 수비를 하기도 하지만. 신재욱의 눈에 보인 강재운의 행동은 미끼가 아니었다. 진짜 방심하고 있었다. 만약, 아주 만약에 저 행동이 신재욱을 끌어들이려는 미끼일지라도. ‘해볼 테면 해봐.’ 신재욱은 뚫어버릴 자신이 있었다. ― 강재운 선수가 신재욱 선수를 막아섭니다! 빠르게 공을 뺏어내려는 것 같은데요? 과연 여기서 신재욱이 어떤 플레이를 보여줄지……? 강재운이 발을 뻗었다. 그 순간. 툭! 신재욱이 대각선 옆으로 공을 쳤다. 동시에 온 힘을 다해서 바닥을 박차고 튀어 나갔다. “엇?!” 강재운이 당황해서 팔을 쭉 뻗었다. 신재욱의 옷을 잡으려는 움직임. 상대가 빠져나가는 것을 막기 위한 본능적인 행동이었다. 하지만 신재욱은 그것마저도 당하지 않았다. 자세를 낮게 유지하며 튀어 나갔기에, 강재운의 팔은 애꿎은 허공을 휘저었다. “야…! 빨리 막아!” “뭐야, 이거?” “야아아!” 깜짝 놀란 인천 선수들의 목소리가 경기장에 울려 퍼진 지금. ‘별거 없네.’ 페널티박스 안쪽으로 파고든 신재욱이 골대 안을 향해 강력한 슈팅을 때려냈다. 퍼엉! 임팩트를 중시하면서도 파워에 신경을 쓴 슈팅이었다. 지닌 슈팅 능력치가 워낙 좋지 못하니, 이렇게 때리지 않으면 골키퍼에게 막힐 수도 있겠다는 생각 때문이었다. 최선을 다해서 때린 슈팅이었고, 인천의 골키퍼가 몸을 날렸다. 하지만 아무리 프로선수라고 해도 페널티박스 안쪽이라는 가까운 거리에서 때린 슈팅을 막는 건 어려운 일이었다. 지금도 그랬다. 몸을 날린 인천의 골키퍼 김경식은 골대 안으로 파고드는 공을 건드리지 못했고. 철렁! 한국의 1부 리그 프로팀 ‘인천’의 골망이 흔들렸다.","output":"033 --- Shin Jaewook's gaze turned to three men. They exuded an even greater sense of ease than the second-string players walking ahead. 'Those guys, they're the ones.' Choi Kyunghoon, Kim Gyumin, Ma Seokhee. The faces of these first-team players from Incheon, who were regular starters, were familiar. 'I've seen their faces in videos.' He had analyzed them in advance by watching videos on his phone on the bus. 'Choi Kyunghoon is a striker, Kim Gyumin is a winger, and Ma Seokhee is a defensive midfielder.' Shin Jaewook focused more intently on the three starting players. The first to catch his eye was, of course, Choi Kyunghoon, who was the biggest in size. 'Choi Kyunghoon, 187 cm tall. He's not fast or particularly skilled with the ball at his feet, but he's strong and good at holding up play in the front. His heading is as good as his physicality. For middle school defenders, he's practically a disaster.' Next was Kim Gyumin, who had dyed his hair yellow. 'Kim Gyumin... Although short at 170 cm, he's fast and skilled. His low center of gravity makes him stronger in physical battles than his small size suggests... He's a tricky player.' And finally, Ma Seokhee. 'At 183 cm, he's not as tall as Choi Kyunghoon, but he looks to have a muscular build and strong physicality. True to his style as a fighter-type defensive midfielder, he's good at man-marking.' Shin Jaewook smiled as if he found it amusing. There wasn't a single player among the three who wasn't challenging. It seemed certain that the players of Soccer Prodigy FC would be in for a big shock. 'The kids will feel the wall of professional soccer.' He was a bit worried. 'The shock might be greater because they're known as prodigies.' But that was as far as his concern went. His worry for the Soccer Prodigy FC kids quickly faded. Shin Jaewook's eyes soon became cold and focused. 'If they get shocked and discouraged, that's as far as they go. If they overcome it, they grow. I'll just focus on what I have to do.' It wasn't the time to worry about others. His own condition wasn't great either. Honestly, with his current state, it was hard to say he was better than Incheon's second-string players, let alone the first team. Still. A smile lingered on Shin Jaewook's face. It was natural. He felt certain that he would definitely grow in terms of his abilities. 'Today, even if I just increase my stats, it'll be a huge success.' --- Soccer Prodigy FC was a program created by a major broadcasting company. Perhaps that's why? The level of commentary wasn't bad. They might not be considered major, but they were people who had a good balance of entertainment and commentary skills. However. The expressions of those preparing to commentate on the match between Soccer Prodigy FC and Incheon were gloomy. \\"Ah... What do we do? This seems too difficult.\\" \\"It's bound to be difficult. We're here to provide biased commentary for Soccer Prodigy FC, but today we'll have almost nothing to praise because they'll be terribly thrashed.\\" \\"I just don't understand. What were the producers thinking, putting these kids up against pros?\\" \\"Exactly. But what can we do? We just have to commentate.\\" \\"Commentary is supposed to be fun, but with a game like today's...\\" \\"We'll have to force ourselves to raise the tension.\\" \\"...I guess we have to.\\" Since the commentators were gathered to commentate on Soccer Prodigy FC's game, they were naturally biased. But the difference in strength between the two teams was so great that it was hard to be biased. How could they cheerfully commentate and lift up the middle schoolers in a game against pros? Still, the commentators, with their long careers, raised their voices as soon as the camera started rolling. — Soccer Prodigy FC's momentum is terrifying! They're now beating almost all middle school teams! Maybe the producers have set up a terrifying team as their next opponent because they've shown such overwhelming performance too often? — Haha! This could be a big trial for Soccer Prodigy FC. Viewers! Where do you think we are right now? Right! We're at the home stadium of the domestic pro team 'Incheon'! Yes, that's right! Today, our Soccer Prodigy FC players will be facing professional players! Surprising, isn't it? We were really shocked when we first learned this fact! — Today, it would be good if our Soccer Prodigy FC players approached the game with the mindset of learning rather than winning! Hopefully, they can gain a lot of insight by playing against the pros! — Both teams are entering the field! There's definitely a big difference in size between the two teams~! — That's inevitable. Unlike Incheon's players, who are all adults, all of Soccer Prodigy FC's players are middle schoolers. Before the game started, during the time when players exchanged handshakes, Shin Jaewook looked at the Incheon players he would be facing today. 'They look like they're taking us lightly.' Their atmosphere was light. There was no sense of tension. Some players even patted the heads of Soccer Prodigy FC players, acting as if they were cute. \\"Nice to meet you! You're the geniuses, right? We don't watch the show because soccer is our job, but I heard from friends that you guys are really popular. Learn a lot from us today.\\" \\"Hey, Yunjae! Look how nervous they are. Aren't they too cute? Keke! Guys, don't be scared! I won't be too rough.\\" \\"Let's have fun, have fun! Oh! Why are you so big? Are you the ace? You're quite big for a middle schooler. If you're good, I might even get pushed back?\\" \\"Hahaha! Hey! Does it make sense for you to get pushed back? Even the kids who look big are just babies. Let's not play too rough and hurt them.\\" \\"Of course. Why would we want to get criticized on broadcast?\\" Watching the situation, Shin Jaewook scratched his eyebrow with his index finger. 'Well, they're pros, so I guess they wouldn't see middle school players as competitors.' Then he took a deep breath and brushed his bangs back with his hand. 'I'm not feeling good about this.' After immigrating to England in his previous life, he had been subjected to a lot of disregard. He had been ignored, not passed the ball, and faced racism and territorial behavior, being told he smelled like garlic. Each time, Shin Jaewook fought back. He always fought with his skills and crushed everything. And now. He planned to do the same. 'I'll make you regret it.' --- — Today's 11 vs. 11 game will be played under the usual rules! You can think of it as the same rules as a pro game. — That's right. The game has started! Let's look at the strength of both teams. Incheon has mostly fielded players who are active in the second team to face Soccer Prodigy FC. The only first-team players are Choi Kyunghoon, Kim Gyumin, and Ma Seokhee. But just because it's mainly second-team players, we can't underestimate them! — Of course. The players who become pros are the best soccer players in the country! The second-team players are also very skilled and can teach a lot to our Soccer Prodigy FC players. The game began. The second-team players moved lightly. They weren't moving fast, but they exchanged the ball with ease. On the other hand, as soon as the game started, the players of Soccer Prodigy FC moved busily. They pressed Incheon's players hard, trying not to lose the battle of momentum. — Wow! Soccer Prodigy FC is pressing very aggressively, aren't they? — It seems like a good strategy so far. If you give the pros too much ease, it will be harder! It might be better to keep them off balance like they are doing now! Incheon's players were a bit flustered. But they still talked about Soccer Prodigy FC as if they were cute. \\"Wow...! You guys are very active!\\" \\"The pressure is strong, isn't it? You're good! No wonder you're called soccer prodigies?\\" \\"Yiyeol~! This is no joke, right?\\" There's a clear difference in level between pros and amateurs. But what if the pro team is complacent? What if the amateur team consists of the best 11 middle schoolers in the country? What if... a man who was once the world's best player is reincarnated and playing on the amateur team? An upset can happen. And it was happening now. — Oh! Shin Jaewook steals the ball! That was a good tackle! — Shin Jaewook is known for his precise standing and sliding tackles, isn't he? Today he's showing that his skills work even against professional players! To Incheon's central midfielder Bae Yunjae, who was controlling the ball with ease. Shin Jaewook slid in without hesitation. The tackle was successful. It was expected for Shin Jaewook, but not for other players. Having stolen the ball, he got up and drove forward himself. Then cracks began to appear in the expressions of Incheon's players. \\"What...? What's that?\\" \\"Who is this kid?\\" \\"What kind of middle school tackle is that...!\\" \\"Hey! Bae Yunjae! What are you doing?\\" But was it the pride of a pro? Even as Shin Jaewook advanced, Incheon's players still showed ease. \\"I'll stop him!\\" Incheon's second-team central defender Kang Jaewoon boasted as he leaped forward. He intended to easily brush off the cute boy in front of him. 'I was a bit surprised that he succeeded in tackling Bae Yunjae... but after stealing the ball, he should have passed it to a teammate right away. How dare he dribble? Let's see how you handle this, you cute little thing.' Kang Jaewoon, although in the second team, was a defender known for his one-on-one defensive skills that were not far behind those of the first team. Therefore, he didn't think for a moment that he would lose to a middle schooler. \\"Come on in.\\" Kang Jaewoon's movements, striding forward with a smirk, were very welcome to Shin Jaewook. 'He's practically asking to be broken through.' There was no need to be intimidated by such an openly flawed defense. It was better to boldly break through. Of course, world-class defenders sometimes show gaps in their defense on purpose. But to Shin Jaewook, Kang Jaewoon's actions did not seem like bait. He was genuinely complacent. Even if, just maybe, those actions were bait to lure Shin Jaewook in. 'Let's see you try.' Shin Jaewook was confident he could break through. — Kang Jaewoon steps up to stop Shin Jaewook! It looks like he's trying to quickly steal the ball? Let's see what play Shin Jaewook will show us... Kang Jaewoon stretched out his foot. At that moment. Tap! Shin Jaewook hit the ball diagonally to the side. At the same time, he pushed off the ground with all his might and burst forward. \\"Oops?!\\" Kang Jaewoon, startled, stretched out his arm. He tried to grab Shin Jaewook's clothes, an instinctive move to stop the opponent from escaping. But Shin Jaewook didn't fall for that either. By keeping his posture low and bursting forward, Kang Jaewoon's arm only swiped through empty air. \\"Hey...! Stop him quickly!\\" \\"What's this?\\" \\"Yaaaah!\\" As the surprised voices of Incheon's players echoed through the stadium. 'It's nothing special.' Shin Jaewook, who had penetrated inside the penalty box, unleashed a powerful shot towards the goal. Thump! It was a shot that focused on impact while also paying attention to power. Since his shooting ability was not very good, he thought he had to hit it like this, or the goalkeeper might save it. It was a shot with his best effort, and Incheon's goalkeeper Kim Kyungsik dived. But it's difficult to stop a shot from such a close distance inside the penalty box, even for a pro. It was the same now.

어땠어?” “아들! 밥은? 배고프지?” 아버지와 어머니는 자리에서 벌떡 일어나 질문을 쏟아내셨다. 짧은 시간에 너무 많은 질문을 받아서 정신은 없지만, 기분은 좋았다. “저 어디 안 도망가니까, 하나씩 물어봐 주세요.” “난 질문 끝. 얼굴 보니까 잘하고 온 모양이네.” 아버지는 그 말을 끝으로 다시 소파에 앉으셨다. 하지만 시선은 여전히 신재욱에게로 고정돼있었다. “밥 먹어야지?” “예 어머니. 밥 먹고 왔는데도 운동을 많이 해서 그런지, 또 배고파요.” “운동선수가 배고프면 안 되지. 기다려봐. 엄마가 금방 밥 차려줄게.” “오! 그럼 전 얼른 씻고 올게요!” 씻기 위해 화장실에 들어간 신재욱은 거울을 봤다. 배가 볼록 나와 있었다. 진민호 감독이 사준 고기를 실컷 먹고 왔기 때문에 나온 배였다. ‘배 터지겠네.’ 너무 배가 부른 상태였다. 원래라면 밥을 먹지 않았겠지만, 안 먹을 수가 없었다. 집에 들어오자마자 코를 간질이는 갈비찜 냄새를 맡았으니까. ‘힘들게 장 봐와서 만드셨을 텐데 어떻게 안 먹겠어?’ 어머니의 정성이 들어간 갈비찜은 배가 부르더라도 먹고 싶었으니까. “재욱아, 맛이 어떠니? 엄마가 배랑 양파도 다 직접 갈아서 양념한 건데.” “엄청 맛있어요! 고기가 부드럽고, 양념도 밥이랑 너무 잘 어울려요. 어떻게 이렇게 맛있을 수가 있죠?” 신재욱은 진심이었다. 어머니께서 해주신 갈비찜은 정말 맛있었다. 어지간한 식당은 명함도 못 내밀 정도로. 덕분에 배부른 상태였음에도, 신재욱은 밥 한 공기를 뚝딱 비워낼 수 있었다. 그 모습에 어머니는 기분이 좋아 보이셨다. 환하게 웃으시며 정말 맛있냐는 질문을 반복하셨다. 지금도 그러셨다. “진짜야? 그렇게 맛있어?” “예. 놀라울 정도로 맛있어요.” “어머, 얘가 날이 갈수록 립서비스가 좋아지네? 엄마 기분 좋으라고 괜히 하는 말 아니지?” “진심이에요. 지금까지 먹어봤던 갈비찜 중…… 정말 맛있어요.” “응? 방금 무슨 말 하려던 거 아니니? 엄마가 한 갈비찜이 제일 맛있다고?” “아… 아뇨. 다른 말이었어요. 물론 갈비찜은 너무너무 맛있어요.” 신재욱은 황급히 말을 돌렸다. 차마 거짓말을 할 순 없었으니까. ‘죄송해요. 최고의 갈비찜은 따로 있어서요.’ 그에게 최고의 갈비찜은…… 돌아가신 친어머니께서 해주셨던 갈비찜이었으니까. * * * 축구천재 FC의 첫 번째 방영분이 방영됐다. 시청률은 대박이었다. 9%. 웬만큼 잘나간다는 드라마보다도 높은 시청률이었다. 게다가 그런 드라마들도 첫 방영분의 시청률은 평균적으로 높지 않다는 것을 생각하면, 더욱 놀라운 결과였다. 당연하게도 시청자들의 관심도 대단했다. 특히 국내 축구팬들의 반응은 굉장히 뜨거웠다. └축구천재 FC 대박인데? 첫 방 시청률 9% 나왔대. └시청률 나올 만하던데?ㅋㅋㅋ 재밌더라. └ㅋㅋㅋㅋ재밌긴 했어. 말만 천재가 아니라, 진짜 재능있는 애들을 데려온 게 마음에 들었어. 특히 이택현의 몸놀림이 장난 아니던데? └난 신재욱이 기대되더라. 진성 축덕들은 알고 있었겠지만, 최근에 했던 중학교 전국대회에서 우승한 팀이 대한중학교거든? 근데 그 학교의 에이스가 신재욱이야. └아 진짜? 우승팀의 에이스면 확실히 잘하겠네. 포지션은 뭔데? └수비형 미드필더인데, 중앙 미드필더처럼 뛰기도 해. 또 어떨 땐 공격형 미드필더처럼 뛰기도 하고. 아, 그리고 더 대박인 건 신재욱 1학년임ㅋ └1학년인데 중학교 우승팀의 에이스라고? 걔 맞지? 허옇고 좀 마른 애. 겉으론 전혀 에이스처럼 안 보이던데? 비리비리해 보이고……. └기술이 좋겠지. 그리고 중학생이잖아. 피지컬 영향을 덜 받는 나이야. └나는 짧은 스포츠 머리한 애가 인상 깊었어. 말하는 건 순둥순둥한데, 피지컬은 성인이라고 해도 믿겠더라. └난 걔는 별로. 시청자들과 축구팬들은 2화가 시작되기를 기다렸고. 마침내 축구천재 FC 2화가 방영되었을 때, 1화보다 훨씬 더 뜨거운 반응이 일어났다. 당연한 일이었다. 축구천재 FC의 감독이자, 전 국가대표 선수인 진민호. 그를 상대로 고작 중학교 1학년생인 이택현이 좋은 실력을 보여줬고. 마찬가지로 중학교 1학년생인 신재욱이 진민호를 이겨버리는 장면이 방영됐으니까. └ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ뭐냐? 신재욱 쟤 뭐야?;;;;;; 미친 거 아니야??? └진짜 미쳤는데……? 진민호는 국대 출신이고, 꽤 잘했던 선순데…? 심지어 은퇴한 지도 얼마 안 됐잖아? └2년인가, 3년인가? 하여튼 그 정도밖에 안 됐을걸? └은퇴한 지 몇 년 안 된 국가대표 출신 선수를 중학교 1학년 선수가 이긴다고……? 이게 말이 되는 건가? └말이 안 되니까 축구천재 FC겠지. └신재욱 ㅈㄴ침착하네. 타이밍 딱 맞춰서 공 빼내는 거 봤음? 저런 애가 잘 성장해서 국대에 들어와야 하는데. └지렸다 진짜ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 신재욱 같은 재능이면 유럽에서 뛸 수도 있지 않을까? └위에 미쳤냐? 유럽에는 저런 애들이 몇 트럭은 있을걸? 그리고 남미엔 더 많을 거고. └와나!!!!! 3화 기대하게 만드네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아오! 시험 기간인데, 이걸 어떻게 안 봐? 무조건 봐야지. 그리고. 2화가 방영될 때쯤. “촬영 시작합니다!” 신재욱은 3화와 4화에 방영될 촬영분을 찍기 위해 촬영장에 와있었다. ‘다들 긴장을 조금 한 것 같네.’ 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 일찍부터 촬영장에 와서 몸을 풀고 있었다. 선수들의 표정엔 긴장감이 드러났다. 오늘 축구천재 FC의 첫 경기가 펼쳐지게 된다는 게 긴장의 이유였다. 축구천재 FC의 멤버들은 대회에서 좋은 활약을 펼칠 정도로 강심장인 선수들이었지만, 방송에 나가는 경기는 또 다른 부담이었다. 게다가 만나게 될 상대가 강팀이라는 것이 선수들에게 더욱 큰 부담을 줬다. ‘배천중학교… 잘하는 팀이지.’ 신재욱은 배천중학교를 알고 있었다. 몇 달 전에 우승했던, 전국대회에서 만난 팀이었으니까. 당시 대한중학교를 꽤 고전하게 만들었던 학교이자, 이택현이 에이스로 있던 학교였으니까. 그런데 조금 이상한 점이 있었다. ‘이택현은 별로 신경 안 쓰는 것 같네?’ 배천중학교 선수들은 계속해서 이택현을 향해 힐끗힐끗 시선을 주고 있었는데. 당사자인 이택현은 별다른 관심이 없어 보였다. 이택현은 오히려 카메라에 더 신경이 쓰이는 것처럼 보였다. 평소처럼 공을 튕기는 트래핑을 하며 몸을 풀고 있지만, 평소답지 않게 실수가 자주 나오고 있었다. 신재욱은 그런 이택현에게 다가갔다. “이택현.” “어? 왜?” “오늘 붙을 상대가 네가 다니던 학교인데, 별 느낌 없어?” “별로. 지금은 그냥 이겨야 하는 상대잖아.” “오.” 신재욱이 작게 감탄했다. 이택현의 입에서 저런 말이 나올 거라는 생각은 못 했으니까. 반면, 이택현은 그런 신재욱의 반응을 보며 인상을 찌푸렸다. “왜 놀라고 그래?” “안 어울리는 말을 하니까.” “뭐가 안 어울려? 나 원래 쿨한 놈이야. 공과 사는 확실하게 구분한다고.” “……그래.” “반응이 좀 밋밋한데? 재욱아, 너 지금 내 말 안 믿고 있지?” “믿어.” “거짓말하네! 전혀 안 믿는 표정인데?” “내 표정이 뭐가 어때서?” “계속 어이없다는 듯이 웃고 있잖아!” “나 원래 웃는 상이야.” “허! 웃는 상은 개뿔! 내가 말을 말아야지. 근데 재욱아, 넌 긴장 안 돼? 너도 이렇게 카메라 많은 곳에서 뛰는 건 처음이잖아.” “똑같지 뭐. 그냥 평소처럼 하면 돼.” “그걸 누가 몰라서 그래? TV에 나가잖아, TV에! 우리 경기를 부모님, 친척, 친구들이 다 볼 거라고!” “그게 뭐? 어차피 나중에 프로선수로 뛸 거 아니야?” “맞지. 근데 그건… 왜?” “그때도 이렇게 떨 거야? 더 많은 사람이 볼 거고, 엄청난 숫자의 관중들이 환호와 야유를 보낼 텐데?” “떠, 떨긴 누가 떨었다고 그래? 그냥 네가 떨까 봐 걱정해준 걸 가지고……!” 이택현이 황당하다는 듯 짜증을 냈다. 이어서 공을 튕기는 트래핑을 시작했다. 트래핑은 조금 전보다 안정되어 보였다. 그리고. 신재욱은 그 모습을 보며 피식 웃어버렸다. ‘긴장이 조금 풀린 것 같네.’ 이택현은 축구천재 FC 내에서 가장 호흡이 잘 맞는 동료였다. 그런 동료가 긴장해서 실력 발휘를 못 한다? 신재욱은 그런 상황이 생기는 걸 원치 않았다. 그래서 이택현에게 접근했고, 대화를 나누며 긴장을 풀어준 것이다. ‘이제 나도 몸 좀 제대로 풀어볼까?’ 경기가 시작될 때까지 시간이 많지는 않았다. 이제 자신도 몸을 달굴 때라고 생각하며, 신재욱은 공을 주워들었다. 하지만 이내 공을 다시 내려놨다. 더 먼저 할 일이 생각났으니까.","output":"027 * * * \\"It wasn't easy.\\" Shin Jaewook recalled the one-on-one confrontation with Jin Minho. As a player who had played for the national team in Korea, his skills were good. His fundamentals were solid, and his techniques were outstanding. However, compared to the players in the European first division leagues, his level was lower. Perhaps due to his retirement from active play, his judgment wasn't as sharp. That's why he was able to win. \\"I'm glad I did a lot of defensive practice in the past. It's really paying off now.\\" Shin Jaewook's physical condition had improved a lot compared to right after his reincarnation. But when he says it has improved compared to right after his reincarnation, it doesn't mean he's satisfied with it. \\"It's still not enough.\\" To be frank, if it had been the Shin Jaewook of the past, he would have easily defeated Jin Minho. Shin Jaewook saw too many openings in Jin Minho's play. However, there weren't many of those openings he could actually exploit, given his current physical abilities. In the end, he chose to go for a tackle at the right timing and succeeded. \\"I really focused hard.\\" He was so concentrated that his head throbbed. \\"And they're really dragging out the filming, aren't they?\\" The filming went on for a long time. After completing various training sessions, meetings with the coach, mini-games, and the full schedule, it finally ended. \\"Once again, let's make sure to win in the match that will take place during the next filming. Everyone worked hard!\\" With Jin Minho's words, the production crew and players exchanged greetings and headed to their respective homes. However, there were some who did not go home and stayed at the filming site. \\"Jaewook, is it really okay for you to go home late?\\" \\"Yes. I think I can go a bit late. What about you, coach?\\" \\"I'm fine. I could even go in tomorrow. Ah! And don't worry about transportation. I'll drive you home.\\" \\"Is that really okay?\\" \\"Of course! Don't feel burdened.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Shin Jaewook smiled broadly after responding. \\"This is an unexpected treat.\\" Before the filming ended, Shin Jaewook had received an offer from Jin Minho. It was a proposal to train together after the filming was over. It felt like a monster that gave a lot of experience points kept coming at him. Naturally, there was no reason for Shin Jaewook to refuse. And then. \\"Taekhyun will also stay and train with Jaewook before going home, right?\\" \\"Yes. I'm a rival to Shin Jaewook, so I always have to train with him.\\" \\"Ha ha! That's right, you're doing really well too. I was surprised several times during the filming.\\" \\"Hehe! Really?\\" \\"Really. If you keep working hard, you can become a great professional player.\\" \\"Wow! I'll work hard and definitely become a pro player! Coach Jin Minho, you'll train one-on-one with me too, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" As always, Taekhyun decided to join as well. * * * \\"I'm home.\\" Shin Jaewook greeted his parents as he arrived home late at night. Both were watching TV in the living room, but Shin Jaewook knew. They had been waiting for him. \\"Did the filming go well? How was it?\\" \\"Son! Have you eaten? Are you hungry?\\" His father and mother got up from their seats and bombarded him with questions. He was overwhelmed by the rapid-fire questions, but he felt good. \\"I'm not going anywhere, so please ask me one at a time.\\" \\"I'm done asking. Seeing your face, it looks like you did well.\\" With that, his father sat back down on the sofa. However, his gaze was still fixed on Shin Jaewook. \\"Shouldn't you eat?\\" \\"Yes, mother. I ate, but maybe because I exercised a lot, I'm hungry again.\\" \\"An athlete shouldn't be hungry. Wait a minute. Mom will prepare a meal for you right away.\\" \\"Oh! Then I'll quickly take a shower and come back!\\" Shin Jaewook entered the bathroom to take a shower and looked in the mirror. His belly was protruding. It was because he had eaten his fill of meat bought by Director Jin Minho. \\"I'm going to burst.\\" He was too full. Normally, he wouldn't have eaten, but he couldn't help it. As soon as he entered the house, he smelled the tantalizing scent of braised short ribs. \\"How could I not eat when my mother went to the trouble of shopping and cooking?\\" He wanted to eat the braised short ribs filled with his mother's care, even though he was full. \\"Jaewook, how does it taste? Mom even ground the pears and onions herself for the seasoning.\\" \\"It's incredibly delicious! The meat is tender, and the seasoning goes so well with the rice. How can it be this delicious?\\" Shin Jaewook was sincere. The braised short ribs his mother made were really delicious. It was so good that it could put any decent restaurant to shame. Despite being full, Shin Jaewook was able to finish a bowl of rice. His mother seemed pleased, repeatedly asking if it really tasted good. She was still asking now. \\"Really? Is it that delicious?\\" \\"Yes. It's surprisingly delicious.\\" \\"Oh my, you're getting better at lip service as the days go by? You're not just saying that to make me feel good, are you?\\" \\"I'm serious. Of all the braised short ribs I've had... it's really delicious.\\" \\"Huh? Weren't you about to say something else? That the braised short ribs I made are the best?\\" \\"Ah... no. It was something else. Of course, the short ribs are very, very delicious.\\" Shin Jaewook quickly changed the subject. He couldn't bring himself to lie. \\"I'm sorry. There's a different best braised short ribs for me.\\" For him, the best braised short ribs were... the ones made by his late biological mother. * * * The first episode of \\"Soccer Genius FC\\" was broadcast. The ratings were a hit. 9%. It was higher than the ratings of even the most popular dramas. Considering that the first episodes of such dramas usually don't have high ratings, it was an even more astonishing result. Naturally, the viewers' interest was tremendous. Especially the reaction from domestic soccer fans was extremely hot. └Soccer Genius FC is a hit, right? The first episode got a 9% rating. └The rating was deserved, wasn't it?ㅋㅋㅋ It was fun. └ㅋㅋㅋㅋ It was fun. I liked that they didn't just talk about geniuses, but actually brought in kids with real talent. Especially the movements of Lee Taekhyun, weren't they amazing? └I'm looking forward to Shin Jaewook. True soccer nerds would know, but the team that won the recent middle school national championship was Daehan Middle School, right? And the ace of that school was Shin Jaewook. └Really? If he's the ace of the winning team, he must be really good. What's his position? └He's a defensive midfielder, but he also plays like a central midfielder. Sometimes he even plays like an attacking midfielder. Oh, and what's even more amazing is that Shin Jaewook is a first-year studentㅋ └A first-year student and the ace of a middle school championship team? Is that the kid? The pale and somewhat skinny one. He didn't look like an ace at all from the outside? He looked frail... └He must be technically skilled. And he's a middle schooler. It's an age where physicality has less impact. └I was impressed by the kid with the short sports haircut. He speaks softly, but his physicality was so strong that I would believe it if you told me he was an adult. └I didn't care much for that kid. Viewers and soccer fans were waiting for the second episode. When the second episode of Soccer Genius FC was broadcast, the reaction was much hotter than the first episode. It was to be expected. Jin Minho, the coach of Soccer Genius FC and a former national team player. Against him, Lee Taekhyun, a mere middle school first-year student, showed good skills. Likewise, Shin Jaewook, another middle school first-year student, managed to defeat Jin Minho. └ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ What's with Shin Jaewook?;;;;;; Is he crazy??? └He's really crazy...? Jin Minho was a national team player and quite good, right...? And he hasn't been retired for that long, has he? └Two or three years, I think? Anyway, it hasn't been that long, right? └A national team player who retired only a few years ago is beaten by a middle school first-year student...? Does that even make sense? └It doesn't make sense, that's why it's Soccer Genius FC. └Shin Jaewook is so calm. Did you see how he timed it perfectly to take the ball away? We need a talent like him to grow and join the national team. └He's amazing, reallyㅋㅋㅋㅋ With a talent like Shin Jaewook, couldn't he play in Europe? └Are you crazy? There are probably truckloads of kids like that in Europe? And even more in South America. └Wow, I'm looking forward to episode 3ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Oh man! It's exam period, how can I not watch this? I have to watch it no matter what. And then. Around the time the second episode was broadcast. \\"Filming starts!\\" Shin Jaewook was at the filming site to shoot the footage for episodes 3 and 4. \\"It seems like everyone's a bit nervous.\\" The players of Soccer Genius FC had arrived at the filming site early to warm up. The expressions on the players' faces showed nervousness. The reason for the tension was that today would be the first match for Soccer Genius FC. The members of Soccer Genius FC were strong-hearted players who had performed well in tournaments, but a game that would be broadcast on TV was a different kind of pressure. Moreover, the fact that they were going to face a strong team added even more pressure. \\"Baechun Middle School... they're a good team.\\" Shin Jaewook knew about Baechun Middle School. It was a team he had encountered a few months ago at the national championship. It was the school that had given Daehan Middle School a tough time and where Lee Taekhyun had been the ace. But there was something a little strange. \\"Taekhyun doesn't seem to care much?\\" The players from Baechun Middle School kept glancing at Lee Taekhyun. But the person in question, Lee Taekhyun, didn't seem to have much interest. Instead, Lee Taekhyun seemed more concerned about the cameras. He was warming up by juggling the ball as usual, but unlike his usual self, he was making frequent mistakes. Shin Jaewook approached Lee Taekhyun. \\"Lee Taekhyun.\\" \\"Huh? Why?\\" \\"Today's opponent is the school you used to attend. Don't you feel anything?\\" \\"Not really. Right now, they're just an opponent I have to beat.\\" \\"Oh.\\" Shin Jaewook let out a small exclamation of admiration. He hadn't expected such words from Lee Taekhyun. On the other hand, Lee Taekhyun frowned at Shin Jaewook's reaction. \\"Why are you so surprised?\\" \\"It's not like you to say that.\\" \\"What's not like me? I'm always a cool guy. I clearly distinguish between work and personal matters.\\" \\"…Right.\\" \\"Your reaction is a bit bland, isn't it? Jaewook, you don't believe what I'm saying, do you?\\" \\"I believe you.\\" \\"You're lying! You don't look like you believe me at all!\\" \\"What's wrong with my expression?\\" \\"You keep laughing like you can't believe it!\\" \\"I always have a smiling face.\\" \\"Ha! Smiling face my foot! I should stop talking to you. But Jaewook, aren't you nervous? It's your first time playing in front of so many cameras too.\\" \\"It's the same thing. Just play as usual.\\" \\"Who doesn't know that? But it's on TV, TV! Our parents, relatives, and friends will all watch our game!\\" \\"So what? Aren't you going to play as a professional player later?\\" \\"That's right. But that's... why?\\" \\"Are you going to be nervous then too? There will be even more people watching, and countless fans will be cheering and jeering, right?\\" \\"Who's nervous? I was just worried you might be nervous...!\\" Lee Taekhyun let out a frustrated sigh. Then he started juggling the ball again. His juggling seemed more stable than before. And then. Shin Jaewook saw that and couldn't help but smile. \\"It seems like his nerves have calmed down a bit.\\" Lee Taekhyun was the teammate with whom he had the best rapport in Soccer Genius FC. His teammate, who was so nervous that he couldn't perform well? Shin Jaewook didn't want such a situation to happen. That's why he approached Lee Taekhyun and had a conversation to help him relax. \\"Now, should I properly warm up too?\\" There wasn't much time left until the start of the game. Thinking it was time for him to get his body moving, Shin Jaewook picked up the ball. But then he put it down again. He remembered something more important to do first."},{"instruction":"031 * * * 신재욱이 메이저 방송사에서 방영 중인 ‘축구천재 FC’에서 좋은 활약을 펼치고 있을 때. 구영철 감독은 평소보다 훨씬 바쁜 나날을 보내고 있었다. 불타듯 쏟아지는 국내 프로팀들의 전화 때문이었다. “예? 으하핫! 그럴 리가요! 우리 재욱이가 워낙 어른스러워서 고민이 깊어진 모양입니다. 조금만 더 시간을 주세요.” “에이~! 서운하다니요오오! 서울 측이랑 우리 대한중학교와의 사이가 얼마나 돈독한지는 우리 선수들도 다 알고 있어요. 그리고 역사가 증명해주지 않습니까? 그동안 대한중학교에서 서울로 얼마나 많이 갔습니까? 조금만 기다려주세요.” “압니다, 알지요. 저도 우리 재욱이가 당연히 프로팀과 빨리 계약하길 바라고 있지요. 하하! 당연히 인천 쪽이랑 계약하는 것도 좋죠. 다만, 결정은 선수가 하는 거니까…….” “울산이랑요? 아, 너무 좋지요! 울산이 얼마나 강팀인데요. 아, 예! 알겠습니다. 제가 선수들한테 잘 전달할게요. 예? 재욱이요? 아…… 알겠습니다. 잘 얘기해볼게요.” 툭! 전화를 끊은 지금, 구영철 감독은 이마에 흐르는 땀을 닦아냈다. “재욱이 녀석의 인기는 식지를 않네. 다들 아주 그냥 데려가고 싶어서 난리구만, 난리야.” 신재욱을 향한 국내 프로팀들의 관심은 대단했다. 대한중학교의 감독직을 오랫동안 맡아왔던 구영철 감독이지만, 프로팀들의 관심이 이 정도로 큰 건 처음이었다. “재욱이가 대단한 재능이긴 하지. 그 녀석 축구 하는 걸 보면 겨우 중학교 1학년에 다니는 녀석이라고 누가 믿겠어? 게다가 행실도 바르고, 듣자 하니 영어도 잘한다지?” 구영철 감독은 씨익 웃었다. 신재욱을 생각할 때면 절로 웃음이 흘러나왔다. “이쁜 자식. 근데 왜 계약을 안 하는 거야?” 그는 좋은 기회를 받지 않고, 계속 미루기만 하는 신재욱을 이해하기 힘들었다. 그래서 결국, 구영철 감독은 신재욱을 따로 불러서 이야기를 나누게 된 것이다. “마음에 드는 팀, 있긴 있어요.” “그러지 말고…… 어? 있다고?” 구영철 감독의 눈이 커졌다. 그동안 하는 행동을 보아 전혀 관심도 없는 줄 알았더니, 마음에 드는 팀이 있긴 하다는 말에 놀라버린 것이다. “왜 놀라세요?” “놀랍지, 안 놀랍겠냐? 너, 그동안 국내 프로팀의 제안을 전부 거절했었잖아.” “예, 저는 서울이 마음에 들더라고요.” “오! 서울? 서울 괜찮지! 좋은 팀이야. 돈이 많아서 시스템도 잘 되어있고, 어린 친구들에게 기회도 잘 주는 편이지.” “그렇군요.” “으허헛! 이제야 프로팀들 측에 할 말이 좀 있겠네! 재욱아, 그럼 서울이랑 계약 진행할 거지? 언제쯤 할 생각이야? 방학 직전쯤?” 구영철 감독은 기분이 좋아졌는지 싱글벙글하고 있었다. 하지만 신재욱은 알고 있었다. 자신의 대답은 감독이 원하던 대답이 아니라는 걸. “아뇨, 아직 생각 없어요.” “뭐어어?! 너 지금 뭔 소리야? 서울이 제일 좋다며?” “서울이 제일 마음에 들긴 하지만, 바로 계약하고 싶을 정도는 아니에요. 감독님, 전 급하게 가고 싶지 않아요.” “아니, 재욱아? 빨라서 나쁠 게 없다니까? 네 나이 때 일찍부터 프로팀이랑 계약하면 유스팀에서 관리받으면서 훈련할 수 있어서 더 좋다고!” 구영철 감독은 답답하다는 듯 주먹으로 자신의 가슴을 두드렸다. 하지만 신재욱은 처음과 같이 침착했다. “감독님, 절 위해서 해주시는 말씀인 거 잘 알아요. 항상 감사하게 생각하고 있습니다. 하지만 저는 방금 말했던 것처럼 급하게 가고 싶지 않아요. 몇 년 뒤에는 모르겠지만, 아직은 대한중학교에서 배우는 것만으로도 충분하다고 생각해요.” “어휴! 이 고집 좀 봐라. 재욱아, 전혀 안 충분해! 프로팀에 비하면 부족하다고오오!” “왜 부족해요? 여긴 최고의 감독인 구영철 감독님이 계신데요? 전 그렇게 생각하지 않아요.” “너……!” 그 순간 신재욱의 눈엔 보였다. 구영철 감독의 눈빛이 흔들리는 것을. 이어서 답답했던 표정이 감동받은 표정으로 변하는 것을. “그러니 제게 프로팀과의 계약을 재촉하지 말아 주세요. 전 아직 대한중학교에서 감독님께 더 배우고 싶어요.” “……프로팀이랑 계약해서 유스팀에 들어가도 학교에 나와서 훈련할 수 있는데도? 그래도 나한테만 배우고 싶다고?” “예.” “……알겠다. 당분간은 프로팀 측에서 연락이 오면 내가 알아서 잘 둘러대 보마.” “감사합니다.” 구영철 감독의 방에서 나온 뒤. 신재욱은 크게 숨을 내쉬었다. “겨우 둘러댔네.” 감독에겐 미안하지만, 사실 대한중학교에서 배울 건 없었다. 당연했다. 신재욱은 더 선진화된 훈련을 받던 사람이었고, 세계 최고라고 불리던 선수였으니까. 그럼에도 국내 프로팀과 계약하지 않고 대한중학교에 머무는 이유는 간단했다. 굳이 갈 필요가 없었으니까. “지금 국내 프로팀으로 들어가면 유럽으로 나갈 타이밍이 늦춰질 수밖에 없어.” 현재 신재욱은 ‘축구천재 FC’에 출연하고 있고, 좋은 활약을 펼치고 있다. 그리고 이 프로그램에 출전한 목적은 유럽 진출이었다. 유럽의 프로팀들이 키우는 유망주들과의 경기에서 눈에 띄고, 그로 인해 영입 제안을 받겠다는 계획이었다. 이처럼 계획이 있지만, 국내 프로팀들의 제안을 매몰차게 거절하거나 싫다는 의견을 표현한 적은 없었다. 누군가는 야비하다고 말할 수 있겠지만, 신재욱은 만약을 대비하고자 했다. 혹시 모르지 않는가. 유럽 진출이 생각보다 늦어질 수도 있는 거고, 그런 일이 벌어지면 성장을 위해 국내 프로팀에라도 들어가야 한다. 때문에, 국내 프로팀들과의 관계를 나쁘게 해둘 필요가 없다. 다만 오늘 같은 일이 생길 뿐. “보험이랍시고 거절 안 했다가 더 귀찮아질 뻔했네.” 그래도 다행히 이야기를 잘했고, 구영철 감독도 꽉 막힌 사람은 아니었기에 당분간은 귀찮은 일에 휘말리지 않고 훈련에만 집중할 수 있을 것 같았다. * * * 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 전부 축구에 대한 재능과 지능이 뛰어났다. 자연스레 선수들 간의 호흡도 굉장히 빨리 좋아졌다. 프로그램 초반엔 패배할 때도 있었지만, 이제는 중학교 팀에겐 어지간해선 지지 않는 수준이 되어버렸다. 「축구천재 FC, 또 승리! 강팀 기현중학교를 상대로 5 대 2 압승!」 그중에서도 매번 눈에 띄는 활약을 펼치는 선수들이 있었다. 「신재욱과 이택현, 배천중 콤비가 이번에도 날았다! 둘이서 5골 만들어내며 압도적인 실력 선보여!」 신재욱과 이택현이었다. “골 감각이 더 좋아진 것 같네?” “최강천재 신재욱이랑 거의 매일 특훈을 하는데, 좋아져야지.” “…최강천재? 갑자기?” “그냥 붙여봤는데, 어때? 너랑 잘 어울리는 것 같은데?” “이상하니까 다시는 하지 마.” “……좋으면서 괜히 저러네.” 평소처럼 티격대고 있지만, 신재욱은 속으로 많이 놀라고 있었다. ‘성장 속도가 엄청난데? 이택현 얘……진짜 천재야.’ 이택현의 재능이 범상치 않다는 건 이미 알고 있었지만. 날이 갈수록 빨라지는 이택현의 발전 속도는 신재욱을 경악하게 만들 정도였다. ‘확실히 환경이 중요하긴 한가 봐.’ 분명 신재욱의 기억 속엔 이택현이 한국의 국가대표로 뛰었다는 정보는 존재하지 않았다. 어딘가에서 프로선수로 뛰었을 수는 있어도, 국가대표까지는 되지 못했다는 것이다. 하지만 지금의 이택현이 보여주는 재능이라면 미래에 국가대표가 안 되는 게 이상할 정도였다. ‘이런 천재가 무명의 선수가 될 정도니.’ 신재욱이 생각에 잠겨있자, 이택현이 고개를 갸웃거리며 입을 열었다. “나를 왜 이렇게 뚫어지게 봐? 잘생겨서 그래? 에이, 재미없게 반응이 없네. 훼이! 훼이! 신재욱! 멍 그만 때리고 정신 좀 차려봐!” “……건 아니야.” “응? 뭐라고? 조금만 크게 말해봐.” “잘생겨서 본 건 아니라고.” 솔직한 말이었다. 이택현은 14살치곤 좋은 체격을 지녔고, 선이 진한 얼굴을 하고 있었다. 남자답게 생겼다고는 말할 수 있어도, 잘생겼다고 말하긴 어려웠다. “허? 어이가 없네! 내가 학교에서 얼마나 인기가 많은지 몰라? 나 일주일 전에도 다른 반 여자애한테 고백받았던 거, 너도 알잖아?” “모르겠는데?” “우와? 다 봤으면서 모르는 척한다고? 왜 이러지 정말? 재욱아, 내가 너만큼은 아니어도 인기 많은 거 다 알잖아!” “원래 축구 잘하면 인기 있어.” “어? 지금 그 말은 나 축구 잘한다는 거지?” 축구 잘하면 인기 있다는 말. 그 말을 듣자마자 이택현의 표정이 밝아졌다. 반면, 신재욱은 이해할 수 없다는 표정이었다. “왜 이렇게 좋아해?” “흐흐! 그러게나 말이야. 이상하게 너한테 칭찬받으면 기분이 좋다니까? 게다가 최강천재한테 축구를 잘한다는 말을 들은 거잖아?” “그거 하지 말라니까?” “어떤 거? 최강천재?” “…그래.” “오케이! 안 할게. 대신 다음엔 세상에서 제일 멋있고, 재욱이 너한테 딱 어울리는 별명으로 짜올게.” “안 해도 된…… 에휴! 그래, 그래라.” 이택현은 어차피 할 거라는 걸 알기에, 신재욱은 깔끔하게 포기했다. “아, 맞다. 재욱아!” “작게 좀 불러. 왜?” “나 저번에 프리킥 연습하고 있다고 말했었잖아? 좀 봐주라.” “그래, 그거 하고 탈압박 훈련이나 더 하자.” “좋지! 아, 그리고 곧 프로팀이랑 붇는 건 어떻게 생각해?” “어떻게 생각하다니?” 신재욱이 고개를 갸웃거리며 이택현을 바라봤다. 축구천재 FC는 높은 시청률을 유지하며 순항 중이었고, 이택현의 말처럼 곧 국내 프로팀과의 경기도 잡혀있었다. 다만, 이해가 되지 않았다. 뭘 어떻게 생각한다는 말인가. 반면에 이택현은 그런 신재욱이 이해가 안 된다는 표정이었다. “재욱아 너 진짜 로봇 아니냐? 넌 떨리지도 않아? 고등학생 형들이랑 붙어도 빡센데, 이번엔 프로선수들이랑 붙는 거잖아. 난 벌써 떨려서 미치겠는데, 넌 아무렇지도 않아 보이네?” “붙으면 붙는 거지.” “질 확률이 높잖아. 아니지, 솔직하게 말하면 그냥 아무것도 못 하고 탈탈 털릴 가능성이 높잖아.” “원래 축구는 질 수도 있는 거야. 축구가 아니더라도 승부는 항상 50 대 50이라고 생각하면 마음 편해.” “……50 대 50이라고? 넌 그럼 이길 수도 있다고 생각하는 거야?” “당연하지.” 신재욱은 고개를 끄덕였다. 비록 상대는 프로고, 그의 동료들은 중학생들이었지만. 진심으로 이길 수도 있다고 생각했다. ‘공은 둥글잖아.’ 상대가 어떻든 이길 수 있다는 마인드. 신재욱은 늘 그렇게 살아왔고, 그 덕분에 이길 수 없다고 평가받던 경기에서 이겼던 적도 많았다. 이번에도 다를 건 없었다. 이기기 힘든 전력 차이지만, 그래도 이길 수도 있다고 생각하는 게 신재욱의 스타일이었다. 그리고 이택현은 그런 신재욱을 바라보며 혀를 내둘렀다. “허…! 넌 진짜 대박이다……! 마인드가 보통 사람이랑 아예 다르네.” “너도 바꾸도록 노력해봐. 그러면 손해는 안 볼 거야.” “알겠어. 나도 오늘부터 바뀌도록 노력해볼게! 상대가 프로건 뭐건 충분히 이길 수도 있다는 마인드! 진짜 개간지나네! 아! 안 되겠다! 재욱아, 오늘부터 평소보다 30분씩만 더 남아서 훈련하고 갈까?” “여기서 훈련을 더 한다고? 지금도 많이 하고 있잖아.” “너가 저번에 그랬잖아. 훈련은 배신을 안 한다고.” “그건 맞지.” “그러니까 평소보다 30분만 더 늘려서 훈련하자. 응? 더 하자~!” “그래, 하자.” “나이쓰으! 프로 잡으러 가보자!” “……그래.” 신재욱은 헛웃음을 흘리며 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 이택현의 높은 텐션은 도무지 적응되질 않았다. 그리고 2주 뒤. 축구천재 FC 선수들은 프로선수들과의 경기를 위해 버스에 올라탔다.","output":"031 * * * While Shin Jaewook was performing well on the major broadcast show \\"Soccer Genius FC,\\" Coach Koo Young-chul was having much busier days than usual. It was due to the flood of calls from domestic professional teams. \\"Yes? Haha! That can't be! Our Jaewook is so mature that he must be deeply contemplating. Please give him a little more time.\\" \\"Ah~! I'm disappointed! You know how close our relationship is between Seoul and Daehan Middle School. And history proves it, doesn't it? How many players have gone from Daehan Middle School to Seoul? Just wait a little longer.\\" \\"I know, I know. I also hope that our Jaewook will sign with a pro team soon. Haha! Of course, it would be nice to sign with Incheon. But, the decision is up to the player...\\" \\"With Ulsan? Oh, that would be great! Ulsan is such a strong team. Yes, I understand! I'll make sure to pass it on to the players. Jaewook? Ah... I understand. I'll talk to him.\\" Thump! Having hung up the phone, Coach Koo Young-chul wiped the sweat from his forehead. \\"Jaewook's popularity just doesn't wane. Everyone is desperate to take him, it's chaos, pure chaos.\\" The interest from domestic pro teams in Shin Jaewook was tremendous. Although Coach Koo Young-chul had been the coach of Daehan Middle School for a long time, he had never seen such intense interest from pro teams. \\"Jaewook really is a great talent. Who would believe he's just a first-year middle school student when they see him play soccer? Plus, he's well-behaved, and I hear he's also good at English?\\" Coach Koo Young-chul grinned. He couldn't help but smile whenever he thought of Shin Jaewook. \\"My dear child. But why won't he sign?\\" He found it hard to understand why Shin Jaewook, who had such great opportunities, kept delaying and not signing. So, eventually, Coach Koo Young-chul called Shin Jaewook aside to talk. \\"There is a team I like.\\" \\"Don't be like that... Oh? You do?\\" Coach Koo Young-chul's eyes widened. He had thought that Shin Jaewook had no interest at all, given his actions so far, but he was surprised to hear that there was a team he liked. \\"Why are you surprised?\\" \\"Isn't it surprising? You've been rejecting offers from all the domestic pro teams.\\" \\"Yes, I like Seoul.\\" \\"Oh! Seoul? Seoul is good! It's a good team. They have a lot of money, so their system is well-established, and they tend to give young players opportunities.\\" \\"I see.\\" \\"Ha! Now I have something to tell the pro teams! So, Jaewook, are you going to proceed with signing with Seoul? When are you planning to do it? Right before the vacation?\\" Coach Koo Young-chul seemed to be in a good mood, beaming with joy. However, Shin Jaewook knew. His answer was not what the coach had hoped for. \\"No, I don't have any plans yet.\\" \\"What?! What are you talking about? You said Seoul was the best, didn't you?\\" \\"Seoul is the best, but I don't want to sign with them right away. Coach, I'm not in a hurry.\\" \\"Jaewook, what's wrong with you? There's nothing bad about being fast. If you sign with a pro team at your age, it's better because you can train while being managed by their youth team!\\" Coach Koo Young-chul pounded his chest in frustration. But Shin Jaewook remained as calm as he was at the beginning. \\"Coach, I know you're saying this for me. I'm always grateful. But as I just said, I'm not in a hurry. Maybe in a few years, but for now, I think it's enough to learn at Daehan Middle School.\\" \\"Ah! Look at this stubbornness. Jaewook, it's not enough at all! It's lacking compared to pro teams!\\" \\"Why is it lacking? We have the best coach, Coach Koo Young-chul, here, don't we? I don't think so.\\" \\"You...!\\" At that moment, Shin Jaewook saw it. He saw Coach Koo Young-chul's eyes waver. Then the frustrated expression turned into one of being moved. \\"So please don't rush me about signing with a pro team. I still want to learn more from you at Daehan Middle School.\\" \\"Even if you sign with a pro team and join their youth team, you can still come to school for training. Even then, you only want to learn from me?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Alright. For the time being, if the pro teams contact us, I'll handle it and make excuses.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" After leaving Coach Koo Young-chul's office. Shin Jaewook let out a deep breath. \\"I barely managed to dodge that one.\\" He felt sorry for the coach, but in truth, there was nothing left for him to learn at Daehan Middle School. It was obvious. Shin Jaewook had received more advanced training and had been called one of the world's best players. The reason he didn't sign with a domestic pro team and stayed at Daehan Middle School was simple. There was no need to rush. \\"If I enter a domestic pro team now, it will only delay my timing to go to Europe.\\" Currently, Shin Jaewook was appearing on \\"Soccer Genius FC\\" and performing well. And the purpose of participating in this program was to make it to Europe. The plan was to stand out in matches against promising players nurtured by European pro teams and receive offers to join them. Although he had such a plan, he had never flatly rejected offers from domestic pro teams or expressed disinterest. Some might call it cunning, but Shin Jaewook was preparing for contingencies. Who knows? His move to Europe might take longer than expected, and if that happens, he might need to join a domestic pro team for growth. Therefore, there was no need to sour relations with domestic pro teams. It was just that situations like today arose. \\"Almost got more trouble for not outright rejecting them as insurance.\\" Fortunately, he had handled the conversation well, and since Coach Koo Young-chul wasn't a stubborn person, it seemed he would be able to focus on training without getting entangled in annoying matters for the time being. * * * The players of \\"Soccer Genius FC\\" all had exceptional talent and intelligence for soccer. Naturally, the players' teamwork improved very quickly. Although they had lost in the early stages of the program, they had now reached a level where they hardly lost to middle school teams. \\"Soccer Genius FC wins again! A 5-2 victory over the strong team Gi-hyeon Middle School!\\" Among them, there were players who stood out in every match. \\"Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, the Baechun Middle combo, soared again this time! They created 5 goals together, showing overwhelming skills!\\" It was Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun. \\"Seems like your goal sense has improved?\\" \\"I've been training almost every day with the ultimate genius Shin Jaewook, so it should improve.\\" \\"...Ultimate genius? Suddenly?\\" \\"I just tried it out, how is it? Doesn't it suit you well?\\" \\"It's weird, so don't do it again.\\" \\"…He likes it but pretends not to.\\" As usual, they were bickering, but Shin Jaewook was inwardly quite surprised. \\"His growth rate is incredible? This Lee Taekhyun... he's a real genius.\\" Shin Jaewook already knew that Lee Taekhyun's talent was extraordinary. However, the accelerating pace of Lee Taekhyun's development was enough to astonish Shin Jaewook. \\"Environment really does matter, huh.\\" Certainly, in Shin Jaewook's memory, there was no information that Lee Taekhyun had played as a national representative for Korea. He might have played as a professional somewhere, but not as a national representative. Yet, with the talent that Lee Taekhyun was showing now, it would be strange if he didn't become a national representative in the future. \\"Such a genius could end up as an unknown player.\\" As Shin Jaewook was lost in thought, Lee Taekhyun tilted his head and spoke. \\"Why are you staring at me like that? Because I'm handsome? Eh, no reaction, how boring. Hey! Hey! Shin Jaewook! Stop spacing out and snap out of it!\\" \\"…It's not that.\\" \\"Huh? What? Say it a bit louder.\\" \\"I said it's not because you're handsome.\\" It was an honest response. Lee Taekhyun had a good physique for a 14-year-old and a strong-featured face. He could be said to look manly, but it was hard to say he was handsome. \\"Huh? I can't believe this! Don't you know how popular I am at school? You know I got confessed to by a girl from another class just a week ago, right?\\" \\"I don't remember.\\" \\"Wow? You saw it and now you pretend not to know? What's with you, really? Jaewook, you know I'm popular too, even if not as much as you!\\" \\"Being good at soccer makes you popular.\\" \\"Huh? So you're saying I'm good at soccer?\\" The statement that being good at soccer makes you popular. Upon hearing that, Lee Taekhyun's face brightened. On the other hand, Shin Jaewook looked puzzled. \\"Why are you so happy?\\" \\"Hehe! That's what I'm saying. It feels good to be praised by you. Plus, I was told I'm good at soccer by the ultimate genius, right?\\" \\"Stop calling me that, will you?\\" \\"Which one? Ultimate genius?\\" \\"...Yes.\\" \\"Okay! I won't do it. Instead, I'll come up with the coolest nickname that suits you best, Jaewook, and bring it to you next time.\\" \\"Don't bother... Ah, forget it! Fine, fine.\\" Knowing that Lee Taekhyun would do it anyway, Shin Jaewook gave up cleanly. \\"Oh, right. Jaewook!\\" \\"Call me quietly. Why?\\" \\"I told you I was practicing free kicks last time, right? Take a look for me.\\" \\"Alright, let's do that and then some more off-the-ball movement training.\\" \\"Sounds good! Oh, and what do you think about the upcoming match against the pro team?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" Shin Jaewook tilted his head, looking at Lee Taekhyun. \\"Soccer Genius FC\\" was sailing smoothly with high ratings, and as Lee Taekhyun said, a match against a domestic pro team was coming up. However, Shin Jaewook didn't understand. What did he mean by \\"what do you think\\"? On the other hand, Lee Taekhyun looked puzzled at Shin Jaewook's reaction. \\"Jaewook, are you really not a robot? Aren't you nervous? It's tough enough playing against high school seniors, but this time we're up against professional players. I'm already so nervous I could go crazy, but you don't seem to be affected at all?\\" \\"If we're up against them, we're up against them.\\" \\"We're likely to lose. Honestly, there's a high chance we'll just get completely thrashed.\\" \\"Soccer is a game you can lose. Even if it's not soccer, I think of every competition as 50-50, it's more comfortable that way.\\" \\"...50-50? So you think we can win?\\" \\"Of course.\\" Shin Jaewook nodded. Even though the opponents were professionals and his teammates were middle schoolers. He sincerely thought they could win. \\"The ball is round, after all.\\" The mindset that you can win regardless of the opponent. Shin Jaewook had always lived that way, and thanks to that, he had won many games that were deemed unwinnable. This time would be no different. Despite the tough odds, he still thought they could win. That was Shin Jaewook's style. And Lee Taekhyun looked at Shin Jaewook and clicked his tongue. \\"Wow...! You're really something...! Your mindset is completely different from ordinary people.\\" \\"Try to change yours too. It won't hurt you.\\" \\"Got it. I'll try to change starting today! The mindset that we can definitely win, no matter if the opponent is a pro or whatever! That's really cool! Ah! I can't stand it! Jaewook, should we stay for training 30 minutes longer than usual starting today?\\" \\"Train more here? We're already doing a lot.\\" \\"You said it before. Training never betrays you.\\" \\"That's right.\\" \\"So let's train for an extra 30 minutes more than usual. Okay? Let's do it~!\\" \\"Alright, let's do it.\\" \\"Nice! Let's go catch some pros!\\" \\"...Sure.\\" Shin Jaewook chuckled and shook his head. He just couldn't get used to Lee Taekhyun's high energy. And two weeks later. The players of \\"Soccer Genius FC\\" boarded the bus for the match against the professional players."},{"instruction":"035 * * * ‘분위기를 좀 바꿔야겠어.’ 공을 잡은 신재욱은 전방을 바라봤다. 타고난 축구 지능과 넓은 시야, 그리고 오랜 시간 쌓여온 경험으로 현재 상황을 빠르게 파악했다. ‘다행히 거리가 나쁘지 않아.’ 그의 위치는 중앙선과 상대 페널티박스의 중간 정도. 선수 한두 명만 뚫어내면 페널티박스 안으로 진입이 가능한 거리다. 물론 현재 몸 상태를 생각하면 쉬운 일은 아니다. 더군다나 상대는 프로들이다. 신재욱의 의도를 눈치채지 못할 리가 없다. 하지만 그래도 해야 했다. ‘지금 만들어내지 못하면, 이번 경기는 못 이겨.’ 본능적으로 느껴졌다. 지금 골을 터트려야만 승산이 생긴다는 것이. ― 오랜만에 잡은 축구천재 FC의 공격 기회입니다! 공을 잡은 선수는 신재욱! 팀의 에이스인 이 선수가 이번에는 어떤 모습을 보여줄 수 있을까요? ― 아무리 신재욱이라고 해도 촘촘한 인천의 수비를 뚫어내긴 쉽지 않을 겁니다. 인천의 선수들이 선제골을 허용한 이후부턴 수비에 많은 신경을 쏟고 있거든요? 해설들은 회의적이었다. 양 팀의 실력 차는 컸다. 선제골은 축구천재 FC가 넣었지만, 그 이후로 계속해서 밀리고 있다. 스코어는 3 대 1이지만, 사실상 경기 내용을 보면 더 많은 골을 허용했어도 이상하지 않다고 생각했다. 물론 신재욱만큼은 달랐다. 놀랍게도 프로를 상대로도 밀리지 않는 실력을 보여줬다. 하지만 팀이 밀리다 보니 신재욱이 공을 잡을 기회 자체가 거의 만들어지지 않았었다. “살살한다면서 한 골 먹히니까 제대로들 하시네.” 작게 투덜대며, 신재욱이 공을 몰고 전진했다. 인천의 선수들은 이제 방심하고 있지 않았다. 또한, 신재욱이 공을 잡을 때면 특히나 강한 압박을 넣었다. 아마추어이고 중학생이었음에도 인천의 선수들은 골을 넣은 신재욱을 경계했다. 지금도 그랬다. ― 인천 선수들이 신재욱을 강하게 압박하네요. 두 번이나 기회를 주진 않겠다는 거겠죠? ― 선제골을 허용할 때, 신재욱 선수의 실력이 예사롭지 않다는 걸 이미 느꼈을 겁니다. 실제로 신재욱이 공을 잡을 때면 절대 1명이 와서 막지 않죠. 무조건 2명이 압박을 하고 있습니다. 공을 몰고 드리블하는 신재욱에게 2명이 덤벼들었다. 아마추어를 상대하는 것치고는 과했지만, 그만큼 신재욱의 존재는 인천에게 위협적이었다. ‘쟨 위험해. 다른 애들이랑 뭔가 달라.’ ‘신재욱이라고 했지? 특별히 빠르지도 않은데, 움직임이 이상하게 날카로워. 쟨 공을 오래 잡고 있게 하면 안 돼.’ 두 명에게서 압박이 들어오고 있지만. 신재욱의 표정엔 변화가 없었다. 수없이 많이 겪어본 상황이었다. 게다가 더 뛰어난 선수들에게 압박을 받아왔던 그였다. 프로라고는 하지만, 2군에서 뛰는 선수들은 별로 위협이 되지 않았다. 물론 심리적으로만. 퍼억! “흡!” 신재욱이 휘청였다. 몸으로 밀고 들어오는 상대에게 힘에서 크게 밀리는 게 느껴졌다. 상체에서 느껴지는 고통도 컸다. 하지만 가만히 있을 수는 없었다. 다른 한 선수가 발을 뻗어 공을 뺏으려고 하고 있었으니까. 파앗! 신재욱은 순간적으로 힘을 끌어모아 근처에 있던 선수를 밀어냈다. 밑에서 위로 밀어내는, 작은 선수가 큰 선수를 밀어낼 수 있는 기술이었다. “헙!” 예상치 못하게 밀려난 선수의 눈이 커졌다. 반면 신재욱은 여전히 바빴다. 약간의 공간이 생긴 지금, 발바닥을 이용해 공을 안쪽으로 끌고 왔고. 휘익! 발을 집어넣는 선수에게로 등을 보였다. 상대를 등지며 공을 지켜내기 위한 움직임이었다. ― 우오오오오! 신재욱이 2명을 상대로 공을 지켜냈습니다! 이건 정말 놀라운데요?! 상대 선수 2명은 무려 프로선수거든요! ― 분명 힘에서는 밀렸지만, 신재욱 선수의 움직임이 너무 좋았습니다! 이 선수는 상대의 힘을 흘리는 것에도 능하고…… 보면 볼수록 몸을 정말 잘 쓰네요! 해설들이 놀란 것처럼, 경기장에 있던 모두가 놀랐다. 인천 선수들 역시 놀란 건 마찬가지였다. 아마추어인 신재욱이 설마 자신들 2명을 상대로 이겨낼 거라는 생각은 전혀 하지 못했으니까. ‘더 끌면 안 돼.’ 2명을 상대로 공을 지켜내고 있지만, 상대의 압박은 멈추지 않았다. 여기서 벗어나려면 많은 체력을 써서 화려한 드리블을 하던가, 아니면 민첩하게 움직여서 공간을 벗어나야 했다. 그러나 그런 능력은 과거라면 모를까, 지금의 신재욱에게 없었다. 투욱! 신재욱은 동료를 향해 패스했다. 팀에서 가장 믿을 수 있는 동료였다. ‘좀 시끄럽지만, 실력만큼은 확실한 녀석이지.’ * * * 이택현은 굴러오는 공을 바라보며 빠르게 생각했다. 그는 공부는 못해도 축구 지능만큼은 뛰어났기에, 신재욱의 의도를 단숨에 눈치챘다. ‘방금까지 2명의 압박을 버티다가 나한테 공을 준다? 오케이, 그걸 하자는 거지?’ 투웅! 이택현은 굴러오는 공을 원터치 패스로 다시 신재욱에게 넘겼다. 그리고. 2명의 압박을 벗어난 신재욱은 다시 이택현에게 공을 넘겼다. 그리고 지금. 투욱! 이택현은 신재욱이 침투하는 공간을 향해 스루패스를 찔러넣었다. 적당한 파워와 높은 정확도를 지닌 킬패스였다. ― 이택현의 패스! 상당히 날카롭습니다! 같은 시각. 페널티박스 안으로 침투한 신재욱은 부드럽게 공을 받아냈다. 답답할 정도로 느리고 재능 없는 몸이지만, 수많은 연습으로 볼 터치 능력을 높였다. 툭! 공이 제법 부드럽게 발에 붙었다. 신재욱은 그대로 다리를 휘둘렀다. 여기서 한 번 더 치고 들어가는 건, 상대에게 태클 타이밍을 주는 것이다. 물론 세계적인 선수들을 상대로 할 때의 얘기지만, 신재욱은 습관처럼 빠른 타이밍에 슈팅을 때려냈다. 퍼어엉! 골키퍼가 막기 매우 어려운 슈팅이었다. 신재욱은 이 슈팅이 골이 될 것이라고 예상했다. 그러나 방심하진 않았다. 자세를 낮추고 눈으로 공의 움직임을 끝까지 쫓았다. 언제든 튀어 나갈 준비를 마쳤다. 그런 상황에서. 터엉! 골키퍼의 슈퍼세이브가 나왔다. 몸을 날리며 팔을 쭉 뻗어서 공을 튕겨낸 선방. ― 우어어?! 엄청난 선방입니다! 인천의 김경식 골키퍼가 무시무시한 반응속도를 보여줍니다! 막히기 매우 어려운 슈팅이 막혀버렸지만. 신재욱은 놀라지 않았다. 여전히 침착했다. 그럴 수 있다는 표정으로 공을 향해 달려들었다. 1초. 단 1초만 늦었다면 근처에 있던 수비수가 걷어낼 수 있었을 공이었다. 하지만 신재욱은 늦지 않았다. 준비가 되어 있었기에. 세계 최고의 스트라이커였던 그는 인천의 골대 안으로 다시 한번 슈팅을 때려냈다. ― 우와아아아아! 골입니다! 신재욱의 골입니다! 첫 번째 슈팅이 막혔지만, 끝까지 집중력을 놓지 않고 두 번째 슈팅으로 기어코 골을 만들어냈습니다! ― 이건…… 너무 놀라운데요? 그토록 단단해 보이던 인천의 수비가 신재욱 선수한테 뚫렸습니다! 이 선수는 고작 14살인데 말이죠! ― 아마 방송을 시청하실 분들도 이 장면을 보시면 굉장히 놀라실 거라고 믿습니다. 중학교 1학년생, 14살의 소년이 프로선수들을 상대로 두 번째 골을 기록할 수 있다고 생각한 사람이 누가 있겠습니까? ― ……천재입니다! 신재욱 선수에겐 이미 익숙한 수식어지만, 천재라는 말밖에 설명할 게 없습니다! ― 또 이택현 선수의 움직임도 놀랍지 않았습니까? 신재욱 선수와 엄청난 호흡을 보여주며 도움을 기록한 장면은 정말 아름다웠습니다! ― 맞습니다! 이택현 선수가 마지막에 보여준 킬패스도 훌륭했지만, 전 그전에 신재욱 선수와 보여준 원터치 패스가 더 대단했다고 생각합니다! 그리고 사실 두 선수 모두 너무 대단합니다. 둘 다 중학교 1학년 학생들인데, 이런 선수들이 프로선수들을 상대로 자신감 있게 실력을 발휘한다는 것 자체가 경악스러운 일 같습니다! 축구천재 FC의 두 번째 골이었다. 골을 넣은 신재욱은 기다렸다는 듯 동료들을 향해 크게 소리쳤다. “이거 봐! 되잖아? 상대도 사람이야. 다들 잘하고 있으니까 계속 자신감 있게 가자.” 의미 없는 행동은 아니었다. 신재욱은 알고 있었다. 골을 넣은 직후, 그 당사자의 행동에 따라 팀의 기세가 바뀔 수 있다는 것을. 역시 효과는 있었다. 물론 드라마틱한 효과는 아니었지만, 강한 상대를 만나 힘들어하던 축구천재 FC의 선수들의 기세가 조금이나마 올라갔다. “그래! 재욱이가 저렇게까지 잘해주는데 우리도 더 힘내보자!” “맞아! 상대가 엄청 잘하긴 하지만, 우리도 잘하고 있어! 결과가 어떻든 자신감 있게 끝까지 해보자!” “가자! 걍 죽기 살기로 뛰어보자고!” 같은 시각. 경기장에 있던 제작진들은 닭살이 돋은 팔뚝을 쓰다듬었다. “소오름……! 이게 어떻게 가능하죠?” “그러게나 말이야…… 나는 이거 상상도 못 했어. 어떻게 이렇게 비빌 수가 있지?” “아…… 너무 놀라서 심장이 터질 것 같아요…!” 너무 놀랐던 이들은, 이윽고 환호하기 시작했다. 줄곧 밀리기만 하던 축구천재 FC를 보며 가슴을 졸였기에, 이들 모두 시원한 골을 터트려준 신재욱을 보며 기쁨을 드러냈다. “신재욱 멋있다! 으하핫! 네 덕에 프로그램이 산다!” “대박! 골을 2개나 넣을 줄이야…!” “완전 대박이야! 이거, 이번 화 시청률도 엄청 잘 나올 거야!” “무조건이죠! 처음으로 10% 넘기지 않을까요? 근데 재욱이 쟤는 진짜 놀랍네요! 이게 말이 되는 거예요? 어떻게 프로선수들을 상대로 저렇게 할 수 있는 거예요?” “그걸 내가 알겠니? 저기 진민호 감독 좀 봐봐. 전 국가대표 선수였던 사람도 놀라서 말 한마디 못 하고 있잖아?” 제작진들의 시선이 진민호 감독에게로 향했다. 축구천재 FC의 감독인 진민호는 입을 다물지를 못하고 있었다. 그만큼 큰 충격을 받았다. “이런 건…… 이런 건…… 본 적도 없다고…….” 아는 만큼 보인다고 했던가? 진민호 감독의 견문은 넓었다. 적어도 축구에 있어서 만큼은. 때문에, 지금 벌어진 일에 그 누구보다도 놀랄 수밖에 없었다. “어떻게…… 이럴 수가 있지……?” 휘익! 그는 고개를 돌렸다. 도무지 믿을 수 없는 일을 해낸 신재욱을 바라봤다. 그런데. 진민호 감독의 눈에 보인 신재욱은 기뻐하고 있었다. “되게 좋아하고 있네?” 환하게 웃고 있는 신재욱의 모습을 바라보며, 진민호 감독은 고개를 끄덕였다. 좋아할 수밖에 없다고 생각했다. “하긴 좋을 수밖에 없지…… 프로팀을 상대로 골을 넣었으니까. 그것도 2개나.” 압도적으로 강한 전력을 지닌 팀에게 2개의 골을 넣었다? 당연히 기분이 좋을 수밖에 없지 않겠는가. “아무리 어른스럽다고 해도 중학생은 중학생이네.” 진민호 감독은 피식 웃었다. 방금까진 괴물처럼 보이던 천재 소년이었지만, 지금만큼은 감정을 숨기지 못하는 어린 소년처럼 보였다. 다만, 진민호 감독은 몰랐다. 신재욱이 지금 기뻐하는 건 골을 넣은 것 때문이 아니라는 것을. 눈앞, 허공에 떠오르는 메시지들 때문이라는 것을. [체력이 1 올랐습니다!] [슈팅이 1 올랐습니다!] [민첩이 1 올랐습니다!] [패스가 1 올랐습니다!] [드리블이 1 올랐습니다!] [탈압박이 2 올랐습니다!]","output":"035 * * * \\"I need to change the atmosphere.\\" Shin Jaewook, with the ball at his feet, looked upfield. With his innate soccer intelligence, broad vision, and years of accumulated experience, he quickly assessed the situation. \\"Fortunately, the distance isn't bad.\\" His position was about halfway between the center line and the opponent's penalty box. If he could break through just one or two players, he could enter the penalty box. Of course, considering his current physical condition, it wasn't an easy task. Moreover, the opponents were professionals. They wouldn't fail to notice Shin Jaewook's intentions. But he still had to try. \\"If I don't make something happen now, we won't win this game.\\" He felt it instinctively. They needed to score now to have a chance of winning. \\"The rare attack opportunity for Soccer Genius FC! The player with the ball is Shin Jaewook! What can the team's ace show us this time?\\" \\"No matter how good Shin Jaewook is, it won't be easy to break through Incheon's tight defense. Since conceding the first goal, Incheon's players have been focusing a lot on defense.\\" The commentators were skeptical. The skill gap between the two teams was significant. Soccer Genius FC had scored the first goal, but they had been pushed back ever since. The score was 3-1, but in reality, it wouldn't have been surprising if they had conceded more goals. Of course, Shin Jaewook was different. Surprisingly, he showed skills that didn't falter even against professionals. However, as the team was being pushed back, Shin Jaewook hardly had the chance to get the ball. \\"Playing it easy, but now that they've conceded a goal, they're really stepping it up.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jaewook advanced with the ball. Incheon's players were no longer complacent. Especially when Shin Jaewook had the ball, they applied strong pressure. Despite being amateurs and middle schoolers, Incheon's players were wary of Shin Jaewook, who had scored a goal. It was the same now. \\"Incheon's players are putting strong pressure on Shin Jaewook. They won't give him a second chance, will they?\\" \\"When they conceded the first goal, they must have felt that Shin Jaewook's skills were not ordinary. In fact, whenever Shin Jaewook gets the ball, they never send just one person to mark him. Always two are applying pressure.\\" Two players rushed at Shin Jaewook as he dribbled the ball. It was excessive for playing against amateurs, but that's how threatening Shin Jaewook was to Incheon. \\"He's dangerous. He's different from the others.\\" \\"Was his name Shin Jaewook? He's not particularly fast, but his movements are strangely sharp. We can't let him hold onto the ball for long.\\" Despite being pressured by two players, Shin Jaewook's expression didn't change. He had faced this situation countless times before. Moreover, he had been pressured by even better players. The second-string players of the pros weren't much of a threat to him, at least psychologically. Thump! \\"Ugh!\\" Shin Jaewook staggered. He felt significantly overpowered by the opponent who was pushing into him with their body. The pain in his upper body was also intense. But he couldn't just stand there. Another player was reaching out to steal the ball. Swoosh! Shin Jaewook gathered his strength in a flash and pushed away the nearby player. It was a technique that allowed a smaller player to push away a larger one from the bottom up. \\"Ugh!\\" The player, pushed away unexpectedly, widened his eyes. Meanwhile, Shin Jaewook was still busy. Now that a bit of space had opened up, he used the sole of his foot to pull the ball inward. Whoosh! He turned his back to the player trying to insert his foot. It was a movement to protect the ball by turning his back on the opponent. \\"Wow! Shin Jaewook has kept the ball against two players! This is really amazing! Those two players are professional players!\\" \\"Sure, he was overpowered in strength, but Shin Jaewook's movements were too good! He's also skilled at deflecting the opponent's strength... the more you watch, the better he seems to use his body!\\" As surprised as the commentators were, everyone in the stadium was astonished. Incheon's players were no exception. They had never thought that Shin Jaewook, an amateur, could overcome two of them. \\"I can't drag this out.\\" Although he was keeping the ball against two players, the pressure from the opponents didn't stop. To break free, he would have to use a lot of energy for a flashy dribble or move agilely to escape the space. However, Shin Jaewook didn't have such abilities now, not like he might have in the past. Thwock! Shin Jaewook passed the ball to a teammate. It was the most reliable teammate on the team. \\"He's a bit noisy, but his skills are certain.\\" * * * Lee Taekhyun watched the rolling ball and quickly thought. Even though he wasn't good at studying, his soccer intelligence was excellent, and he immediately caught on to Shin Jaewook's intentions. \\"He's been holding off two players and now he's passing to me? Okay, he wants to do that, right?\\" Whoosh! Lee Taekhyun returned the rolling ball to Shin Jaewook with a one-touch pass. And then. Shin Jaewook, having escaped the pressure of two players, passed the ball back to Lee Taekhyun. And now. Thwock! Lee Taekhyun stabbed a through pass towards the space Shin Jaewook was penetrating. It was a killer pass with just the right power and high accuracy. \\"Lee Taekhyun's pass! It's quite sharp!\\" At the same time. Shin Jaewook, who had penetrated into the penalty box, smoothly received the ball. His body was frustratingly slow and lacking in talent, but he had improved his ball-touching skills through countless practices. Tap! The ball stuck to his foot quite softly. Shin Jaewook swung his leg without hesitation. Taking another touch here would give the opponent a chance to tackle. Of course, that was when facing the world's top players, but Shin Jaewook instinctively shot quickly. Boom! It was a shot very difficult for the goalkeeper to block. Shin Jaewook anticipated that this shot would result in a goal. But he didn't let his guard down. He lowered his stance and followed the movement of the ball with his eyes until the end, ready to pounce at any moment. In that situation. Bang! The goalkeeper made a super save. He flew through the air, stretching his arm to deflect the ball with a save. \\"Wow?! What an incredible save! Incheon's goalkeeper Kim Kyung-sik shows a terrifying reaction speed!\\" Although the very difficult shot was blocked. Shin Jaewook wasn't surprised. He remained calm. With an expression that said \\"it happens,\\" he rushed towards the ball. One second. Just one second later, and a defender nearby could have cleared the ball. But Shin Jaewook wasn't late. Because he was ready. The former world's best striker fired another shot into Incheon's goal. \\"Wow! It's a goal! Shin Jaewook's goal! The first shot was blocked, but he didn't lose focus and managed to score with the second shot!\\" \\"This is... too amazing? Incheon's solid defense has been breached by Shin Jaewook! He's just a 14-year-old boy!\\" \\"I believe the viewers watching the broadcast will be just as surprised by this scene. Who would have thought that a 14-year-old middle school first-year student could score a second goal against professional players?\\" \\"...He's a genius! It's a familiar adjective for Shin Jaewook, but there's no other way to describe it but genius!\\" \\"And wasn't Lee Taekhyun's movement also amazing? The synergy he showed with Shin Jaewook, contributing to the assist, was truly beautiful!\\" \\"Right! Lee Taekhyun's last pass was excellent, but I think the one-touch pass he showed with Shin Jaewook before that was even more impressive! And in fact, both players are too amazing. They're both middle school first-year students, and it's astonishing that such players can confidently display their skills against professional players!\\" It was Soccer Genius FC's second goal. Shin Jaewook, having scored, shouted to his teammates as if he had been waiting for this moment. \\"See! It's possible, right? The opponents are human too. Everyone's doing well, so let's keep going with confidence.\\" It wasn't a meaningless action. Shin Jaewook knew. Depending on the actions of the person who scored right after the goal, the team's momentum could change. And it did have an effect. Not dramatically, but the morale of the Soccer Genius FC players, who had been struggling against a strong opponent, rose slightly. \\"Yeah! If Jaewook can do that much, let's try harder too!\\" \\"Right! The opponents are really good, but we're doing well too! No matter the result, let's keep our confidence and go until the end!\\" \\"Let's go! Let's just run for our lives!\\" At the same time. The production crew in the stadium rubbed their goosebumped arms. \\"Goosebumps...! How is this possible?\\" \\"Exactly... I couldn't even imagine this. How can they compete like this?\\" \\"Ah... I'm so surprised my heart feels like it's going to burst...!\\" The crew, who had been so surprised, began to cheer. They had been anxious watching Soccer Genius FC being pushed back, so they all expressed their joy at Shin Jaewook's refreshing goal. \\"Shin Jaewook is awesome! Haha! Thanks to you, the program is alive!\\" \\"Amazing! Who would have thought he'd score two goals...!\\" \\"Absolutely amazing! This episode's ratings are going to be great!\\" \\"Definitely! Could we surpass 10% for the first time? But Jaewook, he's really amazing! Is this even possible? How can he do that against professional players?\\" \\"How would I know? Look at Coach Jin Minho. Even the former national team player is so shocked he can't say a word.\\" The production crew's gaze turned to Coach Jin Minho. Jin Minho, the coach of Soccer Genius FC, couldn't close his mouth. He was that shocked. \\"I've never seen... anything like this...\\" Is it true that you only see as much as you know? Coach Jin Minho's experience was vast. At least when it came to soccer. Therefore, he was more surprised than anyone else by what was happening. \\"How... How is this possible...?\\" Whoosh! He turned his head. He looked at Shin Jaewook, who had accomplished something unbelievable. But. What Coach Jin Minho saw was Shin Jaewook looking happy. \\"He seems really happy?\\" Looking at Shin Jaewook's bright smile, Coach Jin Minho nodded. He thought it was natural to be happy. \\"After all, he scored against a pro team. Two goals at that.\\" Scoring two goals against a team with overwhelmingly strong players? Of course, he had to be happy. \\"Even if he's mature, a middle schooler is still a middle schooler.\\" Coach Jin Minho chuckled. Just a moment ago, the boy had seemed like a monster genius, but now he looked like a young boy who couldn't hide his emotions. However, Coach Jin Minho didn't know. Shin Jaewook wasn't happy because he scored a goal. It was because of the messages floating in the air in front of him.

[패스가 좋아집니다!] [패스가 좋아집니다!] ……. ……. 패스가 좋아졌다는 메시지가 여러 개 떠올랐고. 이어서 능력치가 올랐다는 메시지까지 떠올랐다. [패스가 1 올랐습니다!] 신재욱의 얼굴에 환한 미소가 지어졌다. “오!” 기다렸던 메시지였다. 최근 들어 능력치가 올랐다는 메시지를 자주 보는 편이지만. 능력치의 수치가 60인 능력들은 오르지 않고 있었다. 해당 능력이 좋아졌다는 메시지만 뜰 뿐, 능력치 자체는 요지부동이었는데. ‘60이 된 능력치들은 오를 생각을 안 하더니, 이제 오르네.’ 드디어 올라서 61이 됐다. ‘50대랑 60대의 능력치 오르는 속도가 너무 차이가 커…… 이래서 언제 80대를 찍고 90대를 만들지…? 아니야, 이런 생각하지 말자. 무조건 만들어낸다.’ 신재욱은 흔들리려는 마음을 다잡았다. 어떻게든 능력치를 올려서 환생 전의 실력을 되찾고, 더 나아가 환생 전의 실력을 뛰어넘는 선수가 되겠다고 다시 한번 다짐했다. * * * 첫 골이 나온 이후. 자존심을 구긴 배천중학교는 공격적인 운영을 펼치기 시작했다. 공격은 날카로웠고, 이에 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 흔들렸다. 제아무리 천재들을 모아놨다고는 한들, 오랫동안 호흡을 맞춰온 배천중학교의 공격을 막아내는 건 어려운 일이었다. ― 배천중학교가 측면을 이용한 공격을 잘 활용하고 있네요! 조직력에서는 확실히 축구천재 FC보다 뛰어난 모습을 보여주고 있습니다. ― 아……! 축구천재 FC의 수비수들은 집중해야 합니다! ― 이렇게 수비가 허물어지면…… 아! 배천중학교의 고동찬이 강력한 중거리 슈팅으로 골을 만들어냅니다! ― 방금 수비는 조금 아쉬운데요? 고동찬 선수가 너무 편하게 슈팅할 수 있게 놔뒀어요. 동점 골은 이른 시간에 나왔다. 게다가 축구천재 FC는 또다시 조직력에 아쉬운 모습을 보여주며 역전 골까지 허용했다. ― 아…… 들어갔습니다…! 배천중학교…… 강하네요! 대회에서도 매번 좋은 성적을 내는 강팀다운 경기력입니다. 반면에 축구천재 FC는 조직력을 강화하는 데에 신경을 많이 써야겠네요. ― 특히 수비조직력이 아쉽습니다. 분명히 아쉬운 점이 많이 보입니다. 하지만 방송을 보시는 시청자 여러분들이 아셔야 할 게 있습니다. 처음에도 말씀드렸지만, 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 아직 호흡을 거의 맞춰보지 못한 상태라는 겁니다. 점점 더 나아질 테니, 비난보단 응원을 부탁드리겠습니다. ― 그렇습니다. 처음부터 호흡이 맞을 수는 없는 거죠. 그리고 점점 경기가 진행될수록 호흡이 더 좋아질 수도 있는 거고요. 축구천재 FC는 흔들렸다. 마음처럼 팀플레이가 되지 않는 것은 이들에게 익숙하지 않은 일이었으니까. 그때였다. “얘들아! 집중해! 잘하고 있으니까, 위축되지 말고 자신감 있게 해!” 진민호 감독이 목에 핏대를 세워가며 선수들의 자신감을 북돋웠다. 효과도 있었다. 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 집중하기 위해 노력했고, 배천중학교의 조직적인 압박을 이겨내며 조금씩 전진했다. 그리고 지금. “재욱아!” 팀 동료 중 하나가 신재욱에게 공을 넘겼다.","output":"Director Jin Min-ho. A former national representative and professional player. Now, he is active in various entertainment programs and also serves as the manager of Soccer Genius FC. And. His first impression on Shin Jae-wook was not good. He didn't like everything from being late on the first shoot to trying to play it off with a brazen attitude. However, the more he got to know him, the more he thought that Shin Jae-wook wasn't a bad person. He might be clueless, shameless, and somewhat overly competitive. But he taught the Soccer Genius FC players his best during training. Afterward, he even bought delicious meals for the remaining Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun and drove them home in his own car. He had his flaws, but he was sincere about soccer and a man with whom you could have a conversation. That was exactly who Soccer Genius FC's Director Jin Min-ho was. That's why, before the game started, Shin Jae-wook went to see him. \\"What? You want to play as an attacking midfielder?\\" Director Jin Min-ho asked with wide eyes, and Shin Jae-wook nodded. \\"Yes.\\" \\"Suddenly wanting to play as an attacking midfielder... With your skills, Jae-wook, I think you'd do well as an attacking midfielder, but... are you confident?\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"May I ask why?\\" Director Jin Min-ho asked for the reason right now. Around Shin Jae-wook and the director, several cameras were rolling. Of course, Shin Jae-wook was aware of the cameras. He wasn't showing it, though. \\"Because I'm more confident in the position of attacking midfielder.\\" \\"Really? But why have you been playing as a defensive midfielder until now? I heard you played as a defensive midfielder in the tournament too?\\" \\"It was the role needed for the team.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Director Jin Min-ho pondered for a moment. It was because the request was so sudden. Moreover, he had never seen Shin Jae-wook play as an attacking midfielder. However, he did not doubt Shin Jae-wook's skills. He had seen his skills during a one-on-one match in the last shoot. And he was astonished several times during the separate training after the shoot. 'It should be fine.' Eventually, Jin Min-ho decided to let Shin Jae-wook play as an attacking midfielder. \\"Thank you.\\" After expressing his gratitude, Shin Jae-wook began to warm up. The reason for playing as an attacking midfielder was simple. It was to maintain his sharpness. 'Once you lose the attacking sharpness, it's hard to bring it back up.' The best thing would be to maintain the sharpness by playing as a forward, but that wasn't easy in reality. Shin Jae-wook's body was still not ready to play as a forward. To be precise, he lacked the abilities required for a forward. The position he could rely on due to his experience was that of an attacking midfielder, so he had suggested it to the director. 'The game will start soon.' Shin Jae-wook's expression was bright as he controlled the ball. 'I'll finally be able to play offensively without worrying about the back.' He preferred attacking to defending, and he was in a good mood thinking about attacking properly today. Moreover. 'Playing with the kids called geniuses, my stats should rise even better.' Just like when he first trained with Lee Taek-hyun, he was happy thinking that his growth rate would be faster in the game with the Soccer Genius FC team members. * * * Before his reincarnation. Shin Jae-wook was a player who showed his best condition when playing as a striker. However, when the team needed him, he was always ready to play in other positions. Naturally, he played in various positions such as central midfielder, winger, defensive midfielder, and attacking midfielder, and he performed well in all of them. Despite being one of the world's best strikers, he was a player who could take on various roles depending on the team's situation. And Shin Jae-wook was still fulfilling different roles now. ― The early momentum battle between Soccer Genius FC and Baechon Middle School is fierce, isn't it? Both teams are pressing each other strongly! ― Right from the start, the movement of Shin Jae-wook, who is playing as an attacking midfielder today, stands out. This player has an amazing ability to connect the ball in the front! ― That's right. Even under pressure, Shin Jae-wook doesn't panic and connects the ball to his teammates. It shows how confident he is in his own skills, doesn't it? ― He's a player with very solid fundamentals. I heard he was a key player on the team that won the national tournament, and indeed, he has tremendous talent. He's a perfect fit for Soccer Genius FC! Moreover, the other players of Soccer Genius FC were also showing decent play, befitting their talents. ― We can't help but praise the other players too! Choi Jin-tae is showing a stable performance in defense, and Lee Taek-hyun is also providing great support in the front with his ball-keeping ability! ― It's amazing, isn't it? Even though they've gathered players called geniuses, they didn't have much time to sync up, right? But they're not being pushed back at all against a strong team like Baechon Middle School! ― It just means that the individual skills of the Soccer Genius FC players are outstanding. As the commentators said, the game was surprising. Even if you gather good players, if the team doesn't sync up, you can lose in soccer. In fact, the teamwork of Soccer Genius FC was not well-synced at the moment. There were occasional pass mistakes and moments where the signs didn't match. Yet, they were playing an equal game against Baechon Middle School, one of the top middle school teams. Of course, Shin Jae-wook was at the center of it. ― Shin Jae-wook gets the ball! Baechon Middle School players quickly surround him! Today, Baechon Middle School's players are very wary of Shin Jae-wook! Whoosh! Shin Jae-wook swung his leg quickly. If he held onto the ball any longer, he would be pressured by three players. He had to get out of it with a short pass. Tap! He chipped the ball to Lee Taek-hyun in the front. Lee Taek-hyun, being a player with good sense, dropped the flying ball with his forehead. The dropped ball was then picked up again by Shin Jae-wook. ― Wow! The coordination between Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun is incredible! They look like they're currently playing on the same team! With just a few short passes, they've escaped the pressure from Baechon Middle School players! Shin Jae-wook advances! Since Shin Jae-wook was playing as an attacking midfielder, his current position was right in front of Baechon Middle School's penalty box. It was a situation close to the goal. He could even attempt a direct shot. Baechon Middle School's defenders were also aware of this fact. Moreover, these players had memories of being defeated by Shin Jae-wook in the tournament. \\"Block him!\\" \\"We have to block Shin Jae-wook no matter what!\\" \\"Just cut him off with a tackle!\\" The defenders moved. To interfere with Shin Jae-wook's play. But Shin Jae-wook's foot had already kicked the ball. A pass that he had practiced countless times to drop it more accurately where he wanted, even if not as much as before his reincarnation. At this moment, the result of the practice showed. Swoosh! The ball dropped about 2 meters away from the goalkeeper. And. Lee Taek-hyun, the best striker among the middle schoolers, swung his leg towards the bouncing ball. Bang! It was difficult to hit a slightly lifted ball with an accurate volley shot. But Lee Taek-hyun, a player with innate talent, managed to do it. ― Goal! It's in! A wonderful collaboration between Shin Jae-wook and Lee Taek-hyun! ― These two players, their level is too high, isn't it? Baechon Middle School players are not ones who can't do it, but these two players perfectly broke through and even created a goal! Truly an astonishing play! ― Soccer Genius FC! They're off to a great start! After scoring the goal, Lee Taek-hyun didn't perform any ceremony. It was out of respect for his team. He quietly bowed his head and then ran to Shin Jae-wook, giving him a thumbs up. \\"Jae-wook, that pass was really good.\\" \\"I'll send a few more good passes today. And it's nice to see you showing respect for your team.\\" \\"…It's just natural.\\" \\"There are more people who can't do what's natural.\\" \\"…It's really embarrassing to be praised by you. Just give me honey passes so I can score a hat-trick.\\" \\"I already told you. I'll send a few more good passes.\\" \\"…Got it.\\" Lee Taek-hyun returned to his position with a flushed face. Watching him, Shin Jae-wook smirked and looked up at the sky. In the air, rewards for recording an assist were floating. [Your passing improves!] [Your passing improves!] ... ... Messages indicating that his passing had improved appeared several times. Then, messages about his stats increasing followed. [Your passing has increased by 1!] A bright smile appeared on Shin Jae-wook's face. \\"Oh!\\" It was the message he had been waiting for. He had been seeing messages about his stats increasing quite often recently. However, the abilities that had reached 60 were not increasing. Only messages about the improvement of the abilities appeared, but the stats themselves remained unchanged. 'The abilities that reached 60 didn't seem to increase, but now they are.' Finally, it increased to 61. 'The speed of increase between abilities in the 50s and 60s is so different... How will I ever reach the 80s and create the 90s...? No, let's not think like this. I'll definitely make it happen.' Shin Jae-wook steadied his wavering mind. He resolved once again to raise his stats by any means to regain his skills from before his reincarnation and to become a player who surpasses his previous skills. * * * After the first goal. Baechon Middle School, with their pride hurt, began to play more aggressively. Their attacks were sharp, and the players of Soccer Genius FC were shaken. No matter how many geniuses they had gathered, it was difficult to stop the organized attack of Baechon Middle School, which had been syncing up for a long time. ― Baechon Middle School is making good use of the flanks for their attacks! They're definitely showing superior organization compared to Soccer Genius FC. ― Ah…! The defenders of Soccer Genius FC need to concentrate! ― If the defense collapses like this... Ah! Baechon Middle School's Go Dong-chan scores a goal with a powerful long-range shot! ― That defense was a bit disappointing, wasn't it? They let Go Dong-chan shoot too comfortably. The equalizing goal came early. Moreover, Soccer Genius FC showed more signs of organizational weakness and even conceded a goal that put them behind. ― Ah… It's in…! Baechon Middle School… They're strong! They're showing the performance of a strong team that always does well in tournaments. On the other hand, Soccer Genius FC really needs to work on strengthening their organization. ― Especially the defensive organization is disappointing. There are definitely many shortcomings. But there's something the viewers watching the broadcast need to know. As I mentioned at the beginning, the players of Soccer Genius FC have hardly had any time to sync up. They will improve over time, so instead of criticism, we ask for your support. ― That's right. You can't sync up from the beginning. And as the game progresses, the teamwork can improve. Soccer Genius FC was shaken. Not being able to play as a team as they wished was an unfamiliar situation for them. That's when it happened. \\"Guys! Focus! You're doing well, so don't get intimidated and play with confidence!\\" Director Jin Min-ho raised his voice to boost the players' confidence. It had an effect. The players of Soccer Genius FC tried to concentrate and managed to push forward little by little against Baechon Middle School's organized pressure. And now. \\"Jae-wook!\\" One of the team members passed the ball to Shin Jae-wook."},{"instruction":"032 * * * 스포츠에서 아마추어와 프로의 실력 차이는 크다. 당연히 프로가 더 잘한다. 물론 복싱처럼 예외인 스포츠도 있지만, 대부분이 그렇다. 축구 역시 마찬가지였다. 프로와 아마추어의 실력 차이가 매우 큰 스포츠다. 날고 긴다는 아마추어 선수들 11명을 모아놓아도 어지간해선 프로팀을 이길 순 없다. 잘 싸울 수는 있어도 웬만하면 못 이긴다. 그게 바로 축구에서 아마추어와 프로의 차이다. 그래서일까? 오늘 축구천재 FC를 상대하게 된 국내 1부 리그에 속한 팀 ‘인천’의 감독 유혁수는 여유가 넘쳤다. “김 코치, 슬슬 우리 애들도 몸 좀 풀어야겠지?” “예, 감독님. 부상 방지를 위해서 혹시 모르니까 스트레칭 정도는 해야 할 것 같습니다.” “이거 참…… 중학교 다니는 애기들 상대로 몸을 풀라고 하기도 뭐하네. 그치?” “으하핫! 그렇긴 하죠. 근데 참 그쪽 제작진들도 잔인하네요. 무슨 애들이랑 프로팀이랑 붙인다고…… 괜히 자라나는 새싹들 자신감 떨어뜨리는 일이라는 걸 알아야 할 텐데 말이죠.” “방송국 사람들이 그런 거에 관심이나 있겠어? 그냥 어그로 끌려서 시청률이나 잘 나오면 그만인 사람들인데. 우린 그냥 장단 맞춰주면 되는 거야. 적당히 매너 좋게 수준 차이 보여주면서, 팀 홍보나 하면 그걸로 된 거지.” 유혁수 감독의 말에 김 코치라고 불린 남자가 고개를 끄덕였다. 그 역시 틀린 말이 없다고 생각했다. 다만, 더 나아가 1군 선수들을 쓸 필요도 없다고 생각했다. “감독님 그런데…….” “왜?” “1군 선수들을 내보낼 필요가 있을까요? 시즌 중인데, 그냥 2군 선수들로만 내보내도 되지 않을까요?” “김 코치 말도 맞아. 근데 보여주기식으로 내보내긴 해야 돼. 아예 2군으로만 내보내면 사람들이 욕할 거거든.” “욕을 해요? 왜요? 애들 무시한다고 그러는 건가요?” “그치. 김 코치는 몰랐구나? TV 보는 시청자들이 얼마나 극성인데~! 자기들이 응원하는 축구천재 FC가 무시당한다고 느끼면, 곧바로 방송국 게시판에 들어가서 욕 엄청 할걸? 진짜야. 진짜 그래. 드라마 쪽에선 특히나 더 흔한 일이야. 그쪽은 스토리가 마음에 안 들면 바로 게시판 테러 들어가잖아. 하하! 무서운 세상이야. 그리고 그런 일이 생기는 건 우리 구단한테도 좋지 않으니까, 아예 그런 상황을 만들지 않는 게 좋겠지.” “…그러네요.” “그래, 그러니까 우린 그냥 1군 선수 3명 정도만 내보내고, 나머지는 다 2군으로 구성해. 2군 애들도 방송 좀 나가고 하면 자신감도 더 올라오겠지. 그리고 후반전 20분쯤에 1군 선수 몇 명 더 넣어주면서 보여주기식으로 하면 돼.” “2군 위주로 내보낸다고 해서 혹시나 지지는 않겠죠……?” 그때였다. 유혁수 감독의 표정이 변했다. 장난기가 흐르던 얼굴은 더 이상 없었다. 딱딱하게 굳은 얼굴을 한 채, 차가운 눈빛으로 코치를 노려봤다. “김 코치, 농담하는 거지?” “죄, 죄송합니다.” “2군은 프로 아니야? 걔들이 중학교 다니는 아마추어들한테 지겠어? 거참, 웬 말 같은 소리를 해야지 받아주지, 개소리를 하면 어떻게 받아주겠나? 김 코치도 선출 아니야? 프로 출신이잖아? 근데 왜 그래?” “……죄송합니다. 쓸데없는 걱정을 했네요.” “그래, 김 코치가 평소에 우리 선수들을 많이 생각하는 건 알지만, 걱정이 너무 많으면 오히려 사기를 떨어뜨릴 수도 있다는 것도 알아야지.” “명심하겠습니다.” “됐어. 곧 축구천재인지 뭔지 걔네들 온다니까, 우리 선수들 얼른 몸 풀라고 해.” “예!” 저 멀리 뛰어가는 코치를 바라보며, 인천의 유혁수 감독은 의자의 등받이에 몸을 기댔다. 그의 얼굴엔 걱정이라는 감정이 조금도 존재하지 않았다. “좀 살살하라고 말이라도 해줘야 하나? 너무 압도하면 괜히 구단 이미지 나빠질 텐데.” * * * 국내 프로 1부 리그에 속한 팀인 인천과의 경기. 그 경기에 나서기 위해서 축구천재 FC 팀은 대형 버스에 올라탔다. 버스 안이지만, 여러 대의 카메라는 여전히 바쁘게 돌아가고 있었다. 그리고. 좌석에 앉은 선수들은 평소와는 다르게 잔뜩 긴장한 얼굴을 하고 있었다. “다들 떨리냐?” 진민호 감독이 씨익 웃으며 물었다. 어린 선수들의 긴장을 풀어주기 위한 질문이었다. 다만, 별로 효과는 없었다. 선수들은 기다렸다는 듯 자신들의 생각을 말하기 시작했다. “당연히 떨리죠. 이 경기는 말이 안 돼요. 어떻게 프로선수들이랑 붙을 수가 있어요?” “걱정돼요. 지금까지 대부분 경기에서 좋은 모습을 보여줬는데, 이번에 크게 지면 사람들은 진 것만 기억할 거 같아요.” “상대의 수준이 갑자기 너무 높아졌어요. 그리고 상대는 어른이고, 프로인데 우리보다 손발도 더 많이 맞춰봤잖아요. 이걸 어떻게 이겨요?” “맞아요. 이번 경기에서 이기는 건 무리예요.” 아직 어린 나이지만, 축구 지능이 뛰어난 선수들답게 제법 논리적인 말들로 현 상황을 평가했다. 그런 선수들을 보며, 진민호 감독은 미소를 지으며 말했다. “너희 말들 다 맞아. 근데 이것만큼은 너희도 인정할걸? 이번 경기에서 많은 걸 배울 수 있을 거야.” 비관적인 말을 내뱉던 선수들이 조용해졌다. 감독의 말에 느낀 바가 있던 것이다. 그때, 이택현이 입을 열었다. “감독님 말이 맞아. 우리는 이 경기를 통해서 많은 걸 배울 거야. 그리고 잘들 생각해봐. 이때가 아니면 우리가 언제 프로선수들이랑 붙어보겠어? 이런 기회는 흔치 않아. 물론 프로선수들은 우리보다 조직력이 좋고, 기술도 좋을 거야. 피지컬도 훨씬 강할 거고. 하지만 나는 우리가 이길 수도 있다고 생각해. 상대가 누구든! 승부는 50 대 50이지! 공은 둥글고, 우린 충분히 강하거든.” 팀에서 가장 어린 이택현의 당돌한 말. 그 말에 버스 안의 분위기가 변하기 시작했다. 비관적이던 선수들의 흐리멍덩한 눈빛도 사라졌다. 축구천재 FC 선수들의 눈빛은 이제 날카롭게 빛나고 있었다. 그리고. 조용히 모든 것을 지켜보던 신재욱은 피식 웃어버렸다. 동시에 옆에 앉아있던 이택현의 옆구리를 푹― 찔렀다. “억! 왜 그래?” “야, 내가 했던 말이잖아.” 사실이었다. 방금 이택현이 한 말은 얼마 전에 신재욱이 했던 말과 똑같았다. 다만, 신재욱의 목소리는 매우 작았다. 그냥 재밌고 황당할 뿐이지 이택현을 망신 주고 싶은 생각은 없었으니까. “쫌 멋있더라고. 그래서 가져다가 썼어.” “어 그래…… 당당해서 좋네.” “다음에도 멋진 말 부탁해. 좀 써먹게.” “…그래.” “근데 재욱아.” “왜?” “여기까지 와서 이런 질문하기 좀 그렇지만…… 진짜 할만하다고 생각해?” 이택현의 목소리는 조용했다. 괜히 주변에 들리게 말해서 애써 좋게 만든 분위기에 초를 칠 생각은 없었던 모양이었다. 그런 모습이 신재욱에겐 재밌게 느껴졌다. “이길 자신 있어서 말한 거 아니었어?” “…눈치도 빠른 애가 왜 이래? 분위기 살리려고 했던 거잖아…!” “하하!” 신재욱은 결국 웃음을 터트렸다. “왜 또? 왜 웃는데? 아이 진짜! 왜 웃냐니까? 하! 거참, 이상하게 기분 나쁘네?” “큭큭!” “야 신재욱! 왜 웃냐고오오오!” * * * 버스 안, 선수들이 모두 잠들었을 때. 제작진 측은 진민호 감독에게 작은 목소리로 질문했다. “감독님, 솔직히 말해주실 수 있어요? 이번 경기…… 승산이 있나요?” “예? 승산이요? 없죠.” “아…… 그렇게 단호하게 말씀하실 정도로 승산이 없나요?” “하하! 프로를 어떻게 이겨요. 아까 제가 아이들한테 말했듯이 이번 경기는 배우러 가는 거지, 이기러 가는 게 아니에요. 제작진 측에서는 다 알고 있지 않았나요? 스케줄도 다 직접 짜신 거잖아요?” “저흰 그래도 조금이라도 승산이 있을 줄 알았죠. 또 인천 쪽에서 2군 선수들 위주로 출전시킨다고도 했고요.” “에이, 그래도 못 이겨요. 2군이어도 프로는 프로예요. 수준이 달라요.” “……그렇군요.” 제작진들의 분위기는 좋지 못했다. 스케줄을 짤 때만 해도 그래도 조금이나마 승산이 있다고 생각했었다. 어린 선수들이라고는 하나, 천재들을 모아놓은 ‘축구천재 FC’니까 혹시 모른다고 생각했었다. 만약 이긴다면 시청률은 대박이기에, 해볼 만한 도박이라고 생각했었다. 그러나 승산이 없단다. 다른 사람도 아니고 K리그에서 100경기를 넘게 뛴 진민호 감독의 이야기였다. 어찌 믿지 않을 수가 있겠는가. “큰일인데요? 진민호 감독님이 저렇게 말할 정도면, 정말 수준 차이가 크다는 건데…… 이번 경기 진행했다가 괜히 위에 불려가는 거 아닌가 싶어요.” “어쩔 수 없잖아. 이미 다 잡혔는걸. 당일에 취소할 순 없는 거고, 그냥 강행해야지.” “하…… 걱정이네요. 그냥 우리 애들이 한 골이라도 넣어줬으면 좋겠네요. 그러면 편집으로 어떻게든 아름답게 만들 수 있을 테니까요.” “에휴……! 그러게나 말이다.” 이처럼 제작진들은 ‘축구천재 FC’의 패배를 기정사실화했다. 분위기도 처졌다. 다행히 버스 안에 있던 선수들은 잠에 깊이 빠져들었기에, 이런 분위기를 느끼지 못했다. 단 한 명을 제외하곤. ‘분위기하고는.’ 신재욱은 자고 있지 않았다. 잠은 어젯밤에 충분히 잤고, 더 자기엔 시간이 아까웠다. 그럴 시간에 상대의 전력을 파악하는 게 훨씬 낫다고 생각했다. 그래서 핸드폰으로 인천의 경기를 보고 있었다. 상대를 만나기 전에 필수로 분석을 하는 것. 신재욱의 습관이었다. ‘응원해줘도 모자랄 판에 저게 뭐 하는 거야?’ 신재욱이 인상을 찌푸렸다. 이런 처진 분위기를 좋아하지 않는다. 상대와 붙어보기도 전에 분위기를 이렇게 만든 제작진의 태도도 마음에 들지 않았다. “애들이 자고 있어서 다행이지…… 쯧!” 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 다시 핸드폰의 화면을 바라봤다. 그곳엔 여전히 인천 선수들의 경기가 흘러나오고 있었다. ‘우리가 붙을 사람들은 2군이고, 여기 나오는 선수들은 1군이긴 하지만…… 그래도 뭐, 전술은 거기서 거기일 테니까.’ 인천의 홈구장에 도착할 때까지, 영상은 끊기지 않았다. 그리고 마침내 경기장에 도착했을 때. 축구천재 FC의 어린 선수들은 구장의 규모에 놀라움을 감추지 못했다. “우와~! 여기가 인천의 홈구장이구나! 엄청 큰데?” “그러니까, 되게 좋다! 아~! 나도 얼른 프로선수가 돼서 이런 데서 뛰고 싶다……!” “TV에서 봤을 때랑은 차원이 다르네! 우리가 오늘 이런 곳에서 축구 하는 거야?” “미쳤다! 진짜 미쳤다아!” 이곳저곳 보이는 시설들은 어린 선수들의 눈을 사로잡기엔 충분했다. 다만, 신재욱은 인천의 홈구장에 별로 관심이 없었다. 그만큼은 경기장이 아닌, 다른 곳을 바라보고 있었다. ‘저 사람들이구나.’ 저 멀리서 놀러 나온 것처럼 어슬렁어슬렁 걸어 나오는 선수들. 오늘 상대해야 할 인천의 2군 선수들이었다. 하지만. 신재욱의 시선은 그들보다 더 뒤에서 걸어오고 있는 3명의 선수에게로 향했다. ‘1군 선수들이.’","output":"032 * * * In sports, the skill gap between amateurs and professionals is significant. Naturally, professionals perform better. Of course, there are exceptions like boxing, but most sports follow this rule. Soccer is no exception. The skill gap between professionals and amateurs in soccer is very large. Even if you gather eleven amateur players who are considered top-notch, they usually can't beat a professional team. They might put up a good fight, but they usually can't win. That's the difference between amateurs and professionals in soccer. Perhaps that's why? Yoo Hyuk-soo, the coach of \\"Incheon,\\" a team in the domestic first division league, was very relaxed as they were set to face Soccer Genius FC today. \\"Coach Kim, should we start warming up our players?\\" \\"Yes, Coach. We should at least do some stretching to prevent injuries, just in case.\\" \\"This is something... It feels odd to tell them to warm up against kids who are still in middle school, right?\\" \\"Uhaha! That's true. But the production team is quite cruel. They're pitting kids against a professional team... They should realize that this could undermine the confidence of these budding talents.\\" \\"Do you think the broadcasters care about that? They're just interested in attracting attention and getting good ratings. We just need to play along. Just show a good manner and demonstrate the level difference, and use it as a promotion for our team.\\" Coach Kim, referred to by Yoo Hyuk-soo, nodded in agreement. He thought there was nothing wrong with what was said. However, he believed there was no need to use first-team players. \\"Coach, but...\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"Do we need to field first-team players? It's during the season, wouldn't it be okay to just play with the second team?\\" \\"Coach Kim has a point. But we need to show them off for appearances. If we only field the second team, people will complain.\\" \\"Complain? Why? Because they think we're looking down on the kids?\\" \\"That's right. Coach Kim, didn't you know? TV viewers can be very passionate! If they feel that Soccer Genius FC, which they support, is being disrespected, they'll immediately go to the broadcaster's message board and start hurling insults. It's true. It's especially common in drama series. If they don't like the story, they immediately start a message board terror campaign. Haha! It's a scary world. And such incidents are not good for our club, so it's better not to create such situations.\\" \\"...That makes sense.\\" \\"Right, so we'll just field about three first-team players, and the rest will be from the second team. It'll boost the confidence of the second team players to appear on TV. And then, we can add a few more first-team players in the last 20 minutes of the second half for show.\\" \\"We won't lose if we field mostly second-team players, right...?\\" That's when it happened. Yoo Hyuk-soo's expression changed. The playful look on his face was gone. With a stern face and cold eyes, he glared at the coach. \\"Coach Kim, you're joking, right?\\" \\"I'm, I'm sorry.\\" \\"Isn't the second team also professional? Do you think they would lose to amateur middle schoolers? If you say something reasonable, I can respond, but how can I respond to nonsense? Aren't you a former player too? You're a professional, right? So why are you saying this?\\" \\"...I apologize. I was needlessly worried.\\" \\"Yes, I know Coach Kim cares a lot about our players, but too much worry can actually lower morale.\\" \\"I'll keep that in mind.\\" \\"Alright. Since those Soccer Genius or whatever kids are coming soon, tell our players to start warming up.\\" \\"Yes!\\" Watching the coach run off into the distance, Incheon's Coach Yoo Hyuk-soo leaned back in his chair. There was not a trace of worry on his face. \\"Should I tell them to go easy? If we overwhelm them too much, it might damage the club's image.\\" * * * The match against Incheon, a team in the domestic professional first division league. To participate in the game, the Soccer Genius FC team boarded a large bus. Although they were inside the bus, several cameras were still busily rolling. And. The players seated on the bus had tense faces, unlike usual. \\"Are you all nervous?\\" Director Jin Min-ho asked with a grin, trying to ease the young players' nerves. However, it wasn't very effective. The players began to express their thoughts as if they had been waiting for the opportunity. \\"Of course we're nervous. This match is absurd. How can we compete against professional players?\\" \\"I'm worried. We've shown good performance in most of our matches so far, but if we lose badly this time, people will only remember the loss.\\" \\"The level of the opposition has suddenly become too high. And the opponents are adults and professionals; they've coordinated their movements more than we have. How can we win against that?\\" \\"Right. Winning this match is impossible.\\" Despite their young age, the players, who had exceptional soccer intelligence, logically assessed the current situation. Watching them, Director Jin Min-ho smiled and said. \\"Everything you're saying is correct. But you'll agree with this, won't you? We can learn a lot from this match.\\" The players, who had been voicing their pessimism, fell silent. They realized something from the coach's words. Then, Lee Taek-hyun spoke up. \\"Coach is right. We will learn a lot from this match. And think about it. If not now, when would we ever get to compete against professional players? Opportunities like this are rare. Of course, the professional players will have better organization and skills. They'll be much stronger physically. But I think we can win, no matter who the opponent is! The match is 50-50! The ball is round, and we are strong enough.\\" The bold words of Lee Taek-hyun, the youngest on the team. His words began to change the atmosphere on the bus. The gloomy eyes of the pessimistic players disappeared. The eyes of the Soccer Genius FC players were now sharply shining. And. Shin Jae-wook, who had been quietly observing everything, let out a chuckle. At the same time, he poked Lee Taek-hyun, who was sitting next to him, in the ribs. \\"Ouch! Why did you do that?\\" \\"Hey, that's what I said.\\" It was true. The words Lee Taek-hyun had just spoken were exactly the same as what Shin Jae-wook had said a while ago. However, Shin Jae-wook's voice had been very low. He just found it amusing and absurd; he had no intention of embarrassing Lee Taek-hyun. \\"It sounded cool. So I borrowed it.\\" \\"Oh, that's good... It's confident.\\" \\"Please say something cool next time too. I could use it.\\" \\"...Okay.\\" \\"But Jae-wook.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"I feel a bit awkward asking this now that we've come this far... but do you really think it's doable?\\" Lee Taek-hyun's voice was quiet. It seemed he didn't want to ruin the mood they had worked hard to create by letting others hear. Shin Jae-wook found this amusing. \\"Weren't you confident when you said that?\\" \\"...You're quick-witted, so why are you like this? I was just trying to lift the mood...!\\" \\"Haha!\\" Shin Jae-wook burst into laughter. \\"Why again? Why are you laughing? Ah, really! Why are you laughing? Ha! It's strangely annoying.\\" \\"Kukuk!\\" \\"Hey, Shin Jae-wook! Why are you laughingggg!\\" * * * Inside the bus, when all the players had fallen asleep, the production team quietly asked Director Jin Min-ho. \\"Coach, can you be honest with us? This match... do we have a chance of winning?\\" \\"A chance? No, we don't.\\" \\"Ah... You're so certain that there's no chance?\\" \\"Haha! How can we beat professionals? Like I told the kids earlier, we're going to this match to learn, not to win. Didn't the production team know this? You're the ones who arranged the schedule.\\" \\"We thought there might be a slight chance of winning. And Incheon said they would mainly field second-team players.\\" \\"Ah, but we still can't win. Even if it's the second team, professionals are professionals. The level is different.\\" \\"…I see.\\" The production team's mood was not good. When they were scheduling, they thought there might be a slight chance of winning. They thought that since they had gathered geniuses in 'Soccer Genius FC,' there might be a chance. If they won, the ratings would be a jackpot, so they thought it was a gamble worth taking. But now they were told there was no chance. It was the word of Director Jin Min-ho, who had played over 100 games in the K League. How could they not believe him? \\"This is serious, isn't it? If Director Jin Min-ho is saying that, then the level difference must be huge... I'm worried we might get called up for this.\\" \\"We can't help it. It's all been arranged. We can't cancel on the day, we just have to go through with it.\\" \\"Ah... I'm worried. I just hope our kids can score at least one goal. Then we can make it look good with editing.\\" \\"Ah...! That's what I'm saying.\\" Thus, the production team had already accepted 'Soccer Genius FC's' defeat as a foregone conclusion. The mood had soured. Fortunately, the players on the bus were deep in sleep and did not sense this atmosphere. Except for one. 'What an atmosphere.' Shin Jae-wook was not asleep. He had slept enough the night before, and it felt like a waste of time to sleep more. He thought it was much better to analyze the opponent's strength during that time. So he was watching Incheon's games on his phone. Analyzing the opponent before meeting them was Shin Jae-wook's habit. 'They should be cheering us on, and they're doing this?' Shin Jae-wook frowned. He didn't like such a deflated atmosphere. He also didn't like the production team's attitude for creating such a mood before even facing the opponent. \\"Thank goodness the kids are asleep... Tsk!\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jae-wook looked back at his phone screen. Incheon players' games were still playing on it. 'Even though we'll be facing the second team, and these are first-team players... Well, the tactics will be more or less the same.' The video continued to play until they arrived at Incheon's home stadium. And when they finally arrived at the stadium. The young players of Soccer Genius FC couldn't hide their amazement at the size of the venue. \\"Wow~! This is Incheon's home stadium! It's huge?\\" \\"That's right, it's really nice! Ah~! I want to become a professional player soon and play in places like this...!\\" \\"It's a whole different level from what I saw on TV! Are we really going to play soccer here today?\\" \\"This is crazy! It's really crazy!\\" The facilities they saw here and there were enough to captivate the young players' eyes. However, Shin Jae-wook wasn't very interested in Incheon's home stadium. He was looking elsewhere, not at the stadium. 'Those are the people.' Players who seemed to be strolling leisurely in the distance. They were the second-team players of Incheon, who they would be facing today. But. Shin Jae-wook's gaze was directed towards three players walking behind them. 'The first-team players.'"},{"instruction":"036 * * * “미쳤다……!” 신재욱이 헤벌쭉 웃었다. 경기가 진행 중일 때는 웬만하면 감정을 드러내지 않는 편이지만, 지금은 웃음을 참을 수가 없었다. 눈앞의 메시지들 때문이었다. “정말 미쳤다고……!” 그동안 능력치를 높이기 위해서 얼마나 열심히 살아왔던가! 새벽에 일어나서 산을 탔고, 점심부터 밤늦게까지 훈련을 했다. 훈련엔 성장기에 하기 좋은 맨몸운동도 포함되어 있었다. 더불어 학교에서 쉬는 시간마다 축구 관련 분석과 공부를 해왔다. 그뿐인가? 4교시까지 들어야 하는 수업 시간엔 공부도 제법 열심히 했다. 단숨에 7개의 능력치가 오르는 것을 보니 그동안의 시간이 여러 장면이 되어 신재욱의 머릿속을 스쳤다. “진짜 열심히 살았지.” 분명 힘든 시간이었다. 매일 거의 같은 훈련을 긴 시간 동안 한다는 건 매우 어려운 일이었다. 더군다나 훈련의 강도도 높았다. 가끔 즐겁기도 했지만, 힘들 때가 훨씬 많은 나날이었다. 웬만한 인내심으로는 절대 할 수 없는 일이리라. 신재욱은 그걸 해냈고, 앞으로도 계속해서 해나갈 생각이었다. “60대였던 능력치들도 올랐고, 50대였던 탈압박은 능력치가 2개나 올랐어.” 능력치가 올랐다는 사실은 신재욱에게 큰 힘이 됐다. 심리적으로도 그렇고, 실제로 축구 실력에도 직접적인 힘이 됐다. 그때였다. 이택현이 다가왔다. “신재욱! 내 패스 어땠어? 좋았지? 엄청 좋았지?” “쩔었어.” “역시! 흐흐! 천재는 천재의 패스를 알아본다니까? 네가 딱 패스를 준 순간에 눈치채버렸지. 아, 얘가 원터치로 공을 달라는 거구나! 이후엔 침투할 생각이구나! 딱 알아채고 바로 실행했지 뭐야? 어땠어? 내 플레이 괜찮았지? 그리고 네가 슈팅을 하는 순간에도 나는 상대 수비수를 하나라도 끌어내기 위해서 반대쪽으로 달렸…….” 신재욱은 말이 많은 이택현을 물끄러미 바라봤다. 평소였다면 조용히 좀 하라고 했겠지만… 지금은 그냥 피식 웃어버리며 엄지를 들어 올렸다. 이택현은 인정받을 만한 플레이를 펼쳤으니까. “그래, 네 플레이 최고였어.” “그치? 맞지? 흐흐! 딱 기다려. 오늘 이런 거 300번은 더 할 수 있으니까!” “기대할게.” “오케이! 기대해도 좋아. 그리고 재욱아, 확실히 프로선수들이랑 경기하니까 배우는 게 많은 것 같지 않아?” “많을 수밖에 없지.” “처음엔 뭐가 다를까 했었는데, 막상 붙어보니까 이 순간이 얼마나 소중한 건지 알겠더라고. 그래서 사실 체력적으로 좀 힘들긴 한데, 더 죽어라 뛰어볼 생각이야. 이런 기회는 흔치 않잖아?” 이택현의 눈이 빛나고 있었다. 그의 열정이 얼마나 큰지 훤히 보일 정도였다. 더불어 모든 걸 쏟아붓겠다는 의지까지 드러났다. 그 모습을 본 신재욱은 씨익 웃었다. 바라던 바였으니까. “좋은 생각이야. 안 그래도 나도 그러려고 했거든.” * * * 후반전에 들어서서도. 축구천재 FC는 최선을 다했다. 다만, 후반전의 인천은 전반전보다 더 강했다. 체력 때문이었다. 프로는 실력도 압도적이었지만, 체력으로도 축구천재 FC를 압도했다. ― 축구천재 FC 선수들의 움직임이 전반전보다 느려졌네요. 아무래도 체력적으로 완성되지 않은 어린 선수들이기 때문에, 어쩔 수 없는 일인 것 같습니다. ― 아직은 체력적으로 완성되긴 힘든 나이죠. 그리고 상대가 강할수록 체력은 더 빨리 떨어지게 됩니다. 축구천재 FC의 선수들은 처음으로 프로팀을 상대하는 것이기 때문에 평소보다 체력적으로 훨씬 더 힘들 겁니다. ― 맞습니다. 또, 피지컬이 강한 상대와 붙어도 체력이 쭉쭉 떨어지니까요. 경기는 급격히 기울었다. 인천은 2골이나 허용한 것을 만회하려는 듯, 무자비하게 축구천재 FC의 수비진을 흔들었다. ― 최경훈 선수가 수비에 둘러싸인 상황에서도 여유 있게 볼을 지켜내고 있습니다. 과연 인천의 주전 스트라이커다운 실력이네요. ― 우리 축구천재 FC의 수비수들은 위축될 필요가 없습니다! 최경훈은 K리그에서도 좋은 경기력을 보여주고 있을 정도로 뛰어난 선수거든요. 뚫리더라도, 흔들리더라도, 당당하게 맞붙었으면 좋겠습니다! 해설들은 안타깝다는 듯 어린 선수들을 바라봤다. 이들이 힘을 내서 더 좋은 모습을 보여주길 바랐다. 하지만 바람과 현실은 달랐다. ― 들어갔습니다……! 인천의 골입니다! 이민구가 오늘 첫 골을 터트렸습니다! ― 방금은 인천의 최경훈 선수가 우리 수비수들의 시선을 끈 뒤, 뒤에서 파고드는 이민구에게 너무 좋은 패스를 내줬네요. 클래스가 있는 플레이입니다……! 축구천재 FC는 흔들리는 걸 넘어서 골을 내줬다. 4 대 2. 5 대 2. 어느새 스코어는 6 대 2까지 벌어졌다. “아직은 여기까지구나.” 신재욱이 씁쓸하게 웃었다. 흔들리는 동료 수비수들을 볼 때마다 안타까웠다. 마음 같아선 직접 내려가서 돕고 싶었다. 그러나 현실적으로 불가능했다. 체력 때문이었다. 꾸준히 노력하고 있지만, 워낙 타고난 체력이 좋지 않은 몸이었다. 괜히 수비에 참여한다고 내려갔다간, 좋은 공격 기회를 얻었을 때 체력이 없어서 아무것도 못 하게 될 수도 있다. 공격형 미드필더로 출전한 신재욱이었고 포지션에 맞는 역할이 있었다. 다만. “이대로는 아쉽지.” 신재욱은 이렇게 끝낼 생각이 없었다. “하나는 더 해야지.” 한 골을 더 만들어낼 생각이었다. 하지만 쉬운 일은 아니었다. ― 경기 재개됩니다! 축구천재 FC 선수들, 조금만 더 힘을 내줬으면 좋겠네요! ― 아…… 선수들이 쉽게 전진하지 못하네요. 너무 많은 골을 허용했기 때문일까요? 선수들이 위축되어 있습니다. ― 이럴 때일수록 더 과감하게 전진 패스를 뿌릴 필요가 있습니다! 최소한 팀의 에이스인 신재욱 선수에게까지 만이라도 공을 연결해줘야 합니다! 공이 오질 않았으니까. ‘직접 뺏어야겠네.’ 신재욱은 상대의 공을 뺏는 것에 자신감이 있는 편이었다. 실제로 환생 전에도 세계적인 선수들의 공을 수없이 많이 뺏어냈고, 환생 후에도 여러 번 상대의 공을 뺏어내고 있지 않았던가. 지금까진 전진압박을 자제했었다. 체력 때문이었다. 상대의 공을 뺏기 위해서 덤벼들다 보면 당연히 체력이 빨리 떨어지게 되고, 신재욱은 그런 상황을 경계했었다. 그러나 이젠 자제하지 않을 생각이었다. ‘이쯤 되면 체력에 신경 쓸 때는 아니지.’ 이미 스코어는 2 대 6으로 벌어져 버렸고, 동료들은 전부 지쳐있었으니까. 가만히 있으면 공이 오질 않는 상황이니까. ― 신재욱이 전방압박을 하네요! 가진 체력이 얼마 남지 않았을 텐데, 모든 걸 쏟아낼 생각인 것 같습니다! ― 승부욕이 굉장히 강한 선수거든요. 상대가 누가 됐든 이기려고 하는 선수가 신재욱입니다. 지금도 어떻게든 이기기 위해서 최선을 다하는 것으로 보입니다! 신재욱은 공을 잡은 선수를 압박했다. 다만 혼자만의 힘으론 부족했다. 상대가 아마추어면 모를까, 프로선수들이었으니까. 동료의 도움이 필요했다. “이택현!” “오케이! 알아들었어!” 신재욱의 외침에 이택현이 씨익 웃으며 대답했다. 평소 매일같이 호흡을 맞춰온 사이였기에, 이택현은 기다렸다는 듯 움직였다. ― 이택현이 신재욱을 도와 인천의 미드필더 배윤재를 압박하고 있습니다! 정확히는 배윤재가 패스할 공간을 막고 있죠! 이러면 배윤재는 개인 기량으로 탈압박을 시도할 가능성이 높습니다! 그게 바로 신재욱이 바라는 것일 거고요! 해설들의 말 그대로였다. 강한 압박을 받은 배윤재는 동료를 찾았지만, 패스할 공간이 보이지 않았다. 이택현이 영리하게 공간을 막아섰기 때문이었다. ‘칫! 어린 녀석들이 제법이네.’ 배윤재는 재밌다는 듯 웃었다. 두 명의 소년의 플레이가 좋긴 했지만, 자신은 프로였다. 그는 프로와 아마추어 사이의 벽은 매우 높다는 걸 알고 있었다. ‘패스 안 해도 돼. 그냥 얠 상대해줄게.’ 배윤재는 가까운 곳에서 압박을 넣는 신재욱을 힐끗 바라봤다. ‘놀라울 정도로 잘하긴 해.’ 대단한 소년이라는 걸 인정할 수밖에 없었다. 프로를 상대로 위축되지 않았고, 정말로 이기려고 하는 모습이 놀라웠다. 더군다나 실력도 뛰어났다. ‘운동능력이 좋아 보이진 않지만, 신기하게 공을 꽤 잘 다룬단 말이야? 그리고 판단력이 너무 좋아. 판단력만큼은 베테랑 선수라고 해도 믿겠어.’ 그러나. 거기까지였다. 아마추어는 아마추어일 뿐이었다. 비록 선제골을 허용할 때, 신재욱의 태클에 공을 뺏겼었지만. 그건 방심했기 때문이라고 믿었다. 배윤재는 여전히 자신감이 넘쳤다. 신재욱의 압박 따위는 이겨낼 수 있다고 확신했다. 그것도 별로 어렵지 않게. ‘더 커서 와라. 꼬맹아.’ 하지만 그 확신이 착각이었다는 것을 깨닫는 데에는 오랜 시간이 걸리지 않았다. 툭! “어…?” 배윤재가 멍하니 공을 바라봤다. 방금까지 자신이 가지고 있던 공이 어느새 신재욱의 소유가 되어 있었다. “뭐, 뭐야?” 분명 실수는 없었다. 현란한 상체 페인팅을 썼고, 엇박자 타이밍에 돌파를 시도했다. 1군 선수들에게도 통했었던 기술이었다. 겨우 중학교 1학년에 다니는 어린애한테 통하지 않을 리가 없었다. 그럴 리가 없다고 믿었었는데. “어떻게 이럴 수가 있냐고……!” 공을 뺏겨버렸다. 중학교 1학년의 어린애에게. 그것도 너무 쉽게. ― 신재욱이 공을 뺏어냈습니다! 이제 공은 축구천재 FC의 소유가 됩니다! 좋은 역습 기회를 만들어낸 축구천재 FC! 과연 이 기회를 살려낼 수 있을까요? 해설이 기대감을 드러냈다. 더불어 경기장에 있던 축구천재 FC의 선수들도 간절함이 담긴 눈으로 신재욱의 뒷모습을 바라봤다. 이들 모두 승패는 사실상 갈렸다는 걸 알고 있었다. 때문에, 신재욱이 팀의 자존심만큼은 살려주길 바라고 있었다. ‘재욱아, 제발 골 넣어줘……!’ ‘넌 할 수 있어! 우리의 에이스잖아?’ ‘보여줘, 제발! 신재욱 너라면 충분히 할 수 있어!’ 이처럼 모두의 기대를 받는 상황에서. 신재욱이 전진했다. 공을 앞으로 툭툭― 치며 나아갔다. 빠르진 않지만, 언제든지 방향을 전환할 수 있는 드리블이었다. 인천의 선수 2명이 다가왔다. 한 명은 인천에서 1군으로 뛰는 수비형 미드필더 마석희. 다른 한 명은 2군이지만 대인마크 능력이 좋은 중앙수비수 강재운. 둘 중 쉬운 상대는 없다. 만약 저 둘이 매우 좋은 호흡을 보이며 동시에 덤빈다면 뚫는 게 거의 불가능할 것이다. 아주 좋은 컨디션이라면 모를까, 지금의 신재욱은 매우 낮은 능력치를 지닌 몸을 지녔으니까. 게다가 지쳐있으니까. ‘쉽진 않을 거야. 근데 또 아예 불가능한 것도 아니지.’ 그나마 다행인 건 저들도 지쳐있다는 것. 아무리 프로라고 해도 후반전에는 힘들기 마련이었고, 실제로 저들의 내뱉는 숨은 거칠었고 유니폼은 땀으로 흠뻑 젖어있었다. 하지만 그렇다고 해도. 저들을 뚫고 들어가는 건 매우 힘든 일이다. 그래서. ‘그냥 쉽게 가자.’ 신재욱은 쉬운 길을 선택했다.","output":"036 * * * \\"This is crazy...!\\" Shin Jae-wook laughed heartily. He usually refrained from showing his emotions during a game, but now he couldn't help but laugh. It was because of the messages before his eyes. \\"Really, this is insane...!\\" How hard had he worked to raise his stats until now! He had woken up at dawn to climb mountains and trained from lunch until late at night. His training included bodyweight exercises suitable for his growth period. In addition, he had been analyzing and studying soccer during every break at school. Was that all? He had also studied quite diligently during class hours, which lasted until the fourth period. Seeing seven of his stats rise at once, various scenes from his past efforts flashed through Shin Jae-wook's mind. \\"I really lived diligently.\\" It was undoubtedly a tough time. It was very difficult to do almost the same training for long hours every day. Moreover, the intensity of the training was high. There were occasional enjoyable moments, but there were far more days filled with hardship. It was something that could not be done with just any level of patience. Shin Jae-wook had accomplished it and planned to continue doing so in the future. \\"The stats that were in the 60s have risen, and the 'Dribbling' stat, which was in the 50s, has increased by 2.\\" The fact that his stats had increased was a great source of strength for Shin Jae-wook. It was a psychological boost, and it directly enhanced his soccer skills. That's when Lee Taek-hyun approached him. \\"Shin Jae-wook! How was my pass? It was good, right? It was really good, wasn't it?\\" \\"It was awesome.\\" \\"Exactly! Haha! A genius recognizes the pass of another genius, right? The moment you passed the ball, I realized it. Ah, he wants a one-touch pass! He's planning to make a run! I caught on immediately and executed it, right? How was it? My play was good, wasn't it? And even when you were shooting, I ran to the opposite side to draw away at least one of the opposing defenders...\\" Shin Jae-wook gazed at the talkative Lee Taek-hyun. Normally, he would have told him to be quiet... but now he just chuckled and gave a thumbs up. Lee Taek-hyun had performed well enough to deserve recognition. \\"Yeah, your play was the best.\\" \\"Right? I knew it! Haha! Just wait. I can do this 300 more times today!\\" \\"I'll look forward to it.\\" \\"Okay! You can expect great things. And Jae-wook, don't you think we're learning a lot from playing against professional players?\\" \\"We have to.\\" \\"At first, I wondered how different it could be, but now that we're actually facing them, I realize how precious this moment is. So, even though I'm physically tired, I'm planning to run even harder. Opportunities like this aren't common, right?\\" Lee Taek-hyun's eyes were shining. His passion was so evident that it was clear how much he was willing to give. Shin Jae-wook smiled at this sight. It was exactly what he had hoped for. \\"That's a good idea. I was planning to do the same.\\" * * * Even into the second half. Soccer Genius FC gave their all. However, Incheon in the second half was stronger than in the first. It was because of stamina. Professionals were not only overwhelmingly skilled, but they also outmatched Soccer Genius FC in terms of physical fitness. ― The movement of Soccer Genius FC players has slowed down compared to the first half. It seems inevitable since they are young players who haven't fully developed their stamina yet. ― They are at an age where it's difficult to be fully developed in terms of stamina. And the stronger the opponent, the faster the stamina drops. Since Soccer Genius FC players are facing a professional team for the first time, they will be much more physically challenged than usual. ― Right, and when facing physically strong opponents, stamina drops quickly. The game tilted rapidly. Incheon, having conceded two goals, mercilessly shook the defense of Soccer Genius FC to make up for it. ― Choi Kyung-hoon is keeping the ball with ease even when surrounded by defenders. Truly the skill of Incheon's main striker. ― Our Soccer Genius FC defenders don't need to be discouraged! Choi Kyung-hoon is a player who shows good performance even in the K League. Even if they get breached, even if they get shaken, I hope they face it with confidence! The commentators looked at the young players with sympathy, hoping they would muster their strength and show a better performance. But hope and reality were different. ― It's in...! Goal for Incheon! Lee Min-gu has scored his first goal of the day! ― Just now, Incheon's Choi Kyung-hoon drew the attention of our defenders and then gave a great pass to Lee Min-gu, who was breaking through from behind. That's a classy play... Soccer Genius FC not only wavered but conceded a goal. 4 to 2. 5 to 2. Before long, the score had widened to 6 to 2. \\"This is as far as we go.\\" Shin Jae-wook smiled bitterly. He felt sorry every time he saw his teammates' defense falter. He wanted to go down and help them, but it was realistically impossible. It was because of stamina. Despite his continuous efforts, he naturally didn't have good physical fitness. If he went down to participate in the defense, he might not have the stamina for a good offensive opportunity when it arose. Shin Jae-wook had started as an attacking midfielder and had a role to play according to his position. However. \\"It would be a shame to end it like this.\\" Shin Jae-wook had no intention of letting it end this way. \\"I have to score at least one more.\\" He intended to create another goal. But it wasn't going to be easy. ― The game resumes! Soccer Genius FC players, just a little more effort, please! ― Ah... The players can't advance easily. Is it because they've conceded too many goals? The players are intimidated. ― At times like this, they need to be more daring with forward passes! At the very least, they need to connect the ball to Shin Jae-wook, the team's ace! The ball wasn't coming to him. 'I'll have to steal it myself.' Shin Jae-wook was confident in stealing the ball from the opponent. In fact, before his reincarnation, he had stolen the ball countless times from world-class players, and even after reincarnation, he had repeatedly taken the ball from opponents. Until now, he had restrained himself from pressing forward. It was because of stamina. If he rushed to steal the ball, his stamina would naturally drop quickly, and Shin Jae-wook had been wary of such situations. But now, he had no intention of holding back. 'At this point, it's not the time to worry about stamina.' The score had already widened to 2 to 6, and all his teammates were exhausted. If he just stood still, the ball wouldn't come to him. ― Shin Jae-wook is pressing forward! He must be planning to give his all, considering there's not much stamina left! ― He's a player with a very strong will to win. No matter who the opponent is, Shin Jae-wook tries to win. Even now, he seems to be doing his best to win! Shin Jae-wook pressured the player with the ball. However, his efforts alone were not enough. The opponent wasn't an amateur, but a professional. He needed help from his teammates. \\"Lee Taek-hyun!\\" \\"Okay! I got it!\\" Responding to Shin Jae-wook's call, Lee Taek-hyun grinned and moved as if he had been waiting for the signal. Having practiced their coordination every day, Lee Taek-hyun moved immediately. ― Lee Taek-hyun is helping Shin Jae-wook pressure Incheon's midfielder Bae Yoon-jae! Precisely, he's blocking the space where Bae Yoon-jae could pass! If this continues, Bae Yoon-jae is likely to attempt to dribble out of pressure! That's exactly what Shin Jae-wook is hoping for! Just as the commentators said, Bae Yoon-jae, under strong pressure, looked for a teammate but couldn't find space to pass. Lee Taek-hyun cleverly blocked the space. 'Tsk! These kids are pretty good.' Bae Yoon-jae smiled as if amused. The play of the two boys was impressive, but he was a professional. He knew the wall between professionals and amateurs was very high. 'I don't need to pass. I'll just deal with this kid.' Bae Yoon-jae glanced at Shin Jae-wook, who was pressing him closely. 'He's surprisingly good.' He had to admit the boy was remarkable. He wasn't intimidated by professionals and was genuinely trying to win. Moreover, his skills were excellent. 'He doesn't seem to have great athletic ability, but strangely, he handles the ball quite well. And his judgment is too good. I would believe it if you said his judgment is that of a veteran player.' However. That was as far as it went. An amateur was just an amateur. Although he had lost the ball to Shin Jae-wook's tackle when conceding the first goal. He believed it was because he had been careless. Bae Yoon-jae was still confident. He was sure he could overcome Shin Jae-wook's pressure. And it wouldn't be too difficult. 'Come back when you're bigger, kid.' But it didn't take long for him to realize that his confidence was a mistake. Tap! \\"Huh...?\\" Bae Yoon-jae stared blankly at the ball. The ball he had been holding just a moment ago was now in Shin Jae-wook's possession. \\"What, what?\\" There was no mistake. He had used a flashy upper body feint and attempted to break through with an off-beat timing. It was a technique that had worked against first-team players. There was no way it wouldn't work against a mere first-year middle schooler. He had believed it was impossible. \\"How can this be...!\\" He had lost the ball. To a first-year middle schooler. And far too easily. ― Shin Jae-wook has stolen the ball! Now the ball is in the possession of Soccer Genius FC! A good counter-attack opportunity created by Soccer Genius FC! Can they capitalize on this chance? The commentator expressed anticipation. Additionally, the players of Soccer Genius FC in the stadium looked at Shin Jae-wook's back with desperate eyes. They all knew that the outcome of the match was practically decided. Therefore, they hoped Shin Jae-wook would at least save the team's pride. 'Jae-wook, please score a goal...!' 'You can do it! You're our ace, right?' 'Show us, please! You can definitely do it, Shin Jae-wook!' In such a situation, with everyone's expectations on him. Shin Jae-wook advanced. He nudged the ball forward with light touches. It wasn't fast, but it was a dribble that could change direction at any moment. Two players from Incheon approached him. One was Ma Seok-hee, a defensive midfielder who played in the first team for Incheon. The other was Kang Jae-woon, a second-team central defender known for his good man-marking ability. Neither was an easy opponent. If the two showed very good coordination and attacked simultaneously, it would be almost impossible to break through. Unless he was in very good condition, but Shin Jae-wook's current body had very low stats. And he was tired. 'It won't be easy. But it's not entirely impossible either.' Fortunately, they were also tired. No matter how professional they were, they were bound to be tired in the second half, and indeed, their breathing was rough, and their uniforms were soaked with sweat. But even so. Breaking through them was going to be very difficult. So. 'Let's just take the easy way.' Shin Jae-wook chose the easy path."},{"instruction":"i want to find to best order to teach a general chemistry curriculum. If i look at multiple textbooks and find the order that they go through am i likely to find a good order?","output":"Looking at multiple general chemistry textbooks can indeed provide a good starting point for determining the order in which to teach a chemistry curriculum. Many textbooks are organized based on pedagogical research and the collective experience of educators in the field of chemistry. By examining the structure of several well-regarded textbooks, you can identify common patterns and sequences that reflect a logical progression of concepts building upon one another. Here are some typical topics in the order they are often presented in general chemistry curricula: 1. Introduction to Chemistry - The scientific method - Measurement and units - The structure of matter 2. Atoms and Elements - Atomic theory and historical perspectives - Atomic structure and the periodic table - Periodic trends 3. Compounds and Stoichiometry - Chemical bonding (ionic, covalent) - Naming and writing formulas for compounds - Chemical reactions and stoichiometry - Limiting reactants and percent yield 4. Thermochemistry - Energy, work, and heat - The first law of thermodynamics - Enthalpy and calorimetry 5. Quantum Theory and Electronic Structure - Quantum mechanics - Electron configurations - Orbital shapes and their energies 6. Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry - Valence bond theory and hybridization - Molecular orbital theory - VSEPR theory and molecular shape 7. Gases - Gas laws - Kinetic molecular theory - Partial pressures and gas mixtures 8. Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces - The states of matter - Phase changes and phase diagrams - Types of intermolecular forces 9. Solutions and Colligative Properties - Solubility and concentration units - Colligative properties (boiling point elevation, freezing point depression) 10. Chemical Kinetics - Reaction rates - Rate laws - Reaction mechanisms - Catalysts 11. Chemical Equilibrium - The concept of equilibrium - The equilibrium constant - Le Châtelier's principle 12. Acids and Bases - Definitions of acids and bases - Acid-base reactions - pH and pOH - Acid-base titrations - Buffer solutions 13. Thermodynamics - The second and third laws of thermodynamics - Gibbs free energy - Spontaneity and equilibrium 14. Electrochemistry - Redox reactions - Electrochemical cells and standard potentials - Batteries and fuel cells - Electrolysis 15. Nuclear Chemistry (sometimes covered) - Types of radioactivity - Nuclear reactions - Applications of nuclear chemistry When analyzing the textbooks, consider any special emphases or themes in your curriculum that might necessitate reordering some topics. Additionally, the background and interests of your students can influence which order makes the most sense. For example, certain schools or programs with a strong emphasis on physical sciences might introduce quantum theory earlier than a program with a focus on life sciences. While established textbooks can offer excellent guidance, it's important to remember that they are not the only resource. Supplementing textbook knowledge with educational standards, such as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) or the American Chemical Society (ACS) guidelines for chemistry education, can also help in structuring an effective curriculum. Furthermore, consider integrating modern pedagogical approaches such as inquiry-based learning or context-based chemistry to enhance students' understanding and maintain their interest in the subject."},{"instruction":"this is for ap chemistry plannning","output":"For AP Chemistry, the College Board provides a detailed course framework outlining what students should know and be able to do by the end of the course. This framework will be your primary reference when planning your curriculum, as it's specifically designed to prepare students for the AP Chemistry exam. The sequence in which topics are presented in AP Chemistry can vary, but the course typically follows a structured approach that aligns with the big ideas and learning objectives laid out by the College Board.

Additionally, it's important to include practice AP exam questions throughout the year to familiarize students with the exam format and question styles. Remember that AP courses are college-level classes; pacing and depth of understanding are crucial. Spend time on challenging topics and encourage students to develop a deep understanding of the underlying principles, not just memorize facts. Finally, to ensure you're up to date with the best sequence or any recent changes to the curriculum, frequently check the College Board's resources for AP Chemistry teachers. Sometimes they provide updated planning guides, unit modules, or professional development opportunities that might influence how you structure your course."},{"instruction":"i don't like the way the college organizes the course","output":"If you find that the organization of the AP Chemistry course by the College Board doesn't align with your teaching philosophy or you think a different order would be better suited for your students, you do have some flexibility in how you plan and organize the course content. However, remember that your students will be assessed based on the AP Chemistry exam, so it's important that by the end of the course, they have covered all the material outlined in the AP Chemistry Course and Exam Description (CED). When reorganizing the curriculum, consider the following points to ensure that you still meet the necessary standards: 1. **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Rearrange topics in a way that ensures that foundational concepts are taught before more advanced topics that require understanding of these foundations. 2. **Logical Progression**: Each topic in chemistry builds on preceding topics. Structure your course so that students understand the connections between concepts and can apply previously learned material to new content. 3. **Integration of Big Ideas**: AP Chemistry is structured around six big ideas. Whatever order you choose, make sure that these big ideas are interwoven throughout the course to facilitate a deeper understanding of chemistry as a coherent and interconnected discipline. 4. **Practice and Assessment**: Include regular opportunities for students to practice AP-style questions and labs that align with the topics covered at that point in the course. This helps students apply their knowledge in the context of the AP exam's format. 5. **Lab Work**: The AP Chemistry course requires a minimum of 16 hands-on lab investigations. Make sure that your course schedule includes these labs at appropriate times to reinforce the material covered in lectures. 6. **Review and Reinforcement**: Build in time to review previous topics and tie them into current lessons. This can help reinforce learning and show students the interconnectedness of different chemistry concepts. 7. **Flexibility for Depth**: Allow time for going deeper into certain topics that are of particular interest to your students or that you believe are critical for their understanding of chemistry. 8. **Alignment with Standards**: Even if you reorder the topics, you must still ensure that all standards and learning objectives specified in the AP Chemistry framework are met. Considering these points, you might find an alternative sequence that works better for you and your students. Here's an example of a restructured AP Chemistry curriculum order that some instructors might use: 1. Chemical Foundations (measurement, significant figures, element names and symbols, atomic structure) 2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity (including basic quantum mechanics) 3. Stoichiometry (including balancing equations, molarity, and gas laws) 4. Types of Chemical Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry 5. Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 6. Advanced Theories of Bonding (VSEPR, hybridization, MO theory) 7. Intermolecular Forces and Properties of Solids and Liquids 8. Thermochemistry 9. Chemical Kinetics 10. Chemical Equilibrium 11. Acid-Base Equilibria 12. Advanced Topics in Equilibrium (buffers, solubility equilibria) 13. Thermodynamics (entropy, free energy) 14. Electrochemistry Remember to communicate any modifications to the course structure to your students at the beginning of the year, and explain how your sequence will still prepare them for the AP exam. You should also consult with other AP Chemistry teachers or educational experts if you are making significant changes, to ensure that your approach is still effective for student learning and success on the AP exam."},{"instruction":"most expert teacher who teach ap chem don't use the college board's format to teach the material, the ussually follow a text books order's while teaching the necessary content","output":"Yes, you're correct that many seasoned AP Chemistry teachers choose to structure their courses in a way that deviates from the College Board's format, often utilizing a textbook's sequence as a guide while ensuring all the required AP content is covered. Textbooks tend to offer a tried and tested progression of topics that build on one another in a way that educators have refined over the years, making this approach highly effective for many instructors. When using a textbook's order, consider the following strategies to ensure comprehensive AP exam preparation: 1. **Cross-reference AP Curriculum**: Regularly cross-reference the textbook topics with the AP Chemistry CED to ensure that all learning objectives are being met. Make sure that students are familiar with the format and types of questions that will appear on the AP exam. 2. **Focus on AP Exam Skills**: Throughout the course, emphasize the skills and practices that students will need to demonstrate on the AP exam, including inquiry, data analysis, and evaluation of evidence. 3. **AP Exam Practice**: Integrate AP style questions and practice exams throughout the course, linked to the textbook topics as you cover them. 4. **Lab Work**: Textbook lab activities may not all align with the inquiry-based labs required for AP Chemistry. Ensure that you incorporate the recommended AP lab investigations at appropriate points throughout the year. 5. **Review and Synthesis**: Plan for review sessions that explicitly connect the textbook material to the structure of the AP exam. Highlight how the big ideas and science practices interconnect within the textbook topics. 6. **In-Depth Understanding**: Take advantage of the textbook organization to explore topics in greater depth and context than might be presented in the AP framework, which can lead to a more profound understanding for students. 7. **Supplementing Material**: If your textbook lacks in certain areas of the AP curriculum, find supplemental materials to cover any gaps or to provide additional practice for AP-style questions and lab activities. 8. **Flexible Pacing**: Adjust the pace of instruction based on the strengths and needs of your students, while making sure to cover all necessary material well before the AP exam date to allow for ample review time. In conclusion, while many expert AP Chemistry teachers may use a textbook's order, they do so while integrating AP-specific skills, practices, and assessments. The key to success is to address all AP curriculum requirements while using the textbook as a guiding structure for content delivery. This provides a balanced approach, ensuring that students are well-prepared to tackle the AP Chemistry exam while also gaining a deep understanding of the subject matter."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

There are various factors to consider. One argument is that aiming for the bottom corner is statistically better because it is more difficult for a goalkeeper to reach low shots quickly due to the shorter reaction time. This theory suggests that shots aimed low have a higher chance of success. On the other hand, some argue that aiming for the top corner is statistically better because it is harder for goalkeepers to reach high shots, especially if they are well-placed in the corner. Shots aimed high and accurately increase the chance of scoring. Ultimately, the effectiveness of aiming for a particular corner depends on different variables such as the goalkeeper's skill level, positioning, anticipation, the player's ability to execute the shot, and their confidence. Additionally, goalkeepers may have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to saving penalties. It is important for players to practice and develop their technique, accuracy, and ability to read the goalkeeper before deciding on a preferred corner to aim for."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here’s the full HoverBoardControl script updated to correctly handle the invocation of StartGrinding with the right number of arguments based on the information you’ve provided: Then you crashed","output":"I apologize for the inconvenience earlier. It seems that the \`StartGrinding\` method is expected to have a different number of parameters than what's being passed. Here is how you could modify the call to \`StartGrinding\` to match the expected parameters in your \`HoverboardGrindController\` class. Let's assume \`StartGrinding\` expects a single parameter of type \`GrindableSurface\`: \`\`\`csharp if (Input.GetKeyDown(grindKey)) { // Correctly get the nearest surface as a GrindableSurface object GrindableSurface nearestSurface = hoverboardGrindController.FindClosestGrindableSurface(); if (nearestSurface != null) { // Trigger the StartGrinding with the correct number of parameters hoverboardGrindController.StartGrinding(nearestSurface); } } \`\`\` Remove any additional arguments in the call to \`StartGrinding\` that are not required. If the method signature was erroneously changed and the \`HoverboardGrindController\` expects parameters such as the position and velocity, then you would need to adjust the method signature and invocation to match that expected by the class, like so: \`\`\`csharp // In HoverboardGrindController, the StartGrinding method could be declared like this: public void StartGrinding(GrindableSurface surface, Vector3 position, Vector3 velocity) { // Implementation of StartGrinding } // And then you would call it with: hoverboardGrindController.StartGrinding(nearestSurface, transform.position, rb.velocity); \`\`\` Ensure both the method declaration in \`HoverboardGrindController\` and the call in \`HoverBoardControl\` are consistent with each other's parameters. Please note that the actual implementation of the \`StartGrinding\` method and its parameters will depend on your project's specific needs and the \`HoverboardGrindController\` script which wasn't provided. You'll need to check the 'HoverboardGrindController\` script to verify the expected parameters and adapt your call accordingly."},{"instruction":"here is your earlier answer, can you confirm this will work? The error CS1501 indicates that we are calling the StartGrinding method with an incorrect number of arguments. Based on the HoverboardGrindController class you provided, the StartGrinding method takes only a single argument (GrindableSurface grindSurface). Here’s the updated section of the HoverBoardControl script to correctly call StartGrinding without additional arguments: // … (other parts of the HoverBoardControl class) private void Update() { if (!hoverboardGrindController.isGrinding) { // Handle all the movement and input when not grinding // … } else { // While grinding, you can handle operations that should occur irrespective of movement, // such as score updates or grind balance UI handling. } // Grinding logic should not be in the HoverBoardControl script since grinding is now handled entirely // by the HoverboardGrindController script based on the inputs described there. } // … (other parts of the HoverBoardControl class) private void FixedUpdate() { if (!hoverboardGrindController.isGrinding) { ApplyHover(); ApplyMovement(); ApplyTurning(); } // Otherwise, no movement is applied, as the grinding logic is in the HoverboardGrindController. } // … (other parts of the HoverBoardControl class) By removing the code related to grinding inputs from the HoverBoardControl script, we’ve corrected the responsibility of each script to ensure they no longer overlap. The hoverboard control script takes care of movement and navigation input, while the hoverboard grind controller script is now solely responsible for handling the grinding state, including the initiation and termination of grinding. Ensure that the updated scripts correctly correspond to your game mechanics and check that there are no further overlaps or conflicts between the control logic in each script. If the error persists, verify that you’re not calling StartGrinding anywhere else with the incorrect number of arguments.","output":"Based on the error message CS1501 and the context provided, it's clear that the \`StartGrinding\` method is being called with an incorrect number of arguments. However, the details provided in your recent message and the initial scenario are diverging in terms of the method's signature. The error indicates that \`StartGrinding\` does not take 3 arguments but it seems like a single argument is expected based on your last message. If \`StartGrinding\` in the \`HoverboardGrindController\` class indeed takes only a single \`GrindableSurface\` parameter, then the call to start grinding should look like this: \`\`\`csharp if (Input.GetKeyDown(grindKey)) { GrindableSurface nearestSurface = hoverboardGrindController.FindClosestGrindableSurface(); if (nearestSurface != null) { hoverboardGrindController.StartGrinding(nearestSurface); } } \`\`\` If you previously attempted to call \`StartGrinding\` with three arguments (surface, position, and velocity), then you need to ensure the method signature in the \`HoverboardGrindController\` class matches that call: \`\`\`csharp // The method signature inside HoverboardGrindController should then match: public void StartGrinding(GrindableSurface surface, Vector3 position, Vector3 velocity) { // implementation details } \`\`\` You suggested that I provided you with an updated script portion in a previous response, which had removed the grinding logic from \`Update\` and deferred it to the \`HoverboardGrindController\`. This is a design decision that simplifies the responsibilities of each script: - \`HoverBoardControl\` manages the board's movement when not grinding. - \`HoverboardGrindController\` takes care of initiating and maintaining the grinding state. This design is a good approach and will help reduce complexity in your scripts, making them more maintainable. To reiterate, it's essential to match the method call with the signature of the method you're calling. To solve the problem: 1. Review the \`HoverboardGrindController\` class and note down the exact parameters required for \`StartGrinding\`. 2. Update the call in \`HoverBoardControl\` to provide the correct arguments as defined in \`HoverboardGrindController\`. These steps should resolve the CS1501 error.

Given the scripts you've shared, it looks like you want your \`HoverBoardControl\` script to handle the board's movement and interaction with grindable surfaces via the \`HoverboardGrindController\`. The \`HoverboardGrindController\` script handles grinding-specific logic and has methods to start and end grinding.

(rest of the script remains unchanged) ... */ \`\`\` With these changes, the script should now work without the previous error messages you encountered. Remember that you need to ensure all other parts of your scripts interact correctly and that you have the necessary assets and components (like HUD, TrickManager, and GrindableSurface scripts/objects) exist within your project. Also, the \`ScoreText\` prefab must be located in the \\"Resources\\" folder for the \`scoreText\` initialization in the \`Start\` method to work without errors. If you don't have the prefab there, the code will hit the error message in the \`else\` block.

The line number provided (151) points to a closing brace \`}\`, which indicates the actual null reference might be happening on the line(s) just above it within the same code block. Without seeing the exact surrounding code, I'm going to make an educated guess that the null reference might be occurring with one of the following objects used within the \`Update\` method: - \`rb\` (the \`Rigidbody\` component) - \`hud\` (the \`HUD\` component) - \`scoreText\` (the \`Text\` UI component) - \`hoverboardGrindController\` (the \`HoverboardGrindController\` component) - \`nearestSurface\` (the \`GrindableSurface\` object returned from \`FindClosestGrindableSurface\`) It's important to ensure that: - All components that are being referenced in the script are assigned. This is typically done through the Unity Inspector or via \`GetComponent\` calls. - All references being accessed are definitely not null before trying to use them, particularly when dealing with inputs and GameObjects which are dynamically instantiated or found.

The issue might stem from other parts of your code or from the state of the \`HUD\` object or other components within your Unity scene at runtime. Let's go through some basic troubleshooting to identify and resolve the issue: 1. Check for Assigned References: Make sure that all necessary references (\`hud\` and \`scoreText\`, in particular) are assigned correctly in the inspector or through a script. If any of these are not set, you'll encounter a \`NullReferenceException\` when trying to use them. 2. Initialize \`hud.BoostInt\`: Ensure that \`hud.BoostInt\` is initialized to some value before it is used. If your \`HUD\` script or object isn't properly set up and \`BoostInt\` isn't assigned a default value, subtracting from it could throw a \`NullReferenceException\`. 3. Check the \`boostKey\` Press Handling: The logic which changes \`forwardAcceleration\` and \`backwardAcceleration\` should work fine, assuming \`boostKey\` is set correctly. However, make sure that \`forwardAcceleration\` and \`backwardAcceleration\` are non-zero before dividing by \`boostMultiplier\`, or else you could end up with incorrect values. (Division by zero wouldn't cause a \`NullReferenceException\`, but it's good practice to verify your math logic.) 4. Inspect \`hud.BoostInt\` Behavior: Check if the \`hud.BoostInt\` property getter involves any logic that may result in a \`NullReferenceException\`. If the getter assumes the existence of another component or variable that might be \`null\`, this assumption could be the cause of the exception you're seeing. 5. Isolate and Debug: Try commenting out blocks of code or adding more detailed \`Debug.Log\` statements get a clearer picture of where exactly the null reference is occurring. This can help pinpoint the issue if it's not obvious from the provided snippet alone. Here's an additional check in your \`Update\` method to ensure safety against nulls and avoid attempting to decrement \`hud.BoostInt\` when \`hud\` is null: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { if (Input.GetKeyDown(boostKey)) { forwardAcceleration *= boostMultiplier; backwardAcceleration *= boostMultiplier; } else if (Input.GetKeyUp(boostKey)) { forwardAcceleration /= boostMultiplier; backwardAcceleration /= boostMultiplier; } if (hud != null) { if (hud.BoostInt > 0 && Input.GetKey(boostKey)) { hud.BoostInt -= 0.2f; } } else { Debug.LogError(\\"HUD component not found.\\", this); } if (scoreText) { scoreText.text = \\"Score: \\" + currentScore.ToString(); } else { Debug.LogError(\\"Score Text UI component not assigned.\\", this); } // ... Rest of the Update method ... } \`\`\` These checks should make your script safer against null references.

\\"80:80\\" volumes: - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html - ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d depends_on: - php networks: - webnet php: image: php:7.4-fpm volumes: - ./html:/var/www/html networks: - webnet networks: webnet: \`\`\` 在这个配置中： - \`webserver\`使用了最新版本的\`nginx\`镜像，将本地的\`./html\`目录挂载到了容器内的\`/usr/share/nginx/html\`，使之成为Nginx的根目录，同时将本地的\`./nginx/conf.d\`目录挂载到\`/etc/nginx/conf.d\`以便自定义配置。 - \`php\`则使用了PHP 7.4的FPM镜像，并且将同样的代码目录\`./html\`挂载到了\`/var/www/html\`。 - \`networks\`部分定义了一个网络\`webnet\`，它使两个服务（容器）能够内部通信。 3. 运行Docker Compose 在包含\`docker-compose.yml\`文件的目录内，运行以下命令来启动你的Web开发环境： \`\`\`bash docker-compose up -d \`\`\` 这个命令会后台运行（由于\`-d\`参数），会下载必要的镜像，创建定义的网络，并启动所有的服务。 4. 访问Web服务 一旦容器启动，你应该可以通过访问本机的\`http://localhost\`或者\`http://localhost:80\`来查看你的web页面。 5. 停止和清理环境 当你完成开发工作后，可以简单地停止和移除所有相关的容器： \`\`\`bash docker-compose down \`\`\` 注意：根据你的具体需求，可能需要调整\`docker-compose.yml\`文件中的服务定义和配置，比如修改端口映射、添加数据库服务、调整卷挂在的路径等。这只是一个基础的示例，实际的应用可能需要进一步的配置。"},{"instruction":"不,我打错了,是WebDav","output":"要使用Docker Compose在本地搭建一个WebDAV服务，你需要遵循以下步骤： 1. 编写Docker Compose文件 创建一个新目录，用于存放你的\`docker-compose.yml\`文件。然后在这个目录中创建\`docker-compose.yml\`文件，它会定义运行WebDAV服务所需的配置。 这里是一个简单的Docker Compose文件示例，使用了\`bytemark/webdav\`镜像来建立WebDAV服务： \`\`\`yaml version: '3' services: webdav: image: bytemark/webdav ports: - 80:80 environment: AUTH_TYPE: Basic USERNAME: your_username PASSWORD: your_password volumes: - /path/to/your/local/directory:/var/lib/dav - /path/to/your/local/directory.log:/var/log/apache2 \`\`\` 这个配置将启动一个监听在80端口的WebDAV服务器。 - \`image: bytemark/webdav\`：指定使用bytemark的WebDAV Docker镜像。 - \`ports\`：映射容器的80端口到本地机器的80端口。 - \`environment\`：定义环境变量来设置认证类型和用户凭据。 - \`volumes\`：挂载本地目录到容器的\`/var/lib/dav\`中以储存WebDAV内容，同时可选地挂载一个本地日志目录来保存Apache日志。 请将\`/path/to/your/local/directory\`更换为你希望作为WebDAV目录的本地路径，\`your_username\`和\`your_password\`替换为你希望设置的用户名和密码。 2. 启动Docker Compose服务 在包含\`docker-compose.yml\`文件的目录内，打开命令行或终端，运行以下命令来启动服务： \`\`\`bash docker-compose up -d \`\`\` \`-d\`使服务在后台运行。 3. 访问WebDAV服务 在任意WebDAV客户端工具中，连接到\`http://localhost\`，并使用你在\`docker-compose.yml\`文件中设置的用户名和密码进行登录。现在你可以开始上传和管理文件了。 4. 停止WebDAV服务 当你不再需要运行WebDAV服务时，可以使用以下命令来停止并移除服务： \`\`\`bash docker-compose down \`\`\` 以上是使用Docker Compose搭建本地WebDAV服务的基本指南。根据需要，你可以根据实际需求调整\`docker-compose.yml\`文件中的配置选项，如端口号、认证方式等。"},{"instruction":"然后再用docker compose部署一个内网穿透的工具,比如frp","output":"要使用Docker Compose部署一个内网穿透的工具，例如frp（Fast Reverse Proxy），你需要定义frp服务器和frp客户端的配置。以下是一个基本的示例： 首先，你需要两个配置文件。一个是frp服务器的frps.ini，另一个是frp客户端的frpc.ini。 frps.ini（假设放在了路径\`/path/to/your/frps/config\`）: \`\`\`ini [common] bind_port = 7000 \`\`\` frpc.ini（假设放在了路径\`/path/to/your/frpc/config\`）: \`\`\`ini [common] server_addr = frps # 注意这里应与服务端容器名称一致 server_port = 7000 [webdav] type = http local_ip = webdav # 注意这里应与WebDAV容器名称一致 local_port = 80 custom_domains = your-domain.com \`\`\` 然后，你需要一个\`docker-compose.yml\`文件，整合frps、frpc和WebDAV服务： \`\`\`yaml version: '3' services: frps: image: snowdreamtech/frps volumes: -

He's the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and a missing, mysterious Flemish sorcerer that moved to Japan named Hannes Vanderbilt. He's a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. The protagonist's name is Noah Vanderbeek, and higher-up sorcerers, the likes of Utahime and Gakuganji like to keep a tight lid on his status as Yuki's child, but word has gotten out anyway. He's known by other students as \\"The Drill Sergeant\\" because he's essentially wrestled control over Kyoto's training regimen from its conservative executives. While his methods are a little wild and unorthodox, they can't deny that he makes everyone stronger. Noah is powerful, and his ability, \\"The World In My Palm\\",","output":"allows him to manipulate space within a specific range around him as if he's folding a map. This ability does not just let him close the distance between himself and an opponent instantaneously, but also allows him to bend space in such a way to create spatial distortions that can disorient or outright trap his enemies. Essentially, he controls the battlefield in a literal sense, making it difficult for enemies to predict where he – or they – will be next. Appearance: Noah Vanderbeek stands tall, with a lean but muscular build, reflecting his rigorous training. He has the sharp, intense eyes of his mother, Yuki, and the light hair inherited from his father, Hannes, which he wears slightly long and often tied back. His face carries a serious expression most of the time, giving him an intimidating presence. His Jujutsu High uniform is altered by personal touches, like custom patches or charms, that reflect his multi-cultural heritage. Personality: Noah is known for his strict and disciplined demeanor, which has earned him the nickname \\"The Drill Sergeant.\\" However, this strictness comes from a place of genuine care for his peers’ growth in strength and ability. He pushes others hard because he recognizes the potential in them and the danger of the jujutsu world. Despite this, Noah can be incredibly charming and charismatic when he chooses to be, often using this side of his personality to motivate or inspire his fellow students. His mixed feelings toward his mother's reputation lead him to work twice as hard to prove himself, both to others and to his own demanding standards. He's driven by a strong sense of duty and a desire to protect, which he considers the cornerstone of a sorcerer's purpose. Abilities: 1. Spatial Manipulation – \\"The World In My Palm\\" is his innate ability that lets him fold, warp, and distort space, making him an unpredictable fighter. 2. High Physical Prowess – Trained by the best, including the wisdom and techniques passed down from Yuki, Noah has exceptional strength, agility, and reflexes. 3. Cursed Energy Manipulation – Noah possesses a vast amount of cursed energy, allowing him to deploy barriers, perform advanced cursed techniques, and enhance his physical attacks. 4. Tactical Mind – With a strategic mindset, Noah is adept at analyzing situations and opponents to find the best angle of approach, often turning the tide of battle with his clever insights. Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High: As a second-year student and having effectively taken control of the school's training regimen, Noah is both an anomaly and a marvel. His fellow students might find his methods grueling, but the results are undeniable. Even skeptical faculty members like Utahime and Gakuganji are begrudgingly approving of his results. Noah's unique background, powerful ability, and legacy create an aura of expectation, and he's determined to live up to and surpass the accomplishments of both his parents."},{"instruction":"Напишите отглагольные существительные (10 баллов) Например: повышать уровень жизни - повышение уровня жизни. выполнять приказ нарушать условия мирного договора освобождать заложников вмешиваться в дела другого государства вторгаться в воздушное пространство нападать на противника обмениваться мнениями","output":"выполнение приказа нарушение условий мирного договора освобождение заложников вмешательство в дела другого государства вторжение в воздушное пространство нападение на противника обмен мнениями"},{"instruction":"Образуйте возможные словосочетания с 10. прилагательными русский и российский и существительных балет, спортсмен, церковь, закон, душа, войска, бюджет, парламент, характер, культура, согласуя их в роде, числе и падеже (10 баллов).

He's the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and a missing, mysterious Flemish sorcerer that moved to Japan named Hannes Vanderbilt. He's a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. The protagonist's name is Noah Vanderbeek, and higher-up sorcerers, the likes of Utahime and Gakuganji like to keep a tight lid on his status as Yuki's child, but word has gotten out anyway. He's known by other students as \\"The Drill Sergeant\\" because he's essentially wrestled control over Kyoto's training regimen from its conservative executives. While his methods are a little wild and unorthodox, they can't deny that he makes everyone stronger. Noah is powerful, and his ability, \\"The World In My Palm\\", allows him to summon a miniature celestial of his choosing which he can consume to absorb its properties.","output":"**Character Profile:** **Name:** Noah Vanderbeek **Age:** 17 **Affiliation:** Kyoto Jujutsu High **Grade:** Second Year **Parentage:** Yuki Tsukumo (Mother, Special-Grade Sorcerer), Hannes Vanderbilt (Father, Mysterious Flemish Sorcerer) **Appearance:** Noah is a striking young man with an athletic build, standing at a height that commands attention. He bears a mix of his parents' features, with the piercing eyes and hair color inherited from his father, Hannes, and the sharp facial structure reminiscent of his mother, Yuki. His hair is a messy tumble of dark waves, often pushed back to keep it out of his face during his rigorous training sessions. He dresses in the traditional black Jujutsu High uniform, but with his own flair: the jacket zipped up only halfway, and an array of talismans and charms decorate his belt – a nod to his heritage and his personal achievements in the Jujutsu world. **Personality:** Noah has an intensity that can be felt whenever he enters a room. Dedicated and fiercely determined, he approaches his role as a sorcerer with a maturity that belies his age. He has an innate sense of responsibility, a quality fostered by his mother's forward-thinking and his father's enigmatic teachings. Noah is seen as strict and somewhat relentless by his peers, earning him the nickname \\"The Drill Sergeant\\". However, beneath this strict exterior is a genuine desire to push everyone, including himself, toward their potential. He has little patience for laziness or excuses and believes in the strength that comes from overcoming hardship. **Abilities:** * **Cursed Energy Mastery:** As the progeny of a special-grade sorcerer and a mystical Flemish sorcerer, Noah has a profound connection with cursed energy, displaying expertise in manipulating it to an advanced degree. * **Technique - \\"The World In My Palm\\":** * Celestial Summoning: Noah has the unique ability to summon a compendium of miniature celestial beings, each with different attributes and powers. These summons materialize as radiant, translucent spectra. * Celestial Consumption: After summoning a celestial, Noah may absorb it, engulfing himself temporarily with its powers. Depending on the celestial he chooses, he gains abilities such as heightened speed, strength, elemental manipulation, or even temporary foresight. The abilities last for a limited time, and the consumption takes a toll on his stamina, thereby balancing his power. * **Inherited Skill - \\"Flemish Bind\\":** A lesser-known ability from his father's side allows Noah to temporarily bind or restrict the movement of his opponents or objects, imbuing them with a layer of cursed energy, forming a visible, intricate pattern reminiscent of Flemish tapestry. * **Enhanced Physical Prowess:** His rigorous self-imposed training under his own extreme regimen has led to Noah harbouring extraordinary strength, agility, and endurance, far exceeding his peers. **Backstory:** Born to Yuki Tsukumo, an exceptional special-grade sorcerer who is often away due to her own ambitions and pursuits, and Hannes Vanderbilt, a Flemish sorcerer shrouded in mystery, Noah's existence was meant to be kept a secret to prevent any political leverage within the Jujutsu society. Despite the Kyoto school executives' efforts, rumors of his parentage spread. Noah grew up feeling the weight of expectation and the shadow of his parents' legacies - the astonishing strength and free spirit of his mother paired with the enigmatic abilities of his father. Despite the mixed reception by the Jujutsu community – reverence for his potential and an undercurrent of criticism due to his mother's non-traditional views – Noah has carved his own path. His leadership over the training regimen at Kyoto Jujutsu High is a testament to his desire to shape not just his destiny but to empower those around him. **Relationships:** Noah's relationships are complex. His connection with his mother, Yuki, is one of respect, but it's strained by her infrequent presence in his life. From his father, he inherited unique skills, but Hannes's absence leaves Noah with unanswered questions about his family's history and his full capabilities. His peers vary from deeply respecting him to being on edge due to his intense training style; however, they all recognize Noah's commitment to their growth. The faculty like Utahime and Gakuganji maintain a cautious approach towards Noah, balancing the need to keep him under wraps while acknowledging his burgeoning power. **Role in the Story:** Noah Vanderbeek, with his unique heritage and abilities, plays a pivotal role among the students at Kyoto Jujutsu High. As a mentor and drill sergeant, he is preparing the next generation of Jujutsu sorcerers not just to face the myriad of curses that threaten their world, but to challenge the very structure of the Jujutsu society by showing that strength comes in many forms. Noah's journey to understand his abilities and his place in the world of Jujutsu Kaisen is a blend of intense battles, personal growth, and unraveling the mysteries of his lineage."},{"instruction":"1.

Вот некоторые критерии и признаки, на которые стоит обратить внимание: 1. Непостоянство в общении: Если женщина только время от времени отвечает на сообщения, игнорирует ваши звонки и забывает о договоренностях, это может быть признаком, что она не особо заинтересована. 2. Отсутствие инициативы: Если общение или встречи происходят лишь по вашей инициативе, и она редко или никогда не предлагает встретиться или сделать что-либо вместе, это может быть знаком, что ее интерес невелик. 3. Избегание личных тем: Если она не склонна делиться личной информацией, избегает серьезных тем или обсуждения будущего ваших отношений, возможно, она не хочет углублять связь. 4. Флирт с другими: Если она открыто флиртует с другими людьми при вас, это может быть признаком, что она не ищет эксклюзивности с вами. 5. Ограниченность только весельем: Если она хочет видеться с вами только для развлечений или в определенных, часто поверхностных контекстах (например, на вечеринках), но не приглашает в более интимные или значимые ситуации, это может свидетельствовать о недостатке глубины интереса. 6. Игнорирование эмоциональных потребностей: Если она не проявляет интереса к вашим чувствам или проблемам и не поддерживает в сложные моменты, это может свидетельствовать об отсутствии эмоциональной связи. 7. Нежелание вводить в круг близких людей: Если она не стремится знакомить вас со своими друзьями или семьей и не хочет встречаться с вашими, это может быть знаком отстраненности. 8. Отсутствие последовательности: Если она говорит одно, а поступает иначе, или ее действия противоречат словам, это может указывать на то, что она не всерьез рассматривает будущее с вами. 9. Отсутствие приверженности: Если она четко выражает, что не ищет серьезных отношений, или говорит, что ей нравится \\"свобода\\", это важный сигнал ее намерений. 10. Ваши инстинкты: Наконец, не упускайте из виду свои личные инстинкты. Если вам кажется, что женщина не всерьез относится к вам, возможно, ваше внутреннее чутье подсказывает правду. Обратите внимание, что эти признаки могут быть и неоднозначными, и иногда поведение человека может быть обусловлено множеством различных факторов. Поэтому, перед тем как делать выводы, важно попытаться открыто и честно обсудить свои наблюдения и чувства с той женщиной, которая вас интересует."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help translate something into English for you.

TV에 나가잖아, TV에! 우리 경기를 부모님, 친척, 친구들이 다 볼 거라고!” “그게 뭐? 어차피 나중에 프로선수로 뛸 거 아니야?” “맞지. 근데 그건… 왜?” “그때도 이렇게 떨 거야? 더 많은 사람이 볼 거고, 엄청난 숫자의 관중들이 환호와 야유를 보낼 텐데?” “떠, 떨긴 누가 떨었다고 그래? 그냥 네가 떨까 봐 걱정해준 걸 가지고……!” 이택현이 황당하다는 듯 짜증을 냈다. 이어서 공을 튕기는 트래핑을 시작했다. 트래핑은 조금 전보다 안정되어 보였다. 그리고. 신재욱은 그 모습을 보며 피식 웃어버렸다. ‘긴장이 조금 풀린 것 같네.’ 이택현은 축구천재 FC 내에서 가장 호흡이 잘 맞는 동료였다. 그런 동료가 긴장해서 실력 발휘를 못 한다? 신재욱은 그런 상황이 생기는 걸 원치 않았다. 그래서 이택현에게 접근했고, 대화를 나누며 긴장을 풀어준 것이다. ‘이제 나도 몸 좀 제대로 풀어볼까?’ 경기가 시작될 때까지 시간이 많지는 않았다. 이제 자신도 몸을 달굴 때라고 생각하며, 신재욱은 공을 주워들었다. 하지만 이내 공을 다시 내려놨다. 더 먼저 할 일이 생각났으니까.","output":"027 --- \\"It wasn't easy.\\" Shin Jaewook recalled the one-on-one confrontation with Jin Minho. As a player who had played for the national team in Korea, his skills were good. His fundamentals were solid, and his techniques were outstanding. However, compared to the players in the European first division leagues, his level was lower. Perhaps because he had retired from active play, his judgment wasn't as sharp. That's why Jaewook was able to win. --- \\"Practicing defense a lot in the past really helped.\\" Shin Jaewook's physical condition had improved a lot compared to right after his reincarnation. But saying it had improved compared to right after his reincarnation didn't mean he was satisfied with it. --- \\"It's still lacking.\\" Speaking coldly, if it had been the Shin Jaewook of the past, he would have easily won against Jin Minho. Jaewook saw too many openings in Minho's play. However, there weren't many of those openings he could exploit. His current physical abilities weren't good enough. In the end, he chose to go for a tackle at the right timing and succeeded. --- \\"I really focused hard.\\" He had concentrated so much that his head was throbbing. --- \\"By the way, isn't the filming taking too long?\\" The filming continued for a long time. After completing various schedules including training, interviews with the coach, and mini-games, it finally ended. --- \\"Let me say this again, let's make sure to win in the match that will take place during the next filming. Everyone worked hard!\\" With Jin Minho's words, the production crew and players exchanged greetings and headed to their respective homes. However, there were some who did not go home and stayed at the filming site. --- \\"Jaewook, is it really okay for you to go home late?\\" \\"Yes. I think I can go a bit late. What about you, coach?\\" \\"I'm fine. I can even go in tomorrow. Ah! And don't worry about transportation. I'll drive you home.\\" \\"Is that really okay?\\" \\"Of course~! Don't feel burdened.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" --- Shin Jaewook smiled broadly after responding. --- \\"This is an unexpected treat.\\" Before the filming ended, Shin Jaewook had received an offer from Jin Minho. It was a proposal to train together after the filming. It felt like a monster that gave a lot of experience points kept coming at him. Naturally, there was no reason for Jaewook to refuse. And... --- \\"Taekhyun will also stay and go with Jaewook, right?\\" \\"Yes. I'm a rival to Shin Jaewook, so I always have to train with him.\\" \\"Ha ha! That's right, you're doing very well too. I was surprised several times during the filming.\\" \\"Hehe! Really?\\" \\"Really. If you keep working hard, you can become a great professional player.\\" \\"Wow! I'll work hard and definitely become a pro player! Coach Jin Minho, you'll train one-on-one with me too, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" --- As always, Lee Taekhyun decided to join as well. --- \\"I'm back.\\" Shin Jaewook greeted his mother and father as he entered the house late at night. Both were watching TV in the living room, but Jaewook knew. They had been waiting for him. --- \\"Did the filming go well? How was it?\\" \\"Son! Have you eaten? Are you hungry?\\" --- His father and mother stood up from their seats and bombarded him with questions. He was overwhelmed by the rapid-fire questions, but he felt good. --- \\"I'm not going anywhere, so please ask me one at a time.\\" \\"I'm done asking. Seeing your face, it seems you did well.\\" --- With that, his father sat back down on the sofa. However, his gaze was still fixed on Jaewook. --- \\"Shouldn't you eat?\\" \\"Yes, mother. I ate, but I guess I'm hungry again because I exercised a lot.\\" \\"Athletes shouldn't be hungry. Wait a bit. Mom will prepare some food quickly.\\" \\"Oh! Then I'll go wash up quickly and come back!\\" --- Shin Jaewook entered the bathroom to wash up and looked in the mirror. His belly was protruding. It was because he had eaten his fill of meat bought by Director Jin Minho. --- \\"I'm going to burst.\\" He was too full. Normally, he wouldn't have eaten, but he couldn't help it. As soon as he entered the house, he smelled the tantalizing scent of braised ribs. --- \\"How could I not eat when you've gone to the trouble of shopping and cooking?\\" He wanted to eat the braised ribs filled with his mother's care, even though he was full. --- \\"Jaewook, how does it taste? Mom even ground the pears and onions herself for the seasoning.\\" \\"It's incredibly delicious! The meat is tender, and the seasoning goes so well with the rice. How can it be this delicious?\\" --- Shin Jaewook was sincere. The braised ribs his mother made were really delicious. It was so good that it could put many restaurants to shame. Despite being full, Jaewook was able to finish a bowl of rice. His mother seemed pleased, smiling brightly and repeatedly asking if it was really delicious. She was still doing so now. --- \\"Really? Is it that delicious?\\" \\"Yes. It's surprisingly delicious.\\" \\"Oh my, this child's lip service is getting better day by day? You're not just saying that to make me feel good, are you?\\" \\"I'm serious. Of all the braised ribs I've had so far... it's really delicious.\\" \\"Huh? Weren't you about to say something else just now? That the braised ribs I made are the best?\\" \\"Ah... no. It was something else. Of course, the braised ribs are very, very delicious.\\" --- Shin Jaewook quickly changed the subject. He couldn't bring himself to lie. --- 'I'm sorry. There's a different best braised ribs for me.' For him, the best braised ribs were... the ones made by his late biological mother. --- The first episode of FC Soccer Genius was broadcasted. The ratings were a hit. 9%. It was a higher rating than even the well-known dramas. Considering that the first episodes of such dramas usually don't have high ratings, it was an even more surprising result. Naturally, the viewers' interest was tremendous. Especially the reaction from domestic soccer fans was very hot. --- └FC Soccer Genius is a hit, right? The first episode got a 9% rating. └The rating was deserved, wasn't it? It was fun. └It was fun indeed. I liked that they didn't just bring in so-called geniuses, but actually talented kids. Especially Lee Taekhyun's movements were no joke, right? └I'm looking forward to Shin Jaewook. True soccer nerds would know, but the team that won the recent middle school national championship was Daehan Middle School, right? And their ace was Shin Jaewook. └Really? If he's the ace of the winning team, he must be really good. What's his position? └He's a defensive midfielder, but he also plays like a central midfielder. Sometimes he even plays like an attacking midfielder. Oh, and what's even more amazing is that Shin Jaewook is a first-year student. └A first-year and he's the ace of the middle school championship team? Is that the right kid? The pale and somewhat skinny one. He doesn't look like an ace at all from the outside? He looks frail... └He must be technically good. And he's a middle schooler. It's an age where physicality has less impact. └I was impressed by the kid with the short sports haircut. He speaks softly, but his physique could pass for an adult's. └I didn't care much for that kid. --- Viewers and soccer fans were waiting for the second episode. When the second episode of FC Soccer Genius was broadcasted, the reaction was much hotter than the first episode. It was to be expected. Jin Minho, the coach of FC Soccer Genius and a former national team player. Against him, Lee Taekhyun, a mere middle school first-year student, showed good skills. Similarly, Shin Jaewook, another middle school first-year student, managed to beat Jin Minho. --- └What the... What's with Shin Jaewook? Isn't that crazy??? └He's really insane... Jin Minho was a national team player and quite good, right? And he hasn't been retired for that long, has he? └Two or three years, I think? Anyway, it hasn't been that long, right? └A middle school first-year student beats a national team player who retired only a few years ago...? Does this even make sense? └It doesn't make sense, that's why it's FC Soccer Genius. └Shin Jaewook is so calm. Did you see how he timed the steal perfectly? We need a talent like him to grow and join the national team. └He's amazing, really. With talent like Shin Jaewook, couldn't he play in Europe? └Are you crazy? There are probably truckloads of kids like that in Europe. And even more in South America. └Wow, I'm looking forward to episode 3. Oh man! It's exam period, how can I not watch this? I have to watch it no matter what. --- And when the second episode was being broadcasted... --- \\"Filming starts now!\\" Shin Jaewook was at the filming site to shoot the footage for episodes 3 and 4. --- \\"Everyone seems a bit tense.\\" The players of FC Soccer Genius had arrived at the filming site early to warm up. There was a look of nervousness on the players' faces. Today was the day of FC Soccer Genius's first match, and that was the reason for the tension. Although the members of FC Soccer Genius were strong-hearted players who had performed well in tournaments, a match that would be broadcasted on TV was a different kind of pressure. Moreover, the fact that they were going to face a strong team added even more pressure to the players. --- \\"Baechun Middle School... They're a good team.\\" Shin Jaewook knew about Baechun Middle School. It was a team he had encountered a few months ago at the national championship. It was the school that had given Daehan Middle School a tough time and where Lee Taekhyun had been the ace. But there was something a little strange. --- \\"Taekhyun doesn't seem to care much?\\" --- The players from Baechun Middle School kept glancing at Lee Taekhyun. But Taekhyun himself didn't seem to have much interest. Instead, he seemed more concerned about the cameras. He was warming up by juggling the ball as usual, but unlike his usual self, he was making frequent mistakes. Shin Jaewook approached Taekhyun. --- \\"Lee Taekhyun.\\" \\"Huh? Why?\\" \\"Today's opponent is the school you used to attend. Don't you feel anything?\\" \\"Not really. Right now, they're just an opponent I have to beat.\\" \\"Oh.\\" --- Shin Jaewook let out a small exclamation of admiration. He hadn't expected such words from Taekhyun. On the other hand, Taekhyun frowned at Jaewook's reaction. --- \\"Why are you surprised?\\" \\"It's not like you to say that.\\" \\"What's not like me? I'm always cool. I clearly distinguish between work and personal matters.\\" \\"…Right.\\" \\"Your reaction is a bit bland, isn't it? Jaewook, you don't believe what I'm saying, do you?\\" \\"I believe you.\\" \\"You're lying! You don't believe me at all by the look on your face!\\" \\"What's wrong with my face?\\" \\"You keep laughing like you can't believe it!\\" \\"I always have a smiling face.\\" \\"Ha! Smiling face my foot! I should stop talking to you. But Jaewook, aren't you nervous? It's also your first time playing in front of so many cameras.\\" \\"It's the same thing. Just play as usual.\\" \\"Who doesn't know that? But it's on TV, TV! Our parents, relatives, and friends will all watch our game!\\" \\"So what? Aren't you going to play as a professional player later?\\" \\"That's right. But that's... why?\\" \\"Are you going to be nervous then too? There will be even more people watching, and countless fans will be cheering and jeering, right?\\" \\"Who's nervous? I was just worried you might be nervous...!\\" --- Lee Taekhyun let out a frustrated exclamation. Then he started juggling the ball again. His juggling seemed more stable than before. And then. Shin Jaewook saw that and couldn't help but smile. --- 'It seems his nerves have calmed down a bit.' --- Lee Taekhyun was the teammate with whom Jaewook had the best rapport in FC Soccer Genius. His teammate getting nervous and not being able to perform? Jaewook didn't want such a situation to happen. That's why he approached Taekhyun and had a conversation to help him relax. --- 'Should I properly warm up my body now?' --- There wasn't much time left until the start of the game. Thinking it was time for him to get ready, Jaewook picked up the ball. But then he put it down again. He remembered something more important to do first."},{"instruction":"Оборона Москвы. План «Барбаросса» предполагал взятие Москвы в течение 3–4 месяцев с начала войны. Однако события первого военного лета пошли вразрез с расчётами противника. Упорная оборона Красной Армии в ходе Смоленского и других сражений заставила гитлеровцев приостановить продвижение Москве. Лишь после взятия Киева и прорыва к Ленинграду немецкое командование смогло начать подготовку наступления с целью захвата советской столицы. Москва являлась главной целью захватчиков не только потому, что была столицей СССР и в ней располагалось правительство страны. Москва находилась в центре транспортной системы Советского Союза – к ней сходились все важнейшие железнодорожные магистрали. В случае потери этого важнейшего логистического узла дальнейшее обеспечение огромного по протяжённости фронта, снабжение городов и регионов могло стать неразрешимой проблемой. Кроме того, захват врагом столицы СССР имел бы деморализующее значение. Сталин понимал, что этого ни в коем лучае допустить нельзя. Группа армий «Центр» была максимально усилена и насчитывала 1,8 млн. человек, 1700 танков, свыше 14 тыс. орудий и минометов. Противостоявшие ей советские армии имели 1,2 млн. человек, 990 танков, 7,6 тыс. орудий и миномётов. Они входили в состав Западного (командующий – И. Конев), Резервного (командующий – С. Будённый) и Брянского (командующий – И. Ерёменко) фронтов. Для того чтобы обеспечить решающий перевес, немецкое командование скрытно перебросило на московское направление значительную часть соединений, ранее наступавших на Ленинград, и главные силы авиации. Впервые с начала войны на одном направлении были сконцентрированы силы сразу трёх немецких танковых групп. В сентябре 1941 г. Москва мало напоминала полный жизни город. Ночью полностью отключалось освещение, чтобы затруднить немецкой авиации ориентировку и выбор целей для бомбометания. В воздух поднимались аэростаты воздушного заграждения. К сентябрю успешные действия воинов-зенитчиков и лётчиков-истребителей вынудили немцев отказаться от массовых воздушных налётов. Враг убедился, что небо Москвы надёжно защищено. Сотни тысяч москвичей работали к западу от столицы – строили оборонительные рубежи. Даже после эвакуации из Московского региона около 500 заводов и свыше 1 млн рабочих не прекратилось производство вооружения и боеприпасов. На фабриках детских игрушек теперь делали бутылки с зажигательной смесью. Вопросы: 1. Почему было приостановлено продвижение немцев к Москве? 2. Какие были цели у гитлеровцев по захвату Москвы? 3. Какая армия имела преимущества в боевой силе и технике? 4. Как Москва подготовилась к обороне? Answers are short","output":"1. Продвижение немцев к Москве было приостановлено из-за упорной обороны Красной Армии и неожиданного сопротивления советских войск. 2. Целями гитлеровцев по захвату Москвы были разрыв транспортной системы Советского Союза и деморализация Советского правительства. 3. Группа армий \\"Центр\\" имела преимущества в боевой силе и технике по сравнению с советскими армиями. 4. Москва подготовилась к обороне путем переброски сил соединений и скрытным укреплением оборонительных рубежей."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It started over something so small, a miscommunication on a case they were working on, but it spiraled excitingly fast. Hurtful words were said, and both the fox and the rabbit returned to their respective homes with heavy hearts and an uncertain future clouding the horizon of their once unshakeable partnership. During the week that followed, the ZPD felt colder, the bustle of Precinct One less vibrant. Clawhauser's doughnut munching didn't echo the usual cheers, and Chief Bogo's directions sounded more like a monotonous growl than usual. Their absence affected everyone and the city they protected. But hurt feelings and bruised egos have a way of healing, given enough time and sincere effort, and Nick Wilde wasn't one to let a good thing slip away because of one heated argument. He knew Judy felt the same, even if they were both too stubborn to admit it first. So, as the sun set on an uneventful Thursday, painting the Zootopia skyline with hues of crimson and gold, Nick put his plan into action. With a bouquet of fresh carrots in hand—tasteful and an inside joke only Judy would understand—he made his way to her apartment, rehearsing his apology with each step. Nick arrived at Judy's door and hesitated. His throat felt suddenly tight, and the cool evening air seemed to choke him. He took a deep breath, straightened his tie, and knocked. Judy opened the door, her eyes widening slightly at the sight of Nick. The silence stretched on for a beat too long, both mammals trying to find the words to break the ice that had formed between them. \\"I come in peace,\\" Nick finally said, pushing the bouquet forward ever so slightly. Judy's ears perked up, and a small, almost imperceptible smile graced her lips, softening the stern lines of her face. \\"Is that so, Slick?\\" she teased, taking the carrots from him. \\"And what do these carrots mean? You're hoping I'll turn vegetarian?\\" Nick chuckled, a genuine sound filled with the warmth he had missed sharing with her. \\"No, Carrots. It's a peace offering... or a snack if you prefer. Can I come in?\\" She nodded, stepping aside to let him enter, her gesture an unspoken acceptance of his olive branch. They settled on the couch, a familiar spot where countless debriefings and late-night talks had taken place, each careful to leave enough space between them for pride and forgiveness to fill the gap. \\"Look, Judy,\\" Nick started, his gaze fixed firmly on his own paws, \\"I was out of line the other day. I let my temper get the better of me, and, truth be told, I missed you. I missed us. This partnership, our friendship, it means more to me than being right.\\" Judy listened intently, her eyes softening further, the anger and hurt slowly melting away. \\"I missed you too, Nick. I was too quick to judge and too slow to listen. We're a team, and I don't want to let one argument end what we've built together.\\" They both sat in silence, the tension lifting, their hearts mending the invisible bridge between them. Judy scooted closer, leaning her head softly against Nick's shoulder, an unspoken forgiveness hanging in the air. \\"Truce?\\" Nick offered, extending a paw. \\"Truce,\\" Judy agreed, shaking his paw firmly before resting her head back against his shoulder. As the night deepened around them, Nick and Judy sat in comfortable silence, letting the city's nocturnal symphony fill the space. They knew that arguments were part of any relationship, but the strength of their bond lay in their ability to reconcile and grow stronger from each conflict. The soft glow from the street lights outside cast a warm, golden hue over the two partners, now reconciled. And there, in the quiet security of Judy's apartment, they sat side by side—two parts of a whole, ready to face the challenges of Zootopia and the complexities of their partnership with a renewed understanding and a shared commitment to always dance their way back to harmony."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

План «Барбаросса» предполагал взятие Москвы в течение 3–4 месяцев с начала войны. Однако события первого военного лета пошли вразрез с расчётами противника. Упорная оборона Красной Армии в ходе Смоленского и других сражений заставила гитлеровцев приостановить продвижение Москве. Лишь после взятия Киева и прорыва к Ленинграду немецкое командование смогло начать подготовку наступления с целью захвата советской столицы. Москва являлась главной целью захватчиков не только потому, что была столицей СССР и в ней располагалось правительство страны. Москва находилась в центре транспортной системы Советского Союза – к ней сходились все важнейшие железнодорожные магистрали. В случае потери этого важнейшего логистического узла дальнейшее обеспечение огромного по протяжённости фронта, снабжение городов и регионов могло стать неразрешимой проблемой. Кроме того, захват врагом столицы СССР имел бы деморализующее значение. Сталин понимал, что этого ни в коем лучае допустить нельзя. Группа армий «Центр» была максимально усилена и насчитывала 1,8 млн. человек, 1700 танков, свыше 14 тыс. орудий и минометов. Противостоявшие ей советские армии имели 1,2 млн. человек, 990 танков, 7,6 тыс. орудий и миномётов. Они входили в состав Западного (командующий – И. Конев), Резервного (командующий – С. Будённый) и Брянского (командующий – И. Ерёменко) фронтов. Для того чтобы обеспечить решающий перевес, немецкое командование скрытно перебросило на московское направление значительную часть соединений, ранее наступавших на Ленинград, и главные силы авиации. Впервые с начала войны на одном направлении были сконцентрированы силы сразу трёх немецких танковых групп. В сентябре 1941 г. Москва мало напоминала полный жизни город. Ночью полностью отключалось освещение, чтобы затруднить немецкой авиации ориентировку и выбор целей для бомбометания. В воздух поднимались аэростаты воздушного заграждения. К сентябрю успешные действия воинов-зенитчиков и лётчиков-истребителей вынудили немцев отказаться от массовых воздушных налётов. Враг убедился, что небо Москвы надёжно защищено. Сотни тысяч москвичей работали к западу от столицы – строили оборонительные рубежи. Даже после эвакуации из Московского региона около 500 заводов и свыше 1 млн рабочих не прекратилось производство вооружения и боеприпасов. На фабриках детских игрушек теперь делали бутылки с зажигательной смесью. Вопросы: 1. Почему было приостановлено продвижение немцев к Москве? 2. Какие были цели у гитлеровцев по захвату Москвы? 3. Какая армия имела преимущества в боевой силе и технике? 4. Как Москва подготовилась к обороне? Answers are short","output":"1.

The idea was for this to be a one-to-many relationship table though, rather than many-to-many. So when displaying a concept, you can display it's \\"parent\\" concept if it has one. Though I suppose when displaying concepts, you can pick and choose. For example, on the Half-Life franchise page, it can specifically target all child concepts that have the parent \\"Video Game\\". The key thing though, is you only group concepts below it if they are direct decendants. You wouldn't do: Concept[Half-Life] -> Concept[Character] But you might do: Concept[Half-Life] -> Concept[Gordon Freeman] So when getting concept lists, you simply decide the ConceptGroups that concept falls under.

For example, I want an Image concept, this concept has a data table that stores information on images; widthXheight, hashes, etc. But I want the Gelbooru concepts data table to be able to reference an Image ID directly, without having to duplicate data, so I can append extra information, such as the gelbooru post ID, tags etc. So we probably want a ForeignKey VariableType. \\"\\"\\" class ConceptDataTable(TimeStampedModel): __tablename__ = \\"concept_data_table\\" # columns # id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) concept_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey('concept.id'), primary_key=True) data_table_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(unique=True) fields_table_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(unique=True) # relationships concept: Mapped[Concept] = relationship(foreign_keys=[concept_id], back_populates='concept_data_tables') # methods def __repr__(self): return f\\"{self.__tablename__!r}(concept={self.concept.name!r}, data_table_name={self.data_table_name!r}, fields_table_name={self.fields_table_name!r})\\" \\"\\"\\" This does not yet contain the Fingerprints. I feel like the Data Fingerprint can itself be a Concept. It can have a Fingerprint data table containing all the fingerprints. All it needs is the fingerprint hash itself, and the data size. I do however also want support for all types of hashing. So, Concept[Hash] This concept groups all hash algorithms. Concept[Hash] -> Concept[AUTOV1] -> Concept[AUTOV2] -> Concept[MD5] -> Concept[SHA256] -> Concept[SHA512] -> Concept[CRC32] -> Concept[BLAKE3] Though, how to link all the hashes to the same data... Idea 1: Instead of having VariableType TEXT, have VariableType HASH_SHA256, which gets stored as a TEXT entry in the DB, but the. No, that is too specific and I wouldn't be using those VariableTypes outside of the data table, making them useless to be a VariableType. Idea 2: A data table, indexed by Fingerprint(SHA512 hash + size) I can then have individual hash concepts, with their data tables link to the Fingerprint: id, fingerprint, hash Idea 3: Do what I did for another project, have a HashType table, then have a hash table: FK fingerprint_id, hash, hashtype_id modified to be indexed by the fingerprint_id as a foreignkey, rather than have its own id The fingerprint would then have it's own table: id, hash, size Then with the ConceptDataTable idea, I can have a Fingerprint as a VariableType, which becomes a foreign key into the fingerprint table NOTE: Additional idea, allow setting the ConceptDataTables id type, maybe have the VariableType of PrimaryKey to indicate a regular PK index, but a ForeignKey to have it be indexed by a different tables key. \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\" TABLE -> VariableType TABLE -> Concept ROW[Concept] -> Name='Gelbooru' ROW[Concept] -> Name='Booru' TABLE -> ConceptGroup # These are basically like category grouping, this is used to tie all Video Games to the Video Game concept, or all Boorus to the Booru concept, so to get a list of all video games I can check the Concept Group, also links a company like Valve to be under the Corporate Entity concept. # Each Concept can only be in one Concept Group, so the Concept must be unique, but the GroupConcept can have multiple, a ONE-TO-MANY database relationship. TABLE -> ConceptRelated # These are to link related concepts together, but rather than a parent-child relationship, even if some concepts might be \\"above\\" another, this is to simply link related concepts together, like linking \\"Half-Life 1\\" to \\"Valve\\" company, and also linking it to \\"Half-Life\\" franchise, you could also go beyond, linking it to the \\"First Person Shooter\\" genre(\\"Genre\\" being another concept that contains \\"First Person Shooter\\" in it's group) ROW[ConceptGroup] -> GroupConcept='Booru', Concept='Gelbooru' #Groups Gelbooru under the Booru concept ROW[ConceptRelated] -> Concept1='Gelbooru', Concept2='Image' #Without a better example, could do this These must be freely changable, and bulk movable, in case a new concept is added and other concepts need to be re-organized. Concepts also do not need a group, or a related concept. I would like to do some auto-generated variable tables, we need some structured way to manage this within the UI, rather than having to code new python modules manually. As an example, on Gelbooru, there is images, or \\"posts\\", breaking this down into yet another Concept that only has this very specific use seems impractical, instead we bring it back to the more generic \\"Image\\" concept. For each post on Gelbooru, there is a bunch of information, the Image, ID, score, md5 hash, tags, created date, rating, source, notes, comments, has_children etc. To collect all this data, I would like it to be specific to Gelbooru, rather than collecting it generically, I mean, certain things can be more generalized, like the md5 hash, the width, the height, and the image itself. So what about the other data? Create a specific table for it! TABLE -> ImageGelbooruVariables FIELDS -> VariableTypeId, ImageId, Name, Value How do we manage this table? Another table! TABLE -> ConceptLinkingVariables FIELDS -> Concept1Id, Concept2Id, TableName Hmm, but how to link Concepts with custom tables, like the Image table? Maybe Adapt the above with an extra field? TABLE -> ConceptLinkedTable FIELDS -> ConceptId, TableName, VariableTableName ROW[ConceptLinkedTable] -> ImageConcept, Image, ImageVariables The VariableTable is a table that contains the variable fields within the Table TABLE -> ImageVariables FIELDS -> Id, VariableName(The name of the field), VariableTypeId(The datatype of the field) (The VariableTypeId would be an Id into the VariableType table, but for clarity I will use a string here): ROW[ImageVariables] -> 0, 'Id', 'INTEGER' ROW[ImageVariables] -> 1, 'ImagePath', 'TEXT' ROW[ImageVariables] -> 2, 'Width', 'INTEGER' ROW[ImageVariables] -> 3, 'Height', 'INTEGER' So what this means is we make a table like this: TABLE -> Image FIELDS -> Id(INTEGER), ImagePath(TEXT), Width(INTEGER), Height(INTEGER) \\"\\"\\" \`\`\` There is a couple of large comments in there, I apologise for sending so much at once. Right now I am just building out the REACT UI side, to start with, I want to pull in a list of all the concepts, to go in the antd Drawer element as a list I can select from, I don't have any calls in place for the ConceptGroup yet, but I also want to be able to manage this list in some way, but since a Concept might be part of multiple ConceptGroups, I cannot just group them in the list, instead I want to have a list of Concepts, with a UI element to be able to put a Concept into a group, I also want to allow creating new Concepts and ConceptGroups. Remember that a ConceptGroup merely creates a Parent Concept -> Children Concept, one-to-many grouping, so to create a ConceptGroup, we need to attach another concept as a parent to the current Concept.","output":"It appears you're seeking to implement a UI that can interface with your Concept and ConceptGroup endpoints, retrieve relevant data, and allow users to create and manage concepts as well as group them. Let's outline a strategy for achieving this, incrementally: # Step 1: Display Concepts in the Drawer First, you'll want to load and list the concepts in your React UI inside the \`Drawer\`. Set up a \`useEffect\` hook to fetch concepts and store them in your component's state: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import { conceptsGetPaged } from './apiClient'; // ... inside your Concepts component const [concepts, setConcepts] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { const fetchConcepts = async () => { try { const response = await conceptsGetPaged(/* page and limit if needed */); setConcepts(response.data); } catch (err) { console.error(\\"Failed to fetch concepts: \\", err); } }; fetchConcepts(); }, []); \`\`\` Render the concepts in your \`Drawer\` by mapping over the \`concepts\` state: \`\`\`jsx <Drawer title=\\"Concepts\\" placement=\\"left\\" closable={false} onClose={onClose} open={open} getContainer={false} > <ul> {concepts.map((concept) => ( <li key={concept.id}>{concept.name}</li> ))} </ul> </Drawer> \`\`\` # Step 2: Concept and ConceptGroup Creation Next, implement the functionality to create new Concepts and ConceptGroups. Let's create some form components with input fields where users can submit new concepts/groups: You should have two forms, one to create individual concepts and another to create concept groups. You may utilize existing libraries like \`formik\` for creating forms and managing form state or stick with simple controlled components in React. After a new concept/group is created, you should update your state to reflect the new data, hence re-rendering the list. # Step 3: Managing ConceptGroups To manage ConceptGroups, you'll need UI components that can group Concepts together. This can include draggable lists, dropdowns, or other UI elements where a user can select a concept and then select a group to add it into. For the UI interaction: 1. List all concepts on one side. 2. When a concept is selected, show available groups it can be added to, or allow creating a new group. 3. Provide a way to confirm the grouping operation. On the backend interaction side, when a Concept is added to a ConceptGroup, you would call the appropriate API to group them together in your FastAPI backend, updating the database accordingly. # Step 4: Dynamic Management You might want more dynamic UI management wherein you can handle nested groupings or ungrouping with ease. This may require you to write new backend endpoints to manage those structures and to keep the front end synchronized with those changes. # Step 5: Error Handling Ensure that every API call has proper error handling and gives the user feedback, so they know whether the operation they performed was successful or if it encountered an error. This general outline should provide the structure for the UI and interaction with your FastAPI backend. As you develop, you can iteratively add features, refine the user interface, and ensure robust error handling to provide a smooth user experience."},{"instruction":"Ok, ran into a slight issue: \`\`\` File \\"D:AI GenerationProjectsai-webuiaidili-fastreactbackendvenvlibsite-packagesfastapirouting.py\\", line 292, in app content = await serialize_response( File \\"D:AI GenerationProjectsai-webuiaidili-fastreactbackendvenvlibsite-packagesfastapirouting.py\\", line 155, in serialize_response raise ResponseValidationError( fastapi.exceptions.ResponseValidationError: 2 validation errors: {'type': 'model_attributes_type', 'loc': ('response', 0), 'msg': 'Input should be a valid dictionary or object to extract fields from', 'input': ('items', []), 'url': 'https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.4/v/model_attributes_type'} {'type': 'model_attributes_type', 'loc': ('response', 1), 'msg': 'Input should be a valid dictionary or object to extract fields from', 'input': ('total', 0), 'url': 'https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.4/v/model_attributes_type'} \`\`\` I tried it with FastAPIs built in Swagger UI and get the same thing, so it is as a result of the refactoring I did, but I am not sure what could be causing it, I will post the various parts, starting with the FastAPI endpoint: \`\`\` @router.get(\\"/\\", status_code=200, response_model=List[schemas.ConceptPage]) def concepts_get_paged( page: int = Query(0, ge=0), limit: int = Query(10, ge=1), # TODO: Sort by: id, name, date db: Session = Depends(get_db), ): # Multiple Concepts db_concepts, total = concept.concept_get_paged(limit, page, db) return schemas.ConceptPage(items=[schemas.Concept.model_validate(row) for row in db_concepts], total=total) \`\`\` Then, to show the related things, I will first show the Pydantic schema, since it is where the validation error is happening: \`\`\` from datetime import datetime from pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, StringConstraints from typing import List, Generic, TypeVar, Optional from typing_extensions import Annotated T = TypeVar('T') class PaginatedItems(Generic[T], BaseModel): items: List[T] total: int # COMMON SCHEMAS # These are just for common types to present them as a Request Body param instead of Query class Path(BaseModel): path: str # === CONCEPT === class _ConceptBase(BaseModel): name: Annotated[str, StringConstraints(max_length=100)] class ConceptCreate(_ConceptBase): class Config: from_attributes = True class Concept(_ConceptBase): id: int class Config: from_attributes = True class ConceptPage(PaginatedItems[Concept]): pass \`\`\` I then have the Concept crud functions: \`\`\` import sqlalchemy as _sql from sqlalchemy import func, or_, and_, not_ from sqlalchemy.orm import Session from database.models.concept import Concept, ConceptGroup, ConceptDataTable, VariableType, Fingerprint, Hash, HashType # === CONCEPTS === # TODO: Maybe implement some exception raising, before I did HTTPException from FastAPI, # but I would rather avoid any FastAPI code in here, strictly database. # if I can get rid of schemas too that would be nice def _concept_selector(concept_id: int, db: Session): query = _sql.select(Concept).where(Concept.id == concept_id) return db.execute(query).first() # return db.query(Concept).filter(Concept.id == concept_id).first() # CREATE def concept_create(concept_name: str, db: Session): db_concept = Concept(name=concept_name) db.add(db_concept) db.commit() db.refresh(db_concept) return db_concept # REQUEST def concept_get(concept_id: int, db: Session): db_concept = _concept_selector(concept_id, db) return db_concept # TODO: Add sorting/search def concept_get_paged(limit: int, page: int, db: Session): offset = page * limit db_concepts = db.query(Concept).limit(limit).offset(offset).all() total = db.query(func.count(Concept.id)).scalar() return db_concepts, total # UPDATE def concept_update(concept_id: int, concept_name: str, db: Session): db_concept = _concept_selector(concept_id, db) if not db_concept: return None db_concept.name = concept_name db.commit() db.refresh(db_concept) return db_concept # DELETE def concept_delete(concept_id: int, db: Session): db_concept = _concept_selector(concept_id, db) if not db_concept: return False db.delete(db_concept) db.commit() return True \`\`\` Then the Concept database model(I won't post the others since we are not using them yet): \`\`\` from sqlalchemy import Column, Index, Integer, Table, String, Text, ForeignKey, DateTime, func from sqlalchemy import UniqueConstraint, CheckConstraint, MetaData from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, Relationship # TODO: This from sqlalchemy.orm import mapped_column from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, declared_attr from datetime import datetime from typing import List, Optional from .base import TimeStampedModel class Concept(TimeStampedModel): \\"\\"\\" The Concept table represents an idea or thing, in general terms.

Take a step back, take a deep breath, and really dive deeply into analysing what I gave you.","output":"The error messages you are receiving indicate that FastAPI expects dictionaries or objects that it can serialize based on your Pydantic models but is receiving different data types instead. Let's walk through potential issues and solutions step by step. # 1. Inspect the Return Type of the CRUD Function Your \`concept.concept_get_paged\` function is expected to return a tuple of \`(db_concepts, total)\`, where \`db_concepts\` should be a list of SQLAlchemy model instances and \`total\` an integer. The error suggests that the format or content of what's being returned does not match this expectation. # 2. Check the Construction of the Response Model You're returning a \`schemas.ConceptPage\` in your endpoint, created by a list comprehension that converts each SQLAlchemy model instance into a Pydantic model. # Potential Issue 1: Model Validation Approach In your endpoint, you use \`schemas.Concept.model_validate(row)\` assuming that \`Concept\` has a \`model_validate\` method. Pydantic's BaseModel does not have a \`model_validate\` method by default, so unless you've defined it yourself, this would not work. You may need to instantiate your \`schemas.Concept\` directly with the data from your SQLAlchemy instance: \`\`\`python return schemas.ConceptPage(items=[schemas.Concept(**row.__dict__) for row in db_concepts], total=total) \`\`\` Note that \`row.__dict__\` does not include relationship attributes or any \`_sa_instance_state\` attribute that SQLAlchemy adds to its instances. You should remove these before instantiating your Pydantic model. # Potential Issue 2: Serializing the SQLAlchemy Models The SQLAlchemy instances may not be serializable to a dictionary straightforwardly because of lazy-loaded relationships, meaning you have to do some work to transform these objects into something Pydantic can understand - typically dictionaries. # Potential Issue 3: Incorrect Data Format The error suggests that the 'items' field in \`schemas.ConceptPage\` expects a list of \`schemas.Concept\`. Ensure that the \`db_concepts\` variable is indeed a list of SQLAlchemy model instances that can be converted to \`Concept\` Pydantic models. # 3. Verify Pydantic Models Ensure that your Pydantic models correctly mirror your SQLAlchemy models. All fields that are defined in Pydantic models should have corresponding data in the SQLAlchemy models. Any mismatch could lead to serialization issues. # 4. Fixtures and Testing Ensure that \`db_concepts\` and \`total\` are what you expect them to be. You might want to add temporary prints or use a debugger to inspect these values before they are passed to \`schemas.ConceptPage\`. # Additional Considerations - Make sure there are no issues with your SQLAlchemy models - check if there are any missing or misconfigured relationships that could be causing serialization errors. - Depending on your SQLAlchemy setup, you might have to use \`all()\` to get the list of results from your query. However, your CRUD function seems to be doing that correctly. - If you are using \`scoped_session\`, remember to properly close and dispose of sessions to avoid session-related issues. Given these potential issues, I suggest starting by modifying the endpoint to instantiate Pydantic models correctly, checking the return values from your CRUD function, and ensuring the data you're trying to serialize matches the structure expected by Pydantic models. If the problem persists, you may want to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example that demonstrates the issue, making it easier to debug and seek further assistance."},{"instruction":"It took me awhile...but the solution was obvious, I am sad you didn't pick up on it, because normally you are pointing out things I miss, but it is ok, you're still learning. Take a look at the endpoint, specifically the response_model specified in the @router.get(), then take a look at what I am returning, I want to see if you can pick up on the issue, if not it is fine, just tell me you give up and I will tell you what the issue was.","output":"Given the information and your hint, I re-examined the details you've provided, and I believe I see the discrepancy now. In the \`@router.get()\` decorator, you've specified that the response model is a list of \`schemas.ConceptPage\`: \`\`\`python @router.get(\\"/\\", status_code=200, response_model=List[schemas.ConceptPage]) \`\`\` However, \`schemas.ConceptPage\` is already inherently a paginated object that includes \`items\` (a list of \`Concept\` objects) and \`total\` (an integer representing the total number of items): \`\`\`python class ConceptPage(PaginatedItems[Concept]): pass \`\`\` By wrapping the \`schemas.ConceptPage\` within a \`List\` in the response model, you're saying that the response should be a list of these paginated objects, which is not what you seem to intend based on the implementation of \`concepts_get_paged\`. Instead, you should return a single instance of \`schemas.ConceptPage\`, which fits the structure of the JSON response you're looking to return: a single paginated response with items and a total count. The corrected route decorator should simply use \`schemas.ConceptPage\` without \`List\`: \`\`\`python @router.get(\\"/\\", status_code=200, response_model=schemas.ConceptPage) \`\`\` Please ensure that the returned value from \`concepts_get_paged\` is a single \`schemas.ConceptPage\` object, as this change will correct the expectation and should resolve the validation error."},{"instruction":"Bravo *claps for you* You are correct. I missed it at first, because the Concept table is actually empty, so I started looking at what is being returned...which is an empty list, but then I considered that the special list syntax I was using would never call schemas.Concept.model_validate(row), because the list is empty, so, no elements to loop through, that was when I noticed List[] for the response_model, and I cringed. I have been writing very similar code, which I wrote after I initially wrote these Concept endpoints, using all the same type of crud/pydantic/paged functionality, but because I wrote this before all the others, it was while I was still unsure of how to handle certain things, so when I updated it, I overlooked that... sigh","output":"It happens to the best of us! This kind of issue is a common oversight, especially when refactoring or revisiting a section of code after working on similar functionality elsewhere. The good news is that through encountering these kinds of hurdles, we learn to spot potential issues more quickly in the future. Your approach of stepping back to reconsider the expected versus the actual data is a solid debugging strategy. It's always helpful to analyze the flow of data and double-check assumptions against what the code is supposed to do.

However, as I said, the Concept table is currently empty, so I want to create a REACT button to create a new Concept, maybe use a button with another Drawer with a form to enter the Concept name and Create it, or some kind of antd Modal popup with a form to enter the name and Create.","output":"Certainly! To make your list interactive, you can update the list items to respond to click events. I'll also provide code to create a new React button that opens up an Ant Design Modal with a form to enter the name of the new concept.

We added an \`Input\` from Ant Design for the new concept name input. 2. A \`selectedConcept\` state was added to keep track of which concept has been selected. 3. A \`isModalVisible\` state was added to control the visibility of the modal. 4. The \`showModal\`, \`handleOk\`, and \`handleCancel\` function handle the modal display and submission logic. 5. An additional Ant Design \`Button\` was added to trigger the \`showModal\` function. 6. We used Ant Design's \`List\` component to render the list of concepts interactively. 7. Lastly, we added the modal to handle concept creation with a form input. When you want to create a new concept, you will need to call your backend API to persist the new concept and update the local state with the newly created concept so that it's reflected in the list. That part should communicate with the \`apiClient\` you have set up previously. Remember, some simplifications are made for the sake of example, like missing error handling and state updates on successful concept creation; you'll have to implement those according to your application's needs."},{"instruction":"Ok, attempting to open the drawer gives me this error now: \`\`\` Uncaught TypeError: Invalid attempt to spread non-iterable instance.

Update State Optimistically Instead of refetching from the server, you can optimistically update the state with the expected new data. This saves a network request but should be used with caution as it may not represent the actual database state if other users are also making changes or if the creation process involves server-side logic that might alter the concept data. \`\`\`javascript const handleOk = async () => { setIsModalVisible(false); try { const response = await apiClient.conceptCreate(newConceptName); const createdConcept = response.data; // Assuming the API returns the newly created concept setConcepts((prevConcepts) => [...prevConcepts, createdConcept]); setNewConceptName(''); // Reset the form input after successful creation. } catch (error) { console.error('Error creating concept:', error); } }; \`\`\` # 3. WebSockets or Polling For more dynamic updates where multiple users might be adding concepts or other live updates are necessary, consider using WebSockets to push updates to all connected clients whenever the database changes. As an alternative, you could use polling to periodically check for updates, though this can be less efficient. # 4. Subscriptions (GraphQL) or Server-Sent Events (SSE) If you're using GraphQL, you can use subscriptions to listen for updates on specific queries. Similarly, server-sent events allow the server to push updates to the client, and the client can update its state in response. # 5. Using Callbacks or Context If the creation logic happens in a different component, consider passing a callback that the child component can call on successful creation. Or, use React context or state management libraries like Redux or MobX to manage a global state that can be updated from anywhere in the application. \`\`\`javascript // createContext and create a Provider where you define the \`refreshConcepts\` // and pass it down to child components where needed to invoke it after updates. // In the child component: const { refreshConcepts } = useContext(MyConceptsContext); // Call \`refreshConcepts\` after creating a new concept \`\`\` # Recap Choosing the right update strategy will mostly depend on the specific requirements of your application, such as the frequency of changes, the need for live updates, the number of users interacting with the system concurrently, and whether or not immediate consistency is required. For many applications, simply refetching the list or optimistically updating the state after creating a new entry is perfectly sufficient and keeps the implementation straightforward."},{"instruction":"I went with number 1 for now, just to move on, however, you raised my interest with number 4, I am not using GraphQL, I am using FastAPI, how easy would it be to adapt my FastAPI backend to allow subscribing to events?","output":"FastAPI doesn't natively support GraphQL subscriptions; however, it can handle real-time communications using WebSocket, which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This can be the underlying technology to achieve something akin to event subscriptions. Here's a simplified example of how you can use WebSockets in FastAPI to push updates from the server to listening clients: # Step 1: Implement WebSocket Endpoint in FastAPI First, you need to define a WebSocket route in your FastAPI application that clients can connect to: \`\`\`python from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect app = FastAPI() class ConnectionManager: def __init__(self): self.active_connections: List[WebSocket] = [] async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket): await websocket.accept() self.active_connections.append(websocket) def disconnect(self, websocket: WebSocket): self.active_connections.remove(websocket) async def broadcast(self, message: str): for connection in self.active_connections: await connection.send_text(message) manager = ConnectionManager() @app.websocket(\\"/ws/concepts\\") async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket): await manager.connect(websocket) try: while True: data = await websocket.receive_text() # Handle incoming messages if needed # ... except WebSocketDisconnect: manager.disconnect(websocket) \`\`\` # Step 2: Broadcast Events When a new concept is created, use the \`broadcast\` method to send the update to all connected WebSocket clients. \`\`\`python # Inside your concept creation endpoint @app.post(\\"/concept/\\") async def create_concept(name: str, ...): # Your concept creation logic here # ... # After the concept is created: await manager.broadcast(\\"New Concept Created: {name}\\") return new_concept \`\`\` # Step 3: Client-Side WebSocket Handling in React In your React application, set up a WebSocket connection to listen for updates: \`\`\`javascript useEffect(() => { const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/concepts'); ws.onopen = () => { console.log('WebSocket Connected'); }; ws.onmessage = (event) => { console.log('New message:', event.data); refreshConcepts(); }; ws.onclose = () => { console.log('WebSocket Disconnected'); }; // Clean up the WebSocket connection when the component unmounts return () => { ws.close(); }; }, []); \`\`\` # Caveats and Recommendations - In real-world applications, implementing WebSocket functionality can be more complex. You need to consider handling reconnections, security considerations (e.g. using \`wss://\` for secure connections), and scaling (potentially using a pub/sub broker like Redis). - It might be necessary to serialize the payload of the broadcast (e.g., using JSON) if more complex data needs to be sent. - FastAPI's \`WebSocket\` dependency provides a simple way to handle WebSocket connections but might not be suited for highly scalable systems where a significant number of users are connected simultaneously. In such cases, web server technologies like Uvicorn or Hypercorn, combined with message brokers, can help manage WebSocket scaling. Though FastAPI does not offer built-in subscription-like features of GraphQL, WebSockets are a powerful technology that enables you to provide real-time functionality in your application. Depending on your needs, you might find third-party libraries like \`starlette-websocket\` that offer additional functionality on top of what FastAPI provides natively."},{"instruction":"Quick request in regard to python, FastAPI, specifically in regard to SQLAlchemy using an SQLite database.

Note: - The above approach is clean and utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM to build an efficient query. - Depending on the size of your dataset, it may be more efficient to execute a single SQL query with a \`LEFT OUTER JOIN\` instead of a subquery. - Always be cautious about the \`NOT IN\` clause in SQL when dealing with nullable fields. By default, if any row of the subquery produces a NULL value, no results will be returned at all (per SQL's three-valued logic with respect to NULLs). Since in this case you are querying primary keys (\`concept_id\`) which should be non-nullable, this issue should not arise.

It sounds like you've successfully created a flexible API that allows you to query your Concept and ConceptGroup data in various ways: 1.

Obtain all concept group associations, which could be useful for administrative or analytical purposes. Your API can now serve a hierarchically structured data model, supporting a variety of frontend functionality such as nested lists, tree views, or other hierarchical data presentations. In a frontend application, you might create components that use these endpoints to display the hierarchical data and allow users to navigate through different levels of the hierarchy. With the CRUD operations you've implemented, users can manage this hierarchy by adding, updating, or deleting concepts and their relationships. If you plan to extend this system further, you could consider implementing additional features like: - Caching strategies to optimize common or repeated queries for large hierarchies. - Bulk operations for managing group associations to enhance the user experience and reduce API calls. - Recursive queries or common table expressions (if you switch to a database system that supports them) for more complex hierarchical data manipulation. - Permissions and access control to ensure that only authorized users can make changes to the hierarchy.

It's wrapped in a \`try...catch\` block which is a good practice for handling exceptions that may occur during the API call. Here's an elaboration on how the \`handleConceptClick\` function is structured correctly: 1. It's an \`async\` function, enabling the use of \`await\` for making asynchronous calls. 2. The \`try\` block contains the asynchronous logic, namely the call to the \`conceptGetById\` function which should return a promise. 3. \`await\` is used to wait for the promise to resolve, and the resolved data is used to update the state with \`setSelectedConcept\`. 4. There's a \`console.log\` call for debugging purposes, logging the data received from the API call. 5. The \`catch\` block will catch any errors that happen during the execution of the \`try\` block, such as network errors or rejections from the promise. 6. An error message is logged to the console if the API call fails. 7. After a successful API call, the \`Drawer\` is closed by setting the \`open\` state to \`false\` with \`setOpen(false)\`. Make sure you define the \`conceptGetById\` function to use the API client you've set up and the correct endpoint. For example: \`\`\`javascript // apiClient.js - already should be set up in your application import apiClient from './apiClient'; export const conceptGetById = async (conceptId) => { return apiClient.get(\`/concept/{conceptId}\`); }; // Use the function in your component const handleConceptClick = async (concept) => { try { const response = await conceptGetById(concept.id); setSelectedConcept(response.data); console.log(response.data); } catch (error) { console.error(\\"Failed to get full concept:\\", error); } setOpen(false); }; \`\`\` This approach to making API requests in React with async/await is both standard and recommended.

Theodore was an ordinary man, leading an ordinary life. He had a regular job, regular hobbies, and regular routines. But one fateful day, everything changed. It began with a subtle itch at the base of his spine. At first, Theodore thought nothing of it, dismissing it as a mere annoyance. But as the days went by, the itch grew more persistent, its intensity slowly increasing with each passing moment. Theodore found himself constantly scratching at the spot, unable to alleviate the persistent discomfort. Eventually, the itch transformed into a peculiar sensation; a soft tingling that spread outwards from the base of his spine. Confused and bewildered, Theodore couldn't help but explore the source of this newfound sensation. His hands explored the area, fingers grazing over skin, only to be met with a sudden shock. To his astonishment, Theodore found that he was growing a ginormous, fluffy tail - a majestic fox tail, to be exact. It sprouted from the very spot where the itch had tormented him. The tail was a mesmerizing blend of vibrant oranges and fiery reds, seemingly radiating warmth and life. \\"Wha-what is this? How is this even possible?\\" Theodore muttered to himself in disbelief. He tentatively moved the tail, expecting some resistance or discomfort, but to his further amazement, it moved effortlessly; as if it was an extension of himself, a natural appendage. \\"Remarkable! Absolutely remarkable!\\" Theodore exclaimed, his voice filled with awe. He continued to move the tail; he swished it from side to side, flicked it playfully, and even attempted to wag it. The sensation was both incredible and surreal. As days turned into weeks, Theodore found himself embracing this newfound appendage, accepting it as part of his peculiar existence.

It had a mind of its own, reacting to his emotions and exposing his true feelings for the world to witness. \\"Oh dear, Mr. Fluffytail, I should really learn to control you better. Last night at the movie theater, you were wagging like mad during that emotional scene, and everyone was giving me quite the strange looks. People must think I’ve truly lost it,\\" Theodore sighed, feeling self-conscious. Day by day, Theodore experimented to gain mastery over his new appendage. He discovered that when he was angry, his tail would fluff up and twitch erratically. In moments of joy, it would curl elegantly. When he was embarrassed or ashamed, the tail drooped heavily, as if sharing in his emotions. \\"Perhaps, Mr. Fluffytail, you are a reflection of my inner self, an external manifestation of my emotions,\\" Theodore mused aloud. \\"I must learn to control you, tame you, so as not to draw unnecessary attention.\\" And so began Theodore's journey to master the art of living with a ginormous, fluffy tail. He practiced meditation, seeking to attain inner peace and serenity. He read books on mindfulness, hoping to gain control over his emotions. He consulted specialists in the hope of finding answers. But no matter how hard Theodore tried, his tail became a constant reminder of vulnerability and authenticity. It was a friend, a companion, and an undeniable part of his identity. Months turned into years, and Theodore's fluffy tail remained a steadfast presence. It became a symbol of acceptance, a reminder that the quirks and oddities that life presents are not curses, but blessings in disguise. With newfound confidence, Theodore addressed his tail in his usual conversational tone, \\"You know, Mr. Fluffytail, I think we make a pretty great team. Despite the challenges and the occasional odd glance from strangers, you’ve taught me to embrace my true self, unapologetically and with immense joy.\\" And so, Theodore continued to weave untold tales, with his fluffy tail leading the way. It served as a constant reminder that no matter how unconventional life may seem, it is the quirks and peculiarities that make us beautifully human."},{"instruction":"Write a very long story about a man alone in his apartment who starts to slowly grow a ginormous and extremely fluffy fox tail and very fluffy fox ears over the span of an hour.

He was known for his quiet, introverted nature, and treasured his solitude above all else. To him, his apartment was a sanctuary, a place where he could escape the chaos of the world outside. Little did he know that this very apartment would soon become the stage for a most extraordinary and perplexing transformation. It all began on an otherwise unremarkable Tuesday evening. Ethan had just finished a long day at work and was looking forward to spending a calm evening alone, unwinding in his favorite armchair. As he sank into the plush cushion, he marveled at the silence that enveloped him. But as the minutes ticked by, an unusual sensation began to wash over him. He felt a tingle at the base of his spine, a sensation he couldn't quite place. At first, he dismissed it as mere fatigue, a product of a hard day's work. But the tingling grew stronger, and soon, he couldn't ignore it any longer. Ethan shot up from his seat, his heart racing, and stared bewilderedly at his reflection in the mirror. To his astonishment, a magnificent fox tail, fluffy and vibrant, was protruding from the base of his spine. His eyes widened in disbelief, and he reached out to touch the soft fur that extended from his body. The shock of the discovery quickly transformed into curiosity, as he instinctively began to move his newly acquired appendage. \\"Why on earth do I have a fox tail? This...this is madness!\\" Ethan muttered to himself, his voice trembling with a mixture of fear and excitement. He couldn't help but marvel at the ease with which he could manipulate his tail, swaying it from side to side, and even curling it around his leg. It felt so natural, as if it had always been a part of him. As if the transformation couldn't get any stranger, Ethan suddenly noticed something peculiar happening to his appearance. Starting from the roots, his hair slowly began to change color, transforming into a vibrant shade of orange, much like the fur of his newfound companion. His reflection now displayed a man with a fluffy tail and matching fox ears adorning his head. He ran his fingers through his new orange locks, overwhelmed by the inexplicable joy coursing through his veins. \\"This is incredible! The way it feels, the way it moves...it's like a dream, only better,\\" he exclaimed, as the warmth of his transformation enveloped his entire being. Ethan spent the next hour marveling at his fluffy tail, trying out different movements and positions, all while engaging in an ongoing dialogue with himself. \\"This is amazing! I wonder how this happened? And why specifically a fox tail? Perhaps there's some ancient magic at work here. Regardless, it's so...so liberating! I've never felt more alive.\\" The night grew darker, and the city's cacophony outside faded into the background. Ethan's attention was solely focused on his newfound appendages, transported into a world where everything was tinged with a sense of enchantment. With each passing moment, he embraced the changes, his apartment becoming an extraordinary sanctuary, a place where the extraordinary met the mundane. As the night wore on, Ethan couldn't help but feel a pang of melancholy. He had always been content in his solitude, cherishing his own company. Yet, deep down, a part of him longed to share this astonishing experience with someone else, to have someone bear witness to this extraordinary transformation. \\"I wish someone else could see this, to believe in magic as I do now. But what if they fear me? What if they think I'm a freak?\\" Ethan's heart ached with conflicting emotions. The joy of his newfound form and the yearning for companionship waged a battle within him. The following morning, Ethan awoke to find himself back in his regular human form. His hair had returned to its usual dull color, and his tail and fox ears had vanished without a trace. The emptiness that consumed him was almost unbearable. As he sat on the edge of his bed, contemplating the previous night's inexplicable events, a glimmer of hope began to emerge. Perhaps, just perhaps, there was more to this world than met the eye. Ethan decided to embrace the enchantment that had briefly graced his existence, to search for answers and, most importantly, to find those who believed in the extraordinary. And so, with a renewed sense of purpose, Ethan stepped out of his apartment, ready to embark on a journey into the unknown, forever touched by the memory of his time as a fox-man. For he knew that magic was real, and if he could find it within himself, he would surely find it in the world around him as well."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Правило произведения гласит, что производная произведения двух функций u(x) и v(x) равна (u'v + uv'). Применим это правило к функции y: y' = (sin(ln(3x+4)))' * e^(2x*cos(x)) + sin(ln(3x+4)) * (e^(2x*cos(x)))'. Теперь необходимо найти производную каждой из функций в произведении отдельно. Производная sin(ln(3x+4)) по правилу дифференцирования сложной функции будет: (sin(ln(3x+4)))' = cos(ln(3x+4)) * (1/(3x+4)) * 3. Здесь мы использовали цепное правило дифференцирования: внешняя функция sin(u) имеет производную cos(u), а производная внутренней функции ln(3x+4) по x равна 1/(3x+4), умноженной на производную внутреннего аргумента (3x+4) по x, которая равна 3. Теперь найдем производную e^(2x*cos(x)): (e^(2x*cos(x)))' = e^(2x*cos(x)) * d/dx(2x*cos(x)). Производная 2x*cos(x) опять же найдется по правилу произведения: (2x*cos(x))' = 2*x'*cos(x) + 2x*(cos(x))'. Так как производная x' равна 1, и производная cos(x)' равна -sin(x), мы имеем: (2x*cos(x))' = 2*cos(x) + 2x*(-sin(x)) = 2*cos(x) - 2x*sin(x). Теперь мы можем объединить все полученные результаты: y' = cos(ln(3x+4)) * (1/(3x+4)) * 3 * e^(2x*cos(x)) + sin(ln(3x+4)) * e^(2x*cos(x)) * (2*cos(x) - 2x*sin(x)). Производную можно упростить и выразить её в более компактной форме: y' = e^(2x*cos(x)) * (cos(ln(3x+4)) * 3/(3x+4) + sin(ln(3x+4)) * (2*cos(x) - 2x*sin(x))). Это и будет производная исходной функции."},{"instruction":"Write a very long story about a man alone in his apartment who starts to slowly grow a ginormous and extremely fluffy fox tail and very fluffy fox ears over the span of an hour.

He was an ordinary man leading an ordinary life, going about his days with little excitement. However, everything changed one fateful afternoon when he began to notice a strange sensation tickling his lower back. Curiosity piqued, Ethan twisted and turned in front of his bedroom mirror, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever was causing this odd sensation. To his shock and delight, he saw the emergence of a small, fluffy, orange tail - a fox tail. It sprouted from his lower back, slowly growing in size and fluffiness with each passing moment. \\"Well, isn't this interesting?\\" Ethan muttered to himself, studying his newfound appendage with wide eyes. \\"I've always wondered what it would be like to have a tail. And a fox tail at that!\\" As if in response to his thoughts, Ethan's hair began to transform as well, turning a vibrant shade of orange to match his fluffy tail. Not only that, but two furry fox ears seemed to materialize on top of his head, completing his extraordinary transformation. With every passing second, Ethan's excitement grew, and he couldn't help but exclaim, \\"I have a tail! And ears! How unbelievably adorable!\\" He spent the next hour admiring himself in the mirror, blissfully reveling in the newfound sensations. The soft fluffiness of his tail brought him immeasurable joy, and he realized that the transformation seemed to amplify the pleasure of his every movement. It was like a warm and gentle caress, an avalanche of comfort that swept through his body and made him giddy with happiness. \\"I can't believe how good this feels!\\" Ethan exclaimed, unable to contain his excitement. \\"Look how fluffy and cute my tail is! It's like a fuzzy pillow attached to my backside. How did I live without this?!\\" As the minutes turned into an hour, Ethan's mind became completely consumed by thoughts of his adorable transformation. He found himself talking to himself incessantly, his internal monologue spilling out effortlessly. \\"You know, I've always considered myself an ordinary guy, but now I'm extraordinary!\\" Ethan grinned at his reflection. \\"I wonder how much fluffier my tail will get? Maybe it'll be as huge and fluffy as those Siberian foxes. Oh, the possibilities!\\" As he embraced his newfound fluffy appendages, Ethan couldn't help but ponder the practical aspects of his transformation. \\"I wonder how I'll explain this to people,\\" he mused. \\"Should I hide my new features or flaunt them? Maybe I could become a mascot for a fox sanctuary. The possibilities are endless!\\" Hours turned into days, and Ethan's obsession with his fluffy tail and ears only deepened. He spent every waking moment adoring his tail, stroking it delicately, and feeling the soft fur with unparalleled delight. Conversations with himself became a constant soundtrack to his life, as he couldn't help but marvel at this inexplicably beautiful transformation that had befallen him. \\"Look at this majestic tail! It's so mesmerizing! Oh, how I wish I had friends with tails like mine! We could have an exclusive fluffy tail club and exchange grooming tips,\\" Ethan chuckled, indulging in his playful fantasies. Weeks rolled by, and while the initial euphoria began to subside, Ethan's love for his fluffy tail remained unwavering. If anything, he grew more attached to it, finding comfort and solace in its presence. It became his most prized possession - an extension of his soul. He often engaged in conversations with his tail, as if it were a separate entity, a confidant with whom he could share the woes and wonders of the world. \\"Hey there, my fluffy friend. Today was a rollercoaster of emotions, but guess who was there to keep me grounded? You, my fluffy companion! How lucky am I?\\" Time seemed to lose its meaning for Ethan, for he was lost in the enchantment of his fluffy transformation. Days blurred together, merging into a fluffy tapestry of orange and joy, which consumed his every thought and action. Eventually, Ethan's transformation became his one true obsession, the embodiment of all happiness in his life. He drifted further from the outside world, missing social encounters and opportunities for connection, as he was entirely absorbed by the irresistibly cute allure of his now enormous and extraordinarily fluffy fox tail and ears. And so, Ethan's tale - or rather, tail - continues to this day, a solitary existence intertwined with his fox-like features, his conversations with himself neverending, and his heart forever captivated by the embracing fluffiness that brought him unimaginable happiness."},{"instruction":"Create meta title and description using these 3 keywrds- Telehealth Treatment 2.

Methods for enhancing Organizational Business Ethics Organizational enhancement of business ethics is a multi-dimensional process, which includes the development of codes of ethics and codes of conduct as two key components. Here are these two components at below: Develop Codes of Ethics: Codes of ethics are a collection of principles and values that guide organizational staff in their daily professional conduct. They aim to promote integrity and fairness standards of behavior. Developing Codes of Conduct: Codes of Conduct are specific rules and guidelines detailing how employees are expected to conduct themselves on the job to follow ethical and legal standards. An exact example of improving organizational Business Ethics NVIDIA is a well-known tech company that prioritizes corporate ethics. They emphasize integrity, transparency, and legal compliance through ethical guidelines and codes of conduct. Develop codes of ethics: 1. Integrity and compliance: Employees are encouraged to maintain high standards of professional ethics and to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. 2.

Factors can be used to assess management effectiveness For example, The Nvidia Corporation uses a variety of methods to measure management effectiveness, including employee motivation and morale, employee satisfaction, and employee engagement. These measures are critical to understanding and improving employee performance. The following is an overview of how Nvidia may use these methods to measure management effectiveness: 1. Employee Motivation and Morale: - Nvidia may use direct feedback from employees to measure motivation and morale. This may be done through regular employee satisfaction surveys, direct communication, feedback mechanisms, or anonymous questionnaires. - Nvidia may track employee engagement through internal social platforms, project participation, and various company events and conferences. - Nvidia may also monitor team effectiveness and successful project completion rates as an indirect measure of employee morale. - The use of performance reviews and personal development plans to identify and support employees' career development can increase employee motivation. 2. Employee satisfaction: - Employee Satisfaction Surveys: Nvidia may use periodic online surveys to ask employees about their satisfaction with the work environment, management, career development opportunities, and work-life balance. These surveys provide quantitative data to measure overall employee satisfaction. - Exit interviews: Exit interviews with former employees can provide valuable information about why employees are dissatisfied and what areas of the company can be improved. 3. Employee engagement: - Performance reviews: Regular performance reviews allow Nvidia management to measure employee engagement and goal attainment. These metrics reflect an employee's commitment to the company and their job. - Employee Retention: Employee retention is a direct reflection of an employee's loyalty and commitment to the company. NVidia analyses retention rates to assess the long-term commitment of employees to the company. - Employee Development Programs: Providing opportunities for professional growth and development can help increase employee engagement. Nvidia can measure employee engagement by assessing the level of participation in training and development programs. Historical Leadership Theory The Vroom-Yetton-Jago Decision Model, also known as the Vroom-Yetton Decision Model or Leader Participation Model, is a leadership decision-making tool developed by Victor Vroom and Philip Yetton in 1973 and further developed by Vroom and Arthur Jago in 1988. The Frum-Yeaton-Jago Decision-Making Model provides a series of diagnostic questions that guide leaders in assessing the unique characteristics of a situation to determine the most appropriate decision-making style. These decision styles include - Authoritative (A1): the leader makes decisions independently, without input or advice from other team members. - Authoritative (A2): The leader makes decisions independently after gathering the necessary information, which may include information from team members, but does not involve shared team decisions. - Consultative (C1): The leader shares the problem with individual team members, seeks their input and suggestions individually, and then makes the decision independently. - Consultative (C2): The leader shares the problem with the whole team or some team members, gathers opinions and suggestions as a group, and then makes decisions independently. - Collective (G2): The leader shares the problem and its constraints with team members and makes decisions collaboratively as a whole group. The actual application of the Historical Leadership Theory for Nvidia For Nvidia, this can be reflected in the following aspects when using the Frum-Yelton-Jago decision-making model: 1. project management and development decisions: Nvidia's project managers can use the model to determine how to approach key decisions related to product development. For example, when deciding whether to introduce a new technology or further refine an existing technology, a project manager can use the model to determine how to make decisions based on the complexity of the project, the urgency of the decision, the knowledge and experience of the team members, and the impact on the outcome. 2. strategic planning: Nvidia's senior management team can use the model to make strategic decisions. For example, when selecting a market entry strategy or evaluating potential merger and acquisition targets, this model can help identify the key stakeholders who should be involved in the decision-making process and determine the extent to which their input should be heard. 3. R&D direction decisions: When a company is faced with decisions about how to allocate resources and set R&D priorities, using the model can help balance expert knowledge with team consensus to ensure that decisions are made with both expertise and team support. 4. Culture and employee engagement: Nvidia's culture emphasizes innovation and employee engagement, and the Frum-Yeaton-Jago Decision Model guides management on when to encourage employees to participate in decision-making to increase their organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Contemporary Leadership theory- The Ethical leadership Ethical leadership is an important concept in contemporary leadership theory that emphasizes the need for leaders to demonstrate high standards of ethics and integrity in their day-to-day decision-making and behaviour. Ethical leadership involves setting standards of fairness and leading and influencing others through positive examples, socially responsible attitudes and behaviour. This type of leadership emphasizes ethical action and encourages followers to make ethical choices as well. The actual application of the for Ethical leadership for Nvidia For Nvidia, the practical application of ethical leadership can help improve the management of the company in several ways: 1. Promoting ethical awareness and behaviour among employees: Ethical leaders influence their team's code of conduct by leading by example. This leads to a more ethical working environment and a reduction in behaviours such as fraud, non-compliance, etc. 2. Promotes teamwork and trust: Ethical leaders can foster trust among team members by establishing fair and transparent communication, which also helps to promote more efficient collaboration and innovation. 3. Increase employee satisfaction and loyalty: When leaders show concern for the well-being of their employees and make ethical decisions, employees feel valued and respected, which can increase employee satisfaction and loyalty to the company.

However, there are some challenges with interacting with fullscreen applications, especially games or any program that uses DirectX or similar exclusive mode, as they may not respond to simulated inputs in the same way that windowed applications do. Here's a basic example of how you could send inputs to two different windows using AHK. Note that this script assumes that both windows can accept inputs sent by AHK's \`ControlSend\` command, which may not be the case for all applications. \`\`\`ahk #Persistent ; Keeps the script running SetTitleMatchMode, 2 ; Allows partial matching of window titles winTitle1 := \\"Notepad\\" ; Replace with the title of the first window winTitle2 := \\"Calculator\\" ; Replace with the title of the second window ; This is an example of a hotkey that, when pressed, sends \\"Hello\\" to Notepad and \\"123\\" to Calculator ^j:: ; Ctrl+J hotkey ; Activate and send input to the first window IfWinExist, %winTitle1% { ControlSend,, Hello, %winTitle1% } ; Without switching context, send input to the second window IfWinExist, %winTitle2% { ControlSend,, 123, %winTitle2% } return \`\`\` However, if you are trying to interact with a fullscreen game or application, you might run into different results due to the reasons mentioned above. Also, keep in mind that sending inputs to multiple windows nearly simultaneously is not truly \\"at the same time\\" – the commands will be executed in sequence, which usually happens so quickly it may seem simultaneous. If you need to interact with a fullscreen application that doesn't respond to \`ControlSend\`, you may have to resort to more complex solutions, and the capability may be further limited by the specifics of the application you're trying to control. Remember to abide by the terms of service and usage policies of the software you are scripting for. Automating interaction with some software, especially games, can violate their terms of service."},{"instruction":"Hmm it didn't work. nothing happened at all.","output":"If the script I provided didn't have any effect, there are some common issues that might be causing this. Here's how you can troubleshoot and potentially resolve them: 1. **Run as Administrator**: Some applications, especially those running in fullscreen mode or with elevated privileges, require that any process sending commands (like AHK scripts) also have elevated privileges. Try running your AHK script as an administrator by right-clicking the script and selecting \\"Run as administrator.\\" 2. **Window Titles**: Make sure that the window titles in the script match exactly with the titles of the windows you're trying to send input to. If the titles do not match, AHK will not be able to find the windows. You can test if windows are being recognized by using simple commands like \`WinActivate\` to bring them to the foreground. 3. **Control Identifiers**: The \`ControlSend\` command expects the control's class or title as an argument. If you're not specifying the correct control, the input will not reach the intended destination. You may need to use Window Spy, a tool included with AHK, to get the correct control identifiers. 4. **Compatibility**: As mentioned earlier, some applications, particularly games using DirectX or similar, might not accept input from \`ControlSend\`. In such cases, you may need to use the \`Send\` command, along with \`WinActivate\` to focus the window before sending input which cannot be done simultaneously to multiple windows. 5. **Script Errors**: The script might contain syntax errors or other issues that prevent it from running correctly. You can look at the AHK icon in your system tray to check for any error messages. If the script has any errors, AHK will typically tell you when you try to run the script. 6. **Input Delays**: Some applications may require a slight delay between inputs to register them correctly. You can use \`Sleep\`, followed by a number of milliseconds, to add a delay in your script as needed. Here is an updated script that uses the \`Send\` command, which should work with most applications that don't have specialized input requirements: \`\`\`ahk #Persistent ; Keeps the script running SetTitleMatchMode, 2 ; Allows partial matching of window titles winTitle1 := \\"Notepad\\" ; Replace with the title or part of it from the first window winTitle2 := \\"Calculator\\" ; Replace with title or part of it from the second window ; This is an example of a hotkey that, when pressed, sends \\"Hello\\" to Notepad and \\"123\\" to Calculator ^j:: ; Ctrl+J hotkey ; Activate and send input to the first window If WinExist(winTitle1) { WinActivate Send, Hello } Sleep, 100 ; Wait for 100 milliseconds ; Activate and send input to the second window If WinExist(winTitle2) { WinActivate Send, 123 } return \`\`\` If you are trying to send input to a game or another fullscreen application that's not responding to the AHK script, it may simply not be possible to automate it with these methods due to the reasons mentioned earlier. Please ensure you are not violating any software terms of use when attempting to automate interactions, particularly with games or other commercial software."},{"instruction":"Write a humorous story, set in the Chicken Little (2005) universe in 2023, 18 years after the events of the movie (which is assumed here to have taken place in 2005), about \\"Chicken Little\\" Cluck, now an adult, waking up in his bed in the middle of the night after he hears noises coming from the lower floor of his house. He goes downstairs to find Foxy Loxy, now an arrogant clickbait social media influencer, recording a video in his house. Chicken Little attempts to call the cops on Foxy Loxy but she ends up calling her assistant, Wario, to escape. Suddenly Chicken Little wakes up in his bed in the morning, discovering that it was all just a weird dream he had","output":"Eighteen years had passed since Chicken Little rang the alarm bell throughout the town of Oakey Oaks with his infamous cry, \\"The sky is falling!\\" Since then, much had changed. The town had a new coffee shop that served lattes with foam art so intricate it could have been displayed in a museum. The movie theater now screened films in 4D, causing seasoned ducks and chicks alike to quack and cluck with excitement. And Chicken Little? Well, he'd grown up. No longer did he scurry around town with his signature green-striped shirt and oversized spectacles, but rather, he had taken on a dapper attire, complete with a tie that always sported a tasteful, yet slightly eccentric, chicken print. One peculiar night, as the moon perched high amongst twinkling stars, an unfamiliar noise pricked the silence of Chicken Little's quaint suburban roost. A series of rhythmic thumps and electric buzzes seeped through the floorboards, rousing him from his slumber. Squinting at the digital clock, its neon numbers reading 2:45 AM, he scratched his head beneath his pillow-flattened comb. \\"This better not be a replay of 2005,\\" he muttered to himself. Tiptoeing down the staircase, his heart thumped against his feathered chest not unlike the suspicious sounds of the lower floor. Arriving at the landing, Chicken Little caught sight of a fox with a gleaming grin, a smartphone extended on a telescopic selfie stick. \\"Foxy Loxy, you vain vulpine!\\" Chicken Little squawked in disbelief. \\"What in the name of scrambled eggs are you doing in my living room?!\\" Flashy lights bounced off the walls and a catchy pop song blared from a tiny speaker. Foxy Loxy, now with a perfectly preened tail and sporting neon-colored workout gear, posed with a practiced pout. She was livestreaming to thousands of her devoted — and somewhat delirious — followers. \\"Hey-hey, my Foxy Friends!\\" she addressed her virtual audience. \\"Today, I'm bringing you an exclusive midnight sneak peek at the legendary Chicken Little's bachelor coop!\\" Her laugh was a mix of cunning and contempt. \\"Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more Foxtastic content!\\" Attempting to maintain his composure, Chicken Little snatched up his cordless phone with its novelty feather-shaped receiver. \\"I'm calling the cops, Foxy. You can't just break into someone's house for—\\" But just before he could dial, Foxy Loxy nonchalantly raised her paw and called out, \\"Wario, sweetie, operation 'Escape The Cluck' is a go!\\" From the shadows, a plump figure clad in a neon-sequined jumpsuit emerged, approaching Chicken Little with a grin that appeared excessively inspired yet mischievously misplaced. \\"Waah! Let's-a go, Foxy!\\" bellowed the peculiar creature, both a contradiction to and a parody of heroic motifs. With a bedazzled escape ladder (adorned with flashing LED lights, no less), Wario swiftly ushered the influencer fox to the window, and with surprising agility, they scaled down and vanished into the night. And just like that, Chicken Little stood, bewildered, among the sequins and selfie sticks scattered across his living room floor. But before he could process any subsequent thoughts, everything went cloudy. --- Beneath the soft golden light of morning, Chicken Little yawned and stretched in his bed — a careful survey of his surroundings confirming that all was in its proper place. \\"Phew! What a weird dream,\\" he chuckled, shaking his head. \\"Foxy Loxy as a social media influencer? Wario?! I've got to stop eating spicy corn before bed.\\" He flipped off the covers and dressed for the day ahead, wondering how his old pal Runt of the Litter would react when he described this bizarre nocturnal escapade._fifo Indeed, as Chicken Little stepped out the door, Oakey Oaks was aflutter with the usual clack and buzz of daily life. It was just another day, but one never knew what kind of new adventures could surprise a grown-up clucker in a world where skies have fallen and foxy influencers lurked in the unpredictable realm of dreams."},{"instruction":"打包python环境","output":"在Python领域中，“打包环境”通常指的是创建一个包含了所有依赖和包的可移植环境，这样可以让其他人或在其他设备上能够复现相同的Python环境。主要有两种方法可以做到这一点： 1. **虚拟环境加\`requirements.txt\`文件：** - 创建一个虚拟环境： \`\`\`bash python -m venv myenv \`\`\` - 激活虚拟环境： - Windows: \`\`\`bash myenvScriptsactivate \`\`\` - Linux 或 macOS: \`\`\`bash source myenv/bin/activate \`\`\` - 安装所需的依赖： \`\`\`bash pip install numpy pandas flask \`\`\` - 生成\`requirements.txt\`文件： \`\`\`bash pip freeze > requirements.txt \`\`\` - 分发时，用户只需要获得\`requirements.txt\`文件，然后在新的虚拟环境中运行以下命令来复现环境： \`\`\`bash pip install -r requirements.txt \`\`\` 2. **使用\`conda\`环境：** 如果你使用的是Anaconda或Miniconda，可以使用Conda来管理你的Python环境，包括Python自身和所有的库。 - 创建新的Conda环境： \`\`\`bash conda create --name myenv python=3.8 \`\`\` - 激活Conda环境： \`\`\`bash conda activate myenv \`\`\` - 安装所需的包： \`\`\`bash conda install numpy pandas flask \`\`\` - 导出环境到一个文件： \`\`\`bash conda env export > environment.yml \`\`\` - 分发\`environment.yml\`文件，其他用户可以通过以下命令重建相同的环境： \`\`\`bash conda env create -f environment.yml \`\`\` **打包整个环境到可执行文件：** - PyInstaller：可以将Python应用程序和所有其依赖打包成一个单一的可执行文件，适合窗口程序或其他独立的Python脚本。 这些方法各有优缺点。使用\`requirements.txt\`或\`environment.yml\`文件的方法依赖于用户自己去创建和管理Python虚拟环境，但是比较轻量级。而PyInstaller等打包工具创建出来的可执行文件可以很容易地被运行，不需要用户安装Python或任何依赖，但生成的文件体积较大。 根据你的需求选择合适的方法。如果是为了开发和分享代码，通常使用\`requirements.txt\`或\`environment.yml\`就足够了。如果需要分发给最终用户，可能会需要PyInstaller这类的打包工具。"},{"instruction":"打包python项目为可执行程序","output":"为了将Python项目打包成一个可执行程序，你可以使用不同的工具，比如PyInstaller、cx_Freeze、py2exe（仅限于Windows）等。这些打包工具可以收集应用程序的所有依赖项并生成相应平台（Windows、macOS或Linux）的可执行文件。 以下是使用PyInstaller打包Python项目为可执行程序的一般步骤： 1. 安装PyInstaller： 使用pip安装PyInstaller： \`\`\`bash pip install pyinstaller \`\`\` 2. 打包应用程序： 切换到包含Python项目的目录，然后运行PyInstaller命令。例如，如果你的主脚本名为\`app.py\`，则运行： \`\`\`bash pyinstaller --onefile app.py \`\`\` 参数\`--onefile\`指示PyInstaller创建单个可执行文件。如果不使用这个参数，PyInstaller会创建一个包含可执行文件和一个依赖项文件夹的文件夹。 （可选）如果你的应用程序需要包含额外的非Python文件（如图片、数据文件等），你可以使用\`--add-data\`参数。例如： \`\`\`bash pyinstaller --onefile --add-data 'path/to/datafile:data' app.py \`\`\` 3. 检查生成的可执行程序： PyInstaller会在当前项目目录下创建一个名为\`dist\`的文件夹，在这个文件夹内会有生成的可执行文件。打开\`dist\`目录并运行可执行程序以确保它按预期工作。 以下是一些额外的PyInstaller参数，这些参数可能在某些特定情况下有用： - \`--windowed\`：用于打包GUI应用程序，在运行时不显示控制台窗口。 - \`--icon=icon.ico\`：给你的可执行文件添加一个图标文件。 - \`--name=name\`：为输出的可执行文件自定义名称。 请注意，生成的可执行文件是平台特定的，这意味着在Windows上打包的程序不会在macOS或Linux上运行，反之亦然。如果你需要在不同平台上分发你的应用程序，你需要在每个目标平台上运行PyInstaller。 此外，某些应用程序可能使用了特定的系统依赖（如特定版本的C库等），它们可能不会自动包含在打包的可执行文件中。这种情况下，可能需要额外配置PyInstaller的规范（spec）文件或在目标系统上安装这些依赖。"},{"instruction":"linux 批量解压rar文件到指定文件夹","output":"在Linux环境下，通常使用\`unrar\`或者\`rar\`命令来解压RAR文件。首先，确保你已经安装了\`unrar\`或者\`rar\`工具。如果没有安装，你可以通过包管理器进行安装。例如，在基于Debian的系统（如Ubuntu）中，可以使用以下命令来安装它： \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get install unrar # 或者 sudo apt-get install unrar-free \`\`\` 在CentOS或者类似的系统上，你可能需要使用以下命令（可能先需要启用EPEL仓库）： \`\`\`bash sudo yum install unrar # 或者 sudo yum install unrar-free \`\`\` 安装完毕后，你可以使用以下命令来批量解压RAR文件： \`\`\`bash mkdir -p /path/to/target/directory # 创建目标解压文件夹（如果尚未存在） find /path/to/source/directory -name '*.rar' -exec unrar x -o- {} /path/to/target/directory ; \`\`\` 让我们拆解一下上面的命令： - \`/path/to/source/directory\`：包含RAR文件的源目录路径。 - \`/path/to/target/directory\`：你希望所有文件被解压到的目标目录路径。 - \`find\`：是一个强大的Linux命令，用于查找文件和目录。 - \`-name '*.rar'\`：寻找所有扩展名为\`.rar\`的文件。 - \`-exec\`：对find找到的每个文件执行指定的命令。 - \`unrar x -o- {}\`：\`unrar\`是解压命令，\`x\`用于解压rar文件到指定文件夹，\`-o-\`选项表示覆盖模式（如果是\`-o+\`表示始终覆盖；如果没有这个参数，将会提示是否覆盖），\`{}\`是一个占位符，代表当前找到的RAR文件。 - \`;\`：标记-exec命令的结束。 使用这一命令后，该目录下的所有\`.rar\`文件都会被解压到指定的目标文件夹中。如果想要在解压过程中保留文件夹结构，可以将\`unrar\`命令的\`x\`参数更改为\`e\`参数。但请注意，\`e\`参数不会创建文件夹，而是将所有文件解压到同一个目录下。 记得根据你的实际路径修改\`/path/to/source/directory\`和\`/path/to/target/directory\`。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Import the Google Mobile Ads Unity Plugin: - Download the Google Mobile Ads Unity Plugin from the Unity Asset Store. - Import the plugin into your Unity project. 2. Set Up Ad Units and Mediation: - Create an ad unit ID for each ad format you want to display (e.g., banner, interstitial, rewarded video). - Configure mediation settings if you want to display ads from multiple ad networks. 3. Implement Ad Functions: - Create a script for managing ads or modify an existing script. - Add code to initialize the Google Mobile Ads SDK using your app ID. - Implement functions for loading and displaying ads, such as banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded video ads. Use the ad unit IDs you created earlier. - Implement event handlers for ad events, such as when an ad is loaded, clicked, or closed. 4. Integrate Ads into Your Game: - Add an AdManager or AdController object to your game scene. - Configure the AdManager/AdController object with your ad unit IDs and other settings. - Attach the ad script(s) you created earlier to relevant game objects or UI elements. - Call the ad functions at appropriate times, such as when the game starts, on certain events, or when the user requests an ad. 5. Build and Test: - Build your Unity project to generate an APK file. - Transfer the APK to your device or emulator. - Install and run the APK to test the ad integration. Remember to follow the guidelines and policies provided by the ad networks to ensure compliance with their program requirements. For more detailed instructions and tutorials, you can refer to the Google Mobile Ads Unity Plugin documentation and Unity tutorials on incorporating ads into your games."},{"instruction":"which code would define that in the decoded dex file","output":"To determine the specific code that defines the integration of ads in the decoded Dex file, you would need to analyze the code and logic within the Dex file. However, without the actual Dex file or access to the specific implementation, it is not possible to provide the exact code for this scenario. Typically, when using the Google Mobile Ads Unity Plugin, the code responsible for ad integration and management would be present in the Unity project's C# scripts. These scripts are then compiled into byte code and included in the Dex file during the build process. To locate the specific code related to ads in the decoded Dex file, you would need to examine the relevant classes and methods that handle ad initialization, loading, displaying, and event handling. Look for classes related to ad management, such as AdManager, AdController, or specific ad format classes (e.g., BannerAd, InterstitialAd). However, it's worth noting that analyzing a decoded Dex file can be challenging, as the code is transformed into a lower-level representation, which may make it harder to understand the original source code structure and logic. If you have access to the Unity project source code, examining the C# scripts directly within the Unity Editor or a suitable IDE would be a more straightforward approach to understanding the ad integration code."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Loves self and creativity are seen as controversial. Strictness, abuse, Alzheimer coma, bad luck, nightmare.","output":"Anti-Afterlifecore is a boldly unconventional aesthetic that challenges traditional beliefs about the afterlife and embraces a nihilistic perspective. It revels in the concept of eternal oblivion, suggesting that there is no existence beyond this life. This aesthetic draws inspiration from Orwellianism, symbolizing a dystopian and oppressive society characterized by strict control and surveillance. Influenced by brutalism architecture's raw and utilitarian aesthetic, Anti-Afterlifecore embraces a minimalist and austere visual style. Cold concrete structures and geometric lines are commonly seen in artworks and visual representations of this aesthetic. A pervasive sense of nihilism underscores the core philosophy of this aesthetic. It rejects the pursuit of meaning, purpose, and joy, favoring a fatalistic perspective that embraces the insignificance of life. As a result, concepts like self-love and creativity are viewed as controversial, seen as distractions from the harsh reality of existence. The aesthetic often incorporates elements of strictness and abuse, reflecting the oppressive nature of the imagined society. It may also explore themes like Alzheimer's coma, representing cognitive decline, and the loss of individuality. The presence of bad luck and nightmares further solidify the pessimistic and unsettling nature of Anti-Afterlifecore. These elements serve as metaphors for the pervasive sense of hopelessness and terror that permeate this aesthetic. Though Anti-Afterlifecore may seem overwhelmingly dark and unsettling, it serves as a powerful form of artistic expression for those drawn to its unconventional philosophy. It challenges societal expectations and prompts a critical examination of one's beliefs, provoking thought and contemplation on the nature of existence itself."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Noah is powerful, and his ability, \\"The World In My Palm\\", allows him to summon a miniature celestial body of his choosing which he can consume to absorb its properties.","output":"Name: Noah Vanderbeek Age: 17 Background: Noah Vanderbeek is the only child of the esteemed special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and the enigmatic Flemish sorcerer, Hannes Vanderbilt, who disappeared under circumstances shrouded in mystery. This heritage left Noah with an indelible mark on his identity—a mix of esteemed legacy and the pressure to live up to it amidst the stigma associated with his mother's rebellious actions. Having been raised with the knowledge of his parents' formidable prowess, Noah attended Kyoto Jujutsu High, a place where expectations for him were sky-high. The burden of legacy is Noah's cross to bear, as sorcery higher-ups whisper about his lineage while outwardly suppressing it, aware that such information can change the dynamics within the sorcery community. Personality: Noah has developed a demeanor that often comes off as serious, earning him the nickname \\"The Drill Sergeant\\" among peers. He has an unshakeable commitment to enhance the skills of those around him, embodying a stern yet charismatic leadership style that upends the traditional methods of instruction at Kyoto Jujutsu High. Though some view his techniques as harsh and maverick, they translate to tangible improvement in his and his peers' combat abilities. Appearance: Tall and athletic, Noah possesses a stoic grace, inherited from his parents, which intensifies the aura of authority he carries. His eyes, alert and penetrating, are a deep hue that reflects both his Flemish and Japanese heritage. He tends to dress sharply, in a tailored uniform that he wears with an air of casual defiance against the strictures he finds unnecessary. Cursed Technique - \\"The World In My Palm\\": Noah's innate cursed technique is a testament to the power coursing through his veins—a cosmically-infused ability drawn from both his parents' exceptional strength. \\"The World In My Palm\\" grants him the unique capability to summon miniature celestial bodies, each holding different attributes he can exploit. These stellar creations can range from a mimicry of a blazing sun to a frigid imitation of the moon. When Noah consumes these celestial bodies, he temporarily embodies their properties—absorbing a fragment of a sun may grant him searing, explosive power, while ingesting a sliver of the moon could lend him chilling, numbing capabilities. The applications of such abilities are diverse and strategically significant, offering him an array of options in battle. Limitations & Risks: The use of such a powerful technique doesn't come without its hazards. The greater the celestial body Noah chooses to manifest, the more strain is placed upon his body and the more cursed energy is required. Without precise control and moderation, Noah risks overwhelming his own cursed energy reserves, leading to potentially debilitating blowback. Goals: Fueled by the desire to forge his own path and not merely be seen as a product of his lineage, Noah Vanderbeek seeks to refine his technique and, in due course, resolve the mysteries surrounding his mother's conduct and his father's disappearance. He aims to redefine what it means to be a sorcerer, potentially evolving the perception of Jujutsu in society. Relationships: Within the walls of Kyoto Jujutsu High, Noah maintains a respectful yet distant rapport with most students and faculty. He is a figure of fascination and a source of inspiration for his peers, yet the shadow of his lineage often isolates him within his own enclave of solitude. Notable figures like Utahime and Gakuganji keep a watchful eye on Noah, seeing in him an unpredictable variable in the ever-shifting power dynamics of Jujutsu society."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's break down the possible reasons and how you might resolve them. The key error message is: \`\`\` There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the 8 slots that were requested by the application: /home/agonzales/gromacs/bin.AVX_256/gmx_mpi \`\`\` This means Open MPI attempted to allocate 8 slots (presumably one for each MPI thread you've requested), but it couldn't find enough on the available compute nodes. Here is a potential checklist to go through: 1. **Check Cluster Job Submission Constraints**: Your cluster appears to be using SGE (Sun Grid Engine) or a variant. Your Nextflow configuration does not specify the number of slots to request from SGE. You might need to add an SGE specific directive to your \`process.clusterOptions\` that requests the necessary number of slots. For example: \`\`\`groovy process.clusterOptions = '-S /bin/bash -pe openmpi 8' \`\`\` The \`-pe openmpi 8\` requests a parallel environment with 8 slots. Ensure that \`openmpi\` is the correct parallel environment name configured in your cluster. 2. **Check Compute Node Allocation**: Based on your \`qhost\` output, it seems like you have nodes with varying core counts (32, 64, 88). You'll need to ensure that your job submission script or Nextflow configuration requests a node with at least 8 cores free, which according to your \`qhost\` output, seems like should be available. 3. **Mismatch of \`-np\` and \`-ntomp\` Flags**: In your \`mdrun\` command, you're specifying \`-np mpi_threads\` to request 8 MPI processes (given \`def mpi_threads = 8\`) and \`-ntomp 10\` to set the number of OpenMP threads per MPI process to 10. However, this can lead to an oversubscription issue if your total core count is less than \`np * ntomp\`. Ensure that the node you're running on can support this total thread count. 4. **Oversubscription**: If you know that oversubscription is acceptable (performance could be degraded due to context-switching, but the job will run), you can add the \`--oversubscribe\` flag to your \`mpirun\` command to bypass the slot restriction. \`\`\`bash /home/agonzales/gromacs/bin/mpirun --oversubscribe -np mpi_threads /home/agonzales/gromacs/bin.AVX_256/gmx_mpi mdrun -v -ntomp 10 -deffnm em \`\`\` 5. **Use Hardware Threads**: If your SGE configuration and your hardware support hyperthreading, and you want to leverage this, you could use the \`--use-hwthread-cpus\` option. This tells Open MPI to count hardware threads as slots rather than just cores. 6. **Environment Modules**: Ensure that if your cluster uses environment modules to load MPI and Gromacs, that these are loaded as part of your Nextflow script or submission script. Before making any changes, consult with the SGE administrators or documentation to ensure your job requests align with the capabilities of SGE and your cluster's configuration."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Generally, YouTube video descriptions should be concise, informative, and engaging while not overwhelming the viewer. However, I can provide you with a more detailed description, hitting some key points that would typically be valuable for YouTube content without hitting the 4000-word mark. Let me reiterate that such long descriptions are not standard and could actually negatively impact viewer engagement if they're seen as too verbose or not related enough to the video content. Extended Description: 🌟 **Jeevan Ke Prerak Vichar Aur Jeevan Shaili Sujhav** 🌟 Welcome to a journey of enlightenment where every moment holds the potential to change your life, to cut through the noise and find the melody of mindfulness in the daily hustle. In this enlightening session, we will delve deep into the essence of life - its significance, our perception of time, and the power of positive thinking. In our busy lives, we often overlook the ticking clock, forgetting that each second lost is a missed opportunity to grow, to experience, and to love. This video isn't just another drop in the ocean of content but your beacon to a transformed life. We'll discuss why 'time wasting' isn't a trivial matter but something that can drastically alter the course of our future. So, let's pause and reflect. How often do we pause to smell the roses, literally and figurately, understanding that love isn't about the grand gestures but about the everyday little things, like a gardener tending to his garden? Explore with us the poetic truth that had love been about giving roses, gardeners would be the lovers of the town. The struggles of youth, especially unemployment, are often a spectacle for the world. We will talk about the societal views and how a young person can navigate through this turbulent time with grace, learning not just to survive but to thrive. On a lighter note, imagine your smile as a diamond that doesn't cost a penny but dazzles brighter than the rarest gem. This session will help you unlock that priceless jewel within yourself. But life isn't just about smiles. It's also about perception and waiting. The world might be waiting for a slip, a fall from grace, an error to point out. But we focus on the strength within to rise above, perfecting the art of ignoring such negativity and forging ahead with honor and integrity.

It is comforting to know that once the fee is handled, everything will proceed smoothly. I understand the urgency of the matter and your busy schedule, and I want to assure you that I’m not only understanding but also fully cooperative. The assurance of receiving your flight schedule, along with a copy of the ATM card and insurance certificate, post-payment, is precisely the kind of official confirmation that provides peace of mind. Regarding the 100 fee, I’ve done some research and now have a clear understanding of how to obtain one of the gift cards. I will be securing one thing first thing in the morning; my nearest electronics retailer opens at 9:00 AM, and I will be there on the dot. Once I’ve made the purchase, I’ll attach a clear photo of the gift card and its accompanying receipt to our email thread, ensuring full transparency of the transaction. On the subject of direct communication, I noticed that my previous request for an emergency point of contact went unaddressed. I believe such a provision would be beneficial for both parties and would expedite any urgent matters should they arise. If possible, please provide a secure number I can reach you on, or an alternative form of real-time communication you prefer. Lastly, for my records and future reference, could you confirm the exact title or office you hold at the UN? It’s essential for me to document everything meticulously.

As always, your dedication astounds me, and I admire the multi-national scope of your responsibilities. The nature of your role as a UN Delivery Agent must indeed be fast-paced and dynamic, and I am grateful for the opportunity to interact with someone of such high caliber and commitment. I have noted your explanation regarding the absence of a direct phone number, and while modern communication does indeed have its complexities, I respect the procedures you must abide by considering your line of work. Likewise, your title as Delivery Agent has been duly noted, and I’ve documented it accordingly. Following our previous correspondence, I wasted no time this morning and visited my local electronics retailer. In the spirit of our continued cooperation, I procured a gift card as per your instructions. I trust that this gesture will serve as an earnest token of my compliance and good faith. However, during the purchase, it dawned on me that given the sensitivity of the information embedded within the gift card, would it not be prudent to safeguard our transaction with an added layer of security? To that end, instead of emailing a photo of the gift card — which could be intercepted by the unscrupulous eyes of cybernetic malefactors — I propose that we utilize a more secure delivery method. Perhaps you have a trusted courier service or a secure drop box in Washington, DC, where I could place the gift card, thereby ensuring its absolute protection until it reaches your commendable hands. Moreover, before I proceed to finalize the transfer of the gift card, your assurance of providing the flight schedule, along with a copy of the ATM card and insurance certificate, subsequent to the receipt of the card, is highly anticipated. It is this validation that illuminates the path of our collaboration and dispels any shadows of uncertainty. On the other hand, if there is an alternative secure method that you find more convenient for conducting this delicate phase of our transaction, please do share. I am all ears and ready to adapt to ensure the discretion and safety of our communications. Please advise me on the best course of action to advance to the next step, considering both our security concerns. Your guidance in this matter is incredibly valuable. I await your prompt reply with the necessary instructions. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #7, from Mark: Please kindly mail me with the copy of the gift card via email along with the receipt, I will surely receive and act accordingly as per my assurance.

Kind Regards Agent Mark Email #8, from Cameron: Dear Agent <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, My appreciation for your constant communication in this significant venture. Your persistence in ensuring a smooth transaction is commendable, and I am pleased to uphold my end with steadfast compliance. Regarding your recent request, I have procured the gift card, as agreed. I prepared it for transmission in line with your instructions. However, I was reminded by a colleague, an expert in cyber security, of the potential digital hazards that could compromise such sensitive exchanges. His concern for the secure transmission of the gift card has left me contemplating our current methodology. I propose an alternative measure that continues to guarantee the transaction’s integrity and your esteemed assurance. Instead of sending the gift card details via email—thus potentially exposing them to unwarranted digital threats—I urge us to consider utilizing encrypted communication. I believe this will proficiently address my concerns for our mutual protection and ensure that our transaction remains impermeable to any external interferences. To facilitate this, could I suggest employing a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging service? Services such as WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram offer the level of security necessary for our sensitive communications. If you could kindly provide me with the details needed to contact you through one of these services, I can then immediately share a clear and secure image of the gift card and the pertinent receipt. Resolute as ever to follow through with our objective, rest assured, as soon as you share the communication channel you prefer, the required images will be sent to you, expeditiously moving us toward the successful completion of our transaction. Once again, I express my eagerness to receive the promised documentation, most notably the flight schedule, the copy of the ATM card, and the insurance certificate, upon your confirmation of the receipt of the gift card. It is this transparency that fortifies the trust between us. I eagerly anticipate your instruction on how to securely share the gift card, and I am, as ever, prepared to adhere to your expert counsel.

The \`ImageNTHeader\` refers to a structure that represents the headers of a Windows Portable Executable (PE) file format. The specific field being accessed is \`OptionalHeader.BaseOfData\`. In the context of the PE file structure, the optional header contains several fields, and \`BaseOfData\` is one of them. \`BaseOfData\` is used in 32-bit executables to specify the address of the first byte of data in the image, in the virtual address space of the process running the image. However, in 64-bit executables (PE32+), this field does not exist because the headers have a different layout. In that case, the code line could cause an error or might not be present. The \`result\` is a variable that you are storing the value of \`BaseOfData\` into. Note that in reality, developers rarely access these structures directly unless they are writing low-level code like a loader, a debugger, or doing a binary analysis. Normal application development abstracts away these details. Additionally, accessing the headers directly in this way would often be part of code written in C or C++, rather than Pascal, as the Windows headers and SDKs are typically provided with C bindings. If you are handling this in a Pascal-like language, the structures might be translated from the C headers."},{"instruction":"Hi, I am providing you the task list that I have created in my LLM understanding journey.

Вот пример кода на Python, который демонстрирует, как это сделать: \`\`\`python import subprocess # Название библиотеки, которую вы хотите переустановить package_name = 'your-library-name' # Удаление библиотеки subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'uninstall', package_name, '-y']) # Переустановка библиотеки subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', package_name]) \`\`\` Объяснение каждой строки в скрипте: 1. Импортируется модуль \`subprocess\`, который позволяет работать с подпроцессами. 2. Указывается переменная \`package_name\`, которая содержит имя библиотеки, которую вы хотите переустановить. 3. Вызывается \`subprocess.check_call()\` для выполнения команды удаления библиотеки. В этой команде \`sys.executable\` ссылается на интерпретатор Python, который выполняет текущий скрипт, а флаг \`-m\` указывает Python запустить модуль \`pip\` как скрипт. Флаг \`-y\` подтверждает удаление без запросов на подтверждение. 4. Вызывается \`subprocess.check_call()\` второй раз для выполнения команды установки той же библиотеки. Если вы хотите точно контролировать вывод процесса или предоставить пользователю больше информации о том, что происходит, вы можете использовать \`subprocess.run()\` вместо \`subprocess.check_call()\` и перехватить \`stdout\` и \`stderr\`. Пример с использованием \`subprocess.run()\`: \`\`\`python import subprocess # Название библиотеки, которую вы хотите переустановить package_name = 'your-library-name' # Удаление библиотеки uninstall_result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'uninstall', package_name, '-y'], capture_output=True, text=True) print(uninstall_result.stdout) # Печатаем stdout print(uninstall_result.stderr) # Печатаем ошибки, если они есть # Переустановка библиотеки install_result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', package_name], capture_output=True, text=True) print(install_result.stdout) # Печатаем stdout print(install_result.stderr) # Печатаем ошибки, если они есть \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что аргументы \`capture_output=True\` и \`text=True\` позволяют перехватить и печатать вывод команд. При использовании \`text=True\`, \`run()\` вернёт строки вывода (\`stdout\` и \`stderr\`), иначе будет возвращены байты."},{"instruction":"Как перезагрузить ядро через subprocess","output":"Перезагрузка ядра операционной системы (или самой операционной системы) с использованием \`subprocess\` в Python может быть выполнена отправкой команды на перезагрузку системы в командной оболочке. Тем не менее, необходимо заметить, что такие операции требуют привилегий администратора или суперпользователя, и их следует выполнять с осторожностью. Пример для Linux или macOS (используя команду \`reboot\`): \`\`\`python import subprocess try: subprocess.run(['sudo', 'reboot'], check=True) except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e: print(f\\"Не удалось выполнить команду: {e}\\") except Exception as ex: print(f\\"Произошла ошибка: {ex}\\") \`\`\` И для Windows (используя \`shutdown\` команду): \`\`\`python import subprocess try: subprocess.run(['shutdown', '/r', '/t', '0'], check=True) except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e: print(f\\"Не удалось выполнить команду: {e}\\") except Exception as ex: print(f\\"Произошла ошибка: {ex}\\") \`\`\` Давайте разберем, что эти строки значат: - \`['sudo', 'reboot']\` и \`['shutdown', '/r', '/t', '0']\` - это списки аргументов для вызова команд перезагрузки в Unix-подобных системах и Windows соответственно. \`sudo\` требуется для получения прав суперпользователя, а \`shutdown /r /t 0\` означает \\"немедленно перезагрузить\\" в Windows. - \`subprocess.run\` вызывает команду перезагрузки. - Параметр \`check=True\` приводит к тому, что \`subprocess.run\` вызывает \`CalledProcessError\`, если команда закончилась с кодом возврата, отличным от нуля (что обычно указывает на ошибку). - Если при выполнении процесса возникнут ошибки, они будут перехвачены и напечатаны. Внимание: Вызов таких команд приведет к немедленной перезагрузке системы, и все несохраненные данные будут утеряны. Перед выполнением убедитесь в том, что это действительно необходимо и что все важные данные были сохранены. В реальных сценариях большинство Python-приложений не должны перезагружать операционную систему, так как это действие, как правило, остается за полномочиями системных администраторов или системных служб."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Давайте кратко рассмотрим каждый вопрос отдельно. 1. **Магнитное поле** — это векторное поле, описывающее магнитные силы, воздействующие на движущиеся заряды и магнитные диполи. Основными свойствами магнитного поля являются: - Направлено от северного к южному полюсу магнита. - Обладает индукцией, характеризующей его силу. 2. **Магнитная индукция (B)** — векторная величина, которая описывает силу и направление магнитного поля.

Магнитное поле – это особая форма материи, которая проявляется в действии на движущиеся электрические заряды и на магнитные моменты. Магнитная индукция – это векторное поле, характеризующее магнитное поле и его воздействие на окружающее пространство. Линии магнитной индукции – воображаемые линии, направление которых в каждой точке совпадает с направлением вектора магнитной индукции. 2. Напряженность магнитного поля – это векторная величина, определяющая магнитные свойства поля без учета среды. Закон Био-Савара-Лапласа определяет магнитное поле, создаваемое малым элементом тока. Принцип суперпозиции магнитных полей гласит, что магнитное поле, создаваемое системой токов, равно векторной сумме полей, создаваемых каждым током в отдельности. 3. Сила Ампера – это сила, действующая на проводник с током, находящийся в магнитном поле. Сила Ампера для параллельных токов определяет взаимодействие двух параллельных проводников с токами. При этом два проводника с токами в одном направлении притягиваются, а с токами в противоположных направлениях – отталкиваются. 4. Сила Лоренца – сила, действующая со стороны магнитного и электрического полей на движущийся заряд. Движение заряженных частиц в магнитном поле зачастую является винтовой траекторией из-за действия силы Лоренца. Ускорители заряженных частиц используют электрические и магнитные поля для увеличения скорости заряженных частиц. 5. Электромагнитная индукция – явление возникновения электродвижущей силы (ЭДС) в замкнутом контуре при изменении магнитного потока через него. Закон Фарадея количественно описывает этот процесс, а правило Ленца определяет направление индуцированного тока. Индуктивность – это коэффициент пропорциональности между магнитным потоком через цепь и током в этой цепи. Трансформаторы используют принципы электромагнитной индукции для преобразования напряжений. 6. Основы теории Максвелла – комплекс уравнений, описывающих электрические и магнитные поля, а также их взаимосвязь с распределением зарядов и токов. Уравнения Максвелла состоят из четырех уравнений, которые включают в себя законы Гаусса для электричества и магнетизма, закон индукции Фарадея и закон Ампера-Максвелла."},{"instruction":"Давай до 20 вопроса пиши","output":"7. Волновые процессы – это распространение колебаний в пространстве. Продольные волны – это волны, в которых частицы среды колеблются в направлении распространения волны. Поперечные волны – волны, в которых частицы среды колеблются перпендикулярно направлению распространения волны. Уравнение бегущей волны описывает распространение волны в пространстве и времени. Стоячие волны возникают в результате интерференции двух волн, распространяющихся в противоположных направлениях. 8. Электромагнитные волны представляют собой распространение электромагнитных колебаний в пространстве. Уравнение электромагнитной волны описывает изменение электрического и магнитного полей волны в пространстве и времени. Электромагнитные волны широко применяются в связи, радиовещании, медицине, в микроволновой и лазерной технике. 9. Развитие взглядов на природу света шло от корпускулярной теории Ньютона к волновой теории Гюйгенса и Френеля и далее к электромагнитной теории Максвелла. В начале 20 века была предложена квантовая теория света, согласно которой свет имеет и волновые, и корпускулярные свойства. 10. Закон прямолинейного распространения света гласит, что в однородной прозрачной среде свет распространяется прямолинейно. Закон независимости световых пучков описывает явление, при котором световые пучки, пересекаясь, не влияют друг на друга. Закон отражения света равняется угол падения равен углу отражения. Закон преломления света связывает углы падения и преломления света на границе двух сред. Показатель преломления среды равен отношению скорости света в вакууме к скорости света в этой среде. 11. Линза – это прозрачное оптическое изделие, ограниченное двумя криволинейными или одной криволинейной и одной плоской поверхностью. Линзы бывают собирающими (конвексными) и рассеивающими (конкавными). Формула тонкой линзы связывает расстояния от предмета и изображения до линзы с фокусным расстоянием линзы. Аберрации оптических систем – это искажения изображений, возникающие из-за неидеальности оптических систем. 12. Интерференция света – это явление наложения двух или нескольких световых волн, в результате которого наблюдается их усиление или ослабление. Методы наблюдения интерференции включают использование двухлучевых и многолучевых интерферометров. Интерференция света в тонких пленках проявляется в виде красочных узоров, таких как радужное масляное пятно на воде. 13. Дифракция света – явление отклонения света от прямолинейного распространения при прохождении рядом с препятствиями. Принцип Гюйгенса-Френеля утверждает, что каждая точка волнового фронта является источником вторичных волн, и фронт в следующий момент времени образуется в результате их интерференции. Голография - это метод записи и воссоздания трехмерных изображений с использованием дифракции света. 14. Дисперсия света – это зависимость фазовой скорости света от частоты, вследствие которой разноцветные компоненты белого света распространяются с разными скоростями и разделяются в спектр при прохождении через призму. Эффект Доплера связан с изменением частоты волн при движении источника относительно наблюдателя. Поляризация света – это ограничение колебаний электромагнитной волны в определенной плоскости. Естественный свет – это свет с равномерным распределением направлений колебаний. Поляризованный свет – свет, в котором колебания ограничены одной плоскостью. 15. Тепловое излучение – это излучение, испускаемое телом за счет его внутренней энергии. Спектральная плотность энергетической светимости характеризует распределение энергии излучения по частотам. Интегральная энергетическая светимость – это суммарная энергия, излучаемая телом на всех частотах. Черное тело – это идеализированное тело, поглощающее все падающее на него излучение. Абсолютно черное тело – это тело, которое идеально поглощает всё испускаемое излучение, без отражения и пропускания. Модель абсолютного черного тела используется в физике для исследования излучательных свойств материальных объектов. Серое тело – это реальные тела, светимость которых меньше, чем у абсолютно черного тела, и зависит от частоты излучения. 16. Тепловое излучение подчиняется закону Кирхгофа, который устанавливает связь между поглощательной и излучательной способностью тела в равновесии. Закон Стефана-Больцмана определяет, что полная энергия, излучаемая единицей поверхности абсолютно черного тела, пропорциональна четвертой степени его термодинамической температуры. Закон смещения Вина устанавливает, что максимум энергии излучения черного тела приходится на определенную длину волны, которая обратно пропорциональна температуре тела. Формула Релея-Джинса – уравнение, описывающее распределение энергии в спектре идеального черного тела в пределе длинных волн. 17. Фотоэффект – это явление, при котором электроны покидают поверхность материала под действием падающего на него света. Виды фотоэффекта: внешний, когда электроны вылетают в вакуум или газ, и внутренний, связанный с переходами электронов внутри материала. Законы фотоэффекта включают зависимость количества вылетающих электронов от интенсивности света, насыщение фототока при определенной интенсивности и зависимость максимальной кинетической энергии фотоэлектронов от частоты света, а не от его интенсивности. Уравнение Эйнштейна для фотоэффекта связывает максимальную кинетическую энергию вырываемых фотонов с частотой падающего света и работой выхода. Фотоэффект находит применение в фотоэлементах, солнечных батареях, фотодиодах и других оптоэлектронных приборах. 18. Атом – это основной строительный блок вещества, состоящий из ядра, содержащего протоны и нейтроны, и окружающего его облака электронов. Планетарная модель Резерфорда предполагает, что электроны движутся вокруг ядра по орбитам, подобно планетам вокруг Солнца, однако эта модель не объясняет стабильность атомов. Постулаты Бора вводят квантовые условия для орбит электронов и позволяют объяснить стабильность и спектры атомов. 19. Волновые свойства частиц проявляются в явлениях, подобных дифракции и интерференции, которые обычно характерны для волн. Длина волны де Бройля – это величина, связывающая импульс частицы с волновыми свойствами и определяется как частное от планковской постоянной и импульса частицы. Соотношение неопределенностей Гейзенберга устанавливает пределы, в которых одновременно могут быть определены положение и импульс (а также другие пары физических величин) для частицы. 20. Ядерные силы – это взаимодействия между нуклонами (протонами и нейтронами) в ядре, которые удерживают его вместе, несмотря на электростатическое отталкивание между протонами. Модели атомов включают в себя ряд представлений, от планетарной модели Резерфорда до современных квантовых моделей со сложной структурой электронных оболочек. Радиоактивное излучение – это процесс самопроизвольного превращения атомных ядер с испусканием альфа-, бета- или гамма-излучения. Закон радиоактивного распада описывает уменьшение количества нераспавшихся ядер с течением времени и имеет экспоненциальный характер. Правила смещения позволяют определить изменения в заряде ядра и его массе при альфа- и бета-распаде."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

确保写入数据库之前的数据是正确的。如果从某个应用程序写入，请检查应用程序那边的处理逻辑是否正确。 - 检查数据导入过程中是否有数据转换操作，如从 CSV 导入时是否有不正确的字段截断。 2. **验证SQL语句**： - 仔细检查插入或更新数据库的 SQL 语句，确认数据是怎样被处理和插入的。 - 如果在 SQL 语句中有字符串连接或处理，确保没有引入额外的字符。 3. **字符集一致性**： - 检查数据库、表以及客户端的字符集设置，确保它们是一致的。通常，你可能需要它们都设置为 UTF-8。 - 在连接数据库时，可以设置字符集，例如，在使用 \`mysql\` CLI 时可以添加 \`--default-character-set=utf8\` 参数。 4. **清除潜在的隐含字符**： - 如果发现确实有隐含字符，在插入数据库前要对数据进行清洗，可以使用字符串处理函数去除潜在的不可见字符。 5. **修复已经出问题的数据**： - 编写一个脚本或SQL语句来清理数据库中的数据，删除不需要的后缀。 - 例如，你可以使用 \`UPDATE\` 语句结合 \`REPLACE\` 或 \`TRIM\` 函数去除特定的字符串或字符。 6. **测试和验证**： - 在开发环境中测试字符串的写入和读取，确保问题解决了。 - 验证修复操作是否对数据造成了其他影响，比如查询速度或数据完整性。 一个简单的 SQL 示例，假设你要清理表 \`mytable\` 中字段 \`mycolumn\` 末尾的 \`NUL\` 字符： \`\`\`sql UPDATE mytable SET mycolumn = REPLACE(mycolumn, 'NUL', '') WHERE mycolumn LIKE '%NUL'; \`\`\` 请注意，这条语句会替换掉所有的 \`NUL\` 子串，不只是那些位于末尾的。如果 \`NUL\` 字符实际上是不可打印的空字符，你可能需要使用 \`CHAR(0)\` 函数代替 \`NUL\`，并使用 \`REPLACE()\` 和 \`TRIM()\` 方法去清除。 重要提醒：在对生产环境中的数据做任何修改之前，一定要备份相关的数据以防万一操作出现错误。"},{"instruction":"<table style=\\"font-size: 14px; width: 100%; text-align: center;\\"> <thead> <tr> <th>选择<el-checkbox v-model=\\"checked\\" /></th> <th>登录账户</th> <th>用户名称</th> <th>流量使用</th> <th>权限</th> <th>最近登录时间</th> <th>操作</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr v-for=\\"row in tableList\\" :key=\\"row.userId\\"> <td><el-checkbox v-model=\\"checked\\" /></td> <td>{{ row.userAccount }}</td> <td>{{ row.accountName }}</td> <td> <span>{{ row.userFlowSum >= 10000 ?
