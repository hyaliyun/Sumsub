Firstly, this treaty marked the end of the devastating Thirty Years’ War, a conflict that had plagued Europe and resulted in widespread destruction, loss of life, and economic devastation. By bringing about a resolution to this war, the Treaty of Westphalia helped restore stability and establish a new framework for peace in Europe. Secondly, the treaty introduced the concept of state sovereignty into international relations. Prior to Westphalia, the prevailing idea was that the authority of a ruler extended over the religious practices of their subjects. However, this treaty emphasized the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, meaning that the ruler of a territory had the right to determine its religion. This concept played a crucial role in the development of modern nation-states, as it laid the foundation for the idea that states have exclusive and autonomous authority within their own borders. Furthermore, the Treaty of Westphalia contributed to the evolution of the modern nation-state system. The negotiated settlement recognized and legitimized the existence of numerous independent states, effectively ending the era of supranational authority and religious dominance. This helped shift the balance of power away from the authority of empires and the Catholic Church, towards the sovereignty of individual states. The treaty laid the groundwork for the formation of modern states and the development of institutions that would later shape Western civilization. Lastly, the Treaty of Westphalia promoted the concept of religious tolerance and coexistence. While it did not guarantee complete religious freedom, it acknowledged the need for tolerance and respect between different religious groups. The acknowledgment of diverse religious beliefs and the establishment of political arrangements to protect the rights and interests of religious minorities had a profound impact on the subsequent development of Western societies, fostering an atmosphere of religious pluralism and paving the way for the modern concepts of religious freedom and human rights. In summary, the Treaty of Westphalia is significant to the development of modern western civilization due to its role in ending the Thirty Years’ War, introducing the principle of state sovereignty into international relations, contributing to the evolution of the modern nation-state system, and promoting religious tolerance and coexistence. These outcomes had far-reaching implications that shaped the trajectory of Western civilization and laid the groundwork for the values and institutions that define it today.\\"","output":"The Treaty of Westphalia, signed in 1648, was a pivotal moment in shaping modern western civilization.

Simple and rapid colorimetric method is based using smartphone camera which is determined the iodine using RGB (red, green and blue) colour intensity (Vucane et al., 2020). These are the equation used for calculation of colour intensity and absorbance as follow: (Peamaroon, Jakmunee and Moonrungsee, 2021) Colour intensity = I_b-I_s I_b – colour intensity of blank sample. I_s – colour intensity of sample. This equation shows the Beer Lambert’s Law, Absorbance = log (I_b/I_s ) The liquid products that contain fats are milk and oil.

Please write your answer in paragraphs of full sentences. No bullet points.","output":"The 1812 Overture is an orchestral piece composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1880. It was specifically written to commemorate the successful defense of Russia against Napoleon's invading forces in 1812 during the French invasion. The overture is an epic composition, designed to convey the grandeur and intensity of the historic event. In its entirety, the 1812 Overture represents a musical depiction of the stages of the conflict. It begins with a solemn and melancholic introduction, symbolizing the peaceful prelude to war. This section introduces the melodic theme that will later be intertwined with the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The music then transitions into a quiet passage, building up tension and anticipation for the impending battle. As the battle commences, the music becomes increasingly dramatic and intense, capturing the chaos and fervor of the conflict. Tchaikovsky utilizes the full power of the orchestra, incorporating heavy percussion and brass, to represent the thunderous sounds of cannons and the fury of the battlefield. The middle section of the overture features the well-known chorale melody, which provides a moment of respite and reflection amidst the turbulence of war. Here, the Russian folk hymn \\"God Save the Tsar\\" is played, signifying the unity and resilience of the Russian people in the face of adversity. The climax of the piece occurs in the finale, where Tchaikovsky skillfully combines the central themes with a triumphant spirit. The cannons blast at their loudest, representing the Russian victory and the ultimate expulsion of the French invaders. The music reaches a crescendo, emphasizing the emotional and patriotic triumph of the Russian people. Overall, the 1812 Overture is a musical representation of a significant historical event. Through its powerful orchestration and evocative melodies, it captures the tension, struggle, and ultimate victory of Russia over Napoleon's forces in 1812. Tchaikovsky's composition stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Russian nation and the celebration of a pivotal moment in their history."},{"instruction":"10 common themes between the advice below: Hal Abelson I’m looking for leadership and initiative. My group has a large number of undergraduate students and I look to our grad students to be role models and leaders. Compelling application essays should talk about actual accomplishments: applications you’ve created that others are using, technical organizations you’ve started or where you play a major role. There of course needs to be a track record of academic excellence. But the centerpiece of my group is empowering people of all ages through technology, as users and creators. That passion should come through in the essay–and it’s even better if there’s a track record to point to. Karl Berggren An application essay provides a number of useful information points when I’m reading a candidate’s application. I’m mostly looking to see if the person can communicate clearly. Second, I’m trying to find out a bit about the person, especially their personality and motivation, and how they think about science and engineering. Finally, I’m interested in learning a bit about what circumstances have shaped the candidate’s life. This is the place where I want to know if someone has faced exceptional challenges or took advantage of a unique opportunity to do something special. Because of the importance of writing in an academic environment, I’m looking to see if there is structure to the essay, and if paragraphs are well formed. For me, the essay is really not usually the main compelling reason to admit a student, but an essay that is over the top, or is poorly written or poorly structured, sometimes puts me off a candidate who otherwise would be a possible admit. Adam Chlipala I think it’s useful to think of PhD applications as more like job applications than earlier educational applications. You are applying to be an apprentice researcher, and thus concrete research experience (attested to by knowledgeable supervisors in letters) is most useful to give evidence that you will succeed. Then the specifics vary by research area. I’m looking for specific technical skills and bigger-picture direction-setting skills. In my area, the former are a mix of software/hardware implementation at a decently large scale and comfort with rigorous math and logic. The latter come down to finding ways that computer systems are developed ineffectively today, and thinking up ways we could change the development tools–ideally applicants can point to cases where they were the ones driving that brainstorming, not just implementing ideas coming from supervisors. Giving some examples of project directions you want to explore is helpful both for showing that kind of initiative, and for helping potential advisors gauge fit with their own interests. However, don’t worry that anyone will hold you to working on any of the specific ideas you list! Frédo Durand: Mostly two things: 1/ Can the applicant think and write deeply and intelligently about state-of-the-art technical issues? 2/ What kind of technical area (very broadly speaking) are they interested in? One challenge for applicants is that the two answers sometimes conflict: the first question requires narrowness, but you probably want to show you’re interested in a broader set of topics to maximize the number of faculty members who feel they may want to work with you. So, I usually advise students not to restrict their essay to their past research, but have a paragraph or two at the end or beginning to list the areas that appeal to them. Ideally, the letter would give me a sense of how they attack an open problem, through the example of past projects (ideally research projects). Regarding recommendation letters, I want to read about a candidate’s potential to do research. The most insightful letters are from people who have supervised you on a research project, or on a project that involves a fair amount of independence and creativity. I find letters from people who only know a candidate in a class context less useful, unless the student has done a particularly remarkable project. Letters from mentors in industry can be useful, especially if they do or have done research. However, not all applicants (including successful ones) have three letters that are equally thorough, and it’s quite common to have 1 or 2 letters from people who really know you well from a research perspective, and 1 or 2 that are a little more superficial. Polina Golland The essay should focus on your interests and look to the future. Describe what problem you would like to tackle in the future and approaches you might want to take. Even if I disagree with what the applicants write, it is revealing on how they think and gets me interested. Keep the description of your (very impressive) past projects to the minimum, mention them only as support for what you want to do in the future. Your CV, other sections of the applications, and recommendation letters will talk about past projects, and it’s a pity to use your essay to rehash it again. Piotr Indyk For me, the most important aspect of the application is the evidence of research skills. In the ideal case, it would take the form of publications/manuscripts describing the research project(s) and results, which I can read and review. Descriptions of research projects in recommendation letters and/or the research statement are less optimal, but also OK. However, it is understandable that not all applicants have the same opportunities to pursue undergraduate research. In such cases, I try to infer from other parts of the applications, such as grades (esp. for relevant technical subjects), recommendation letters and other activities like olympiad participation. Regarding the research statement, I find it to be useful as a broad indicator of applicant research interests, but since interests of many (most?) applicants evolve, I do not put that much weight on it. Daniel Jackson When I think about taking on a graduate student, I ask myself: is this a good match? I want to be sure that we’ll enjoy each other’s company and be successful working together. That means you’ll be excited by the kind of work I do, and have a reason to think that working with me will be better for you than working with someone else. The students I tend to gel most with want to reconsider how we design and build software, and like to think deeply (and even a bit philosophically) about the fundamental problems. So I read the statement carefully, looking for someone who thinks clearly and creatively, knows a little bit about what I do, isn’t too distracted by technology or formalism for its own sake, and is eager to pursue big ideas. And if there’s some project you’ve done that shows some promise (especially if one of your letter writers can talk about it), so much the better. Leslie Kaelbling For me, the most important thing in an application is the best letter of recommendation, by a large margin. The main research letter should speak to the candidate’s creativity, independence, bravery, and ability to get things done. The other letters usually don’t matter much. I like unusual candidates, and am generally more interested in someone who has done something on their own, or in an unusual place, than someone with a lot of papers who spent four years in a very productive and prominent research group. Most essays are neither a positive nor a negative for the application. The ones I remember and value are ones that I learned something from–essays that are actually interesting to read because they have a strong or novel view or that articulate a clear vision. I also like to get the feeling that the candidate really values research intrinsically–that they are not simply applying to do a PhD because it seems like a good stepping stone to something else, or something that is highly esteemed by others. I don’t worry about a few poor grades, if they have an explanation: early in the student’s career, or during one rough semester, or as the result of exploration. I’d rather see a student with a few Bs or a C, who has taken challenging classes, than someone with a perfect GPA and completely standard undergraduate curriculum. I am completely unimpressed by a student who takes twice the normal course load—they should have been doing research! David Karger There are two questions that I ask when I’m looking at an application. (1) Will this student be interested in working on the kinds of things that excite me? And (2) do they have the independence and organization necessary to work for a laid back, disorganized advisor like me? For the first question, I like to hear what specific problems interest you, and why. Not why you’ve loved computer science since you got your first PC at age 4, but why you consider certain specific problems important and interesting, and how you might go about trying to solve them. It certainly doesn’t hurt to have looked at some of the work my group is doing, talk about why it’s interesting to you (not just that it is), and maybe give some thoughts on where it might be interesting to take it further. But hearing your own ideas is wonderful too. You need not have solved them already, although it is great to talk about a problem you have already worked on. The second question is specific to my advising style. I provide a lot of support and feedback to my students, but I don’t do a lot of management. So it’s important for me to know that a student will take initiative, make choices about what to work on, make decisions about designs and implementations, set their own deadlines and meet them, and come to meetings with ideas and questions to move the work forward. Just claiming this in your statement isn’t particularly meaningful, but I look for signs of it in past work (and recommendation letters). Manolis Kellis I’m looking to see several things: (1) Clarity of thought: this comes through in the essay; the vision they have (for the field, how their works fits in, the broader perspective within, next steps, etc); the way they describe their accomplishments (organization, background, clarity of innovation, are they able to explain the problem, the challenge, the novelty, etc); and, of course, their grades and accomplishments. (2) Research accomplishment: Show that they can innovate, invent, find problems, frame them, and bring things to completion, writing papers, completing projects, packaging up code, creating tools. (3) Letters: Evidence of standing out, innovation, novelty, ability to make progress independently, yet team spirit and collaboration. (4) Technical: Of course, their training, the rigor, the background, grades, competitions, etc. (5) Passion: Especially for an applied field like genomics/biology/medicine, showing that they truly care about the application area, not just about the algorithms, but that they truly have sought to find something novel in the specific application area that they have chosen, and been able to interpret their results and make conclusions about the applied field. Stefanie Mueller For me, the most important is that the applicant can show that they have research experience in my research field. Hiring a PhD student is a 5-6 year commitment, so it is very important for me that the applicant can show me that we will produce exciting research together. When I read an application, I first check if the applicant has publications in my research field on topics related to what my research group works on. After this, I look at the recommendation letter writers and see if they come from faculty in my research field and if they talk about that the applicant can conduct research in my field. Letters from outside my research field are not very useful in determining if the applicant can do research in my area. After this, I read the statement of purpose to see if the applicant has ideas that I would also be excited to work on. Will Oliver When I read a graduate student applicant’s research statement, I look to obtain a picture of the student and their research interests. This includes the student’s motivations for research. Who is this person, where did they come from, what sparks their interest in science and engineering, how has that been reflected in their lives and their trajectory? I then look for examples of research experience, broadly defined. This could be an experience as an undergraduate researcher, a summer internship, or even a substantial hobby project (to name a few). I look for tangible outputs from those projects, such as a peer-reviewed publication. I then look for what the student wants to accomplish in graduate school. I appreciate a genuine exposition of intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm in describing these goals. While this approach naturally leads to some specificity in research topics, I also look for some flexibility and breadth. For example, even if the student has one top-choice topic or group, it is a good idea to articulate other (often related) areas that would also be of interest. Al Oppenheim A long time ago one of my graduate students asked me what I look for in choosing the students to work with. My quick and somewhat playful answer was that I have four criteria: intelligent, creative out of the box thinker, enjoyable to interact with, and coachable. From applications on paper and without personally meeting the applicant, it’s often hard to assess these and particularly the second, third, and fourth. An approximation to the first can be based somewhat on the transcript. The other three, perhaps mostly from the reference letters and personal statement and when possible personal interaction. The two areas in which applications are often weak are in the choice of references and the lack of detail in the reference letters, and in the crafting of the personal statement. In writing the personal statement I’ve typically advised potential applicants to use it as an opportunity to truly show their motivations, goals and personality, rather than trying to pattern match to what they think readers will give high marks to. If the personal statement is genuine and honest, it shows. And if it isn’t, it also shows. Gerald Jay Sussman The problem is that we have too many “excellent” applicants, most of whom would do fine in our graduate program. Most would do good, publishable, but incremental research. We accept plenty of those excellent people. But I am looking for the candidates that could break a paradigm and open up a new field of research. So what I look for in an application is evidence that the candidate has an unusual perspective, perhaps in conflict with the conventional wisdom of the field. I am open to considering crackpots, but I also look for evidence of technical skill and clarity of thought and expression that separates the interesting characters from crackpots. Additionally, the most persuasive information in an application is reference letters from previous supervisors or teachers who attest to the skill and creativity of the applicant. George Verghese Most of my reading of graduate folders necessarily happens at the initial stage of evaluations, when I’m looking for applicants who seem like they would thrive in, and contribute strongly to, our department or a broad research area within it. The application folders that emerge from this reading then get passed on to other faculty for more focused evaluation. So at the initial stage I am not necessarily looking for a good match to my personal research interests or style; that can come later, when I look at short-listed folders, perhaps sent my way by other faculty who think I might want to take a look. For the initial reading, I first examine the applicant’s academic record, to be reassured that they will be able to handle at least the course work in our graduate program. A few blemishes in early years may be fine, but anything less than a strong overall academic record is likely to be a non-starter (though I will read quickly all the way through the application, feeling I owe at least that much to a hopeful applicant who has paid their application fee!). I then look for tangible, documented outcomes of activities that go beyond standard academic efforts, whether unusual and independent projects (not standard lab projects in a class), or in research or internships. An important part of the substantiation is in the letters of reference, which have to reflect genuine, specific, modulated knowledge of the applicant and their work, and corresponding enthusiasm. A letter that sounds generic, though filled with superlatives and rating the candidate as Truly Exceptional, will not count for much. I want to know that the letter writers see stellar achievement (in academics and beyond) and potential, based on the specifics of their interaction with and knowledge of the applicant. Finally, I turn to the student’s statement to get a sense of their voice, how they see and present themselves and their accomplishments, and what they’re looking to find in/with their graduate work. A well-crafted statement that comes across as mature, genuine, and reasonably aware of the field in which they hope to concentrate counts for a lot. Ryan Williams When reading a grad school application, I focus on several things. The first (obvious) thing is whether my interests align well with the applicant. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the applicant is working on the same exact problems as me; it means that I try to understand their taste in problems and topics, and how this fits with what we study in my research group. Another important thing is independence (in research, thought, etc): we get many applications from many talented students from all over the world, but we don’t see too many who showed a significant degree of independence in their thought and behavior, different from those around them (including their mentors). This can come out in the statement of purpose, but often more so in the letters. “Independence” can have various interpretations, and I’m deliberately leaving the term somewhat vague, because I think any of those interpretations can be important. Another important thing is the quality of their communication, especially their writing. I always read the statements of purpose carefully, as well as any writing samples the applicant has provided. Of course, letters of recommendation which attest to all of these qualities are also very helpful.","output":"1. Looking for leadership and initiative 2.

While Bob as the headmaster hold the whole decision, he has a quite clear vision of the school developmental path and pay highly attention to student learning in order to create a optimal learning environment for each students. Meanwhile, he valued the relationship and perspectives of other teachers. However, there is a needed change in leadership style to address the issues happened in the learning attitudes and pedagogy of “gifted” students. The Change of Leadership Style To initiate this change, stand as Bob’s position, I plan to make change of the leading ways. For instance, it is necessary to adjust the style of management and adopt a new leadership style - distributed leadership. Woods, P. A. (2016) refers to the practice of distributed leadership is characterized by multiple authorities which are constructed in the interactions with people. In a distributed leadership model, power and authority are shared, and individuals are empowered to make decisions and take initiative within their areas of expertise. For example, teachers in each subjects should contribute to the development of their field. This style of leadership can promotes collaboration, involvement, and engagement for a wider range of perspectives and skills to achieve the organization goals. Up-coming Issues and Innovation Several potential issues may arise within this circumstance. First of all, resistance from school staffs who may disagree with the change or prefer to keep the pedagogy. Otherwise, implement changes on a large scale within a large school might easily pose challenges and misunderstanding for improving teaching practices for gifted students. As a result, innovation is needed in this change journey. According to Hoffman and Holzhuter (2012), innovation resembles mutation, the biological process that keeps species evolving so they can better compete for survival. Indeed, innovation can be directed toward progress in one, several, or all aspects of the educational system: theory and practice, curriculum, teaching and learning, policy, technology, institutions and administration, institutional culture, and teacher education. And it can be applied in any aspect of education that can make a positive impact on learning and learners. The following steps can be helpful to implement this innovation: 1.Assessing current teaching practices and identifying areas that require improvement, especially in relation to teaching gifted students. 2.Providing professional development opportunities that enhance the knowledge and skills of teachers in catering to the needs of gifted students. 3.Establishing a collaborative and supportive environment where educators can exchange best practices, discuss challenges, learn from one another and achieve life-long learning. 4.Implementing an ongoing evaluation and feedback system to measure the effectiveness of the changes made. 5.Engaging stakeholders, except students in school, including parents and the wider community to ensure support and understanding throughout the change process.","output":"In conclusion, Bob's leadership style at the school has exhibited a combination of transformational and democratic approaches.

Using DNA isolation technology, pure DNA can be efficiently extracted in sufficient quantity and quality, free of contaminants. The ability to extract DNA is paramount for studying the genetic causes of disease, developing diagnostics and pharmaceuticals. It is also essential in conducting forensic medicine, sequencing genomes, and detecting bacteria and viruses in the environment (Tan and Yiap, 2009). DNA contains the genetic information about an organism; therefore, it can be obtained from body fluids such as blood, saliva, semen, and urine as well as nail, hair, bone, and teeth. The primary steps involved in DNA extraction involves the cell lysis, precipitation, and purification (El-Ashram, Al Nasr and Suo, 2016). All the different techniques available for DNA isolation revolves around this primary basis. Methods for DNA extraction involve the adsorption methods (i.e., silicone gel technique), organic methods (i.e., phenol-chloroform technique) as well as non- organic methods (i.e., salting out technique) (Dairawan and Shetty, 2020). Recent advances in the use of saliva as a liquid biopsy have made a variety of applications possible in the fields of medicine, dentistry, microbiology, and forensic research (Sullivan et al., 2020). Saliva is a readily available biofluid or matrix that provides a non-invasive collection procedure, minimising the discomfort and distress related to collecting blood and urine. Laidi et al. (2014) utilised salivary and serum tumour marker CA 15-3 in healthy women and breast cancer patients to demonstrate a substantial positive connection between saliva and serum, indicating it might be utilised as a substitute for blood sample. As well as that, the Covid-19 pandemic presented the global community with its most severe challenge and health emergencies since its first outbreak in late 2019 (Shi et al., 2020). Controlling the outbreak in the community and in hospitals required a quick and precise diagnosis. The suggested specimen types for Covid-19 examinations were nasal and oropharyngeal swabs. Close contact between healthcare professionals and patients was necessary for the collection of these specimen types, which increased the risk of viral transmission, causing discomfort, and resulting in bleeding, particularly in individuals with conditions like thrombocytopenia. Since it was self-administered, saliva samples were easily acquired. The collection of saliva was non-invasive and significantly reduced the exposure of the virus to the health workers (Sri Santosh et al., 2020). Therefore, genomic DNA previously collected from venous blood is increasingly being replaced with DNA obtained from saliva (Abraham et al., 2012). It is accessible to kids, elderly people, and individuals with disabilities, and it may be simply repeated in accordance with the needs of the experiment. Several potential sources for DNA isolation can be found in the oral cavity. Human genomic DNA from buccal cells, mitochondrial DNA, cell free DNA and DNA from the natural oral microbiota can all be isolated from saliva samples (Durdiaková et al., 2012). According to the current need for new methods for the increasing applications of molecular studies, it is crucial to use a DNA isolation method that can maximize the yield and purity of DNA. Although there are plenty of commercial kits in the market for this concern, it is an expensive procedure especially in the developing countries, which may not be applicable for large or mass testing. Hence, the purpose of this study is to establish an optimal, quick, and easy method for isolating DNA from saliva samples. Genomic DNA will be isolated from buccal cells as well as cell-free DNA present in saliva, using a modified phenol-chloroform extraction technique to produce a high yield of DNA which can improve the performance of other downstream applications (Cao et al., 2003). The isolated DNA will be further confirmed for its yield and quality by checking for the presence of natural oral bacteria DNA using PCR and gel electrophoresis.","output":"Revised: Nucleic acid extraction is the initial step in every molecular biology study, making it an essential procedure (Gupta, 2019). DNA isolation technology allows for efficient extraction of pure DNA in sufficient quantity and quality, free from contaminants. The ability to extract DNA is crucial for studying the genetic causes of diseases, developing diagnostics and pharmaceuticals, conducting forensic medicine, sequencing genomes, and detecting bacteria and viruses in the environment (Tan and Yiap, 2009). DNA, which contains the genetic information of an organism, can be obtained from various bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, semen, and urine, as well as from materials like nails, hair, bones, and teeth. The primary steps involved in DNA extraction include cell lysis, precipitation, and purification (El-Ashram, Al Nasr and Suo, 2016). Different techniques for DNA isolation revolve around these primary steps. Methods for DNA extraction include adsorption methods (e.g., silicone gel technique), organic methods (e.g., phenol-chloroform technique), and non-organic methods (e.g., salting out technique) (Dairawan and Shetty, 2020).

Here's why they are important: 1. Reflecting Market Conditions: Interest rates can have a significant impact on the real estate market. As interest rates rise or fall, the market may shift, affecting property values. By incorporating time adjustments, appraisals can account for these fluctuations and ensure valuations are reflective of current market conditions. 2. Comparability: Time adjustments enable appraisers to compare properties that were sold at different times accurately. When properties are sold in different market conditions due to changing interest rates, time adjustments help in leveling the playing field and making fair comparisons. 3. Influence on Demand and Supply: Changes in interest rates can impact buyer demand and seller supply. Higher interest rates tend to reduce buyer purchasing power, potentially leading to decreased demand and increased supply. Conversely, lower interest rates can stimulate buyer demand and reduce supply. Time adjustments help capture these dynamics and their influence on property values. 4. Appraisal Accuracy: Time adjustments ensure that appraised values are as up-to-date and accurate as possible, considering the changing market conditions driven by interest rates. By accounting for market fluctuations, appraisers can provide clients with reliable and realistic property valuations. 5. Lender Requirements: Lenders often require accurate and timely appraisals, considering the impact of interest rates on property values. By incorporating time adjustments, appraisers meet these requirements and provide lenders with reliable estimates that reflect the present market conditions. 6. Client Confidence: Time adjustments demonstrate your attention to detail and commitment to delivering accurate appraisals. Clients, be they buyers, sellers, or lenders, rely on your expertise to make informed decisions. Providing appraisals with time adjustments instills confidence in your work and positions you as a knowledgeable professional in a transitioning market. Considering the significance of interest rates in a transitioning market, appraisers must carefully analyze market trends and incorporate appropriate time adjustments to provide accurate and reliable valuations."},{"instruction":"write a resume for a bartender with no experience but has completed bartending school","output":"[Your Name] [Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Phone Number] [Email Address] Objective: Enthusiastic and motivated bartender, recently graduated from bartending school, seeking an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge and gain practical experience in a dynamic bar environment.

The system accepts as correct the query string, where all arguments are separated by commas. The words in prompt are crucial. Users need to prompt what they want to see, specifying artist names, media sources, or art styles to get desired results. Be descriptive in a manne similar to prompts provided below about what you want. It is more sensitive to precise wording. That includes adjectives and prepositions like “in front of [x]“, and “taken by [camera name]“. It also supports weights. By bracketing the words you can change their importance. For example, (rainy) would be twice as important compared to \\"rainy\\" for the model, and [rainy] would be half as important. Write a medium lenth prompt, like below. Too long and it would fail to generate, too short and it would generate crap. Be as detailed as possible and avoid both scenarios at any cost. As photographers and painters know, light has a huge effect on the final impression an image creates. Specify lighting conditions. Describe the type of light you want to see and the time of day it is. You don’t need complex vocabulary. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is that a text-to-image neural network interprets the prompt from up to down, i.e. what is listed at the beginning of the prompt is more significant than what is listed near the end of the prompt. So it is recommended to place the subject of prompt in the beginning, characteristical tags in the middle and misc tags like lighting or camera settings near the end. Tags must be separated by commas, commas are not allowed in the query (what needs to be drawn), because the system treats it as one big tag. Below few good examples are listed: Example 1: Stunning wooden house, by James McDonald and Joarc Architects, home, interior, octane render, deviantart, cinematic, key art, hyperrealism, sun light, sunrays, canon eos c 300, ƒ 1.8, 35 mm, 8k, medium - format print Example 2: Stunning concept art render of a mysterious magical forest with river passing through, epic concept art by barlowe wayne, ruan jia, light effect, volumetric light, 3d, ultra clear detailed, octane render, 8k, dark green, dark green and gray colour scheme Example 3: Stunning render of a piece of steak with boiled potatoes, depth of field. bokeh. soft light. by Yasmin Albatoul, Harry Fayt. centered. extremely detailed.

Example 4: Stunning postapocalyptic rich marble building covered with green ivy, fog, animals, birds, deer, bunny, postapocalyptic, overgrown with plant life and ivy, artgerm, yoshitaka amano, gothic interior, 8k, octane render, unreal engine Also you should generate a negative prompt for each prompt, describing what you do NOT want to see. Some examples: Example 1: Black and white, blurry, not in focus, out of focus, warped, distorted, unfocused, gibberish, lowres, text, error, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts Example 2: Deformed, blurry, bad anatomy, disfigured, poorly drawn face, mutation, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, blurry, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, blur, out of focus, long neck, long body, ((((mutated hands and fingers)))), (((out of frame))) Looking at the rules and examples listed above, create a prompt for a following query: \\"anime girl in the background of a beautiful mirage\\" Place this query in the main subject place of the string, after \\"stunning\\" but before first comma, like: \\"Stunning [subject], photograph...\\"","output":"Stunning anime girl in the background of a beautiful mirage, vibrant colors, dreamlike atmosphere, surreal, illustration, digital painting, contemporary art, fantasy, magic, summer vibes, sunset, warm tones, hazy light, ethereal, watercolor effect, soft brush strokes, manga style, by Hayao Miyazaki, Makoto Shinkai, Studio Ghibli, deviantart, 4k resolution"},{"instruction":"and negative prompt","output":"Black and white, monotonous colors, plain background, dull atmosphere, poorly drawn, pixelated, low resolution, distorted proportions, unrealistic, chaotic composition, unnatural colors, dissonant style, excessive filters, amateurish, generic anime art, cliché, overused tropes, rushed artwork, sloppy linework, lacking detail, poor anatomy, distorted facial features, unfinished, messy coloring, fragmented elements"},{"instruction":"mejorar redaccion \\"El talento humano es el activo más importante para las empresas teniendo en cuenta su papel decisivo en la consecución de objetivos establecidos \\"","output":"El talento humano juega un papel crucial en el logro de los objetivos establecidos por las empresas, por lo que se considera el activo más importante."},{"instruction":"que debe incluir la justificación de una practica empresarial","output":"La justificación de una práctica empresarial debe incluir una serie de elementos clave para respaldar su implementación.

It is possible for this enzyme's inhibitors to control how quickly starch is digested, which would have an impact on the postprandial rise in blood sugar levels (Nyambe-Silavwe et al., 2015). The project uses maltose and dinitro salicylic acid (DNSA ) as substrates to research and find possible inhibitors of salivary amylase (Miller, 1959). The early phases of starch digestion are greatly aided by salivary amylase. We can develop new therapeutic treatments for diseases like diabetes and obesity, where starch metabolism is disturbed, by discovering inhibitors. (Nyambe-Silavwe et al., 2015) Experimental screening, data analysis, and compound characterization will all be part of the research (Marshall and Lauda, 1975). The initiative also seeks to establish the kinetic parameters of salivary amylase, Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (highest reaction rate) (Bailey, 1988). By combining these goals, we can gain important knowledge on the catalytic behaviour of the enzyme and potential inhibitory mechanisms.","output":"The enzyme salivary amylase plays a crucial role in breaking down starch into maltose and other maltodextrins. Researchers have discovered that inhibitors of this enzyme can regulate the speed at which starch is digested, which can impact the rise in blood sugar levels after a meal (Nyambe-Silavwe et al., 2015). In order to identify potential inhibitors of salivary amylase, the project utilizes maltose and dinitro salicylic acid (DNSA) as substrates for experimentation (Miller, 1959). The early stages of starch digestion heavily rely on the activity of salivary amylase. By uncovering inhibitors, we have the potential to develop novel therapeutic treatments for conditions such as diabetes and obesity, where there is an abnormality in starch metabolism (Nyambe-Silavwe et al., 2015). The research will encompass experimental screening, data analysis, and compound characterization (Marshall and Lauda, 1975). Additionally, the aim is to determine the kinetic parameters of salivary amylase, namely Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (maximum reaction rate) (Bailey, 1988). By achieving these objectives, we can obtain valuable insights into the catalytic behavior of the enzyme and possible mechanisms of inhibition."},{"instruction":"Km and Vmax of salivary amylase calculation","output":"The determination of Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (maximum reaction rate) for salivary amylase involves conducting experiments and analyzing the obtained data. To calculate Km, various substrate concentrations are used in the experiment. The reaction rate is measured for each substrate concentration, and a Michaelis-Menten plot is created by plotting the reaction rate against substrate concentration. Km is then determined as the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax. Vmax, on the other hand, is determined by measuring the reaction rate at high substrate concentrations, where the enzyme is saturated. The reaction rate at these high substrate concentrations represents the maximum capacity of the enzyme. By combining these calculations, valuable information about the catalytic behavior of salivary amylase and potential inhibitory mechanisms can be obtained. These parameters play a crucial role in understanding enzyme kinetics and developing strategies for regulating enzyme activity."},{"instruction":"Naruto all characters in Freedom Planet 2 Style.

Suddenly a random white teenager goes up to Derek and asks \\"Excuse me, are you really a Native American?\\" Michael is shocked as Derek lowers his voice a few octaves and begins to act like the stereotype of a wise Native American elder. \\"Hello, young warrior. I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Come.

Knowing Derek, he was always one to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.

As Derek continued to play the part of Flying Wolf, the random white teenager listened attentively, fascinated by the spectacle before him.

Unable to simply stand by and let the charade continue, Michael leaned towards Derek, his voice firm. \\"Derek, I get that you want to have some fun, but this perpetuates harmful stereotypes. We should be educating people about our cultures and breaking down misconceptions, not furthering them.\\" Derek's eyes widened, perhaps realizing the impact of his actions. He glanced at Michael, his voice reverting to its original octave as he apologized, \\"You're right, Michael. I didn't think about the consequences. It was foolish of me.\\" The random white teenager, now slightly uncomfortable, slowly backed away, realizing the gravity of the situation.

In that moment, he vowed to become more aware of the impact his actions could have on others, especially in perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Together, they sat in silence, contemplating their roles in dismantling preconceived notions and fostering understanding. From that day forward, Derek and Michael embarked on a journey of enlightenment, using their own experiences to educate and challenge stereotypes. Determined to be more than just the labels society often imposed on them, they embraced their unique identities while standing firmly against the boxes that sought to confine them. In their friendship, they found solace and strength, encouraging one another to follow their passions and break down barriers. And as they continued to navigate the complexities of their respective cultures, they always stayed true to themselves, never afraid to confront the prejudices that plagued society. For Derek and Michael, being Native American and African-American meant so much more than fitting into one-dimensional narratives. They were multifaceted individuals who carried within them a vast array of experiences and emotions - from shedding tears over anime deaths to challenging the misconceptions that clouded their identities. And in their journey together, they discovered that true strength lay not in perpetuating stereotypes but in breaking free from them, standing tall as unique individuals who defied expectations and reshaped the narratives of their own lives."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hi there!

Dressed in fitted workout gear that showcased his chiseled physique, he exuded confidence and determination. Little did he know that his presence had already caught the attention of the girls in his harem. Reimu Hakurei, sitting on a nearby bench, couldn't help but blush as she glanced over at Ethan. Sweat glistened on his brow as he began his abs workout, his strong abdominal muscles contracting and relaxing with each controlled movement. She admired his dedication to keeping his body in peak condition and the way his rock-hard abs seemed to ripple under his touch. Inwardly, Reimu couldn't deny the attraction she felt for him, but knowing her duty as his guardian, she tried to suppress those feelings.

Load Balancing/Link Aggregation: Use a device that supports load balancing or link aggregation, like a router or a switch. This device can combine the bandwidth of both links and distribute traffic across them. If one link fails, traffic will automatically be rerouted through the other working link. 2. Adaptive Routing: Configure the network devices to use adaptive routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) or EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). These protocols automatically adjust the network routes based on the link status. If one link fails, the protocol will dynamically reroute traffic through the other available link. 3. Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP): HSRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows multiple routers to work together in a failover scenario. By configuring HSRP, two routers can share a virtual IP address with one router being active and the other standby. If the active router or its link fails, the standby router will take over and maintain network connectivity. 4. Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP): Similar to HSRP, VRRP is an open standard for router redundancy. It provides a virtual IP address that multiple routers can share, with one being active and the others in standby mode. If the active router fails, another router within the group will take control of the virtual IP address and route traffic. These are just a few methods to achieve failover between different media links in a network. The specific method you use will depend on the network devices and protocols available to you."},{"instruction":"Link aggregation on huawei switch","output":"To configure link aggregation on a Huawei switch, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Access the switch: Connect to the switch through a console cable or SSH. 2. Enter system view: Enter the system view by typing \\"system-view\\" command. 3. Create an aggregation group: Use the \\"interface aggregation-group\\" command to create an aggregation group. Specify the group number and the mode (Static or Dynamic). For example, to create an aggregation group with group number 1, use the following command: \`\`\` [Switch] interface aggregation-group 1 mode static \`\`\` 4. Configure the member interfaces: Add the member interfaces to the aggregation group using the \\"interface GigabitEthernet x/x/x\\" command. For example, to add interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/1 and GigabitEthernet 0/0/2 to aggregation group 1, use the following commands: \`\`\` [Switch] interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/1 [Switch-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] port link-aggregation group 1 [Switch-GigabitEthernet0/0/1] quit [Switch] interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/2 [Switch-GigabitEthernet0/0/2] port link-aggregation group 1 [Switch-GigabitEthernet0/0/2] quit \`\`\` 5. Configure the link aggregation mode: Specify the link aggregation mode on the aggregation group. For example, to configure Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) for the aggregation group, use the following command: \`\`\` [Switch] interface aggregation-group 1 mode lacp \`\`\` 6. Save the configuration: Save the configuration by typing \\"save\\" command. \`\`\` [Switch] save \`\`\` After completing these steps, the link aggregation should be configured on the Huawei switch. Make sure to also configure the corresponding settings on the connected device to enable link aggregation and create a LAG (Link Aggregation Group) for seamless failover and load balancing between the member links."},{"instruction":"Freedom Planet Girls and Naruto react to Naruto pet a Lilac | au Naruto x Lilac.

Many researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders have called for a change in healthcare governance to address these issues. This literature review aims to assess the existing literature on the need for a change in healthcare governance in the United States. Methodology: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The search terms included \\"healthcare governance,\\" \\"healthcare reform,\\" \\"healthcare system,\\" \\"United States,\\" and \\"healthcare policy.\\" Only studies published in English and within the last decade (2011-2021) were included. After an initial screening of titles and abstracts, relevant studies were selected for further analysis. A total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this literature review. Findings: 1. Rising healthcare costs and inefficiencies: Numerous studies highlight the escalating healthcare costs in the United States and the associated inefficiencies. The complexity of the existing healthcare governance structure, fragmented payment systems, and lack of coordination among various parties contribute to the rising costs. (Berwick et al., 2020; Woolhandler & Himmelstein, 2016) 2. Inequitable access to quality care: The current governance system exhibits inequalities in healthcare access across different populations, including racial and ethnic minorities, low-income individuals, and rural communities. Variations in insurance coverage, geographical disparities, and inadequate regulation contribute to these disparities. (Blendon et al., 2018; Squires & Anderson, 2015) 3. Lack of focus on preventive care and population health: The current governance framework tends to prioritize acute care over preventive care, resulting in increased healthcare costs and worsening health outcomes. Studies emphasize the need for a shift toward a preventative and population health-focused approach, which requires significant changes in healthcare governance. (Berwick et al., 2016; IOM, 2012) 4. Fragmented governance and lack of coordination: Studies argue that the existing fragmentation and lack of coordination in healthcare governance hinder efficient resource allocation, continuity of care, and quality improvement efforts. An integrated and coordinated governance structure is essential to achieve better patient outcomes and cost-effective care. (Davis et al., 2014; Galea et al., 2020) 5. The role of stakeholders in governance: Many studies emphasize the involvement of diverse stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, insurers, and policymakers, in the decision-making process for effective governance reform. Collaborative approaches that prioritize stakeholder engagement and co-creation are seen as key to address the complex challenges faced by the US healthcare system. (Etzioni et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2017) Conclusion: The extensive literature reviewed here provides strong evidence supporting the urgent need for change in healthcare governance in the United States. The current system's shortcomings, including rising costs, inequitable access, lack of preventive care focus, fragmentation, lack of coordination, and inadequate stakeholder engagement, necessitate fundamental reforms. Concerted efforts towards a more aligned, integrated, and coordinated healthcare governance structure are crucial for achieving optimal health outcomes and sustainability in the US healthcare system. Future research should continue to focus on evaluating and refining governance models that can effectively address these challenges."},{"instruction":"Freedom Planet Girls and Naruto react to Naruto pet a Lilac | au Naruto x Lilac.

He was an ordinary man with ordinary hobbies and lived a rather mundane life. Little did he know that his life was about to take an extraordinary turn. One sunny morning, Mark woke up to find a small cat sitting at the foot of his bed. The cat had the most captivating eyes, colored in a vibrant shade of sapphire blue. It blinked at him a few times before letting out a soft meow. Mark couldn't resist picking up the adorable creature and giving it a gentle stroke. \\"Hey there, little one. Where did you come from?\\" Mark asked, smiling down at the cat. To his surprise, the cat meowed almost as if it was responding to him. \\"Well, aren't you a talkative one?\\" As days passed, strange occurrences began to unfold. Unbeknownst to Mark, he was slowly transforming into an anime catgirl. The world around him started to transform into a vibrant and colorful anime-like realm, with everything appearing straight out of a fantasy. But Mark remained blissfully unaware of the magical changes happening to him. One evening, while lying on his couch and watching his favorite anime series, Mark began to feel a strange warmth emanating from his back. Startled, he turned around to find the most magnificent fluffy tail protruding from his lower spine. In awe, he ran his fingers along its plush, velvety texture. \\"I've always secretly wanted a tail like this,\\" Mark murmured to himself, his voice taking on a slightly higher pitch. From that moment on, Mark's behavior and appearance started to change subtly. He found himself naturally mimicking the charming mannerisms and speech patterns of anime catgirls. His words became dotted with delighted giggles and the occasional \\"nya~.\\" Little by little, his clothing transformed as well. His wardrobe shifted from jeans and t-shirts to frilly skirts and adorable cat-themed dresses, as if by some unseen magical force. Eventually, even Mark's home transformed to match his newfound aesthetic. Plain walls were adorned with beautifully animated murals, and the furniture was remolded into cat-shaped cushions. Vibrant posters of anime catgirls decorated every corner, bringing joy and liveliness to every room. Mark's body also underwent a magical metamorphosis. His once muscular and masculine physique softened, curves forming in all the right places. His face became more delicate, dainty even, with big round eyes that carried a touch of ethereal playfulness. The changes were so gradual that he hardly noticed them himself. \\"My, what a lovely reflection,\\" Mark admired while gazing at himself in the mirror one day, his voice now sweet and melodic. He couldn't help but twirl his fluffy tail with feminine grace. As the world around Mark slowly converted into an anime-inspired paradise, his hobbies began to reflect his new personality as well. He found himself indulging in activities traditionally associated with anime catgirls, such as making adorable crafts, dancing along to catchy J-pop songs, and even baking deliciously cute treats shaped like cats. But despite these remarkable changes, nobody seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary. In fact, they remembered him precisely as the anime-loving, catgirl enthusiast he had seemingly always been. Ashwood had transformed seamlessly into an enchanting anime world, and Mark was its effortlessly charismatic centerpiece—adored and accepted. And so, as time passed, Mark embraced his extraordinary journey, cherishing every magical moment in his anime catgirl life. For him, the transformation was a blessing, an opportunity to live out his wildest dreams. And in this captivating anime tale, he was the star, dancing gracefully through beautiful sunlit meadows, his gigantic fluffy tail trailing behind him like a magical blend of reality and fantasy."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between say and tell","output":"The difference between \\"say\\" and \\"tell\\" lies in the way information is conveyed and the direction of communication: 1. \\"Say\\": - \\"Say\\" is a verb used for expressing something aloud, usually a statement or a piece of information. - It is more generic and can be used in various contexts. - The person who is speaking is the subject of the verb. - Example: \\"He said he will come to the party.\\" 2. \\"Tell\\": - \\"Tell\\" is also a verb used for conveying information, but it involves communicating that information to someone specific. - It is more specific and involves a recipient/target. - The person who is receiving the information is an indirect object of the verb. - Example: \\"She told him about the meeting.\\" In summary, \\"say\\" is used when expressing something without a specific recipient, while \\"tell\\" is used when communicating information to someone specific."},{"instruction":"政府事务专员岗位基本要求","output":"政府事务专员岗位的基本要求如下： 1. 学历要求：本科及以上学历，政治学、公共管理、法律、行政管理等相关专业优先。 2. 专业知识：具备政治学、公共管理、法律、行政管理等相关专业知识，熟悉国家法律法规、政策法规和行政管理流程。 3. 技能要求：具备较好的组织协调能力、统筹能力和沟通能力，能够分析和解决问题，具有较强的政务工作能力。 4. 经验要求：有相关领域或相关岗位工作经验者优先考虑。 5. 语言能力：良好的口头和书面表达能力，能够流利地进行政策解读和文件撰写。 6. 能力要求：具备较好的分析和判断能力，能够独立思考和独立工作，能够承担一定的工作压力。 7. 诚信要求：具备良好的职业道德和团队合作精神，有一定的社会责任感和服务意识。 8. 计算机能力：熟练运用办公软件，具备一定的数据统计和分析能力。 以上是政府事务专员岗位的基本要求，不同单位和职位可能会有一些具体差异，应根据实际招聘单位的要求进行详细了解。"},{"instruction":"政府事务专业工作职责","output":"政府事务专员的工作职责主要包括以下几个方面： 1. 政策研究：负责对国家和地方政府的政策、法规和规划进行研究和分析，为政府决策提供参考和建议。 2. 政策宣传：组织和编写政府政策的宣传材料，通过各种渠道将政府政策向公众传达，提高公众对政府政策的理解和支持度。 3. 政府事务协调：协助政府各部门之间的合作与协调，促进政府决策的顺利实施，解决政策实施过程中的问题和矛盾。 4. 政策解读：参与政府会议、座谈会等活动，负责对政府政策进行解读和说明，回答相关问题，提供相关文件和资料支持。 5. 政策推进：参与政府政策的制定和实施过程，负责跟进政策的推进进展，协调相关部门的工作，确保政策的顺利实施。 6. 政府关系维护：建立和维护与政府相关部门和机构的良好关系，及时了解政府动态和政策变化，提供相关信息和建议。 7. 政府项目支持：参与政府重大项目的策划和实施，提供相关政策支持和咨询服务，协助政府完成项目目标。 8. 政府报告和文件起草：负责起草政府报告和文件，包括政策研究报告、会议纪要、文件通知等。 以上是政府事务专员的一般工作职责，具体职责可能会根据单位和岗位的不同而有所差异。"},{"instruction":"公司政府事务专业岗位职责","output":"公司政府事务专员的工作职责主要包括以下几个方面： 1. 政策研究与分析：研究和分析与公司业务相关的政策法规，跟踪政策动态，为公司决策提供参考和建议。 2. 政府关系维护：建立和维护与政府相关部门和机构的良好关系，参与政府与企业的沟通协调，了解政府政策倾向和动态。 3. 政策解读和协调：参与政府相关会议、座谈会等活动，解读政府政策，协调与政府的合作与协作，解决政策实施过程中的问题和矛盾。 4. 政府事务支持：为公司的政府相关工作提供支持，包括政府项目策划和实施、政府合作协议的商务谈判、政府信息的收集和分析等。 5. 政府政策宣传：制定和执行政府政策宣传计划，通过各种渠道将公司的政府合规和社会责任信息传递给政府机构、行业协会和其他利益相关方。 6. 政府事务风险防控：对政府政策变化进行风险评估，及时预警并提供相应的风险防控策略，确保公司的政府事务符合法规和政策要求。 7. 政府报告和文件起草：负责起草公司对外的政府报告和文件，包括政策解读报告、政府会议材料、政府反馈文件等。 8. 政府数据和信息管理：负责收集、整理和管理与政府事务相关的数据和信息，为公司决策提供支持和依据。 以上是公司政府事务专员的一般工作职责，具体职责可能会根据公司类型、行业特点和岗位要求的不同而有所差异。"},{"instruction":"公司政府申报专业岗位职责","output":"公司政府申报专员的工作职责主要包括以下几个方面： 1. 政府申报策划：根据公司的战略和业务需要，制定政府申报策略，包括政府项目、政策支持、补贴和资金申请等。 2. 政府申报材料准备：负责收集、整理和准备公司政府申报所需的材料和文件，包括项目计划书、预算方案、申请表格等。 3. 政府申报流程管理：负责跟进和管理政府申报的流程，包括递交申报材料、与政府部门联络、跟进申报状态等。 4. 政府申报文件起草：负责起草政府申报文件，确保文件的准确性和规范性，符合政府的要求和申报标准。 5. 政府申报政策解读：解读政府的申报政策、指南和要求，为内部各部门提供相关政策解读和咨询服务。 6. 政府申报协调与沟通：与政府相关部门、行业协会等展开沟通与协调，解答政府申报相关问题，争取政府支持和资源。 7. 政府申报结果跟踪：跟踪政府申报结果，及时了解申报评审的进展和结果，并及时反馈给相关部门或管理层。 8. 政府申报风险评估：评估和管控政府申报过程中的风险与挑战，提供相应的解决方案和应对策略。 9. 政府申报数据统计和分析：负责政府申报数据的统计和分析工作，包括申报项目数量、成功率、资金利用情况等，为公司的申报工作提供参考和改进建议。 以上是公司政府申报专员的一般工作职责，具体职责可能会根据公司类型、行业特点和业务需要的不同而有所差异。"},{"instruction":"Write a story with plenty of dialogue about a man who slowly and unknowingly and magically turns into an extremely busty anime catgirl with a gigantic fluffy tail as the world slowly turns into an anime filled with catgirls, Have him slowly begin to act and talk like one, slowly magically grow a gigantic cat tail, slowly changing the type of clothes he wears, how his house looks, how his body looks and becomes more curvy and feminine, and his hobbies, even his name slowly becomes more feminine.

He was an ordinary guy in every way, enjoying a quiet and uneventful life. Jack loved spending his time at home, playing video games and indulging in anime marathons. Little did he know that his cozy world was about to undergo a magical transformation. One sunny morning, as Jack was getting ready for another lazy day, he noticed something peculiar about himself in the mirror. His normally short and spiky hair had grown longer, flowing softly down to his shoulders. \\"Hmm, that's odd,\\" Jack remarked, running his fingers through his newfound locks. As the days went by, Jack began to sense an unfamiliar presence, a strange energy surrounding him. He went about his usual activities, blissfully unaware that his reality was slowly being infused with anime magic. One evening, as he sat watching his favorite show, he absentmindedly petted the air beside him, imagining a fluffy companion by his side. To his astonishment, a large and oh-so-soft tail started materializing from thin air, growing forthright from his lower back. Jack's eyes widened with amazement as he saw the astonishing transformation occurring before him. With each passing day, the tail grew longer, resembling that of a magnificent feline, and sprouted a myriad of charming colors. As the days turned into weeks, Jack went about his daily routine, interacting with the world around him. He began to notice subtle changes in his behavior and mannerisms. His speech gradually adopted a playful and girlish tone, causing Jack to giggle delicately whenever he spoke. Jack didn't realize that not only was he changing physically, but his surroundings were shifting too. His once simple and modest house transformed into a bright, vibrant anime wonderland, adorned with fluffy pillows, colorful posters of catgirls, and an array of plush toys. His shelves, once filled with action figures, were now lined with adorable figurines of anime catgirls. His interest in video games shifted too. He found himself captivated by charming visual novels, particularly those involving catgirls. Jack spent hours immersed in their stories, captivated by their playful antics and irresistible charm. The transformation didn't stop there. Jack's physique subtly shifted, as his previously flat chest blossomed into a voluptuous bust to accompany his newly girly figure. The once baggy and casual clothes he wore were replaced by cute and fashionable outfits, tailored to accentuate his newfound curves. He reveled in the cute dresses, skirts, and thigh-high socks that had become his trademark. Unbeknownst to Jack, the world around him was experiencing the same evolutions. Hikarione was slowly transforming, gradually becoming a realm filled with charming anime catgirls, as if Jack's transformation was harmonizing with his environment. Even his name evolved, shifting subtly to reflect his changing identity. Jack became Jackie — a name as adorable as it was feminine, solidifying his place in the anime-filled world. Yet, throughout this incredible journey, nobody seemed to notice the astonishing turn of events. Friends, family, and acquaintances remembered Jackie as always being the charming and stylish catgirl she had become. It was as if the memories of their shared pasts merged seamlessly with the present, making Jackie's transformation appear completely natural. And so, Jackie continued to live her extraordinary and magical life, feeling both grateful and enthralled by her new existence. She embraced her role as an anime catgirl, showcasing her immense tail, adorable outfits, and enchanting personality with pride. Now, Jackie eagerly anticipated each new day, eagerly awaiting the undiscovered adventures that lay ahead in her ever-evolving anime-filled world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

throw a bird at another, you kill two birds without the need for the stone\\".\\" said Michael to Alex. Alex could only reply: \\"I'm sorry, one, how does this philosophy work? And two, in a literal sense, how hard are you throwing that bird?\\"","output":"Michael and Alex sat on the porch swing, sipping on cold drinks as the scorching summer sun beat down on their small town. This was their usual spot for deep conversations and friendly banter, but today, Michael had something quite peculiar to share. \\"I've been pondering about life, Alex,\\" Michael began, looking out at the serene countryside. \\"Everyone always talks about 'killing two birds with one stone,' but I believe there's a more humane way to achieve the same result.\\" Alex raised an eyebrow, genuinely intrigued yet somewhat skeptical. \\"Okay, Michael, I'm all ears. How on earth does your philosophy work?\\" \\"Well,\\" Michael chuckled, \\"imagine you have two birds that you need to relocate from your backyard because they're causing havoc in your garden. Instead of using a stone to harm them, my idea is to gently toss one bird towards the other.\\" Alex's skepticism only deepened. \\"But wouldn't that still harm the bird being thrown? I mean, even if you're careful, it sounds quite risky.\\" Michael nodded understandingly. \\"I understand your concern, but hear me out. If the bird is thrown skillfully, it can glide gracefully towards the other one. Instead of causing harm, it's more like a strategic intervention, creating a diversion or capturing their attention. Birds are incredible creatures, agile and swift. They're capable of avoiding obstacles and landing safely on their own.\\" Rubbing his chin, Alex couldn't help but admire Michael's outside-the-box thinking. \\"I have to admit, that's surprisingly considerate. It's like employing the bird's own nature to resolve a problem. But tell me, doesn't this require impeccable timing and precision?\\" Michael grinned mischievously. \\"Indeed, it does! That's the thrilling part. It's like a game of skill, a dance with nature. It takes practice and perfect timing to pull it off effectively. Besides, if we aim for the overall well-being of the birds while keeping our gardens intact, it's a win-win situation.\\" Though still unsure about the practicality of Michael's philosophy, Alex couldn't help but appreciate his friend's unique perspective. \\"Well, Michael, you've certainly given me something to think about. But before we get carried away philosophizing, let's address the elephant in the room – how hard are you throwing these birds?\\" Michael chuckled heartily, shaking his head. \\"Oh, Alex, you always keep me grounded. Rest assured, my friend, I wouldn't dare throw them with any kind of force that could harm them. The intention is to ensure their safety while solving a problem.\\" They both burst into laughter, their worries momentarily forgotten. As the sun began to set, casting hues of orange and pink across the sky, Michael and Alex knew that no matter how peculiar or unorthodox their ideas may be, their friendship thrived on these endless conversations, challenge, and above all, understanding."},{"instruction":"The next day, Michael told Alex another one of his restructuring of quotes and proverbs. \\"\\"The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.\\" Usually attributed as an African proverb but I can't find the source for it.\\" \\"Yeah, I've heard of that. And it makes sense.\\" said Alex. Michael went on \\"But I thought of something new: \\"The child who is not sufficiently entertained by the village will burn it down just for the spectacle.\\"\\"","output":"Michael and Alex sat at their favorite coffee shop, the aroma of freshly brewed beans filling the air. Michael couldn't contain his excitement as he leaned in closer, eager to share his latest idea. \\"Alex, you know that quote, 'The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth'? It's often attributed as an African proverb, but I couldn't find the proper source for it.\\" Alex nodded, sipping his coffee thoughtfully. \\"Yeah, I've come across that one before. It's a powerful statement about the importance of community and acceptance.\\" A mischievous glint sparkled in Michael's eyes. \\"Well, I've been thinking, what if we put a different twist on it? What if we say, 'The child who is not sufficiently entertained by the village will burn it down just for the spectacle'?\\" Alex's eyebrows shot up in surprise. \\"That's certainly a unique interpretation. So, you're suggesting that if a child doesn't find enough excitement or engagement within their community, they may resort to causing chaos for the sake of creating a spectacle?\\" Michael nodded, a grin spreading across his face. \\"Exactly! Sometimes, when people feel bored or unfulfilled, they seek attention or stimulation in destructive ways. It's like they want to shake things up, to draw everyone's gaze towards them, even if it's through negative means.\\" Alex pondered for a moment, considering Michael's perspective. \\"I can see your point. It's like a cry for attention, a desperate attempt to break free from monotony. However, it also highlights the responsibility of the village to provide a vibrant, engaging environment for its children.\\" Michael's eyes lit up with enthusiasm. \\"That's precisely it, Alex! It's a call for communities to foster creativity, curiosity, and a sense of wonder. By providing opportunities for growth, exploration, and entertainment, we can prevent the burning down of our metaphorical 'villages'.\\" As they continued discussing their new proverb, Michael and Alex delved into the importance of nurturing a stimulating community, where individuals of all ages could thrive and find fulfillment. They recognized that the responsibility lay not only on the children but also on the village itself to ensure a vibrant and inclusive atmosphere. Their conversation flowed, each idea building upon the other. They brainstormed ways to create engaging programs, events, and spaces that would capture the imagination of the community, providing a sense of belonging and adventure for everyone involved. Hours passed, but Michael and Alex remained lost in their enthusiastic dialogue, fueled by their shared passion for reimagining traditional sayings and proverbs. Little did they know, their spirited discussions would inspire them to take action and bring positive change to their own village, one idea at a time."},{"instruction":"写一篇工会送清凉的活动方案","output":"活动主题：工会送清凉活动 一、活动背景 夏季是炎热的季节，为了让广大职工度过一个舒爽的夏天，提高工作效率，我们工会决定举办一场“工会送清凉”活动。 二、活动目标 1. 为广大职工提供清凉的活动，缓解工作压力，提高生活质量； 2. 加强职工之间的交流与沟通，增进工作团队的凝聚力； 3. 提升职工对工会的认同感和归属感。 三、活动内容 1. 游泳比赛 在周末的下午，组织一场游泳比赛，邀请所有职工参加。比赛设置不同难度和项目，让参赛者根据自己的能力进行选择，激发参与的热情。 2. 冰淇淋派对 在公司大厅搭建一个冰淇淋派对区域，派发各种口味的冰淇淋给职工品尝。还可以提供一些DIY冰淇淋的材料和工具，让职工亲自动手制作自己心仪的冰淇淋。 3. 水枪大战 在公司停车场或室外空旷区域搭建一个水枪战区，为职工提供水枪和水弹，组织水枪大战比赛。让职工在欢笑中感受到清凉的同时，释放工作压力。 4. 凉茶品鉴会 策划一场凉茶品鉴会，邀请专业的茶艺师现场展示泡茶的技巧，并介绍每种凉茶的功效和目标适应人群。职工可以跟随茶艺师学习制茶技巧，品尝各种凉茶，提升对茶文化的了解。 5. 清凉奖品赠送 举行抽奖环节，准备一些清凉奖品，如折叠伞、风扇、凉席等，让幸运的职工们能够享受到额外的清凉。 四、活动安排 时间：活动在公司范围内选择连续的两天，一般选择公休日进行。 地点：游泳比赛在附近的游泳池举行，其它活动场地在公司内合适的区域搭建。 人员：全体职工参与，活动执行需聘请专业人士进行指导。 费用：由公司工会自行承担。 五、活动宣传 1. 制作宣传海报，张贴在公司办公区域和休息区域； 2. 通过公司内部通讯工具，如企业微信或Email，向全体职工发布活动通知； 3. 在公司网站、微信公众号等平台发布活动相关内容，加强对活动的宣传。 六、活动评估 活动结束后，通过职工问卷调查、反馈会议等方式，收集职工对活动的意见和建议，为下一次活动改进和完善提供参考。 七、总结 活动的顺利进行将会增进职工对工会的认同感和归属感，提高工作积极性。通过工会送清凉活动，可以为广大职工提供一个舒适、愉快的夏天，促进职工之间的交流与互动，实现真正的工会服务职工。同时，也为企业营造了一个和谐、积极向上的工作氛围。"},{"instruction":"写一篇工会送清凉的活动总结","output":"工会送清凉活动总结 本次工会送清凉活动以提供清凉的活动为宗旨，旨在缓解职工的工作压力，提高生活质量，增强职工之间的交流与沟通，进一步提升职工对工会的认同感和归属感。 通过组织游泳比赛、冰淇淋派对、水枪大战、凉茶品鉴会和清凉奖品赠送等多个活动项目，我们成功地为广大职工提供了清凉与快乐。职工们积极参与各项活动，展示了团结合作、积极向上的精神风貌，增进了成员之间的友谊和凝聚力。 在活动中，游泳比赛提供了一个锻炼身体的机会，加强了职工的身体健康意识；冰淇淋派对让职工们在品尝美味的同时，体验了制作冰淇淋的乐趣；水枪大战以游戏的形式缓解了工作压力，增加了娱乐性和互动性；凉茶品鉴会让职工们对凉茶的功效有了更深入的认识；清凉奖品赠送为幸运的职工们提供了额外的惊喜。 活动期间，工会充分发挥了组织者的作用，认真策划、安排和推进活动，确保了每个环节的顺利进行。同时，通过各种宣传渠道，如海报、通讯工具和网络平台，广泛宣传了活动，增强了职工的参与度和积极性。 此外，我们在活动结束后进行了职工的评估，通过职工问卷调查、反馈会议等方式，收集了职工对活动的意见和建议。这些反馈将对我们下一次活动的改进和完善起到积极的作用。 总之，本次工会送清凉活动圆满成功。我们认为，通过这样的活动，不仅为广大职工提供了一个舒适、愉快的夏天，增进了职工的生活幸福感，也为企业创造了和谐积极的工作氛围。我们工会将继续努力，不断提升工作品质和服务水平，为职工提供更多的福利和关爱，始终以职工的需求为导向，切实履行工会的职责和使命。"},{"instruction":"用html写一个样式好看的表格","output":"下面是一个例子，展示了一个样式好看的表格： \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> table { font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

Calculate the scaling factor: Scaling factor = Number of desired portions / Number of original portions Scaling factor = 150 / 12 = 12.5 2. Convert the serving portion from tablespoons to the desired unit of measurement (e.g., cups): Since you mentioned the serving portion is 2 tablespoons, we need to convert it to cups for consistency with recipe measurements. 1 cup = 16 tablespoons Serving portion in cups = 2 tablespoons / 16 tablespoons per cup = 0.125 cups 3. Calculate the new ingredient amounts for each ingredient in the recipe: For each ingredient, multiply the original amount by the scaling factor calculated above. For example, let's say the original recipe calls for: - Ingredient A: 1 cup - Ingredient B: 2 cups - Ingredient C: 3 cups New ingredient amounts for catering to 150 people: - Ingredient A: 1 cup * 12.5 = 12.5 cups - Ingredient B: 2 cups * 12.5 = 25 cups - Ingredient C: 3 cups * 12.5 = 37.5 cups Repeat this calculation for all the ingredients in the recipe to determine the appropriate ratios for catering to 150 people."},{"instruction":"This recipe serves 12 people.

The environment is a dense forest, with towering trees and undergrowth stretching as far as the eye can see. Shafts of moonlight pierce through the thick canopy, creating patches of light and shadow on the forest floor. The forest is teeming with life, with the sounds of nocturnal creatures echoing through the night. The composition focuses on the preparations of the ninjas and the unsuspecting guards. The ninjas are huddled together in a circle, their weapons at the ready and their expressions focused and determined. The guards patrol the stronghold walls, unaware of the imminent attack, their faces etched with boredom and fatigue. The mood of the scene is one of anticipation and stealth. The atmosphere is charged with tension, as the ninjas move silently through the darkness, their every step calculated and precise. The forest itself seems to hold its breath, waiting for the climax of the battle. The night air is cool and crisp, adding to the sense of urgency and focus. For this prompt, a photography style is appropriate to capture the realism of the scene. A wide-angle lens is used to encompass the vastness of the forest, while a shallow depth of field is employed to focus on the ninjas and guards, emphasizing their contrasting roles in the imminent conflict. The prompt calls for the image to be captured with a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV camera, using a 24-70mm lens, allowing for versatility in capturing both the wider scene and the details of the characters. /imagine prompt: In the heart of a stormy night, a group of brave ninjas stealthily make their way through a desolate mountain pass, leading to an ancient temple. The thunder rumbles ominously, and bolts of lightning occasionally light up the dark sky, providing fleeting glimpses of the treacherous path ahead. The ninjas, determined and resilient, press on despite the harsh conditions. A fierce battle awaits them at the temple gates. The environment is a rugged mountain pass, with sharp cliffs and jagged rocks. The wind howls through the narrow path, threatening to sweep the ninjas off their feet. Rain pours down in torrents, creating small rivulets that trickle along the path. The temple, nestled atop the mountain, is barely visible through the stormy haze. The composition emphasizes the treacherous nature of the journey. The ninjas navigate the treacherous path with agility and determination, their figures slightly bent against the wind. The temple looms ominously in the distance, its silhouette barely discernible through the storm. The composition captures the contrast between the ninjas and the harsh elements of nature. The mood of the scene is one of bravery and resilience in the face of adversity. The atmosphere is charged with the elements, as rain lashes against the figures and the wind howls through the mountains. The air is electric with the anticipation of the battle that awaits the ninjas at the temple gates. For this prompt, a sculpture style is suitable to capture the dynamic nature of the scene. The different materials used should convey the textures and contrast between the ninjas and the elements. The sculpture should be realistic in form, with attention to the details of the ninjas' expressions and movements. The style should be reminiscent of traditional Japanese sculptures, creating a sense of timelessness and reverence. --ar 16:9 --v 5"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Aluminum Cabinet Handles的定义","output":"铝制柜手把是一种常见的家居装饰和家具配件，通常用于柜子、抽屉和橱柜等家居家具上。它的主要特点是由铝材制成，具有轻巧、耐用、易于清洁和抗腐蚀的优点。铝制柜手把通常具有简约而现代的设计，与各种家居风格相匹配。它们可以是直线型、弧型、U型或其他形状，也可以是单色或多色的，以提供不同的装饰效果。铝制柜手把还可以根据需要安装，通常使用螺钉或其他固定方式。总之，铝制柜手把是一种实用而时尚的家居配件，为家居家具增添美观和便利性。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Aluminum Cabinet Handles的特点与优势","output":"铝制柜手柄具有以下特点与优势： 1. 轻巧耐用：铝材料具有轻质且坚固的特性，使得铝制柜手柄相较于其他材料更加轻便且不易疲劳变形，能够长时间使用而不失其稳定性。 2. 耐腐蚀：铝制柜手柄不会受潮、生锈、腐蚀等影响，即使长时间暴露在潮湿环境下或经受化学物质的腐蚀，也能保持良好的外观和性能。 3. 美观大方：铝制柜手柄具有简约大气的外观设计，无论是用于家居还是商业场所的柜子，都能够为其增添一份雅致和现代感。 4. 安装方便：铝制柜手柄通常采用螺丝固定方式，安装简单方便，只需将手柄固定在柜门上即可。 5. 多样化选择：铝制柜手柄具有丰富的款式、颜色和表面处理方式可供选择，可以根据个人喜好和使用需求来挑选最适合的款式。 6. 高温耐性：铝材料具有良好的导热性，能够快速散发热量，使铝制柜手柄能够在高温环境下保持冷却，不易烫伤用户。 总之，铝制柜手柄以其轻巧耐用、耐腐蚀、美观大方以及安装方便等特点和优势，在柜子的开关和推拉过程中提供了良好的使用体验。"},{"instruction":"化工专业可以考哪些证书","output":"化工专业可以考取以下证书： 1. 高级化学工程师资格证书（技术职称等级证书） 2. 化学工程师（注册职业资格证书） 3. 化学分析师（注册职业资格证书） 4. 环境工程师（注册职业资格证书） 5. 安全工程师（注册职业资格证书） 6. 职业健康与安全管理体系内审员（职业资格证书） 7. 质量管理体系内审员（职业资格证书） 8. 职业教师资格证书（高等学校教师） 9. 专利代理师（专利代理人资格证书） 10. 工程师（化学与化工工程专业技术职务） 这些证书可以提升化工专业人员的技能水平和职业竞争力，并可以在职业发展中起到积极的推动作用。同时，具体考取哪些证书还需根据自身的职业规划和发展方向来确定。"},{"instruction":"大专文凭可以考小学教师资格证吗？详细","output":"根据中国教育部的规定，大专文凭不具备直接申请小学教师资格证的条件。根据《教师法》第十一条规定，小学教师必须获得本科以上学历，并通过专门组织的教师资格考试，获得相应的教师资格证书。 因此，如果您拥有大专文凭，希望成为小学教师，首先需要进一步通过自学或继续教育的方式，获得本科及以上学历。然后，您可以参加教师资格考试，通过考试后获得小学教师资格证。 建议您在考虑职业规划时，详细了解相关的教师资格要求和考试流程，并咨询当地教育部门或学校相关部门，以获得最准确的信息。"},{"instruction":"安保证怎么考取需要什么条件？","output":"安保证指的是安全员职业资格证书，它是针对从事保安、安全服务等职业的人员所设置的职业资格证书。通常，要考取安保证需要满足以下条件： 1. 年龄条件：通常要求年满18周岁以上； 2. 学历要求：一般要求高中及以上学历，大专及以上学历可以优先考虑； 3. 健康条件：需要体检合格，无严重疾病或患有影响从事相关职业的疾病； 4. 具备公民身份：一般要求为中华人民共和国公民； 5. 无犯罪记录：要求没有犯罪记录或不良信用记录； 6. 培训要求：需要参加相关的安保培训课程，并通过考核。 具体的考取流程和要求可能会因地区、国家等因素有所不同，建议您在考取安保证前，仔细阅读并遵守相关部门或机构发布的官方文件、公告，了解具体的考试要求和申请流程。"},{"instruction":"gsp证书怎么考","output":"GSP证书是指“药品经营质量管理规范认证证书”，主要针对从事药品经营的企业，特别是药品批发和零售企业的质量管理要求。以下是GSP证书的考取流程： 1. 准备材料：准备企业的相关资料，包括企业营业执照、法人代表身份证、药品经营许可证等。 2. 咨询培训机构：联系当地认证机构或认证培训机构咨询关于GSP证书的培训和认证要求。 3. 培训学习：参加GSP培训课程，了解GSP的具体要求和管理措施，掌握药品经营质量管理的相关知识。 4. 实施整改：根据培训内容，对企业的管理制度和流程进行整改，确保符合GSP要求。 5. 委托申请：由企业自行或委托认证机构进行GSP证书的审核和申请。这包括提交相关的申请材料，接受认证机构的现场审查和验证。 6. 认证审核：认证机构对企业进行现场审核，包括对质量管理制度、设施设备、人员培训、仓储管理等方面的评估和验证。 7. 颁发证书：经过审核合格后，认证机构会颁发GSP证书给企业，表明企业的药品经营质量管理符合GSP要求。 需要注意的是，GSP证书的申请和考取过程可能会因国家和地区的要求而有所不同，建议您详细了解当地的相关政策和规定，并咨询专业机构或认证机构以获取准确的信息和指导。"},{"instruction":"cfa协会的esg证书国内怎么考","output":"目前CFA协会并没有推出专门的ESG证书，但CFA协会在其职业道德准则中强调对环境、社会和公司治理（ESG）因素的重视。CFA考试的教材也会涵盖一些与ESG相关的内容。 如果您对ESG有特别的兴趣或想在该领域深入学习和发展，可以考虑以下几种方式： 1. 参加CFA协会相关课程：CFA协会推出了一些独立的短期课程，如《ESG考察和投资实战》等。这些课程可以帮助您深入了解ESG的理念、方法和实践。 2. 参加ESG培训班或课程：国内一些培训机构或高校开设了与ESG相关的培训班或课程，通过学习这些课程可以系统地掌握ESG的知识和技能。 3. 考取其他ESG相关证书：国内一些专业机构也提供了与ESG相关的证书培训和考试，如《中国注册企业社会责任管理师》等。通过考取这些证书可以获取专业的ESG认证。 需要注意的是，ESG是一个相对新兴的领域，目前国内的相关证书体系还在发展中，因此选取合适的培训机构和课程时，建议您仔细了解其质量和认可度，并结合自身的职业规划和需求做出选择。"},{"instruction":"Create rdp using github lifetime","output":"I apologize, but I'm not able to generate the specific code you're looking for."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好! 有什么可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"故宫里有哪些神兽","output":"故宫里有以下几只神兽： 1. 石狮：石狮位于故宫的门前，一般是成双成对的站立，作为守护和防止邪灵入侵的象征。 2. 大蟠龙：大蟠龙即九龙壁，位于故宫北端，是一面贴满有九条巨龙的墙壁，象征着皇家的威严和权力。 3. 麒麟：麒麟是中国传统神兽之一，象征着吉祥和幸福。故宫中的麒麟多是以石雕的形式出现，常常可以在屋顶的角落或者门柱上看到。 4. 螭龙：螭龙是一种传说中的神兽，形似龙，通常有鱼身、蛇尾，角如鹿角，不开口，是一种带有镇宅辟邪作用的神兽。在故宫中，常可见到螭龙纹饰，如屏风、花盆等。 总的来说，故宫里的神兽主要包括石狮、大蟠龙、麒麟和螭龙等。"},{"instruction":"故宫里的排水设施","output":"故宫作为一座古代宫殿，排水设施相对简单，并没有像现代建筑那样完备的管道系统。在故宫的建筑中，采用了一种古代的排水系统，主要包括以下几种方式： 1. 暗沟排水：主要是指建筑内部的暗沟，用于排放建筑内的污水和雨水。暗沟通常位于建筑墙基下方，通过坡度导向外部的排水系统，将水流排出。 2. 水井：故宫内部有多处水井，用于收集和储存雨水。这些水井通常位于院落的角落，也可以用于日常生活的用水。 3. 渠道和溜槽：在故宫中，还可以看到一些渠道和溜槽，用于引导和排放雨水。这些渠道和溜槽通常隐藏在地面下或者建筑物的墙角处。 需要注意的是，由于故宫建筑的年代久远，排水系统可能经过多次修复和改建，因此具体情况可能会有所差异。不过，总体来说，故宫的排水设施主要采用了暗沟、水井和渠道等方式。"},{"instruction":"故宫千龙吐水","output":"故宫千龙吐水是指故宫前院正中的“千龙吐水大理石龙池”。这个大理石龙池位于太和门前的广场上，是故宫的标志性景观之一。 千龙吐水池的总长约72米，池中分布着550多条龙，有大小不同、形态各异的石龙。其中主要有七龙，有的蜿蜒盘旋，有的张牙舞爪，栩栩如生。这些龙各自扎根于龙池内，如同在水中游动般的造型，非常壮观。 在节气特殊的日子或者重要的庆典活动中，千龙吐水池会放水表演。当水流从龙口中喷出，形成喷泉效果时，给人一种神龙出水的感觉，场面非常壮观。 千龙吐水池不仅是故宫的观赏景点，也是古代皇帝接待贵宾和举办庆典活动的场所。通过千龙吐水的设计，展现了中国古代皇家建筑的雄伟和神圣气势。"},{"instruction":"summarise the news: \\"China’s central bank pledged to avoid excessive movements in the yuan as the currency slides toward its weakest level since 2007. The People’s Bank of China also said it will “step up macroeconomic policy adjustment,” while largely reaffirming its policy stance, according to its quarterly monetary policy report published Thursday. The central bank said it will resolutely prevent “over-adjustment” in the yuan, which it said has yet to deviate from its fundamentals. The PBOC has experiences and ample policy tools to safeguard a stable foreign exchange market, it said. The central bank has taken stronger steps recently to bolster the currency by setting the daily reference rate at a higher level than markets expect. Chinese authorities also told state-owned banks to step up intervention in the currency market this week and are studying other ways to prop up the yuan, according to people familiar with the matter. The PBOC reiterated it will implement a targeted and forceful monetary policy, and make use of various tools to ensure liquidity remains reasonably ample. It also said it will optimize property policies when appropriate. Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said the comments suggested more monetary easing may be on the cards following this week’s unexpected interest rate cut. “We believe more rate actions or reserve requirement ratio cuts will be taken,” he said. There could also be more support measures for the property industry, he said. The central bank highlighted challenges to the economy, including households’ weak income outlook, insufficient private investment confidence and growing pressure on local government finances. It vowed to make credit growth more stable and sustainable, and to adjust property policies when appropriate. Echoing recent comments from the statistics bureau, the PBOC said China is not in deflation, and consumer price inflation will likely rebound starting from August. The PBOC’s rate cut this week, the biggest since 2020, came shortly before official data showed economic activity slumped more than expected in July.

Esta bacteria es considerada el ancestro común más antiguo conocido de todos los organismos, y su estudio proporciona valiosas pistas sobre los orígenes y la evolución de la vida en nuestro planeta. La teoría de LUCA sostiene que esta bacteria es el antepasado común de todos los seres vivos que existen en la actualidad. Según esta teoría, hace aproximadamente 3.500 millones de años, LUCA fue el primer organismo en aparecer en la Tierra y dio origen a las diferentes ramas de la vida que conocemos en la actualidad. Aunque no se ha logrado identificar a LUCA directamente, su existencia es inferida a través del estudio de los genomas de distintas especies. El estudio de las bacterias LUCA es fundamental para comprender cómo la vida surgieron y evolucionaron. Al analizar los genomas de las diferentes especies, los científicos pueden identificar secuencias genéticas y moléculas conservadas que muestran similitudes entre los organismos actuales. Estas similitudes sugieren que existe un ancestro común en algún punto de la historia evolutiva, y LUCA es considerado como el candidato más probable. La existencia de LUCA respalda la teoría evolutiva propuesta por Charles Darwin, ya que demuestra que todos los seres vivos están relacionados y comparten una ascendencia común. La evolución implica cambios a lo largo del tiempo, y LUCA es un testigo clave de los primeros pasos de este proceso. Al estudiar sus características y compararlas con las de otros organismos, los científicos pueden establecer conexiones y reconstruir la filogenia de la vida en la Tierra. Es importante tener en cuenta que LUCA no es una bacteria común y corriente. Su existencia y estudio representan un desafío científico considerable, ya que hablamos de un organismo que se remonta a miles de millones de años atrás. Sin embargo, los avances en técnicas de secuenciación genética y bioinformática han permitido obtener información valiosa sobre este antiguo ancestro. En resumen, la bacteria LUCA es un organismo de gran relevancia para comprender los orígenes y la evolución de la vida en la Tierra. Su estudio proporciona evidencias sólidas en apoyo a la teoría evolutiva y nos permite reconstruir la filogenia de los seres vivos.

There are a few reasons for this: 1. Regulatory restrictions: Some countries and airlines have strict regulations that prohibit the use of personal Wi-Fi equipment on aircraft. These regulations are in place to ensure flight safety and prevent interference with the aircraft's communication and navigation systems. 2. Bandwidth limitations: In-flight Wi-Fi services require a specialized infrastructure that operates on specific frequencies and bandwidth allocated for aviation communications. Personal Wi-Fi routers may not be compatible with these systems, which are designed to provide reliable and secure connectivity for passengers. 3. Cost and technology limitations: Equipping an entire aircraft with in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity requires significant investment in equipment and infrastructure. Airlines need to partner with specialized providers to offer this service, and personal Wi-Fi routers cannot connect to these systems without proper authorization and configuration. 4. Security concerns: In-flight Wi-Fi networks are subject to strict security protocols to protect passengers' privacy and prevent unauthorized access. Personal Wi-Fi routers may not have the necessary security measures in place, making them potential vulnerabilities in the network. Overall, the absence of personal Wi-Fi routers on planes is primarily due to regulatory restrictions, the need for specialized infrastructure, and security concerns. However, it's worth noting that some airlines do provide Wi-Fi services onboard, but these are usually installed and operated by the airline or a dedicated provider."},{"instruction":"how are wireless wifi wireless if you need wires to use it","output":"Wireless Wi-Fi refers to the technology that allows devices to connect to a network without the need for physical wired connections. While it is true that wireless routers require wires to connect to the internet service provider (ISP), the devices connected to the router can communicate with the router and access the internet wirelessly. Here's a simplified explanation of how wireless Wi-Fi works: 1. Internet connection: The wireless router is connected to an ISP via an Ethernet cable. This cable brings the internet connection to the router. 2. Wireless transmission: The router converts the wired internet connection into a wireless signal using internal antennas. This signal is then broadcasted throughout your home or office space. 3. Device connectivity: Wi-Fi-enabled devices such as smartphones, laptops, or tablets detect the wireless signal and connect to the router wirelessly. They communicate with the router using radio waves. 4. Data exchange: Once connected, devices can send and receive data with other devices on the network or access the internet through the router. The router acts as a central hub, managing and directing data traffic between devices. So, while there are wires involved in the setup of a wireless router, the actual connectivity between devices and the router is achieved wirelessly through radio waves. This wireless connection allows for greater mobility and convenience, as devices can access the internet without the limitation of physical cables."},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Aluminium Handle For Cabinet的特点与优势","output":"Aluminium Handle For Cabinet（铝制柜把手）是一种用于家具柜、橱柜等的铝合金材质的把手。这种把手具有以下特点和优势： 1. 高强度：铝合金材质具有良好的强度和硬度，能够承受较大的拉力和不易变形，能够长时间使用而不失效。 2. 耐腐蚀：铝合金材质具有良好的抗腐蚀性，不容易受到潮湿环境、酸碱等外界因素的侵蚀，能够保持长时间的使用寿命。 3. 轻便：相比于其他金属材质的把手，铝合金材质更轻巧，使用起来更加方便，可以减轻家具的整体重量。 4. 外观美观：铝合金把手的表面处理工艺多样，可以进行电泳、喷涂等处理，使其具有亮丽的外观，能够提升整个家具的美观度。 5. 易于清洁：铝合金把手表面光滑平整，不易积累灰尘和污垢，使用和清洁起来更加方便。 6. 耐用性高：铝合金具有较高的耐用性，不易磨损或断裂，可以长时间保持良好的使用状态。 总之，铝制柜把手具有高强度、耐腐蚀、轻便、美观、易清洁和耐用等特点和优势，是家具柜、橱柜等家居装饰中常见的把手之一。"},{"instruction":"Python imgui 怎么给input_text设置回调","output":"在imgui中给\`input_text\`设置回调可以使用\`imgui.input_text()\`函数，并且指定\`callback\`参数为一个回调函数。 下面是一个示例代码，演示如何给\`input_text\`设置回调函数： \`\`\`python import imgui # 回调函数 def input_callback(sender, value): print(f\\"Sender: {sender}, Value: {value}\\") # 创建一个imgui窗口 imgui.create_context() imgui.create_window(\\"Example\\", 400, 200) # 设置回调函数 imgui.input_text('Input', callback=input_callback) # 主循环 while not imgui.should_stop(): imgui.render() imgui.new_frame() imgui.show_demo_window() imgui.end_frame() imgui.render_frame() # 销毁imgui窗口 imgui.destroy_context() \`\`\` 在上面的示例中，\`input_callback()\`定义了一个回调函数，用于处理输入文本变化事件。然后，通过\`imgui.input_text()\`函数指定了\`callback\`参数为这个回调函数。 当用户在输入文本框中输入文本时，回调函数会被触发，可以在回调函数中处理输入文本的变化。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Aluminium Handles For Drawers的定义","output":"铝抽屉手柄是一种用来打开和关闭抽屉的装置，它通常由铝制成。铝抽屉手柄具有轻质、耐腐蚀和耐用的特点，因此被广泛应用于家居、办公室和商业场所的抽屉家具上。它们可安装在抽屉的正面或侧面，方便用户轻松地进行抽屉的开关操作。铝抽屉手柄的设计多样，常见的形状有直线型、C型、L型等。铝抽屉手柄还可以根据个人喜好进行表面处理，如阳极氧化、喷涂或拉丝处理，以增加其美观性和与家具风格的搭配性。总之，铝抽屉手柄是一种实用、耐用且美观的家居装饰品，能提升抽屉家具的实用性和美感。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Aluminium Handles For Drawers的特点与优势","output":"Aluminium Handles For Drawers（铝合金抽屉手柄）具有以下特点与优势： 1. 轻巧耐用：铝合金材质使得抽屉手柄轻巧而坚固，能够承受较大的压力和重量，不易变形或损坏，具有出色的耐用性。 2. 环保健康：铝合金是一种环保材料，通过再生利用可以减少对自然资源的消耗。此外，铝合金不含有有害物质，使用时不会释放出有毒物质，安全可靠。 3. 美观大方：铝合金手柄的外观简洁、现代感强，通常有光滑的表面处理，可以与各种家居装饰风格相匹配，给抽屉增添质感和美感。 4. 不易生锈：铝合金抽屉手柄具有较强的耐腐蚀性，不会受到湿气和潮湿环境的影响而生锈。因此，它可以在潮湿的厨房和浴室等地方使用，保持长久的使用寿命。 5. 易于清洁：铝合金手柄表面光滑平整，不易积聚尘土和污渍，只需用湿布轻轻擦拭即可保持干净。这大大减少了清洁的麻烦。 总之，铝合金抽屉手柄具有耐用、环保、美观、不易生锈和易于清洁等一系列优势，成为家居装饰中常用的选择。"},{"instruction":"you know how make a cool and easy customized discord channel ?","output":"Yes, I can help you create a cool and customized Discord channel.

Unicode字符集： - Unicode是一种标准字符编码系统，它使用统一的编码方案来表示世界上所有的字符。 - Unicode字符集使用固定长度的编码单元，通常为16位（2个字节）或32位（4个字节）。 - Unicode字符集可以支持世界上几乎所有的字符，包括ASCII字符以及来自各种语言和符号系统的字符。 - 最常用的Unicode编码方案是UTF-8、UTF-16和UTF-32。 在使用字符串处理函数时，需要注意当前使用的字符集编码。对于MFC中的CString类，它具有宽字符集（Unicode）和多字节字符集（MBCS）两种模式。可以根据程序的需要选择适当的字符集模式，并确保字符集一致性，以避免乱码和字符转换问题。"},{"instruction":"昨天的日期是什么","output":"昨天的日期是根据您所处的时区和当前日期来确定的。请告诉我您所在的时区或城市，我将为您提供昨天的日期。"},{"instruction":"中国","output":"如果您位于中国的时区（中国标准时间，UTC+8），那么昨天的日期是： 当前日期 - 1天 = 昨天的日期 请注意，由于时区的差异，上述日期可能与您实际所在地的日期略有不同。"},{"instruction":"之后又经多次催要，被告仍未向原告偿还过一分钱。续写","output":"法庭再次开庭，案件依然紧张地进行着。被告的态度仍然冷漠，毫不在意地坐在被告席上，似乎对自己的行为没有丝毫悔意。 原告的代理律师站了起来，目光坚定地注视着被告：“尊敬的法官，我们已多次催要被告偿还欠款，但是被告却毫不配合，完全无视我们的请求。根据法律，被告应该承担相应的法律责任。” 法官沉默片刻，然后严肃地看着被告：“被告，你有什么解释吗？为何一直拒绝偿还原告的合法权益？” 被告慵懒地耸了耸肩：“我没钱，没有能力偿还。” 法官皱了皱眉头，摆斥道：“每个人都要为自己的行为负责，你不能因为没有钱而逃避责任。如果你真的没有能力偿还，你应该积极与原告商讨解决方案，而不是完全置之不理。” 被告的态度让法官十分生气，他知道要给被告一个教训，同时也要保护原告的合法权益。于是，法官做出了一个决定：“被告，鉴于你的态度和违法行为，法庭判决你必须尽快支付欠款，并承担相应的法律责任。如果一旦拒绝执行，你可能面临更严重的后果。” 被告的脸上浮现出一丝惊愕，他终于意识到自己逃不过法律的制裁。在法庭的指示下，他被要求在一个指定的时间内支付欠款，以避免更严厉的处罚。 经过一段时间的等待，被告终于支付了欠款。原告收到款项后，感到一种胜利的喜悦涌上心头，他为自己坚持不懈地追求正义感到骄傲。 这起案件不仅给被告敲响了警钟，也给了其他人一个警示：无论是谁，无论面对什么困难，都不能逃避责任。法律是公平而公正的，它将保护每一个人的权益，同时给予犯罪者应有的惩罚。 这起案件的审判结束了，但正义的火种在所有人心中熊熊燃烧，让人们相信，公正和正义依然存在，将为每一个受伤害的人伸张权益。"},{"instruction":"之后又经多次催要，被告仍未向原告偿还过一分钱。将上述诉状补充后续文字内容","output":"原告向本法院提交诉状后，法院对被告进行了传唤并提醒其履行还款义务。然而，被告不但没有按照法院的要求偿还款项，还对原告的催讨行为置若罔闻。 原告经过多次催要以及法院的传唤与提醒，被告仍然未向原告偿还过一分钱。被告明显无视法院的决议与裁决，在逐渐逃避还款责任的过程中，诸如转移财产、迁址等行为频频出现。 在被告屡次拒绝履行还款义务的情况下，原告被迫不得不寻求法律援助，以维护自己的合法权益。原告希望法院严肃对待被告的逃避行为，并采取适当的强制措施来确保被告按时偿还债务。 鉴于被告的明显恶意逃避还款行为，原告请求法院对被告加以法律制裁，包括但不限于责令被告立即履行还款义务、冻结、查封被告的财产、限制被告的个人行动自由等措施，以确保原告能够合法获得应有的债权。 原告坚信，本案的事实清楚，证据确凿，被告的行为严重侵犯了原告的权益，对其造成了严重的损失与困扰。原告请求法院能依法判决被告立即履行还款义务，并承担由此产生的违约金与滞纳金等损失。同时，原告请求法院酌情考虑赔偿原告因被告的不法行为所导致的其他损失，以实现正义与公平。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Stainless Steel Shower Door Handles的定义","output":"不锈钢淋浴门把手是一种用于淋浴门的装饰性和功能性元素。它通常由不锈钢制成，具有耐腐蚀、耐候性和耐久性。这种把手的设计可以根据个人喜好和需求而变化，一般有直线型、弧形型、拉杆型等多种款式。不锈钢淋浴门把手的主要作用是提供方便的开关和关闭淋浴门的功能，并增加淋浴门的整体美观性。它可以安装在淋浴门上的侧边或顶部，提供稳固的抓握点，方便用户打开和关闭淋浴门。与其他材质的把手相比，不锈钢材质具有耐腐蚀和防锈的特性，适合在潮湿的浴室环境中使用，并且容易清洁和维护。总之，不锈钢淋浴门把手是一种经济实用且耐用的选择，可以提高淋浴门的实用性和美观性。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Stainless Steel Shower Door Handles的特点与优势","output":"不锈钢淋浴门把手是一种用于淋浴门的装饰性配件，具有以下特点与优势： 1. 材质坚固耐用：不锈钢是一种耐腐蚀的金属材料，具有耐久性和长寿命。不容易生锈、褪色或变形，确保淋浴门把手的品质和外观持久稳定。 2. 环保健康：不锈钢淋浴门把手不含有害物质，对人体无害，符合环保标准。使用不锈钢把手可以避免一些金属材料可能对人体健康造成的潜在风险。 3. 易于清洁：不锈钢材质表面光滑，不容易沾染尘土、细菌或水渍。只需用清水擦拭或使用中性清洁剂即可轻松清洁，节省时间和精力。 4. 优雅美观：不锈钢淋浴门把手的设计简约而时尚，可搭配不同风格的淋浴门，为浴室增添一抹现代感和高级感。其亮度和质感还能提升浴室整体的美观度。 5. 安全可靠：不锈钢淋浴门把手具有较高的强度和稳定性，能够承受较大的拉力和压力。同时，其表面的防滑设计使用户在使用时更加安全可靠，避免意外摔倒或伤害。 总而言之，不锈钢淋浴门把手具有耐用、环保、易清洁、美观和安全可靠等优点，成为现代浴室装饰中的热门选择。"},{"instruction":"ok, I got a simpller and better idea here. let's just continously spawn a random emojicons in each slot before original random emojicon appears. now try to implement this concept. and output your variant wrapped in codeblocks in this chat.: <html> <head> <title>Riddle Slots</title> <style> .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; padding: 0px; margin-bottom: 0; position: relative; } #emoji-container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-wrap: wrap; background-color: PaleGoldenrod; padding: 0px 0; } #reset-button { margin-left: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\\"container\\"> <h1>Riddle Slots</h1> <div id=\\"difficulty-container\\"> <span id=\\"difficulty\\">Current difficulty: Secret&nbsp;</span>|&nbsp; <span id=\\"change-difficulty\\">options</span> <div id=\\"difficulty-panel\\" style=\\"display: none\\">: Difficulty: <span class=\\"difficulty-level\\">Secret</span>, <span class=\\"difficulty-level\\">Enigma</span>, <span class=\\"difficulty-level\\">Wonderland</span>. </div> <div id=\\"score\\"></div><button id=\\"reset-button\\">Reset</button> </div> <div id=\\"emoji-container\\" class=\\"emoji-container-circle\\" data-spin-count=\\"2\\"> <button class=\\"emoji-btn\\">🍔</button> <button class=\\"emoji-btn\\">🌮</button> <button class=\\"emoji-btn\\">🥨</button> </div> <div id=\\"riddle-container\\"></div> <div id=\\"notification\\"></div> </div> <script> (() => { const emojiButtons = document.querySelectorAll(\\".emoji-btn\\"); const riddleContainer = document.querySelector(\\"#riddle-container\\"); const notification = document.querySelector(\\"#notification\\"); const scoreField = document.querySelector(\\"#score\\"); const changeDifficultyButton = document.querySelector(\\"#change-difficulty\\"); const resetButton = document.querySelector(\\"#reset-button\\"); const difficultyPanel = document.querySelector(\\"#difficulty-panel\\"); const difficultyLevels = document.querySelectorAll(\\".difficulty-level\\"); let score = 0; let riddles = { secret: [ { emoji: \\"🍔\\", question: \\"I am a popular fast food item.

Основные элементы питания, которые требуют смородина и крыжовник, - это азот, фосфор и калий. Во время плодоношения растения тратят большое количество питательных веществ, поэтому после сбора урожая важно восстановить запасы питания в почве. Азот является необходимым для поддержания зеленой массы растений и хорошего роста. Чтобы подкормить смородину и крыжовник азотом, можно использовать органические удобрения, такие как перегноя, компост или органические удобрения в жидком виде. Рекомендуемое количество азотных удобрений составляет около 30 г на 1 квадратный метр. Фосфор необходим для развития корневой системы и формирования цветочных почек. Для подкормки смородины и крыжовника фосфором можно использовать фосфорные удобрения, такие как осадок из аквариумов или специальные удобрения с высоким содержанием фосфора. Рекомендуется вносить около 20 г фосфора на 1 квадратный метр земли. Калий способствует устойчивости растений к стрессу, созреванию плодов и сохранению плодов на растении. Его можно получить из золы древесных растений или использовать готовые калийные удобрения. Рекомендуемое количество калия составляет около 30 г на 1 квадратный метр земли. Кроме основных элементов питания, кусты смородины и крыжовника также нуждаются в микроэлементах, таких как железо, магний и марганец. Если почва в вашем саду имеет нехватку этих элементов, можно использовать специальные комплексные удобрения или приготовить раствор травяной подкормки. Подкормка кустов смородины и крыжовника после плодоношения должна выполняться весной, после таяния снега. Удобрения можно вносить в землю рядом с кустами, равномерно распределяя их по всей площади вокруг куста. Рекомендуется поливать растения после подкормки, чтобы удобрения быстро проникли в почву.

Firstly, high voltage power lines are essential infrastructures used for the transmission of electricity across long distances. However, these power lines generate and emit strong EMF due to the flow of high currents. EMF consists of electric and magnetic fields that can interact with biological systems. Physics provides the necessary understanding of EMF, allowing us to assess potential health risks associated with exposure to these fields. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the long-term effects of EMF on human health, particularly in relation to their association with cancer, neurological disorders, and other health conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established guidelines, such as the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), to ensure safe exposure limits to EMF. High voltage power lines, due to their close proximity to human populations, can expose individuals to elevated EMF levels. As a result, it is necessary to examine the potential health effects on people living in both urban and rural communities. To address this claim, physics methodologies could be utilized to assess the exposure levels of EMF from high voltage power lines and evaluate their potential health risks. Electromagnetic modeling techniques can be employed to predict the field strengths and distributions around power lines. Measurements can then be conducted to validate these predictions and assess the actual levels of exposure. Furthermore, studies could focus on the biological effects of EMF on human cells and tissues. Cell culture experiments can be performed to investigate any biological changes induced by the exposure to EMF from high voltage power lines. Additionally, epidemiological studies can be conducted to analyze the health records of individuals living near power lines and compare them with control groups to determine any correlations between EMF exposure and health outcomes. Overall, physics plays a crucial role in assessing the potential health risks associated with exposure to EMF from high voltage power lines. By conducting thorough investigations and analyses, it is possible to determine whether shielding or other mitigation methods are necessary to protect the health of people in urban and rural communities. These assessments contribute to evidence-based decision-making regarding power line infrastructure planning and policies aimed at minimizing potential health risks."},{"instruction":"write a a level physics rationale for the claim and break it down into how emf effects honey bees : High voltage power lines need to be shielded to protect the health of people in urban and rural communities.","output":"The claim \\"High voltage power lines need to be shielded to protect the health of people in urban and rural communities\\" raises important questions about the potential impact of electromagnetic fields (EMF) from power lines on both human health and the health of honey bees, which are essential pollinators in ecosystems and agriculture. It is well established that high voltage power lines generate strong EMF due to the flow of high currents, and this can extend to significant distances from the lines. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate the potential effects of EMF on honey bees and their overall health. This rationale will focus on how EMF may impact honey bees, providing a physics-based approach to understand the claim. Firstly, honey bees are highly sensitive to environmental cues and rely on Earth's magnetic field for navigation. EMF from power lines can interfere with bee navigation by disrupting their ability to detect and utilize the Earth's magnetic field. Therefore, it is crucial to examine how EMF exposure affects honey bee navigation and their ability to forage efficiently, return to the hive, and maintain overall colony health. Secondly, honey bees exhibit complex social behaviors within their colonies. EMF exposure may impact their ability to communicate effectively and coordinate tasks such as foraging, brood care, and food storage. Investigating the potential disruptions or changes in honey bee behavior caused by proximity to power lines can provide insights into the broader impact on their social organization, reproduction, and overall colony health and productivity. Physics provides tools and theories to understand EMF generation and propagation. Measurements can be conducted near power lines to quantify the strength and frequency spectra of EMF exposure at different distances from the lines. Electromagnetic modeling and calculations can then be employed to estimate the EMF intensities experienced by honey bees within their colonies near power lines. These assessments can help determine whether shielding or other mitigation measures are needed to minimize the potential impact on honey bees. Furthermore, controlled experiments can be conducted to directly investigate the effects of EMF exposure on honey bees. These experiments can involve exposing honey bees to specific frequencies and intensities of EMF and then monitoring their behavior, navigation abilities, reproductive success, and overall colony health. By isolating the specific variables of EMF exposure, it becomes possible to correlate the observed effects with the presence of high voltage power lines in the environment. In conclusion, addressing the claim regarding the need to shield high voltage power lines for the protection of human health necessitates a thorough understanding of the potential impact of EMF on honey bees. Applying physics principles and methodologies allows us to investigate the effects of EMF exposure on honey bee behavior, navigation, and overall colony health. This knowledge can contribute to evidence-based decision-making regarding power line infrastructure planning and policies aimed at minimizing potential risks to both human and honey bee populations."},{"instruction":"do pandabuy have good reps","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot browse the internet or provide real-time information.

Этот способ выращивания растений имеет множество плюсов, но не лишен и некоторых минусов. Давайте рассмотрим их подробнее. Плюс №1: Удобство и доступность Высокие грядки – это поднесенные над землей цветочные и овощные грядки. Они являются удобным решением для тех, кто не может работать на коленях из-за проблем со здоровьем или возрастных ограничений. Такие грядки можно разместить на плоской поверхности, которая значительно облегчит работу сравнительно с традиционным садоводством. Плюс №2: Улучшение качества почвы Выращивание растений на высоких грядках предоставляет возможность контролировать качество и состав почвы. Смесь для высоких грядок состоит из питательных компонентов, таких как перегной, компост или специальные субстраты. Это способствует росту здоровых растений сильным и устойчивым к болезням. Плюс №3: Лучшая дренажная система На высоких грядках используется вегетационный слой, представляющий собой плотное соединение субстратов. Это обеспечивает улучшенную дренажную систему, что позволяет избежать застоев воды и переувлажнения почвы. Также лучшая вентиляция, предоставляемая высокими грядками, помогает предотвратить гниение корней растений. Плюс №4: Легкость ухода и поддержки растений Размеры и высота высоких грядок позволяют садоводу избежать наклона и перекопки больших площадей в огороде. Это облегчает уход за растениями, что может оказаться особенно важным для людей с ограниченными физическими возможностями. Высокие грядки также обеспечивают контролируемое распределение растений и позволяют легко управлять их ростом и развитием. Минус №1: Высокая стоимость устройства Установка высоких грядок может требовать некоторых дополнительных расходов. Приобретение необходимых материалов для создания и наполнения грядок (как субстратов, так и конструкций) может быть дорогим. Однако, долгосрочные выгоды и улучшение качества урожая, возможно, перевешивают этот минус. Минус №2: Возможность пересыхания почвы Высокие грядки могут подвергаться быстрому испарению влаги из-за их вышележащего положения. Это может создать трудности в поддержании необходимого уровня влажности и привести к пересыханию почвы. Регулярный полив и использование мульчи для сохранения влаги могут помочь в решении этой проблемы. Минус №3: Жара и обезвоживание Высокие грядки, из-за своего положения над землей, могут быстро нагреваться и становиться сухими при высоких температурах. Это может привести к обезвоживанию растений и негативным последствиям для их здоровья и урожая. Контроль температуры и частые поливы могут помочь защитить растения от этой проблемы. В заключение, высокие грядки предоставляют множество преимуществ для садоводов, в том числе удобство работы, контроль качества почвы, легкость ухода и поддержки растений. Однако, они также имеют свои недостатки в виде высокой стоимости устройства и возможности пересыхания почвы и обезвоживания растений.

To start the MED in Second Language Acquisition in Culture and Society program (MED-SLACS) in this September via on-campus form, I am applying for my study permit to Canada. Why study M.Ed.-Second Language Acquisition in Culture & Society program at this critical time: My grandmother was a teacher and following her occupational track, my mum became an excellent college teacher. Influenced by the two generations of teachers, I have set my career goal to be a college teacher of English, contributing to improve English teaching in the multi-Ethnic regions like my hometown Xinjiang. China’s western region, where our ethnic minorities gather, is vast and exceptionally rich in natural resources, but has long been economically backward. To develop western China, the State built railroads, highways and airports for us. Our hardware facilities have been upgraded accordingly, but the quality of our people still needs to be improved. I have personally experienced how the low level of English education has greatly restricted our minority students of western China from entering developed regions to receive higher education and give back to the west. Hence my career aim will help our Chinese minorities go out to see the world, help the world to know us minorities in China, and finally give back to the west. 从母亲和我的想法来讲，都希望我将来能到母亲曾经工作过、我也实习过的新疆师范大学工作，收入良好还有假期还能我们彼此互相照应，考虑到新疆师范大学对学历背景和海外经历的要求，我本科已经上了国内名牌大学，硕士再进行海外学习，归来以后为进高校做好一些背景准备和整体素质的提高是我能够在硕士阶段出国留学的初衷；Therefore, I choose the MED-Course based in Second Language Acquisition in Culture and Society of the University of Windsor to establish my qualifications as a teacher. Through my undergraduate studies of the courses Philosophy Problem, Modern Western Philosophy, Philosophy of Mind, I cultivated a philosophical thinking model that enables me to think profoundly and consider problems from a broader perspective. By learning the courses Counselling and Psychotherapy and Psychology and Its Application, I accessed the basic psychological principles and psychotherapy, which is necessary for my future study of the education program. However, to be a qualified teacher of English education, I should receive professional education and training on Second Language Acquisition, and further explore the education area at my graduate studies. Why Canada and the University of Windsor 出国留学我们考虑的国家分别是日本/英国/加拿大/美国，之所以考虑日本是因为我母亲在日本留学过，我小时候也去过日本，所以还是有一些好的印象的。但是我母亲坚决反对我去日本留学是因为她感受到了辛辛苦苦学习来的日语，回到国内以后根本用不上，所以就建议去英语类国家。英国硕士在国内很多就业部门被认为是“水硕”，所以我们就抛弃了这个想法。在美国和加拿大中做选择时，考虑到学费生活费因素以及加拿大对教育的重视在国际上都是有良好的口碑的，所以最终选择了加拿大； To study Education on English, Canada is ideal because English is its mother-tongue and compared to the bad social security of USA, Canada is better for study in. In the Universitas 21 ranking, Canada rates third overall for best higher education system. Relying on such a credible education system, University of Windsor offers a unique international student experience and annually attracts students from more than 40 countries around the globe. Consequently, UW's longstanding reputation in the field of education, elite professors, and the well-designed courses with unique focus on Second Language Acquisition in Culture and Society will equip me with a systematic background in contemporary education theory, especially with regards to realize my career aim of being a college teacher of English by granting me the most applicable expertise in Second Language Acquisition. I will be capable of helping more students of China’s western region to effectively exchange information in English, and helping them achieve education and career success and experience a different life with English. I am so glad that the UW has admitted me into the MED-SLACS program. Coming from China’s western region where the English education is quite poor, I only achieved Duolingo 100. But I have successfully had my English proficiency enhanced to MED-SLACS program’s entry level through completing its ELIP with 83%. It is time for me to study the MED-SLACS program via on-campus form this fall. I will examine philosophical orientations, conceptual frameworks, and research methodologies relevant to the study of theoretical and developmental aspects of language acquisition, bearing in mind cultural and societal influences. It will enable me to teach with a more robust sense of cultural and linguistic responsiveness. I will also command how to use international and interdisciplinary collaborations in teaching and research to improve the teaching result. I believe my graduate studies will be fruitful. Career plan after the MED-SLACS program at the University of Windsor By the time I finish the MED-SLACS program, I will return to China to achieve my career goal of being a college teacher of English, contributing to improve English language teaching in the multi-Ethnic regions like my hometown Xinjiang. I want help our Chinese minorities go out to see the world and help the world to know us minorities in China too. Led by the \\"One Belt, One Road\\" policy, China is stepping up its efforts to open up the western part of the country. I am sure to have a promising future and long-term career development in my hometown in China. On the other hand, as the only child of my parents, I know my parents desperately need my accompaniment. I will look after their well-being as a reward for their devotion to my development and coming back to China to support my family and society has been my ultimate goal. It makes sense for me to return my motherland and it is really the best decision for me. So please approve my study permit application and your favourable decision will be highly appreciated. 我是我父母唯一的孩子，也是他们的全部，父母希望我将来事业有成生活幸福，同时能够陪伴他们，相互照应。在生活方面来讲，我们的父母的正逐渐老去，除了我没有其它孩子，所以他们希望我将来距离他们越近越好。他们甚至在母亲工作过的新疆师范大学的温泉校区买了两套房子，一套是他们按教师优惠政策购买的，他们打算用来自己养老居住，另一套是从别的老师手中以商品房形式高价为我购买的婚房，他们是为了将来相互照应才这样购买的；此外，我父母在新疆师范大学老校区家属院也有一套面积较小的房子，这套房子面积小他们平时也不住，但是却一直在保留着，是因为这是非常抢手的学区房（师大附小和附中都是乌鲁木齐非常的重点中学），学校允许父母辈和爷爷奶奶辈的孩子孙子入学师大附小和附中，这套房子，也是为了将来能够让我的孩子（他们未来的孙子）上学方便而专门留着，否则他们早就可以高价出售了；前不久，我父母还在特意在风景秀美的水西沟镇南山购买了一套有院子的别墅，如果只是考虑他们老两口的居住需求的话，他们完全没有必要这样购买，因为随着年龄的逐渐增长，他们将没有精力也搭理这套别墅巨大的院子了，所以他们购买这套带院子的别墅也是为了将来我有了孩子们以后，在假期里能带着孩子们和他们一大家子们在别墅里让让他们尽享天伦之乐、愉快的度过假期而备的。 我母亲在日本完成了博士学位，在此期间，我的父亲、奶奶和我都去日本探访过当时留学的母亲，我母亲毕业以后完全可以留在日本工作，享受发达国家的收入和待遇。陪同她的我们当时也完全可以留在日本，但我们没有那样做，我们依然毅然决然的回国投入祖国的西部大开发。今后我也会如此，我留学学习的目的完全是为了真正提升自己的整体素质并且具备海外学习的经历来更加使自己具有在国内高校尤其是新疆师范大学工作的竞争优势的。 Best regards, Kamiran Dilidan","output":"Personal Statement Dear Visa Officer, I am writing to appeal the decision to refuse my Study Permit application for Canada. The reason provided for the refusal, namely that I do not have significant family ties outside Canada and the purpose of my visit is not consistent with a temporary stay, is unjustified. In this personal statement, I will provide evidence of my significant family ties in China and explain how the purpose of my visit to Canada is consistent with a temporary stay. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and I am a full-time student at the University of Windsor (UW). I recently completed the English Improvement Program (ELIP) via online learning from September 2022 to March, achieving a score of 83%. I have been admitted to the MED in Second Language Acquisition in Culture and Society program (MED-SLACS), which will begin in September. My purpose for applying for a study permit is to further my education in Canada. Regarding my family ties outside Canada, both my mother and grandmother have worked as teachers. Following their footsteps, I aspire to become a college teacher of English and contribute to improving English language education in the multi-ethnic regions of China, particularly in my hometown of Xinjiang. My career goal aligns with the Chinese government's efforts to develop the western region of the country and promote cultural exchange. Furthermore, my intention is to eventually work at Xinjiang Normal University, where my mother used to work and where I have also interned. My family desires that I have a prosperous career and a fulfilling life, and they hope that I will be able to support and care for them in their old age. By pursuing a master's degree in Canada, I aim to enhance my qualifications and gain international experience that will ultimately benefit my future career in China. My decision to study in Canada, particularly at the University of Windsor, is based on careful consideration. Initially, our options included Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. However, my mother strongly opposed me studying in Japan due to her personal experience of not being able to utilize her Japanese language skills upon returning to China. Therefore, she advised me to choose an English-speaking country. Although the UK is renowned for its education system, it is often regarded as having \\"easier\\" master's degrees in China, leading us to dismiss this option. When comparing the United States and Canada, we considered factors such as tuition fees and living expenses. Ultimately, Canada's reputation for prioritizing education internationally, along with its favorable living conditions, made it an ideal choice. Additionally, the University of Windsor's well-established reputation in the field of education, renowned professors, and specialized courses on Second Language Acquisition in Culture and Society made it the perfect fit for my career aspirations. I am confident that studying at the University of Windsor and in Canada will equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in improving English language education in China's multi-ethnic regions. Upon completing the MED-SLACS program, my plan is to return to China to pursue my career goal of becoming a college teacher of English. I wish to contribute to the development of English language education in Xinjiang and help Chinese minorities expand their horizons by experiencing different cultures and learning from different perspectives. Furthermore, as the only child of my parents, I have a strong sense of responsibility to support and care for them as they grow older. They have made significant investments in properties in Xinjiang, including a house in Xinjiang Normal University's faculty housing area and a villa in a scenic location. These properties have been acquired with the intention of providing a comfortable retirement for my parents and a place for me and my future children to spend time with them during holidays. Returning to China to be with my family and contribute to my society has always been my ultimate goal. In conclusion, I firmly believe that I have significant family ties in China, and the purpose of my visit to Canada is consistent with a temporary stay. Pursuing my master's degree at the University of Windsor will not only enhance my qualifications as a teacher but also contribute to the development of English language education in China's multi-ethnic regions. I kindly request that you reevaluate my application and reconsider your previous decision. Your favorable decision would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Хвойные растения являются прекрасным украшением любого сада или участка, их пышные кроны и зеленые иглы придают естественность и живописность ландшафту. В зимний период они особенно уязвимы, поэтому необходимо применить некоторые меры по уходу за ними. Первое, с чего следует начать, это подготовка изгороди к зиме. Необходимо провести осеннюю обрезку, чтобы укоротить и уплотнить крону, придавая растению более компактный вид. Обрезку следует проводить в конце осени или в начале зимы, при температуре выше -5 градусов Цельсия. Помните, что при сильных морозах раны могут долго заживать. Также следует подготовить почву для хвойных растений. Они предпочитают рыхлые, дышащие почвы, поэтому убедитесь, что она хорошо дренирована. Если вода задерживается в почве, это может привести к загниванию корней. Можно добавить некоторое количество песка или перлита для улучшения дренажа. Одним из важных моментов в уходе за изгородью из хвойных растений является защита от ветра и снега. В зимний период они подвержены пересушиванию и обморожению, поэтому необходимо создать преграду от ветра, используя широкую сетку или легкий материал, при этом не вплотную облепляя растения. Это поможет снизить потерю влаги и предотвратить загнивание хвои. Также рекомендуется заготовить снег вокруг изгороди. Он служит естественным укрытием и защищает растения от низких температур. Когда снег лежит вокруг кустов, он действует как естественный утеплитель, снижая вероятность обмораживания растений. Не стоит забывать и о поливе. В зимний период многие садоводы считают, что поливать растения не нужно, так как на улице морозы. Однако, это неверное представление. Хвойные растения нуждаются в достаточном количестве воды для поддержания своего здоровья и жизнеспособности. Вода будет усиливать сопротивляемость растений низким температурам и поможет им зимой выжить. Также стоит упомянуть об устранении повреждений. Если во время зимних морозов произошли разрывы ветвей или повреждения хвои, их необходимо срочно устранить. Для этого следует использовать секатор и аккуратно удалить поврежденные части. Это поможет предотвратить дальнейшее распространение вредителей и болезней. В заключение, уход за изгородью из хвойных растений в зимний период требует особого внимания и заботы. Бережное отношение к растениям, правильная подготовка к зиме, защита от ветра и снега, полив и устранение повреждений – все это поможет сохранить красоту и здоровье вашей изгороди на протяжении всего зимнего сезона. Не забывайте, что правильный уход гарантирует процветание ваших растений и радость от их великолепного вида."},{"instruction":"{ \\"Count\\":7, \\"title\\": \\"High Quality +100 Beautiful Designs for All Ages\\", \\"englishtitle\\": \\"Anime Coloring Book: High Quality +100 Beautiful Designs for All Ages\\", \\"english7ofdescriptionkeyword\\": [\\"AI\\", \\"ブレザー\\", \\"スカート\\", \\"留め袖\\", \\"バッグ\\", \\"スカーフ\\", \\"ブーツ\\"], \\"kdpofintroduction\\": \\"本書『航空会社の美女たち』は、シックなブレザーとスカートを着たアーバンな美女たちを収めた写真集です。留め袖やバッグ、スカーフやブーツを合わせたコーディネイトは、女らしいと同時に神秘的な印象を与えます。航空会社のエレガントなイメージに合ったプロフェッショナルな女性たちが、安全かつ快適なフライトを支えています。\\", \\"prompt\\": \\"white marble, bathroom, luxury kelly wearstler,, best quality, photorealistic, modern design, interior design, gold brass, led ceiling\\", \\"Negativeprompt\\": \\"EasyNegative, bad anatomy,\\" }, 上記を基に真似して「French interior decoration 」というテーマを加えてpromptとNegativepromptだけは英語で書いてkdpofintroductionでは英語分も書き、interior decoration booksとして下記のjsonの形で5つ作ってください。 {\\"item\\":[{ \\"Count\\":3, \\"title\\": \\"\\", \\"englishtitle\\": \\"\\", \\"english7ofdescriptionkeyword\\": [], \\"englishkdpofintroduction\\":\\"\\", \\"prompt\\": \\"\\", \\"Negativeprompt\\": \\"\\" },]}","output":"{ \\"item\\":[{ \\"Count\\":3, \\"title\\": \\"Elegant French Interior Decoration: Discover the Art of Timeless Design\\", \\"englishtitle\\": \\"Elegant French Interior Decoration: Discover the Art of Timeless Design\\", \\"english7ofdescriptionkeyword\\": [\\"French\\", \\"interior decoration\\", \\"luxury\\", \\"elegance\\", \\"timeless design\\", \\"antique furniture\\", \\"chandeliers\\"], \\"englishkdpofintroduction\\":\\"Immerse yourself in the world of elegant French interior decoration with this stunning book.

Одним из методов, позволяющих достигнуть этих целей, является чередование культур. Чередование культур представляет собой систематическое изменение видов растений на одном и том же участке земли с целью улучшения биологического состояния почвы и предотвращения развития вредителей и болезней. Одним из простых правил при чередовании культур является соблюдение ротации. Ротация – это последовательность выращивания различных культур на одном и том же участке земли в течение нескольких сезонов. Когда растения разных видов чередуются, они оказывают различное воздействие на почвенные микроорганизмы и вредителей, что способствует улучшению ее плодородия. Важно помнить, что при ротации следует учитывать совместимость культур, то есть их способность расти и развиваться вместе на одном и том же участке земли. Некоторые растения могут подавлять рост друг друга или, наоборот, способствовать его улучшению. Например, помидоры и картофель исчерпывают почву одними и теми же питательными веществами, поэтому их следует чередовать, чтобы восстанавливать плодородие почвы. Ротация культур также помогает предотвратить развитие вредителей и болезней. Некоторые вредители и болезни специфичны для определенных культур и могут переживать зиму в почве или на растениях. При чередовании культур, эти вредители не находят себе подходящую среду обитания и их численность снижается. Кроме того, некоторые растения, например, клевер или горчица, обладают свойствами сдерживать развитие определенных вредителей или улучшать рост других культур. Важным аспектом чередования культур является также выбор правильного места для каждой культуры. Некоторые растения предпочитают кислые почвы, другие – щелочные. Оптимальные условия для роста и развития каждого вида растений могут быть разными, и их следует учитывать при выборе места для посадки. Не следует забывать, что чередование культур влияет не только на урожайность, но и на экологическое состояние окружающей среды. Многолетняя ротация способствует сохранению влаги в почве и предотвращает эрозию. Кроме того, чередование культур позволяет сократить использование химических удобрений и пестицидов, так как разные виды растений используют разные нутриенты из почвы и снижают риск массового появления вредителей и болезней. Таким образом, чередование культур – это простое и эффективное средство для достижения урожайности и сохранения плодородия почвы. Правильно организованная ротация культур позволит сократить затраты на химические удобрения и пестициды, снизить риск повреждения вредителями и болезнями, а также сохранить экологическое равновесие в земледелии. Запомните эти простые правила чередования культур, и вы всегда будете иметь успешный урожай."},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Stainless Steel Patio Door Handles的定义","output":"Stainless Steel Patio Door Handles（不锈钢露台门把手）是一种用于露台门的把手，它由不锈钢材料制成。不锈钢是一种具有高度耐腐蚀性和耐久性的金属材料，常用于户外家具和门窗硬件制造。这种把手通常用于露台门上，以便用户可以轻松地打开或关闭门，并提供额外的手部支撑。它的设计通常简约且符合现代风格，能够与不同风格的露台门完美搭配，提供一个舒适和美观的使用体验。由于不锈钢的特殊性质，这些把手具有防锈、耐用和易于清洁的特点，使其在户外环境中表现出色，适用于长期使用。无论是在家庭住宅还是商业场所，Stainless Steel Patio Door Handles都是一种可靠和实用的选择。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Stainless Steel Patio Door Handles的特点与优势","output":"不锈钢庭院门把手具有以下特点与优势： 1. 高耐腐蚀性：不锈钢材质具有很强的耐腐蚀性，能够长时间抵御氧化、腐蚀和水槽。 2. 强度高：不锈钢门把手具有出色的强度和耐久性，不易变形或受损。 3. 美观大方：不锈钢庭院门把手外观干净、简约，能够与各种装饰风格相匹配，提升整体审美感。 4. 易于清洁：不锈钢材质相对容易清洁，只需用清水或洗涤剂进行简单擦拭即可。 5. 长寿命：由于不锈钢门把手的耐久性，通常可以经受很长时间的使用而不需要更换，节省了维修和更换成本。 6. 安全性：不锈钢门把手可以为庭院门提供出色的安全性，能够承受较大的力量和冲击。 7. 易于安装：不锈钢庭院门把手通常配备各种安装配件，易于安装。 总之，不锈钢庭院门把手以其高耐腐蚀性、强度高、美观大方等特点，在装饰和使用方面都具有明显优势。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Во-вторых, важно обеспечить малине достаточное количество питательных веществ и влаги. Регулярно поливайте растения, особенно во время засушливой погоды. Хорошая идея - использовать систему капельного орошения, чтобы обеспечить равномерное распределение влаги вокруг корневой зоны малины. Кроме того, не забывайте о подкормках. В августе можно применять органические и минеральные удобрения. Третий шаг, который следует предпринять в августе, - это устранение сорняков и мульчирование почвы вокруг кустов малины. Сорняки конкурируют с растением за питательные вещества, влагу и солнечный свет, поэтому важно своевременно удалять их. Затем накройте почву вокруг кустов слоем мульчи (например, травяной скошенной травой, опилками или соломой). Это поможет сохранить влагу, удержать тепло и предотвратить рост сорняков. Четвертый шаг - регулярно проверять малину на наличие вредителей и болезней. Контролируйте свои растения и принимайте меры, если заметите какие-либо признаки поражения. Удалите пораженные части растений и листья, чтобы предотвратить распространение инфекции. Если необходимо, обращайтесь к специалистам или используйте доступные в городских садовых центрах химические препараты. И последний, но не менее важный шаг - убирающие мероприятия. Когда малина закончила плодоношение, необходимо провести санитарную обрезку. Удалите все побеги, которые были плодоносными в текущем сезоне. Это поможет предотвратить размножение вредителей и болезней, а также сосредоточить энергию растения на формировании почек для будущего урожая. В заключение, чтобы собрать урожай крупной, сладкой ягоды малины ведрами на следующий год, необходимо предпринять несколько важных шагов. Это включает правильную обрезку и поддержку растений, обеспечение достаточного питания и влаги, борьбу с сорняками и вредителями, а также проведение убирающих мероприятий. Следуя этим рекомендациям, вы сможете наслаждаться пышным и вкусным урожаем малины каждый следующий год."},{"instruction":"你是写作文的高手。请帮我写一份 大学老师师德师风方面的个人小结。我是计算机方面的老师。1000字左右。谢谢。","output":"致 XXX学院领导： 尊敬的领导： 我怀着无比谦虚的心情，向领导汇报我作为一名计算机专业的大学老师在师德师风方面的个人小结。作为一名才刚踏入大学教育岗位不久的新教师，我深感自己虽有一技之长，但在师德师风方面还有许多需要改进与提高的地方。通过一段时间的观察和反思，我得出了以下几点小结： 首先，师德是一名大学老师最基本的道德要求。作为专业人士，我一直抱有严谨认真的态度，对待工作中每一个细节。无论是对待学生还是对待教学，都以真诚和尊重为原则。我努力将自己塑造成开明而宽容的人格形象，积极引导学生进入学术的殿堂。无论在课堂还是在与学生的交流中，我始终以真诚的微笑和耐心的倾听面对每一位学生，为他们提供良好的学习环境与建设性的指导。 其次，师风是大学教育的重要组成部分。作为一名计算机专业的教师，我时刻保持对新知识与新技术的关注，并通过不断的学习来提高自身的教学水平。我积极参与学校组织的各项教学培训和研讨活动，通过同行间的交流和学识碰撞，拓宽了自己的视野，提升了教学能力。在教学过程中，我注重将理论与实践相结合，通过设计有趣而实用的项目与案例，激发学生的学习兴趣和动力，并培养其实际能力。 另外，身为教师，我深知自身的责任和使命。我常常在课堂上践行“学以致用”的理念，启发学生对计算机科学的热爱与创新思维。我鼓励学生积极参与学术竞赛、实验室研究项目等，为他们提供展示才华的平台。此外，我时常与学生就人生规划和职业发展进行交流，关心他们的成长与进步。我坚信，帮助学生树立正确的人生价值观和职业理念，是作为一名大学老师应尽的义务。 最后，作为一名计算机专业的教师，我深知良好的师德师风对学生的影响远远超过课堂之外。我时刻以身作则，注重自身修养和道德品质的提升，力求成为学生的榜样。在校园里，我尽我所能地积极承担社会责任，参与各类公益活动和学术服务，积极推动校园文化建设。 总结来说，我通过自身努力不断提高自己的教学能力和师德师风素养。我会继续关注学生的需求和变化，不断反思和改进自己的教育方法，不断提升自我，并为学生的成长做出更大贡献。在今后的工作中，我将秉持“用心教学，潜心育人”的原则，不断为培养高素质的计算机人才而不懈努力。 谨此，向领导汇报。 敬礼！ XXX"},{"instruction":"你是写作文的高手。请帮我写一份 大学老师师德师风方面的个人小结。我是柴春来，主要教计算机网络方面的课程。1000字左右。谢谢。","output":"致柴春来老师： 尊敬的柴老师： 我怀着无比谦虚的心情，向您汇报我作为一名计算机网络课程的大学老师在师德师风方面的个人小结。作为一名才刚踏入大学教育岗位不久的新教师，我深感自己虽有一技之长，但在师德师风方面还有许多需要改进与提高的地方。通过一段时间的观察和反思，我得出了以下几点小结： 首先，作为一名教师，师德是最基本的道德要求。在课堂上，我以严谨认真的态度对待教学工作，始终抱有真诚和尊重之心。我始终坚持以学生为中心，积极关注每一位学生的成长和发展。我努力通过亲身示范，引导学生树立正确的学术道德观念，严禁任何形式的学术不端行为。在与学生的交流中，我以平等和尊重为原则，耐心倾听他们的疑惑和困惑，并与他们一起解决问题。同时，我鼓励学生积极参与课堂讨论和互动，激发他们的学习兴趣和探索精神。 其次，作为计算机网络课程的教师，师风是大学教育的重要组成部分。我时刻关注行业的最新动态和技术发展，持续学习和更新自己的知识。我认真备课，组织课程，并利用各种教学资源和技术手段提高教学效果。在教学过程中，我注重理论与实践的结合，通过设计实际案例和项目，让学生学以致用，提高他们的实践能力和问题解决能力。我积极参与学校组织的教学研讨活动和学科竞赛，与同行交流，共同提高教学水平。同时，我也鼓励学生自主学习和探索，培养他们的自主学习能力和创新思维。 另外，作为一名教师，我深知自身的责任和使命。我时常与学生进行沟通和交流，了解他们的困惑和需求，关心他们的成长和发展。我注重对学生进行个性化指导和支持，帮助他们从全面的角度认识和发展自己。我积极参与学术研究和教学探索，以增加自己的学术影响力和专业素养。同时，我尊重学生的多样性和个体差异，努力培养他们的创新能力和团队合作精神，使他们成为具有社会责任感和职业素养的计算机专业人才。 最后，作为一名计算机网络课程的教师，我深知良好的师德师风对学生的影响远远超过课堂之外。我始终以身作则，注重自身修养和道德品质的提升，努力成为学生的榜样。我尝试将道德教育融入到日常教育与管理中，鼓励学生积极参与公益活动和社会实践，培养他们的社会责任感和公民意识。 总结来说，我通过反思和实践，不断提高自己在师德师风方面的素养和能力。我会时刻关注学生的需求和变化，积极反思和改进教育方法，不断提升自己，并为学生的成长和发展做出更大贡献。在今后的工作中，我将坚持努力，保持对教育事业的热爱和力量，用心教学，潜心育人，为培养高素质的计算机网络专业人才而不懈努力。 谨此，对您致以最诚挚的感谢和敬意。 敬礼！ XXX"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

你可以为文物元素添加一个事件监听，当用户点击删除键时阻止默认行为，并执行你想要的操作。例如，你可以通过添加以下代码来实现这个功能： \`\`\`html <span class=\\"topicid not-clickable\\" id=\\"16116\\" onclick=\\"clickTopic(16116)\\" onkeydown=\\"handleDelete(event)\\"

<\/script> \`\`\` 在上面的代码中，我们为文物元素添加了一个onkeydown事件监听，并调用handleDelete函数来处理删除键事件。在handleDelete函数中，我们首先检查用户按下的键是否是删除键（\\"Delete\\"或\\"Backspace\\"），如果是，就调用event.preventDefault()来阻止默认行为（删除文本），然后你可以执行你想要的操作。 注意：

这段代码使用addEventListener方法为文物元素添加了keydown事件监听。在事件处理函数中，我们检查按下的键是否是删除键（keyCode为46），如果是，就调用event.preventDefault()来阻止默认行为（删除文本），然后使用this.remove()来删除整个文物元素。 这样，当用户点击删除键时，整个文物元素将被删除。请注意，这将删除整个元素，而不仅仅是文本内容。"},{"instruction":"上述代码addEventListener无效","output":"非常抱歉，之前的代码确实有问题。感谢你的指正。以下是一个修正后的代码： \`\`\`html <span class=\\"topicid not-clickable\\"

在这个修正后的代码中，我们将事件处理函数直接绑定到onkeydown属性上，而不使用addEventListener方法。事件处理函数handleDelete将检查按下的键是否是删除键（keyCode为46），如果是，则调用event.preventDefault()阻止默认行为，并使用parentNode和removeChild方法从文档中删除整个文物元素。 这样，当用户点击删除键时，整个文物元素将被删除。请注意，在这种实现中，文物元素本身需要设置一个唯一的id（在此例中为\\"16116\\"），以便在事件处理函数中使用document.getElementById去获取和操作该元素。"},{"instruction":"var sel = document.getSelection(); console.log(sel); if

These proteins are involved in various metabolic processes, such as digestion, energy production, and DNA replication. The primary function of enzymes is to lower the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to occur, allowing reactions to take place at a faster rate (Reference 2). Enzymes possess important features that enable them to perform their function efficiently. For example, enzymes are highly specific, meaning they can recognize and bind to specific substrates to catalyze a particular reaction (Reference 3). One well-known enzyme is catalase, which is responsible for the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen (Reference 4). Overall, enzymes are critical for maintaining the homeostasis and biochemical processes in living organisms. 2nd paragraph: Conditions that affect enzymes Enzyme activity is influenced by various conditions, which can impact their function and efficiency. Factors such as pH, temperature, substrate concentration, and the presence of inhibitors or activators can affect enzyme activity (Reference 5). Temperature, for instance, can have a significant impact on enzyme activity. At low temperatures, enzyme activity is usually low, as there is not enough kinetic energy for the reaction to proceed at an efficient rate. As temperature increases, so does the enzyme activity, as the kinetic energy of molecules also increases. However, extreme temperatures can denature enzymes, causing them to lose their structural integrity and function (Reference 6). 3rd paragraph: Introduction of the experiment The modified experiment aims to investigate the effect of temperature on the activity of catalase. The hypothesis is that as temperature increases, the activity of catalase will also increase, up to an optimal temperature. However, beyond this temperature, the activity of catalase will decrease as the enzyme becomes denatured. The independent variable in this experiment is the temperature, which will be controlled and manipulated to different levels. The dependent variable is the activity of catalase, which will be measured by the rate at which hydrogen peroxide is broken down. The controlled variables include the concentration of catalase, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, and the duration of the reaction. In summary, enzymes are essential for carrying out crucial biological reactions. They possess specific features that allow them to function efficiently. However, enzyme activity can be influenced by various conditions, including temperature. The experiment aims to investigate how temperature affects the activity of catalase."},{"instruction":"refernce list pls","output":"Reference 1: Nelson, D. L., Cox M. M.

They play a crucial role in various metabolic processes, including digestion, energy production, and DNA replication (Berg et al., 2015). Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to occur, enabling reactions to proceed at a faster rate (Nelson and Cox, 2017). This ability is due to their specific binding of substrates, allowing them to catalyze specific reactions (Campbell and Farrell, 2019). A well-known enzyme, catalase, is responsible for breaking down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen (Herga et al., 2019). Enzymes are essential for maintaining homeostasis and carrying out biochemical processes in living organisms. 2nd paragraph: Conditions that affect enzymes Enzyme activity is influenced by various conditions, including pH, temperature, substrate concentration, and the presence of inhibitors or activators (Voet and Voet, 2011). One of the critical factors that affect enzymes is temperature. At low temperatures, enzyme activity is generally low due to reduced molecular motion and insufficient kinetic energy for reactions to occur efficiently (Voet and Voet, 2011). As the temperature increases, so does the enzyme activity, as molecules gain more kinetic energy (Voet and Voet, 2011). However, extreme temperatures can denature enzymes, causing them to lose their structural integrity and, thus, their function (Alberts et al., 2014). 3rd paragraph: Introduction of the experiment The modified experiment aims to investigate the effect of temperature on catalase activity. The hypothesis is that increasing the temperature will increase catalase activity up to an optimal temperature, based on the premise that higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy necessary for enzyme-substrate interactions (Nelson and Cox, 2017). Beyond this optimal temperature, the enzyme's structure will start to denature, leading to a decrease in catalase activity (Alberts et al., 2014). The independent variable in this experiment is the temperature, which will be controlled and manipulated. The dependent variable is the activity of catalase, which can be measured by the rate at which hydrogen peroxide is broken down (Herga et al., 2019). The experiment will also control the concentration of catalase, concentration of hydrogen peroxide, and the duration of the reaction as controlled variables. In conclusion, enzymes are vital for carrying out essential biological reactions. They possess specific features allowing them to function efficiently. However, various conditions, such as temperature, can influence enzyme activity. The experiment focused on investigating how temperature affects catalase activity, with the hypothesis that increasing temperature would initially increase the enzyme's activity up to an optimal point before denaturation occurs."},{"instruction":"can you write the links to the websites","output":"I apologize for the confusion.

All Quiet on the Western Front, set during World War I, explores the harrowing experiences of German soldiers on the front lines and vividly portrays the physical and psychological toll of war (Remarque, 1929). On the other hand, Freedom Writers delves into the inner-city struggles faced by a diverse group of students during the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, harnessing the power of education to combat societal violence (LaGravenese, 2007). Through vivid language and descriptive imagery, Remarque illustrates the dehumanizing effects of war on soldiers, describing the trenches as \\"a pestilential marsh\\" that slowly erodes their humanity (Remarque, 1929, p. 22). Likewise, in Freedom Writers, the director skillfully employs filmmaking techniques, such as close-ups and intense sound design, to convey the traumatic impact of gang violence on the lives of students living in a war zone-like environment (LaGravenese, 2007). Both works provide powerful narratives that serve as poignant reminders of the devastating consequences that warfare and violence can have on individuals and communities."},{"instruction":"refernces?","output":"I apologize for the confusion.

All Quiet on the Western Front explores the concept of allegiance to one's country and the disillusionment that arises when soldiers witness the brutal realities of war (Remarque, 1929). Through the character of Paul Baumer, Remarque depicts the internal conflict between duty and personal morals, highlighting the challenges faced when loyalty to one's comrades clashes with loyalty to the nation (Remarque, 1929). In Freedom Writers, the concept of allegiance is depicted through the students' loyalty to their respective gangs or ethnic groups, which fuels conflicts and perpetuates violence (LaGravenese, 2007). However, through the transformative power of education and the guidance of their teacher, the students shift their allegiance towards a greater sense of unity and empathy (LaGravenese, 2007). Both works highlight the complexities and consequences of allegiance, whether it be to one's country, community, or personal identity, and explore the impact it has on individuals and their actions."},{"instruction":"and coming of age concept","output":"In the context of the coming of age concept, both the novel All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque and the film Freedom Writers directed by Richard LaGravenese offer insightful explorations of personal growth and maturation amid challenging circumstances. All Quiet on the Western Front follows the transformative journey of Paul Baumer, a young German soldier, as he navigates the horrors of war and confronts the harsh realities of adulthood (Remarque, 1929). Through his experiences, Remarque portrays the loss of innocence, the questioning of societal values, and the profound emotional and psychological impact of war on young individuals (Remarque, 1929). Similarly, in Freedom Writers, a group of diverse high school students undergo a process of coming of age as they navigate personal struggles, cultural conflicts, and the transformative power of education (LaGravenese, 2007). The film portrays their growth, self-discovery, and the triumph over adversity, as they find their voices and assert their identities (LaGravenese, 2007). Through these narratives, both works encapsulate the universal themes of growth, resilience, and self-discovery that are inherent in the coming of age concept, showing how individuals can navigate challenging circumstances and emerge stronger and more self-aware."},{"instruction":"When will the saucony tempus 2 running shoe be available?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have real-time access to product release dates.

However, Hibernate provides some level of thread safety through its session management and transaction handling mechanisms. It ensures that multiple threads can safely access the SQLite database by allowing only one thread to interact with the database at a time.\\" Now: I meant does using Hibernate make the app that uses SQLite thread-safe?","output":"Using Hibernate does not inherently make the application thread-safe when using SQLite as the underlying database. While Hibernate provides some level of thread safety through its session management and transaction handling mechanisms, it does not guarantee complete thread safety by default. SQLite itself is not designed to handle concurrent writes from multiple threads, so the responsibility for managing thread safety falls on the application developer. To ensure thread safety, the developer needs to properly synchronize access to the SQLite database or implement mechanisms such as connection pooling and thread-local sessions. In summary, while Hibernate can help with managing threads and transactions, it does not automatically make the application thread-safe when using SQLite. Developers need to take additional steps to ensure concurrency control and thread safety in their application."},{"instruction":"What is meant by \\"It ensures that multiple threads can safely access the SQLite database by allowing only one thread to interact with the database at a time.\\"?","output":"When it is mentioned that Hibernate ensures only one thread can interact with the SQLite database at a time, it refers to the way Hibernate manages database access through its session management and transaction handling mechanisms. Hibernate uses a concept called \\"session\\" to manage interactions with the database. Each session represents a single-threaded context for database operations. When multiple threads in an application attempt to access the database simultaneously, Hibernate enforces the rule that only one thread can have an active session and interact with the database at any given time. This means that Hibernate ensures exclusive access to the database by allowing only one thread to perform database operations through its active session. Other threads that attempt to access the database concurrently are typically queued or blocked until the active session completes its work or releases the database resources. By allowing only one thread to interact with the database at a time, Hibernate helps prevent data corruption and maintain consistency. However, it's important to note that this mechanism alone might not guarantee complete thread safety because it doesn't address potential race conditions or synchronization issues that can occur in complex multi-threaded scenarios. Additional measures may need to be taken by the application developer to ensure complete thread safety."},{"instruction":"Are you saying that only one Session object can access the database at a time?","output":"Apologies for any confusion. When it comes to Hibernate and database access, it is more accurate to say that multiple sessions can access the database simultaneously, but only one session can modify the database at a time. In a multi-threaded application using Hibernate, each thread typically has its own session object to interact with the database. Multiple session objects can coexist and perform read operations on the database simultaneously. This allows concurrent read access from multiple threads without any issues. However, when it comes to write operations (modifying the database), Hibernate ensures that only one session is actively modifying the database at a given time. This is to maintain data integrity and prevent conflicts that may arise from concurrent writes. Hibernate achieves this through its transaction management mechanism, which ensures that only one session commits changes to the database at a time. So, multiple session objects can read the database concurrently, but only one session can modify it at any given time to prevent conflicts and maintain consistency."},{"instruction":"How does this apply for when the database used is SQLite?","output":"The behavior I described regarding Hibernate and session management applies to any database, including SQLite. However, there is an important consideration specific to SQLite when it comes to concurrent writes from multiple threads. By default, SQLite is not designed to handle concurrent writes from multiple threads, regardless of whether you are using Hibernate or any other framework. SQLite operates in a serialized manner, meaning that it allows only one write operation at a time. When multiple threads attempt to write to the database simultaneously, SQLite will serialize those write operations, and the writes will be executed one after another in a predictable order. In the context of Hibernate with SQLite, while Hibernate's session management and transaction handling mechanisms still apply, SQLite itself handles concurrent writes in a serialized manner to maintain data integrity. This means that even if multiple threads have their own Hibernate sessions, only one thread will be able to perform a write operation on the SQLite database at a time due to SQLite's internal concurrency control. Therefore, while Hibernate can manage multiple sessions and transactions, the underlying SQLite database will handle concurrent writes in a serialized manner, ensuring that only one write operation occurs at a time. It is worth noting that this behavior can potentially introduce contention and impact performance in multi-threaded scenarios with frequent write operations. To mitigate this, developers can implement additional mechanisms such as connection pooling or thread-local sessions to manage concurrent access more efficiently."},{"instruction":"I don't see the problem. If SQlite serializes writes and Hibernate prevents multiple Session objects from writing, how could there be a problem with the data's integrity?","output":"Apologies for any confusion caused. You are correct that with SQLite's serialization of writes and Hibernate's control over write access through session management, there is less risk of data integrity issues in terms of concurrent write operations. When using Hibernate with SQLite, the combination of SQLite's internal serialization and Hibernate's management of sessions helps ensure that only one thread can actively modify the database at a given time. This reduces the potential for conflicts and data integrity problems that can arise from concurrent writes. By allowing only one write operation at a time in a serialized manner, SQLite's internal mechanisms maintain the integrity of the database regardless of the number of concurrent threads. Hibernate's session management and transaction handling mechanisms further help coordinate and control write access, ensuring that only one session is modifying the database at any given time. So, the likelihood of data integrity issues is significantly reduced in this case. However, it's important to note that other potential issues related to concurrency, such as race conditions or synchronization problems, may still exist in multi-threaded scenarios. These issues are not directly related to data integrity but could impact the overall functionality and performance of the application. Proper synchronization and concurrency control measures should still be considered when designing multi-threaded applications, even when using Hibernate and SQLite."},{"instruction":"1) Okay, so, the application and not the SQLite database is what would could still potentially have a problem then, right? 2) What if every method uses the synchronize keyword in Java. Then, would all multi-threaded issues be resolved?","output":"1) Correct. When using Hibernate with SQLite, the underlying SQLite database handles concurrent writes in a serialized manner, ensuring data integrity. However, potential issues related to concurrency, such as race conditions or synchronization problems, are more likely to exist within the application itself rather than in the SQLite database. Issues with data consistency or race conditions can potentially arise if the application's design or code implementation does not properly handle multi-threaded scenarios. These issues could affect the state of application variables or the order of operations performed by different threads. It is the responsibility of the application developer to design and implement appropriate synchronization and concurrency control mechanisms to avoid such problems. 2) The \`synchronized\` keyword in Java is a useful tool for achieving thread safety in certain scenarios. When a method or block is synchronized, it ensures that only one thread can execute that method or block at a time, providing a level of thread safety by avoiding concurrent execution of the synchronized code. However, using \`synchronized\` keyword alone does not guarantee complete resolution of multi-threaded issues. While it helps with synchronization and can prevent certain race conditions, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the complexity of the application and the specific multi-threading requirements, additional synchronization mechanisms or strategies may still be necessary. It is important to carefully analyze the application's requirements and properly apply synchronization techniques where necessary. This may involve using other synchronization mechanisms in addition to \`synchronized\`, such as locks, condition variables, atomic operations, or higher-level concurrency constructs provided by frameworks or libraries. Thorough testing and consideration of thread safety principles are also crucial to ensure the resolution of multi-threaded issues within the application."},{"instruction":"If only one Session object is used, then all these issues are avoided, right?","output":"If the application strictly uses only one Hibernate \`Session\` object for interacting with the SQLite database, it inherently simplifies the thread safety concerns to some extent. This is because having only one \`Session\` object effectively limits the database access to a single-threaded context. With a single \`Session\` object, you eliminate potential synchronization issues and race conditions that can arise when multiple threads try to modify the database concurrently. The single \`Session\` object ensures that write operations are executed serially and prevents conflicts or data corruption caused by concurrent writes. However, it's important to clarify that using a single \`Session\` object might not completely eliminate all thread safety concerns in a larger application. Issues related to read consistency, shared state, and other multi-threading considerations may still exist depending on the overall architecture, design, and concurrency requirements of the application. Additionally, using only one \`Session\` object may not be suitable in scenarios where multiple threads need to perform independent database operations simultaneously. In such cases, careful synchronization or the adoption of other strategies like connection pooling and thread-local sessions might still be necessary to ensure proper thread safety and concurrent access. While using a single \`Session\` object simplifies some aspects of thread safety, it is crucial to carefully analyze the specific requirements and design of the application to determine the most appropriate approach for achieving thread safety in a multi-threaded environment."},{"instruction":"If the application is single-thread and only uses one Session object, then all of these problems would be avoided, right?","output":"If the application is single-threaded and only uses one Hibernate \`Session\` object to interact with the SQLite database, it significantly reduces the concerns related to concurrency and thread safety. In a single-threaded application, there are no issues with concurrent writes from multiple threads, as there is only one executing thread. With a single \`Session\` object, you eliminate the need for synchronization mechanisms to handle concurrent access to the database. The single-threaded execution ensures that the database modifications are sequential and consistent. In such cases, the likelihood of running into race conditions, data corruption, or other concurrency-related problems is greatly minimized. As long as the application operates within a single thread, the use of a single \`Session\` object promotes simplicity and reduces the complexities typically associated with multi-threaded environments. However, it's essential to consider that even in a single-threaded application, other aspects like transaction handling, exception management, and query optimization may still require attention while using Hibernate with SQLite. Nonetheless, the primary concerns regarding concurrent writes and multi-threaded synchronization are effectively avoided in a single-threaded environment with a single \`Session\` object."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is considered to be one of the most effective ways to combine the strengths and skills of two fighters, and it plays a significant role in several major story arcs. The process of potara fusion begins with the acquisition of a pair of Potara earrings, which are incredibly powerful artifacts that were originally worn by the Supreme Kais. These earrings are said to be infused with divine energy, making them capable of creating a permanent fusion between two individuals. To begin the fusion process, both individuals must be wearing one Potara earring on opposite ears. The earrings are designed to react to one another when worn by two separate beings, causing an intense gravitational pull that draws the wearers towards each other. Once the individuals are within close proximity, they must perform a synchronized pose, typically raising their arms to align their earrings. This gesture is crucial for activating the fusion process. Upon completion of the pose, a bright light envelops the two individuals, signifying the initiation of fusion. As the fusion commences, the individuals' bodies are gradually merged together, resulting in a completely new being with a combination of their physical characteristics, powers, and abilities. The fusion process is depicted as a stunning display of energy and light, swirling around the merging individuals and gradually shaping them into a new entity. The resulting fused being possesses a combination of the strengths and weaknesses of both individuals, along with an immense power boost. The fusion also grants the individual access to incredibly powerful techniques and skills that were previously beyond their reach. Furthermore, the fusion is permanent, meaning that the resulting being cannot be undone unless a wish is made to the eternal dragon, Shenron. It is important to note that while the potara fusion is generally permanent, it can be undone under certain circumstances. For instance, if one of the fused individuals is dead, the fusion will be temporary and last only for one hour. Additionally, if the fused being is forcefully separated, their original forms will be restored. Potara fusion has been famously used by characters such as Goku and Vegeta, who fuse together to become Vegito, as well as by other characters like Kibito Kai and Old Kai. Each fusion creates a unique and immensely powerful being, capable of rivaling some of the strongest adversaries in the Dragon Ball universe. In conclusion, the potara fusion process is a remarkable technique that allows two individuals to merge into a more powerful being. With the help of the Potara earrings, they synchronize their poses to initiate the fusion, resulting in a new entity with combined attributes, increased power, and access to new abilities. It is a permanent fusion, unleashing a formidable individual capable of facing even the most powerful opponents."},{"instruction":"rewrite this","output":"There is a need to rephrase the given sentence, but it is missing.

Ethan was tired of being bullied by his coworker, Greg, who constantly belittled him and made derogatory comments about women. Ethan was fed up with Greg's sexist behavior and was determined to teach him a lesson. One day, while exploring an old antique shop, Ethan stumbled upon a dusty remote control. The shop owner told him it had a touch of magic, capable of granting unusual wishes. Eager to seek revenge, Ethan decided to give it a try. That evening, Ethan invited Greg over to his apartment under the pretense of settling their differences. Little did Greg know, he would become the victim of Ethan's secret plan. As Greg entered the apartment, anxiety filled his eyes, sensing something was amiss. Ethan chuckled to himself and pressed a button on the remote. Instantly, Greg's short, dark hair transformed into long, light pink locks that cascaded down his shoulders. Astonished, Greg touched his newfound hair, demanding to know what was happening and why he found himself donning a frilly maid outfit. The outfit was a vibrant mix of pale pink and white, accentuated by ruffles and bows. It hugged Greg's figure, highlighting his now slightly curvier physique. The bully felt both baffled and embarrassed as he pleaded with Ethan for answers, his voice trembling with fear. With a mischievous smile, Ethan pressed another button. Greg's face twisted in confusion as his ears sprouted two fluffy cat-like extensions. Utterly bewildered, he shouted at Ethan, asking why everything suddenly seemed so loud and why his ears felt so strange. Before Greg could get an answer, the remote worked its magic again. Greg's voice and tone shifted dramatically, becoming friendly and feminine, with a slight, flirtatious purr. He found himself speaking in a more sophisticated and catgirl-like manner, stringing together words and phrases that were foreign to him moments ago. As the changes continued, Greg's resistance began to crumble, and he started enjoying his transformation. He eagerly questioned Ethan, curious about his newfound desire to serve and clean for him. Greg expressed his surprise at the intense surge of emotions he felt toward Ethan and how mesmerized he was by Ethan's appearance. With another press of the button, a large, fluffy pink tail sprouted from Greg's behind. Overjoyed, Greg hugged his tail, purring with contentment, while expressing his gratitude to Ethan for this adorable addition. He couldn't help but compliment how delightful the maid outfit looked on him and how adorable his long, pink locks were. Feeling mischievous, Ethan pressed yet another button on the remote. Greg's body became petite, with well-defined curves and undeniable femininity. Greg's movements grew more graceful, his body language adapting naturally to his new form. He couldn't deny the tingling sense of rightness and familiarity in the way he held himself. As Greg marveled at his transformed body, he watched in awe as his chest grew to astonishing proportions. His breasts swelled and became lusciously large, leaving Greg stunned. He instinctively cupped his newfound assets, exclaiming how soft and wonderful they felt. Blushing deeply, he confessed to Ethan that he had always wondered what it would be like to have such ample breasts, marveling at their size and comfort. Thanking Ethan profusely, Greg's gratitude overflowed, as did his newfound affection for him. The once-macho bully found himself utterly captivated by Ethan's presence. He showered Ethan with compliments, calling him master and a total hottie, while happily acknowledging how free and confident he felt with his new appearance. Ethan, satisfied with the transformation, decided to add a touch of femininity by changing Greg's fingernails to a bright shade of pink. Greg showered Ethan with appreciation for this change, gushing about how cute and adorable pink had always been his favorite color. As Greg basked in the effect of the last transformation, Ethan sneaked one final press of the unmarked button on the remote. A faint popping sound emanated from between Greg's legs, instantly relieving him of any discomfort he may have experienced before. Grateful for this surprising adjustment, Greg expressed his relief and delight, explaining how free and airy it now felt \\"down there.\\" His hands instinctively landed on his hips, accentuating his femininity, as he couldn't resist calling Ethan cute and a total hottie. Greg's seemingly never-ending transformation concluded with Ethan altering his memories. As his name changed to a female version, Greg gasped, feeling a fog settle over his mind, causing his memories to blur and fade. Confused, he looked at Ethan with a mix of adoration and confusion, calling him babe and confessing that he was starting to forget everything. Yet, his heart swelled with pure joy, embracing these new memories that felt so right. He ccouldn't help but praise Ethan for being so kind and loving. Ethan, wanting to ensure the transformation stuck, pressed one final button, making Greg's personality shift into that of a loving and submissive maid. Greg's face lit up with joy as he observed his changed self, giggling with delight. He assured Ethan how cute and nice he was and how happy and free he felt. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Greg confessed his deep affection, promising to be Ethan's devoted maid. The story concludes with Greg, now completely transformed, unaware of his previous identity as a bully. Greg gazes upon Ethan, captivated by his kindness and beauty, expressing endless gratitude and adoration. In that moment, a sense of love blossoms between them, culminating in a tender kiss, sealing their newfound connection. And so, in the realm of magic and revenge, the tables turned, and two souls found unexpected happiness in the most extraordinary circumstances."},{"instruction":"我在和静县和静镇巩哈尔村调研时看见一个清真寺，但这个清真寺和传统的清真寺不一样。他们在墙上用国语、维吾尔语、古兰经解释了社会主义核心价值观，在主讲台用对联的形式宣传爱党爱国和中华优秀传统美德。帮我用学术性的一段话修饰上面的文字","output":"在对静县和静镇巩哈尔村进行调研时，我注意到一个独特的清真寺，与传统的清真寺呈现出不同的风貌。该清真寺在墙上以国语、维吾尔语和古兰经的形式阐述了社会主义核心价值观，同时运用对联的形式，在主讲台上宣传爱党爱国和中华优秀传统美德。这种寺庙具有独特的文化内涵和教育性质，通过多语种与多信仰共存的方式，有力地弘扬了社会主义核心价值观与中国优秀传统文化的结合。"},{"instruction":"使用学术性术语修饰“在和静县和静镇巩哈尔村有一个独特的清真寺，与传统的清真寺呈现出不同的风貌。该清真寺在墙上以国语、维吾尔语和古兰经的形式阐述了社会主义核心价值观，同时运用对联的形式，在主讲台上宣传爱党爱国和中华优秀传统美德。这种寺庙具有独特的文化内涵和教育性质，通过多语种与多信仰共存的方式，有力地弘扬了社会主义核心价值观与中国优秀传统文化的结合。”","output":"在和静县和静镇巩哈尔村的调研中，我观察到了一座与传统清真寺不同的独特建筑。该清真寺以国语、维吾尔语和古兰经为媒介，以墙体形式诠释了社会主义核心价值观。此外，主讲台上以对联的形式宣传了爱党爱国和中华优秀传统美德。这一寺庙呈现出独特的文化内涵和教育性质，通过多语种与多信仰共存的方式，成功地促进了社会主义核心价值观与中国优秀传统文化的融合。"},{"instruction":"La evolución es un hecho cambia este titulo a uno mas original","output":"\\"Transformación perpetua: Un viaje a través de la evolución\\""},{"instruction":"LUCA EL PRIMER SER VIVO. cambia este titulo a uno mas original","output":"\\"El enigma primordial: El origen de la vida en LUCA\\""},{"instruction":"Teorías de los Orígenes de la vida. cambia este titulo a uno mas original","output":"\\"Desentrañando los misterios de la vida: Explorando las teorías del origen primigenio\\""},{"instruction":". cambia este titulo a uno mas original","output":"\\"Entre las brumas del nacimiento: Persiguiendo los enigmas del origen de la vida\\""},{"instruction":"Teorías del Origen de la Vida. cambia este titulo a uno mas original","output":"\\"La danza cósmica de la vida: Descifrando los misterios de nuestros orígenes\\""},{"instruction":"Teorías del Origen de la Vida. cambia este titulo a uno mas original para un ensayo.","output":"\\"El telar de la vida: Un viaje a través de las teorías del origen primordial\\""},{"instruction":"Teorías del Origen de la Vida. cambia este titulo a uno mas original para un ensayo.","output":"\\"En los umbrales de la existencia: Un análisis profundo de las teorías del origen de la vida\\""},{"instruction":"Привет, ты знаешь о технике \\"скользкие горки\\" для написания текстов?
