This block combines favorable reservoir characteristics, traps, and location relative to the depositional environment. 2. Block 7 (Depth: 2 to 4.5 km) - excellent to intermediate reservoir quality, oil to gas generation, potential structural traps associated with deepwater fan sandstones, silts, and salt. Though oil generation might transition to gas generation at deeper depths, this block still holds promise for oil exploration in shallower areas. 3. Block 1 (Depth: 1 to 4 km) - excellent to intermediate reservoir quality, oil generation, and potential structural traps. Despite the immature source rock and lack of HC in the nearby well, this block may benefit from hydrocarbon migration from deeper parts of the basin. 4. Block 4 (Depth: 2 to 3.5 km) - intermediate reservoir quality, oil generation, and potential structural traps. While reservoir quality is lower than Blocks 6 or 7, and the block is farther from the fan structures, it could still hold potential for oil exploration. 5. Block 2 (Depth: 0.5 to 1 km) - excellent reservoir quality, oil generation, and potential structural traps. However, the immature source rock and lack of HC in the nearby well limit its potential for oil exploration. This block ranks lower due to these factors. 6. Block 3 (Depth: 1 to 2.5 km) - excellent reservoir quality, oil generation, but no potential structural traps. Even though reservoir quality is excellent and located within the oil generation depth according to Figure 6, the absence of structural traps makes it less favorable for oil exploration. This ranking prioritizes blocks with excellent to intermediate reservoir quality, oil generation potential, and favorable structural traps. Blocks that have immature source rocks, lack hydrocarbons in nearby wells, or are otherwise less suitable for oil exploration are ranked lower. Please note that this ranking is based on the available data and may not take into account all factors that could impact the hydrocarbon potential of the blocks. Additional data, analysis, and interpretation may be required for a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of the blocks' potential."},{"instruction":"traduza 見るも無残なくらい溶けかけていた衣服に染み込んだそれがトドメとなり、布地は下着まで残さず、綺麗さっぱり消え失せてしまった。","output":"A roupa, que estava derretendo de maneira trágica, ficou manchada e essa mancha acabou sendo o golpe final, fazendo com que todo o tecido, até mesmo a roupa íntima, desaparecesse completamente e de forma impecável."},{"instruction":"ChatGPT, let’s run through a test scenario.

They are both used to measure the apparent resistivity (ρa) of the subsurface material. Here, we will explain their differences along with the formulas and numbers associated with these methods. 1. Wenner Array: In the Wenner configuration, four equally spaced electrodes are placed collinearly on the ground surface. The electrodes are labeled A, B, M, and N, where A and B are the current electrodes and M and N are the potential electrodes. The array has a symmetrical arrangement, with equal spacings between all the electrodes (A-M, M-N, and N-B), typically denoted by 'a'. The apparent resistivity ρa in Wenner array can be calculated using the formula: ρa = 2πa∆V/I Here, ∆V represents the voltage drop measured across M and N, and I is the current injected into the ground through electrodes A and B. The Wenner array provides good resolution of the underlying subsurface but is less sensitive to deep structures. Its primary advantage, however, is the simplicity of its set-up and measurement. 2. Schlumberger Array: The Schlumberger configuration also uses four electrodes but with an asymmetrical arrangement. Like the Wenner array, it labels the electrodes as A, B, M, and N. However, the spacing between the current electrodes A-B may be much larger than the potential electrodes M-N. The spacing distance between the potential electrodes is denoted by 's,' while the distance between the midpoint of the potential electrodes and the current electrodes is denoted by 'l.' The Schlumberger array's apparent resistivity can be calculated using the formula: ρa = π(l² - (s/2)²) (∆V/I)/s Here, ∆V denotes the voltage drop across the M and N electrodes, and I is the injected current through the A and B electrodes. Schlumberger provides better depth penetration, having a greater sensitivity for detecting deep structures. However, due to the large electrode spacings, this configuration might have lower resolution for shallow structures. Comparison: 1. Array Geometry: Wenner array has equally spaced electrodes, while Schlumberger has a more flexible arrangement with different spacing between the current and potential electrodes. 2. Resolution: Wenner array generally has better resolution for shallow structures, whereas the Schlumberger array is more sensitive to deep structures. 3. Penetration Depth: Schlumberger array can penetrate deeper due to its broader array size, while Wenner is usually limited to shallower structures. 4. Field Procedure: Wenner array has a simpler and fixed electrode set-up, which is easier to implement but less versatile. Schlumberger array offers more flexibility in its use, but it requires changing the electrode spacings. In conclusion, the selection between Wenner and Schlumberger configurations depends on the objectives of the survey and the target depth. Wenner is suitable for shallow investigations with its straightforward and symmetrical set-up. Schlumberger is more diversified with its asymmetrical configuration and provides better depth penetration for deeper structures."},{"instruction":"explain in detail, according to the formula and electric field and electric field shape, what would happen if we measure with potential spacing too small or too large in sclumberger in proportion to the current electrode spacing. compare that to wenner","output":"When performing a resistivity survey using the Schlumberger array, choosing the appropriate potential and current electrode spacings is crucial to obtain reliable measurements. Following a detailed explanation, we will present consequences resulting from too small or too large potential spacings relative to the current electrode spacings in Schlumberger, as well as how these concerns contrast with Wenner measurements. Recall the formula for the Schlumberger array apparent resistivity: ρa = π(l² - (s/2)²) (∆V/I)/s Where 'l' is the distance from the midpoint of the potential electrodes (M-N) to the current electrodes (A-B), and 's' is the separation between the potential electrodes (M-N). 1. Potential Spacing Too Small: If the potential spacing 's' becomes too small relative to the current electrode spacing 'l,' the term (s/2)² in the formula will nearly vanish, and the apparent resistivity can be approximated by: ρa ≈ πl² (∆V/I)/s When 's' is too small, the electric field's strength between electrodes M and N may be difficult to measure accurately due to instrument limitations, external noise, and contact resistance between the electrodes and the ground. In the worst-case scenario, it can lead to erroneous potential measurements, resulting in unreliable apparent resistivity values. Moreover, when potential spacing is much smaller than the current electrode spacing, the electric field created by the Schlumberger array is concentrated mostly in a narrow zone near the ground surface. This leads to a lack of depth penetration and insufficient data on deeper subsurface structures. In the Wenner array, these issues are less likely to occur. Since the electrode spacing is equal for all electrodes (A-M, M-N, and N-B), the electric field is more evenly distributed, providing a more balanced sensitivity to both shallow and deeper subsurface structures. 2. Potential Spacing Too Large: If the potential spacing 's' becomes too large relative to the current electrode spacing 'l,' the term (s/2)² in the formula will significantly impact apparent resistivity calculation. Also, the electric field lines between A-B and M-N would spread over a wider region, and the measurement becomes more sensitive to deeper formations. However, when potential spacing is excessively large, the resulting electric field might become weak, causing potential differences to be less distinguishable from background noise, which can lead to poor-quality data or even measurement errors. Furthermore, in this scenario, the Schlumberger array's sensitivity to shallow structures decreases, which might lead to a masking effect where shallow features could be overlooked. Compared to the Schlumberger array, Wenner array has equal electrode spacing, which reduces the risk of encountering issues related to excessively large potential spacings and maintains a good overall balance between sensitivity to shallow and deeper subsurface structures. In conclusion, for Schlumberger arrays, choosing appropriate electrode spacings is an essential aspect of survey design to obtain reliable and accurate results. The same applies to Wenner arrays, though the fixed, equal-spaced nature of the Wenner configuration automatically addresses concerns related to large or small spacings mentioned here."},{"instruction":"in (ρ_a=π (〖(AB/2)〗^2-〖(MN/2)〗^2)/MN .∆V/I ) what would happen if the MN is too small and too large","output":"This expression for calculating apparent resistivity (ρa) for the Schlumberger array appears to be slightly different from the previously provided formula. The given formula is: ρa = π((AB/2)² - (MN/2)²) (∆V/I) / MN Where AB is the separation between current electrodes (A-B), MN is the separation between potential electrodes (M-N), ∆V is the measured potential difference between M and N, and I is the current injected through the A-B electrodes. Now, we'll analyze the effects of MN being too small or too large: 1. MN is too small: When the potential electrode spacing MN becomes too small compared to the current electrode spacing AB, the electric field between potential electrodes M and N may be difficult to measure accurately due to the following reasons: - Instrument limitations: Some resistivity instruments may have difficulty in detecting very small voltage differences (∆V) between the potential electrodes. - External noise: Small voltage differences are more susceptible to environmental and electromagnetic interferences, leading to noise in the measurements. - Contact resistance: The resistance between the electrodes and the ground may affect the ∆V measurements, particularly when MN is very small. As a result, the measured apparent resistivity (ρa) values may be unreliable and lead to a less accurate interpretation of the subsurface resistivity structure. In this situation, the depth of investigation will be limited to shallow regions, and deeper structures may not be adequately resolved. 2. MN is too large: When the potential electrode spacing MN becomes too large compared to the current electrode spacing AB, the electric field lines between the current electrodes A-B and potential electrodes M-N may spread over a wider region, increasing the investigation's depth. However, this scenario can also lead to some potential issues: - Weak electric field: As the potential electrode separation MN increases, the strength of the electric field between M and N can decrease significantly, making it difficult to measure. - Background noise: With a weak electric field, the potential difference (∆V) will be smaller and more susceptible to noise from various sources, potentially resulting in poor-quality data. - Reduced sensitivity to shallow structures: With a larger MN, the Schlumberger array becomes less sensitive to shallow subsurface structures. Consequently, some near-surface features might be missed or not adequately resolved. To avoid the above issues, it is crucial to select an appropriate balance between the current and potential electrode spacings when designing a Schlumberger resistivity survey, considering the target depth and desired resolution of the subsurface structures."},{"instruction":"analyze this data and tell me why and how the current varies, it goes up then down again following AB spacing values MN/2 AB/2 K V (mv) I (ma) R (ohm) RHO (ohm-m) 0.5 1.5 6.3 428 30 14.26666667 89.88 0.5 2.5 18.8 382 67 5.701492537 107.1880597 0.5 4 49.5 294 124 2.370967742 117.3629032 0.5 6 112.3 172 131 1.312977099 147.4473282 0.5 8 200.3 103 112 0.919642857 184.2044643 0.5 10 313.3 47.7 73 0.653424658 204.7179452 0.5 12 451.8 35 74 0.472972973 213.6891892 0.5 15 706.1 17 51 0.333333333 235.3666667 5 15 62.8 205 52 3.942307692 247.5769231 5 20 117.8 123 64 1.921875 226.396875 5 25 188.5 57 53 1.075471698 202.7264151","output":"From the given data, we can observe that the current (I) values vary with increasing AB/2 spacing. In general, the current increases initially with the increase in AB/2 spacing and later decreases after a certain point. Here's an analysis of the current values in relation to AB/2 spacing: 1. Current Increase: When the current electrode spacing (AB) starts small, the injected current encounters higher resistance concentrated in the shallow subsurface layers due to the proximity of the current electrodes. Consequently, the currents passing through the subsurface are relatively small. As the AB spacing increases, the injected current penetrates deeper into the subsurface and the resistance offered by the surface layers reduces. Thus, more current can pass through the subsurface, which is why the current values increase as the AB spacing becomes larger. 2. Current Decrease: When the AB spacing becomes significantly larger, the current electrode spacing eventually becomes less effective in inducing the current into the subsurface due to the increased distance. The effect of the increased distance leads to decreased current levels. Besides, as the AB spacing increases even further, the induced electric field within the subsurface becomes weaker. Consequently, the potential electrode separation (MN) might be too large relative to the size of the electric field induced by the current electrodes. This scenario can also result in a decrease in the current values. To summarize, the variation in current values with changing AB spacing can be attributed to several factors, including the resistance offered by the shallow subsurface layers, the effectiveness of current injection with an increased distance between the current electrodes, and the influence of the induced electric field on the potential electrodes. The optimal electrode configuration and spacing would depend on the desired survey objectives and subsurface resistivity structure."},{"instruction":"do the analysis and relate i value with K","output":"To analyze how the I (current) values relate to K (geometric factor) in the presented data, let's first understand what the geometric factor represents in a resistivity survey using the Schlumberger array. The geometric factor K is defined as: K = π ((AB/2)^2 - (MN/2)^2) / MN It can also be rearranged as: K x MN = π ((AB/2)^2 - (MN/2)^2) The geometric factor accounts for the electrode geometry (spacing between electrodes), and it is used to convert the measured resistance R into apparent resistivity ρa. ρa = K x R Now, let's examine the relationship between the current (I) and the geometric factor (K) for the given data. There is no direct relationship between the current (I) and K in the resistivity formula. However, they may appear to be indirectly related to each other through the actual subsurface resistivity structure. Current flows based on the subsurface resistivity and the electrode configuration. As the electrode configuration changes, the geometric factor (K) also changes. The current is affected by the change in resistance encountered by the electrodes in different configurations and the resistivity of the subsurface layers. From the given data and the way the survey was conducted, we cannot establish a unique and direct relationship between the current (I) values and the geometric factor (K) since they are influenced by the actual subsurface resistivity. However, it is evident that the current values change as the electrode spacing changes, which is also reflected in the changing geometric factor. In practice, while designing and conducting resistivity surveys, it is vital to optimize the electrode spacings and the survey configuration to acquire accurate and reliable data for specific survey objectives and subsurface conditions."},{"instruction":"explain in detail steps from this: (∂^2 V)/(∂r^2 )+2/r ∂/Vr=0 to get this: V=1/r Iρ/2π","output":"To derive the expression V = Iρ/2πr from the given differential equation (∂²V)/(∂r²) + 2/r ∂V/∂r = 0, we need to follow the following steps: 1. Rewrite the given differential equation: The given differential equation can be written as: d²V/dr² + 2/r dV/dr = 0 This is a homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). 2. Rewrite the equation using substitution: We introduce a substitution to transform the second-order ODE into a first-order ODE. Let u = dV/dr. Then, d²V/dr² = du/dr. Substituting into the original equation, we obtain: du/dr + 2/r u = 0 This is a first-order linear ODE. 3. Solve the first-order linear equation: The first-order ODE can be rewritten as: (du/dr) = -2/r u Now, the equation is separable. Separating the variables, we get: du/u = -2(dr/r) Integrating both sides of the equation, we have: ∫ (1/u) du = -2 ∫ (1/r) dr ln|u| = -2 ln|r| + C₁ where C₁ is the constant of integration. 4. Solve for u: Without loss of generality, we can write the constant of integration as C₁ = ln(C), where C is another constant. Therefore, ln|u| = ln(C) - 2 ln|r| Raising both sides as powers of 'e', we get: u = e^ln(C)/e^2ln|r| u = Cr^(-2) Recall that u = dV/dr, so we have: dV/dr = Cr^(-2) 5. Integrate to find V: Integrating both sides with respect to 'r', we obtain: ∫ dV = C ∫ r^(-2) dr V = -C/r + C₂ where C₂ is another constant of integration. 6. Choose the boundary condition: In this derivation, we're not given any specific boundary conditions. However, the potential V should remain finite at r = 0. Therefore, we choose the boundary condition V(0) = 0 (the potential at the origin should be finite). Using this condition, C₂ = 0. Hence, the solution for V is: V = -C/r 7. Connect V to I and ρ: Now let's relate V to the injected current (I) and resistivity (ρ) of the material. We know that current is related to Voltage (V) and resistance (R = ρ/2πrL) through Ohm's law, where L is the length of the conductor: V = IR Since V varies with r, we must use a small section of the conductor with length dr. The resistance of this small section is dR = ρ/2πr * dr. Replacing R with dR and V with dV, we get: dV = I dR dV = I (ρ/2πr) dr Now, substitute dV = -C dr/r from the derived equation and compare the coefficients: -C dr/r = I (ρ/2πr) dr C = -Iρ/2π Thus, substituting C back into the solution for V, we obtain: V = Iρ/2πr This is the derived expression for the potential V in terms of the injected current (I) and resistivity (ρ) of the material."},{"instruction":"explain homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation. first-order ODE. and ∂ in simple terms please. make me understand what it is and the concept of it.","output":"An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation that contains one unknown function (typically denoted as y(x)) and its derivatives. The equation describes the relationship between the function and its derivatives concerning an independent variable, usually denoted as x. ODEs are used to model and study various phenomena in physics, engineering, biology, and many other fields that involve change over time or space. 1. Homogeneous Second-Order Linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE): A second-order ODE involves the second derivative of a function. It is called linear if the equation is linear in both the unknown function and its derivatives, meaning that there are no higher powers (squares, cubes, etc.), products, or complicated functions (e.g., sine, exponential) of the unknown function or its derivatives in the equation. A second-order linear ODE is written in the general form: a(x) y''(x) + b(x) y'(x) + c(x) y(x) = F(x), where a(x), b(x), and c(x) are known coefficient functions, y(x) is the unknown function we wish to find, y'(x) is the first derivative of y(x) with respect to x, and y''(x) is the second derivative of y(x) with respect to x. The second-order ODE is called homogeneous if the right-hand side function, F(x), is zero for all x: a(x) y''(x) + b(x) y'(x) + c(x) y(x) = 0. The term \\"homogeneous\\" implies that the equation represents a kind of \\"balance\\" or \\"stable state\\" in the underlying process being described by the equation. 2. First-order ODE: A first-order ODE involves only the first derivative of the unknown function y(x). It is an equation that establishes a relation between the unknown function, its first derivative, and the independent variable x. The general form of a first-order linear ODE is: p(x) y'(x) + q(x) y(x) = r(x), where p(x), q(x), and r(x) are known coefficient functions, and y'(x) is the first derivative of the unknown function y(x) with respect to x. 3. The Partial Derivative (∂): In calculus, the derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable. When we deal with functions of multiple variables, we use partial derivatives to understand how the function changes with respect to one variable while holding all the other variables constant. The symbol used for partial derivatives is ∂ (a rounded 'd') as opposed to the conventional 'd' used for ordinary derivatives. For example, consider a function of two variables, u(x, y). The partial derivative of u with respect to x (denoted as ∂u/∂x) measures the rate of change of the function u in the x direction while keeping y constant. Similarly, the partial derivative of u with respect to y (denoted as ∂u/∂y) measures the rate of change in the y direction while keeping x constant. In summary, ODEs describe relationships between functions and their derivatives, capturing the behavior of dynamic systems. The order of an ODE determines the highest-order derivative involved in the equation. A linear ODE involves only the unknown function and its derivatives, and a homogeneous ODE has a zero on the right-hand side. Lastly, partial derivatives are used when dealing with functions involving multiple variables, considering the rate of change in one variable while holding others constant."},{"instruction":"Cisco Packet Tracer команды что бы произвести настройку обеспечения избыточности с помощью VRRP на сетевом оборудовании","output":"1.

However, in general, predators could be affected by the presence or absence of Mesostoma ehrenbergii depending on their ecological role. For example, if Mesostoma ehrenbergii are prey for predators, their absence could affect the population dynamics of the predators. On the other hand, if Mesostoma ehrenbergii are predators themselves, their presence could affect the populations of their prey. Additionally, the activities of Mesostoma ehrenbergii, such as filtering and grazing, could affect the abundance and diversity of other organisms in their ecosystem, which could indirectly impact predators."},{"instruction":"use examples","output":"Sure, here are some examples: 1. Mesostoma ehrenbergii is a flatworm that feeds on small invertebrates such as planarians and rotifers. If a predator, such as a fish or bird, relies on these same small invertebrates for food, the availability of their prey could be reduced if the Mesostoma ehrenbergii population grows. Alternatively, if the Mesostoma ehrenbergii population declines due to predation or other factors, this could lead to lower prey availability for the predator. 2. Mesostoma ehrenbergii also acts as a predator itself, feeding on other small invertebrates in freshwater ecosystems. If the population of Mesostoma ehrenbergii increases, it could lead to a decrease in the populations of certain prey organisms, which could then impact higher level predators that rely on those prey for food. 3. Mesostoma ehrenbergii filters water, removing particles and microorganisms as it feeds. This could have an indirect impact on predators in the ecosystem, as the filtering could affect nutrient availability and water quality, which could then impact the abundance and diversity of other organisms in the ecosystem. For example, if the Mesostoma ehrenbergii population decline, there could be an increase in phytoplankton blooms which could lead to a decrease in aquatic insects, which could then impact fish populations that rely on insects for their food."},{"instruction":"What to do if my gf prefers a magic wand over me?","output":"As an AI language model, I am not qualified to offer relationship advice.

Rimuovere vecchi smalti: Prima di iniziare a preparare le unghie per l'estate, è importante rimuovere vecchi smalti o gel. Puoi utilizzare un solvente a base di acetone o un prodotto senza acetone, se preferisci un'alternativa più delicata. 2. Limare le unghie: Dopo aver rimosso il vecchio smalto, limare le unghie a forma di quadrato o rotondo, a seconda della preferenza personale. Non utilizzare mai la lima in modo aggressivo per evitare danni alle unghie naturali. 3. Ammorbidire la pelle intorno alle unghie: Immergere le unghie in acqua calda per alcuni minuti, poi utilizzare la pietra pomice o un bastoncino di legno per rimuovere eventuali residui di pelle intorno alle unghie. 4. Scegliere il giusto smalto: Scegliere uno smalto di buona qualità e di lunga durata per resistere alle attività estive. Optare per colori luminosi, pastello o neutri per mostrare al meglio le mani. 5. Prevenire la scheggiatura: Applicare uno strato di base prima di applicare il colore atteso, per evitare la possibile scheggiatura dello smalto. 6. Utilizzare la protezione solare: Proteggere le unghie dalle radiazioni UV dannose, applicando una crema solare sulle mani e sulle unghie stesse. 7.

Puoi scegliere tra oli naturali come olio di cocco, olio di mandorle o olio di argan. 2. Usa una crema idratante per le mani: La pelle delle mani e delle unghie è spesso esposta ai danni della luce solare e a temperature estreme in estate, quindi è importante mantenere la giusta idratazione. Applica una crema idratante dopo ogni lavaggio delle mani per ridurre la secchezza. 3. Bevi molta acqua: Il mantenimento dell'idratazione interno è importante per la salute delle unghie. Bere molta acqua durante il giorno aiuta a mantenere una pelle sana e morbida. 4. Mangia alimenti ricchi di vitamina E: La vitamina E è importante per la salute delle unghie e per mantenerle idratate. Cibi ricchi di vitamina E includono noci, avocado, spinaci e olio di oliva. 5. Utilizza guanti di protezione: Quando si eseguono attività come la pulizia della casa o il giardinaggio, le sostanze chimiche possono danneggiare le unghie.

Could we expand to about 1500 tokens?","output":"Absolutely, here's a longer version: In today's world of conversational AI, the key to creating effective interactions and experiences lies in asking the right questions. This is where prompt engineering comes into play. Prompt engineering is essentially the process of crafting prompts or questions for chatbots and other AI systems that are both relevant and engaging. This requires developers to have a deep understanding of the user's needs, preferences, and context. At its core, prompt engineering is an art and a science, a balance between form and function. It requires developers to not only focus on the technical side of things but also grasp the importance of user-centered design. In other words, it's not just about building a chatbot that \\"works\\" - it's about creating one that provides a seamless and satisfactory user experience. Part of prompt engineering involves utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Chatbots can interpret and process user messages and then respond appropriately. However, even with the most advanced NLP algorithms, chatbots still need to be told what to ask and how to ask it. That's where prompt engineering comes in—providing the chatbot with the necessary prompts to carry out a conversation that is both empathetic and efficient. To create effective prompts, developers need to know their users inside and out. This includes understanding their needs, their motivations, and the context of the interaction. User research is critical in this regard and can involve surveys, interviews, focus groups, and other methods for gathering feedback and data. Once the developer has a clear understanding of the user's needs, they can craft prompts that are relevant, concise, and engaging. The prompt should not only elicit the information needed for the chatbot to provide accurate and useful responses, but it should also do so in a way that feels intuitive and natural for the user. One challenge of prompt engineering is ensuring that prompts prompt conversation rather than stymie it. The specificity of the prompt can have a huge impact on the effectiveness of the conversation. Prompts that are too open-ended or vague can lead to confusion, while overly-specific prompts can feel rigid and unnatural. Striking the right balance involves careful consideration and iteration. Another aspect of prompt engineering involves incorporating contextual cues. These can include factors such as the user's location, weather, time of day, or any other information that can provide context for the interaction. Incorporating these cues can help the chatbot deliver more targeted and relevant information. Finally, prompt engineering isn't a one-and-done process—it requires ongoing testing and iteration. Developers need to monitor the chatbot's performance and refine the prompts as necessary. This involves a dedication to ongoing assessment and improvement. Overall, prompt engineering is a critical component of building effective chatbots and conversational AI systems. Good prompt engineering requires developers to be part engineer and part psychologist, part linguist and part designer. It's a complex and multifaceted process that, when done correctly, can result in chatbots that are not only helpful but also pleasant to interact with."},{"instruction":"ChatGPT, let’s run through a test scenario.

Erbaut wurde sie 1856 durch die Albertsbahn AG als \\"Hänichener Kohlezweigbahn\\" für die Abfuhr der in Hänichen und am Windberg bei Freital geförderten Steinkohle. Nach einem Umbau zu einer öffentlichen Linie und der Verlängerung nach Possendorf war sie eine bedeutende Ausflugsbahn. Allgemein bekannt ist die Strecke als \\"Windbergbahn\\". Historisch ist die Strecke auch als \\"Sächsische Semmeringbahn\\" und \\"Possendorfer Heddel\\" bekannt geworden. ', 'Der obere Abschnitt wurde bereits 1951 stillgelegt, die Reststrecke diente bis 1989 vor allem den strategisch wichtigen Uranerztransporten der SDAG Wismut. Der verbliebene Güterverkehr endete 1993. Seit 2008 befinden sich die noch vorhandenen Bahnanlagen bis Dresden-Gittersee im Besitz des \\"Sächsischen Museumseisenbahn Vereins Windbergbahn e. V.\\", der sie als Museumsbahn nutzt.', 'Die noch vorhandenen Gebäude und Anlagen der gesamten Strecke stehen seit 1980 wegen ihrer eisenbahngeschichtlichen Bedeutung als Kulturdenkmal unter Denkmalschutz.', 'Geschichte.', 'Vorgeschichte.', 'Erste Nachweise für die Förderung von Steinkohle im Döhlener Becken stammen schon von 1452. Aber erst mit der beginnenden Industrialisierung Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts nahm der Abbau größere Ausmaße an. In dieser Zeit entstanden die ersten Tiefbauschächte. Dem Transport der Kohle nach Dresden diente in dieser Zeit die \\"Kohlenstraße\\", die von den Fördergebieten bei Hänichen und am Windberg über Coschütz direkt zu den Abnehmern in Dresden führte.', 'Im Jahr 1849 entstand mit dem Hänichener Steinkohlenbauverein eine Aktiengesellschaft, zu der die Gruben Beckerschacht, Beharrlichkeitsschacht und Berglustschacht bei Hänichen gehörten. Der Hänichener Steinkohlenbauverein forderte 1852 den Bau einer Eisenbahnverbindung zu den Schächten auf privater Basis, um die unzureichenden Transportverhältnisse zu verbessern. Die Strecke sollte in Niedersedlitz an der Sächsisch-Böhmischen Staatseisenbahn beginnen und durch das Lockwitztal nach Hänichen führen. Die nötige Konzession wurde allerdings verweigert, da der sächsische Staat zu dieser Zeit vor allem an gewinnbringenden Hauptbahnen interessiert war.', 'Ähnliche Forderungen nach einer Eisenbahnverbindung kamen jedoch zur gleichen Zeit auch von den Bergbauunternehmern und Fabrikanten des Plauenschen Grundes. Hier stimmte der sächsische Staat den Plänen zum Bau einer Bahnstrecke zu, die von Dresden aus bis Tharandt führen und später ein Teil einer Fernverbindung Richtung Freiberg und Chemnitz werden sollte. Am 4. Mai 1853 gründete sich die Albertsbahngesellschaft, am 28. Juni 1855 wurde ihre Strecke von Dresden nach Tharandt eröffnet. Die Konzession zum Bau der Strecke Dresden–Tharandt bezog auch den etwaigen Bau einer Zweigbahn nach Hänichen mit ein.', 'Am 31. Mai 1855 schloss die Albertsbahn AG mit dem Hänichener Steinkohlenbauverein einen Vertrag, der die Einrichtung einer Zweigbahn zu deren Schächten bei Hänichen vorsah.', 'Bau und Eröffnung.', 'Der Bau der Hänichener Kohlenzweigbahn erwies sich letztlich als außerordentlich problematisch. Wegen der enormen Höhenunterschiede war zunächst der Bau einer Seilzugbahn konzipiert worden, die an eine mit Pferden betriebene Strecke im Poisental anschließen sollte. Eine solche Lösung hätte allerdings eine viel zu niedrige Beförderungskapazität gehabt, so dass sie – auch aus Kostengründen – verworfen wurde.', 'Der für die Planung und Bauleitung zuständige Eisenbahningenieur Guido Brescius entwarf schließlich eine als reine Adhäsionsbahn konzipierte Trassenführung, die in künstlicher Längenentwicklung in Kehren am Birkigter Hang aufwärts führte. Durch eine geschickte Wahl der Streckenführung gelang es, ohne teure Kunstbauten wie Brücken und Einschnitte auszukommen. Die meisten Zechen konnten zudem durch sehr kurze Anschlussbahnen an die neue Strecke angeschlossen werden. Allerdings war zunächst noch ein Betrieb mit Pferden vorgesehen.', 'Nach Bekanntwerden des Bahnprojektes schlossen die interessierten Steinkohlenwerke Anschlussverträge mit der Albertsbahn AG über die zu transportierenden Tonnagen ab. Die avisierten Transportmengen nahmen jedoch einen solchen Umfang an, dass an einen Betrieb mit Pferden nicht mehr zu denken war. Guido Brescius plante die Strecke nunmehr als normale Lokomotiveisenbahn. Gegen erhebliche Widerstände von Kritikern des eigenen Berufsstandes und den Aktionären der Albertsbahn setzte er letztlich seinen Plan durch.', 'Im Lauf des Jahres 1855 begannen schließlich die Bauarbeiten, die rasch voranschritten. Am 4. April 1856 wurde die Abzweigweiche zur Albertsbahn in Niedergittersee eingebaut. Am 21. Oktober 1856 war die Strecke mit der Prüfung durch ein Sachverständigengremium fertiggestellt. Im Februar und März 1857 lieferte die Firma Hartmann in Chemnitz die drei bestellten Lokomotiven aus.', 'Der erste Leergüterzug fuhr am 1. April 1857 vom Dresdner Kohlenhafen nach Hänichen, um am Nachmittag, beladen mit Kohle des Hänichener Steinkohlenbauvereins, wieder talwärts zu rollen. Damit hatte die erste Gebirgsbahn Deutschlands ihren Betrieb aufgenommen.', 'Am 15. April 1857 unternahm der sächsische König Johann eine Inspektionsfahrt auf der Hänichener Kohlenzweigbahn. Im Anschluss an die Fahrt äußerte er in einer Rede vor den Aktionären der Albertsbahn AG den Satz: Seitdem ist der Name \\"Sächsische Semmeringbahn\\" für die Strecke in Gebrauch.', 'Im Betrieb der Albertsbahn AG.', 'Die neue Bahn erfüllte von Beginn an die Erwartungen. Der Betrieb auf den engen Radien erwies sich als vollkommen sicher. Problematisch war in den ersten Betriebsjahren die zu geringe Ausstattung mit Betriebsmitteln. Bis zur Verstaatlichung hatte die Albertsbahn AG für die Hänichener Kohlezweigbahn nur 290 Fünf-Tonnen-Hunte beschafft, was nie ausreichte. Das Problem verschärfte sich noch dadurch, dass der Hänichener Steinkohleverein als Hauptaktionär der Albertsbahn AG bei der Gestellung von Leerwagen bevorzugt wurde.', 'Ab dem 10. März 1857 bot die Albertsbahn an Sonntagen auch Ausflugsfahrten für die Öffentlichkeit an. Die unbequemen Kohlehunte erhielten dafür eine Ausstattung mit Bänken. In jener Zeit wurde der geradezu legendäre Ruf der Windbergbahn als Ausflugsbahn begründet.', 'Nach der Verstaatlichung.', 'Die Konzession für die Albertsbahn war zunächst auf 20 Jahre bis 1873 ausgestellt gewesen. Nach dem Deutschen Krieg 1866 strebte der sächsische Staat eine Verstaatlichung seiner Eisenbahnen an. Mit der schon länger geplanten Strecke zwischen Freiberg und Tharandt sollte zudem die notwendige Verbindung zwischen den bislang getrennten Netzen der Östlichen und Westlichen Staatsbahn entstehen. Die Albertsbahn AG setzte diesen Plänen keinen Widerstand entgegen, waren doch die erhofften reichen Gewinne für die Aktionäre ausgeblieben. So ging die Albertsbahn AG am 1. Juli 1868 für 2.862.800 Taler in das Eigentum des sächsischen Staates über. Zum Zeitpunkt der Verstaatlichung standen auf der Hänichener Kohlezweigbahn fünf Lokomotiven und 290 Fünf-Tonnen-Hunte mit einem Nettoladegewicht von 1450 Tonnen im Einsatz.', 'Im Jahr 1869 wurde der Lückenschluss zwischen Tharandt und Freiberg in Regie der Königlich Sächsischen Staatseisenbahnen vollendet. Damit erschlossen sich neue Absatzgebiete für die am Windberg geförderte Steinkohle. Da ein Übergang der Fünf-Tonnen-Kohlehunte der Albertsbahn auf Staatsbahngleise nicht zugelassen war, errichtete man 1870 in Niedergittersee eine Umladeanlage. Für den Einsatz auf der Umladeanlage ließ die Staatsbahn 1873 nochmals 80 Kohlehunte in verbesserter Konstruktion herstellen, die unterflur entladen werden konnten.', 'In den nächsten Jahrzehnten sank die beförderte Tonnage erheblich. Bemerkenswert ist der Rückgang von 171.000 t im Jahr 1872 auf nur noch 137.000 t sechs Jahre später. Grund dafür war die zunehmende Erschöpfung der bauwürdigen Vorräte im Windberggebiet. Der einst bedeutende Windbergschacht wurde 1877 aufgegeben, kurz darauf der benachbarte Neuhoffnungsschacht. Die Hänichener Kohlezweigbahn erfuhr 1879 eine Abstufung zur \\"Secundärbahn\\".', 'In den Jahren 1893/94 erfolgte ein Streckenausbau für größere Achslasten. Von nun an war neben dem Einsatz stärkerer Lokomotiven die Beförderung normaler Zehn-Tonnen-Güterwagen zugelassen. Trotzdem blieb ein Teil der nicht mehr zeitgemäßen Fünf-Tonnen-Hunte bis nach 1900 im Einsatz.', 'Die Verlängerung nach Possendorf.', 'Um 1900 waren die Kohlevorkommen bei Hänichen erschöpft. Der Berglustschacht schloss 1905, die beiden anderen Schächte kurz darauf. Am 18. Mai 1906 wurde der Hänichener Steinkohlenbauverein aus dem Gewerberegister gestrichen. Nach der Entlassung der Belegschaften entstand in den Orten der Umgebung ein sozialer Notstand. In dieser Situation regte man erneut die Fortführung der Bahn bis Possendorf und den Ausbau zu einer dem öffentlichen Verkehr dienenden Linie an. Am 16. Dezember 1905 wurde der Ständekammer ein Dekret zum Ausbau der Kohlebahn vorgelegt. Noch vor Jahresende genehmigte der Landtag das Vorhaben. Das königliche Finanzamt bewilligte Anfang 1906 die erforderlichen Mittel von 490.000 Mark, und der Bau konnte beginnen.', 'Am 12. September 1907 begannen bei laufendem Betrieb die Umbauarbeiten. Neben der Verlängerung der Trasse bis Possendorf wurde der Oberbau der gesamten Strecke erneuert. Allerdings gelang es nicht, die vorhandenen engen Radien deutlich zu erweitern, da dies eine umfassende Neutrassierung erfordert hätte. So blieb etwa der 85-Meter-Radius des Gleises im Geiersgraben erhalten. Nach nur 100 Tagen Bauzeit war die umgebaute Strecke bis Hänichen-Goldene Höhe fertiggestellt. Mit einem Festzug wurde die Strecke am 21. Dezember 1907 für den öffentlichen Verkehr eröffnet.', 'Der Bau der Verlängerungsstrecke bis Possendorf dauerte indes noch weit: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Bahnstrecke, Sachsen, Bergbau, Denkmalgeschützt, Güterverkehr, Kohlenbahn, Kulturdenkmal, Museumsbahn, Verlängerung, öffentlicher Verkehr"},{"instruction":"کد یک صفحه دارای عکس کاور آهنگ در وسط صفجه با دکمه های زذن آهنگ قبلی و پخش آهنگ و زدن آهنگ قبلی در زیر عکس و در پایین صفحه لیستی از آهنگ های موجود با استایل زیبا با کد رنگ های #7787A6 و #D9886A","output":"<div style=\\"background-color: #7787A6;

Es erschien über das britische Independent-Label Cherry Red Records und war im Heimatland der Band zunächst nur als Import erhältlich.', 'Das Album gilt als Meilenstein der US-amerikanischen Punkgeschichte und als eines der frühen stilprägenden Hardcore-Punk-Alben. Es ist einerseits geprägt durch das für das Erscheinungsjahr sehr hohe Tempo der enthaltenen Musikstücke, andererseits durch die satirischen, gesellschaftskritischen Texte von Leadsänger Jello Biafra. In den durchweg polemischen Songtexten kritisieren und karikieren die Dead Kennedys soziale Ungleichheit.', 'Entstehungsgeschichte.', 'Da sich der Haupt-Songwriter Jello Biafra und der Rest der Dead Kennedys zerstritten hatten, existieren zwei Versionen der Entstehungsgeschichte, eine von Biafra und eine vom Rest der Band. An einigen Stellen des folgenden Abschnitts werden daher unterschiedliche Sichtweisen den jeweiligen Personen zugeordnet.', 'Vertragssuche.', '1978 gegründet, suchte die mit Liveauftritten sehr präsente Band Dead Kennedys eine geeignete Plattenfirma. Wegen ihres provokanten Bandnamens gestaltete sich die Suche besonders schwierig. Eine breite Independent-Szene war noch nicht entstanden und nach The Dickies und Ramones interessierten sich die Major-Labels nicht mehr für US-amerikanische Punkbands. DIY („Do it yourself“, zu Dt. „Mach’ es selbst“) wurde dadurch zu einer der Säulen der noch jungen US-amerikanischen Punkbewegung.', 'Nach Veröffentlichung der Single \\"California über alles\\" durch das bandeigene Label Alternative Tentacles kam bald der Kontakt mit dem Musikagenten Bill Gilliam zustande. Einer festen Buchung der Band für Konzertveranstaltungen stand – auch nach Meinung des zwischenzeitlich ebenfalls kontaktierten Managers von Sham 69, Terry Gordon – jedoch eine nicht ausreichende Menge musikalischen Materials entgegen. Bislang waren lediglich einige Singles und die Kompilation \\"Live at the Deaf Club\\" erschienen. Bill Gilliam stellte die Band daraufhin Iain McNay von Cherry Red Records vor, Terry Gordon startete einen Vermittlungsversuch mit Safari Records. Diese hatten jedoch kein Interesse an einer Albumproduktion und so konzentrierte die Band ihre Hoffnungen ausschließlich auf Cherry Red Records.', 'Kurze Zeit später schickte die Band eine frühe Fassung ihres Songs \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\" an McNay, um dessen Interesse zu wecken. Nach anfänglichen Vorbehalten seitens McNays, unter anderem wegen des provokativen Bandnames, konnte das von der Band eingereichte und als nächste Single geplante Lied überzeugen. Zur Produktion eines Albums verfügte Cherry Red Records allerdings zunächst nicht über die erforderlichen finanziellen Mittel. Nach Biafras Angaben lagen diese bei 8.000, den Auskünften der restlichen Bandmitglieder nach bei 10.000 US-Dollar. Richard Bishop, ein Geschäftspartner McNays von Caroline Records, bot daraufhin seine Unterstützung an. Voraussetzung für das Vorstrecken der benötigten Geldmittel war die vertragliche Einwilligung von McNay und der Band in spezielle Verkaufskonditionen und ein dreimonatiges Exklusivverkaufsrecht für Virgin Records, die Muttergesellschaft von Caroline Records.', 'Bevor die Arbeiten am Debütalbum begannen, nahm die Gruppe die Single \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\" (B-Seite: \\"Police Truck\\") im Tewksbury-Studio in Richmond auf. Als Toningenieur wurde Geza Gedeon, bekannt auch als Geza X, verpflichtet. Er hatte zuvor bereits mit Black Flag und Germs zusammengearbeitet und verfügte als Mitglied der Punkbands Deadbeats und The Bag auch über eigene musikalische Erfahrungen. In den Vereinigten Staaten erschienen die ersten 3.000 Exemplare über Optional Records, danach folgte eine zweite Veröffentlichung über Faulty Products, einen Ableger von Miles Copeland IIIs Independent-Label I.R.S. Records. Die ursprünglich vorgesehene Veröffentlichung durch A&amp;M scheiterte am Namen der Band, denn Labelgründer Jerry Moss war Ted Kennedy freundschaftlich verbunden. Im Mai 1980 erschien die Single im Vereinigten Königreich, dort bereits über Cherry Red Records.', 'Die Aufnahmen zum Album.', 'Nach der erfolgreichen Veröffentlichung der Single willigten McNay und Gilliam ein und gaben der Band die 10.000 Dollar für die Aufnahme des Albums. East Bay Ray gab später an, dass die Band für das Studio 6.000 Dollar einkalkuliert und das restliche Geld unter den vier Bandmitgliedern aufgeteilt habe. Die Band mietete das Studio Mobius Music von Oliver DiCicco in Noe Valley und entschied sich gegen die Verpflichtung von Geza X. Dabei überstimmte sie Jello Biafra, der diesen Produzenten bevorzugte. DiCicco, Musikproduzent und Besitzer des Studios, war lediglich der Toningenieur des Albums, da er wenig Erfahrung mit Punkmusik hatte. Seine vorherigen Produktionen entstammten dem New-Age-Bereich. Da Klaus Flouride berufliche Verpflichtungen hatte, fanden die Aufnahmen nur abends und nachts statt. Das Studio war gerade auf 16-Spur-Technik umgestellt worden und war räumlich sehr eingeschränkt. Die Aufnahme erfolgte auf einem Zwei-Zoll-16-Spur-Band. East Bay Ray verwendete für seine E-Gitarre des Typs Fender Super Reverb einen DOD-Overdrive-Vorverstärker und als Hallgerät eine Echoplex aus den 1960ern. Außerdem spielte er eine alte Telecaster mit Seymour- und Humbucker-Pickups, einem Hals im Stratocaster-Stil und einem Steg von Schecter. Jello Biafra verwendete ein Neumann-U47-Mikrofon, eine Empfehlung von Geza X. Für den Endmix wurde ein Ampex-351-Zweispurgerät verwendet.', 'Die Band investierte viel Zeit auf die Vorproduktion. Die Lieder waren bereits fertig geschrieben und mussten nur noch eingespielt werden. Die meisten Songs waren nach dem ersten oder zweiten Take fertig. Auf dem Album sind daher nur wenig Overdubs zu hören. Während der Aufnahmen kam es jedoch vermehrt zu Konflikten innerhalb der Band, was sowohl die musikalische als auch die organisatorische Seite der Aufnahme betraf. Insbesondere Jello Biafra und East Bay Ray überwachten die Aufnahmen des Albums und streiten sich bis heute um den Hauptanteil. Insbesondere Ray fühlt sich hintergangen, da er nach seinem Verständnis zu wenig Kontrolle über die Produktion hatte. Als Produzent wurde schließlich im Booklet „Norm“ angegeben – der Name der Siamkatze des Produzenten. East Bay Ray wurde unter seinem bürgerlichen Namen „R. Pepperell“ als Produktionsassistent geführt. Spätere Pressungen enthielten andere Angaben. So wurden neben Norm auch East Bay Ray oder „Norm and the Dead Kennedys“ angegeben.', 'Das Album erschien am 2. September 1980 im Vereinigten Königreich, wobei die Pressung fehlerhaft war. Das eingesetzte Masterband lief zu schnell und es fehlten zudem die tiefen Frequenzen. Im Heimatland der Band war das Album zunächst nur als Import erhältlich, erst 1981 erschien die US-Version über I.R.S. Records.', 'Musikstil und Texte.', 'Wie bereits bei den beiden Vorgänger-Singles handelt es sich musikalisch um schnell gespielten Punkrock, der später als Hardcore Punk definiert wurde. Neben dem frühen Punkrock wurden auch Elemente des Garage Rock, insbesondere der Sonics, des Surf und des Rockabilly in die Musik aufgenommen. Dadurch entstand eine für damalige Verhältnisse ungewöhnliche Mischung aus traditionellen Rockelementen und Punkrock. Der Gesang von Jello Biafra war für die damalige Zeit ungewöhnlich schrill und erinnert an ein wütendes Fauchen.', 'Die Texte sind bissig bis bösartig-sarkastisch und aus einer sehr linken Perspektive geschrieben. Dabei werden nicht nur einzelne Aspekte herausgegriffen, die für die Neue Linke in den Vereinigten Staaten charakteristisch waren, sondern die Kritik richtet sich gegen alle Aspekte des sogenannten American Way of Life und das komplette politische System Amerikas. In den Liedern nimmt Biafra oft die andere Position ein und verhöhnt so seine Gegner mit ihren eigenen Worten. Die Produktion war zwar recht dünn, doch die Schnelligkeit und die Verwendung der für Punk ungewöhnlichen Elemente wurden später zum Markenzeichen der Dead Kennedys.', 'Gestaltung.', 'Auf dem Album befindet sich ein Schwarzweißfoto, das eine Reihe brennender Autos zeigt. Die Aufnahme stammt von Judith Carlson und wurde für den San Francisco Examiner erstellt. Sie wurde während der sogenannten „White Night Riots“ am 21. Mai 1979 aufgenommen. Die Unruhen brachen aus, nachdem der ehemalige Stadtrat Dan White den Homosexuellen-Aktivisten Harvey Milk sowie George Moscone, den damaligen Bürgermeister von San Francisco, erschossen hatte und zu einer aus Sicht vieler Kritiker zu geringen Haftstrafe von lediglich sieben Jahren verurteilt worden war. Aus den Reihen einer aufgebrachten Menge von annähernd 5.000 Personen, die zum Rathaus marschierten, lösten sich einzelne Randalierer heraus und steckten in dieser Nacht mehr als ein Dutzend Polizeiautos in Brand.', 'Bei der Reproduktion des Bildes für die Erstveröffentlichung ging viel von der Qualität verloren. Ursprünglich sollten die Flammen deutlicher dargestellt werden, wozu sie von I.R.S. Records orange eingefärbt wurden. Dies wirkte sich aber auch auf den Rest des Bildes aus, so dass Biafra nicht mehr damit zufrieden war. Cherry Red Records übernahm dann den schwarz-weißen Druck, der auch auf allen späteren Veröffentlichungen Verbreitung fand. Die Wiederveröffentlichung zum 25. Jubiläum des Albums 2005 enthielt eine eingefärbte Version, bei der allerdings nur die Flammen hervorgehoben wurden, so wie es ursprünglich geplant war. Über die Jahre erschienen viele unterschiedliche Varianten des Coverartworks, die sich in der Helligkeit des Motives sowie in der Farbe des Bandlogos (weiß oder gelb) unterschieden. Auf der Originalversion befindet sich zudem der Name des Albums nicht auf dem Schallplattencover, sondern nur auf der Rückseite. Bei einigen Versionen wurde dies geändert.', 'Auf dem Backcover war eine andere Band abgebildet, nämlich Sounds of Sunshine, die Anfang der 1970er einen kleinen Hit mit \\"Love Means You Never Have to Say You’re Sorry\\" hatte. Tatsächlich hatte Flouride das Foto irgendwann auf dem Flohmarkt gekauft, ohne dass damals jemand Band oder Fotograf hätte zuordnen können. Das Bild wurde mit Totenköpfen und dem Dead-Kennedys-Logo verziert. Als die Dead Kennedys im Fernsehen gezeigt wurden und dazu immer wieder das Bild vom Backcover abgebildet wurde, wurden ehemalige Sounds-of-Sunshine-Mitglieder, inzwischen konservative Christen, darauf aufmerksam und klagten gegen die Dead Kennedys. Der Vertrieb I.R.S. Records zahlte schließlich eine Entschädigung und auf späteren Pressungen wurden einfach die Köpfe der Bandmitglieder entfernt.', 'Dem Album beigefügt war ein Poster mit einer Collage sowie den Texten des Albums. Die Collage wurde von Jello Biafra angefertigt mit etwas Unterstützung von Winston Smith, der auch für das Dead-Kennedys-Logo und später das Alternative-Tentacles-Logo verantwortlich: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

He slipped it on, feeling the tightness of the material as it hugged his body in all the right places. As he stood in front of a full-length mirror, he couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement and anticipation. He had become addicted to the feeling of transformation, the rush of adrenaline that came with slipping into the persona of a beautiful woman. He slipped on a pair of high heels, feeling a bit unsteady at first, but then finding his balance as he began to strut around the closet. He twirled in front of the mirror and practiced his feminine giggle, feeling more and more confident with each passing minute. Finally, after much deliberation, he settled on a dark-haired bodysuit with bright blue eyes that he felt complemented his complexion the best. He put on a sexy red dress and a pair of dangling earrings, completing the look with a swipe of bright red lipstick on his lips. As he stepped out of the closet, a sense of excitement and possibility washed over him. He was ready for anything that the night might bring, eager to explore his secret desires and revel in the feeling of being someone else entirely.

Einzigartig innerhalb des Reiches waren das genossenschaftlich organisierte Verfassungsgebilde der Burggrafschaft und die Ausstattung mit herrschaftlichen Privilegien durch den Kaiser, die bis zu ihrer Auflösung im Jahr 1806 mehrfach bestätigt wurden. Durch die Ausbildung eines eigenen Territoriums, das neben der Kontrolle über die benachbarte Reichsstadt Friedberg und dem Freigericht Kaichen einen schmalen Landstrich in der südlichen Wetterau umfasste, kann die Burg Friedberg seit der Aufnahme in die Reichsmatrikel 1431 als einzige reichsständische Burg angesehen werden. Nach ihrem Selbstverständnis war die \\"Kayserliche und des heiligen Reichs-Burg Friedberg\\", wie sie sich nannte, eine herausgehobene Einrichtung der Reichsritterschaft und direkt dem König oder Kaiser unterstellt.', 'Geschichte.', 'Gründung und staufische Zeit.', 'Die Burg Friedberg wurde erstmals 1217 urkundlich erwähnt, als König Friedrich II. gegenüber dem Friedberger Burggrafen Giselbert, den Burgmannen und dem Frankfurter Schultheiß bekannte, dass er Ulrich von Münzenberg die Güter zurückgab, die sein Vater und sein Bruder besessen hatten. Wahrscheinlich handelte es sich um eine planmäßige staufische Gründung, die schon einige Jahre zuvor erfolgt sein mag. Darauf deuten Reste einer romanischen Vorgängerkirche unter der Stadtkirche hin. Die Anlage von Stadt und Burg ist im Rahmen der staufischen Reichslandpolitik zu sehen. Der Ausbau der Wetterau zum staufischen Hausgut wurde nach 1171 forciert, als mit dem Aussterben der Grafen von Nürings ihre in dieser Region konzentrierten Lehen an das Reich heimfielen. Die Gründung Friedbergs hat regionale Parallelen in der Gründung und dem Ausbau der Burgen und Reichsstädte Gelnhausen und Wetzlar.', 'Interregnum.', 'In der Zeit des Interregnums (1245–1273) blieben Burg und Stadt Friedberg wie die meisten von staufischen Kaisern gegründeten Reichsstädte der Region zunächst auf staufischer Seite. Doch mit dem Aufbruch Konrads IV. nach Italien 1252 wechselte Friedberg die Seite. Erstmals sind am 17. September 1252 dort ausgestellte Urkunden des Gegenkönigs Wilhelm von Holland belegt. Der Seitenwechsel und die Beendigung des Loyalitätsverhältnisses zu den Staufern zahlten sich bereits wenige Tage später insofern aus, als Wilhelm die Burgmannen am 20. September 1252 von der Verpflichtung zur Reichsheerfahrt entband, ihnen aber eine \\"freiwillige\\" persönliche und finanzielle Beteiligung anheimstellte.', 'Weiterhin war es den Burgmannen in dieser Zeit gelungen, sich von ihrem Status als Reichsministerialen zu Niederadligen zu entwickeln, indem sie am Ende des Interregnums die volle landrechtliche Verfügungsgewalt über ihre Burglehen und damit die volle Lehnsfähigkeit besaßen. Spätere Könige konnten diesen Zustand nur noch bestätigen, um sich die Unterstützung dieser Gruppe zu sichern, was durch eine Urkunde Albrechts I. 1298 bezeugt ist. Für die Burgmannen bedeutete dies eine Standeserhöhung, da sie im genossenschaftlichen Verband reichsunmittelbar wurden.', 'Zuvor hatte bereits König Rudolf I. der Burg und ihren Burgmannen umfangreiche Rechte bestätigt und ihre herausgehobene Stellung privilegiert. Dies sollte entscheidenden Einfluss auf die weitere Verfassungsgeschichte der Burggrafschaft haben:', 'Spätes Mittelalter.', 'Die bereits im Interregnum erworbenen Rechte, die weit über das in der Organisation der Reichsburgen Übliche hinausgingen, wurden im 14. und 15. Jahrhundert gefestigt. 1347 unterlag Graf Adolf I. von Nassau-Wiesbaden der Burgmannschaft in einer Fehde. Mit dem Lösegeld wurde der mächtige Adolfsturm als zweiter Bergfried und Wahrzeichen der Burg errichtet. Durch einen 1349 unter Karl IV. verfassten Burgfrieden wurde der Burgmannschaft das Recht, den Burggrafen einzusetzen, eingeräumt, das zuvor dem König oblag.', 'Während sich die Burggrafschaft mit der Aufnahme in die Reichsmatrikel 1431 auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Macht befand, setzte in der Stadt bereits seit dem 14. Jahrhundert ein Niedergang ein. Die Friedberger Messen verloren durch die nahe Frankfurter Messe an Bedeutung und wurden eingestellt. Als Ursache werden neben einem Niedergang der Tuchproduktion zwei Stadtbrände von 1383 und 1447, Seuchen und die Abwanderung von Bürgern vermutet. Die wiederholten Auseinandersetzungen mit der Reichsstadt Friedberg konnte die Burggrafschaft im 15. Jahrhundert endgültig für sich entscheiden, weil die Burgmannen es verstanden, die schwache Position der Stadt geschickt auszunutzen. Auf dem Höhepunkt der Krise wurde die Stadt 1454 zahlungsunfähig. Frankfurt kündigte aufgrund der Friedberger Schulden den Geleitschutz auf, den Friedberger Bürger bis dahin auf dem Weg zur Frankfurter Messe in Anspruch nehmen konnten. Dadurch wurde die Wirtschaft der Stadt, besonders die Tuchproduktion, schwer getroffen. Im Februar des folgenden Jahres wurde der Rat abgelöst, wobei der Burggraf und die sechs Burgmannen im Rat verblieben und eine vermittelnde Position einnahmen. Die Schlüssel der Stadt wurden der Burg übergeben, zunächst nur aufgrund der Unruhen, die das Ereignis begleiteten. Doch war der Vorgang nicht nur symbolisch, denn in der Folgezeit vergrößerte sich der Einfluss der Burgmannschaft auf die Stadt erheblich.', '1455 erwarb die Burggrafschaft, die sich zunächst abwartend verhalten hatte, erste Teile der Reichspfandschaft, auf deren Basis sie den Rat 1482 zum sogenannten Verherrungsrevers (damit war es der Stadt verboten, ohne Erlaubnis den Herrn zu wechseln, faktisch die Unterwerfung der Stadt) und 1483 zu einer Huldigungsverschreibung (regelte Einzelheiten im Verhältnis der Stadt zur Burg als ihrem Herren) zwingen konnte. Weitere Anteile der zuvor zwischen verschiedenen Parteien geteilten Pfandschaft folgten in den nächsten Jahren. Bereits 1376 hatte die Burggrafschaft erste Rechte im Freigericht Kaichen erworben, deren Landeshoheit sie endgültig 1475 zugesprochen bekam. Ebenfalls 1475 erhielt sie die landesherrliche Stellung in Teilen der \\"Mörler Mark\\". Hinzu kam ein Anteil an der seit 1405 bestehenden Ganerbschaft Staden um die Burg Staden in der Wetterau.', 'So gewann anstatt der bisherigen städtischen Steuer- und Justizeinnahmen die Landesherrschaft erheblich an Bedeutung. 1541 kam noch das Münzprivileg in Friedberg hinzu, die Münzen wurden im Namen des jeweiligen Burggrafen herausgegeben.', 'Neuzeit.', 'Der Niedergang des Niederadels im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert blieb für die Burggrafschaft nicht folgenlos. Das Aussterben und die Verarmung vieler ritterständiger Familien der Region führten dazu, dass die tragenden Säulen der Burgmannschaft (Residenzpflicht, Burghut, Burggericht, Burglehen) verfielen. Die Zahl der Burgmannen sank zum Ende des Dreißigjährigen Kriegs auf das geringste Niveau.', 'Der Einfluss der verbliebenen lokalen Niederadligen wurde in der Folge noch weiter zurückgedrängt. Durch Dienstverpflichtungen bei größeren Landesherren traten Interessenskonflikte auf. Ein großer Teil der Burgmannschaft war inzwischen faktisch vom Einfluss auf die Burgpolitik ausgeschlossen. Durch steigende Bedeutung und die Zahl der Mitglieder war es bereits seit dem 15. Jahrhundert üblich, Regierung und Amtsausübung in die Hand eines kleineren Gremiums, des sogenannten Burgregiments aus zwölf Burgmannen, zu legen. Selbst bei Burggrafenwahlen hatte die gemeine Burgmannschaft gegenüber den vom Regiment vorab ausgewählten Kandidaten kaum mehr als ein Akklamationsrecht. Entsprechend sank die Beteiligung bei Burgkonventen und herrschaftlich-administrativen Anlässen im 18. Jahrhundert auf nahezu Null.', 'Während die Mitgliedschaft in einer einzigartigen Genossenschaft der Reichsritterschaft in der Neuzeit vorwiegend dem sozialen Prestige des Einzelnen in der Ständegesellschaft diente, wurde die Burggrafschaft durch den Einfluss größerer Landesherren allmählich gelähmt. Die Mainzer Erzbischöfe brachten die Burggrafschaft letztlich auf reichspolitisch-katholisch-kaiserlichen Kurs. In der Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts wurden die seit der Reformation mehrheitlich protestantischen Burgmannenfamilien aus dem Burggrafenamt und dem Regiment verdrängt. Die Einrichtung des Ordens des heiligen Joseph 1768 verfestigte diese Politik und erhöhte gleichzeitig nochmals das Ansehen der Burgmannschaft, das jedoch in keinem Verhältnis mehr zur tatsächlichen Bedeutung stand.', 'Auflösung.', 'Ab dem 17. Jahrhundert wandelte sich die Burg zunehmend zum Herrensitz. Davon zeugen repräsentative Gebäude, etwa das Schloss, zunächst Sitz des Johann Eberhard von Cronberg, dann Burggrafiat, der weitläufige Burggarten und die Burgkirche. Als im 18. Jahrhundert zunehmend ständisch andersartige Anteilseigner in die Burggrafschaft eindrangen, etwa die Landgrafschaft Hessen-Kassel oder durch Kurmainz geförderte römisch-katholische Mitglieder, paralysierte das die hergebrachte genossenschaftliche Struktur und die Burggrafschaft versank in politischer Bedeutungslosigkeit.', '1806 wurde sie im Großherzogtum Hessen mediatisiert, obwohl der letzte Burggraf, Clemens August von Westphalen, bei Napoleon und seinem Minister Talleyrand intervenierte. Zuvor hatte die Landgrafschaft Hessen-Darmstadt bereits 1803 versucht, die Burggrafschaft zu besetzen, wurde zu dieser Zeit aber noch vom Kaiser daran gehindert. Die Rheinbundakte von 1806 sprach in Artikel 21 die Burggrafschaft dem Großherzogtum zu. Das Großherzogtum gliederte die Burggrafschaft zunächst als Amt mit der Bezeichnung „Amt Burg-Friedberg“ in seine Verwaltungsstruktur ein. 1821 kam es zu einer Justiz- und Verwaltungsreform, mit der auch die Trennung der Rechtsprechung von der Verwaltung auf unterer Ebene umgesetzt wurde. Die Ämter wurden aufgelöst, ihre Aufgaben hinsichtlich der Verwaltung neu gebildeten Landratsbezirken, die erstinstanzliche Rechtsprechung Landgerichten übertragen. Das „Amt Burg-Friedberg“ wurde aufgelöst, seine Verwaltungstätigkeit übernahm der neu geschaffene Landratsbezirk Butzbach, die von ihm bis dahin ausgeübte Rechtsprechung das Landgericht Friedberg.

It would have a sleek, aerodynamic shape with elegant lines and sharp angles, resembling a frozen shard of ice. Its color could be a subtle icy blue with metallic silver accents, enhancing its connection to the frigid environment. Step 2: Main Deck The Main Deck of the yacht would be an expansive, open-concept space equipped with a forcefield to shield occupants from the chilly wind. This area would serve as the primary gathering place for the graduation party. A sizable dance floor would be situated in the center, complete with a state-of-the-art sound system and dazzling light displays to accompany the music. Around the dance floor, there would be a combination of comfortable oversized couches, elegant seating areas, and high-top tables for guests to gather and socialize. The furniture and decor would have a modern design, with faux fur and snowflake motifs to maintain the icy theme. Step 3: Bar and Catering Area Towards the rear of the Main Deck, there would be a stylish, full-service bar serving up a variety of drinks, mocktails, and party treats. The bar itself would have a frosted glass design with built-in LED lighting to complement the surrounding aesthetic. Adjacent to the bar would be a catering area, providing a lavish spread of hot and cold appetizers, desserts, and finger foods for the guests to enjoy throughout the night. These offerings would be presented artistically on snow- and ice-themed platters and trays. Step 4: Lounge Area and Viewing Deck On the upper level of the yacht, there would be a more intimate lounge area for those who want a break from the action or a quieter space to take in the breathtaking auroras. This indoor space would be warm and cozy, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a transparent roof to provide uninterrupted views of the sky. Outside, a smaller Viewing Deck would offer the chance for guests to truly experience the open air, magnetic light show, and serene environment without interference from the forcefield. Blankets and heating elements would be provided to keep guests warm in this area, adding another level of comfort while staying in theme. Step 5: Sanitation and Rest Facilities Located discreetly off the Main Deck and Lounge Area, there would be clean and modern restrooms to accommodate the needs of the guests. These facilities would also have an icy theme in their design, with blue LED lighting and snowflake accents on the walls and floors. Step 6: Entertainment and Games To provide additional entertainment options for the graduating teens, the yacht would be equipped with a dedicated gaming area in a separate room. This area would house various arcade-style games, virtual reality stations, and interactive activities to offer an exciting break from the dancing and socializing happening on the Main Deck. With this layout and selection of facilities, Sierra's ice-themed yacht would provide the perfect setting for her graduation party, welcoming all the guests into an unforgettable celebration under the auroras of their unique world."},{"instruction":"I'm confused.

Die meist auffällig gefärbten, baumbewohnenden Spechte sind klein bis mittelgroß. Ihr Verbreitungsgebiet erstreckt sich vom nördlichen Nordamerika bis ins zentrale Südamerika, wo sie in unterschiedlichen, meist aber eher offenen, baumbestandenen Landschaften vorkommen. Einige Arten sind Endemiten der größeren Karibikinseln. Nur die an den nördlichen Arealgrenzen beheimateten Populationen sind obligate Zugvögel, einige Arten weisen jedoch ein unstetes, wenig ortsgebundenes Verhalten auf und neigen zu irruptiven Wanderungen. Die meisten Arten ernähren sich von verschiedenen baum- oder bodenbewohnenden Insekten sowie von Samen, Früchten und Beeren, nur wenige ernähren sich überwiegend von Früchten und anderen pflanzlichen Nahrungsbestandteilen. Alle sind Höhlenbrüter, die ihre Nachkommen in selbst gebauten Höhlen großziehen, die in toten oder stark geschädigten Bäumen, in Palmen oder Kakteen gebaut werden. Zumindest acht Arten leben in zum Teil stark differenzierten sozialen Verbänden, außerhalb der Brutzeit werden fast alle Arten in Familienverbänden oder kleinen, gelegentlich auch artlich gemischten Gruppen angetroffen. Einige, wie zum Beispiel der Eichelspecht, betreiben eine intensive Vorratshaltung. Zurzeit werden 24 Arten unterschieden, von denen der Rotkopfspecht und der Guadeloupespecht auf der Vorwarnliste der IUCN stehen.', 'Aussehen.', 'Sowohl im Aussehen als auch in der Größe sind die Vertreter dieser Spechtgattung sehr variabel. Die kleinsten Arten, wie etwa der Yucatánspecht erreichen mit 16 Zentimetern gerade Kleinspechtgröße, bei vielen Arten liegt die Körpergröße um die 23 Zentimeter, sie sind also gut buntspechtgroß, und die größte Art, der Bahamaspecht, ist mit 32 Zentimetern etwa so groß wie der heimische Grünspecht.', 'Alle \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten sind vierzehig mit zygodactyler Zehenanordnung.', 'In Bezug auf die Gefiederfärbung lassen sich zwei etwa gleich große Gruppen unterscheiden: Die Vertreter der einen sind auf der Oberseite auffällig schwarz-weiß, oder, wie beim Haitispecht schwarz-gelb, meist leiterartig gebändert, zuweilen aber auch gefleckt oder punktiert. Je nach Gewichtung der Farbelemente erscheint die Oberseite insgesamt eher hell oder dunkel. Gelbtöne können vor allem in den Schulterpartien vorhanden sein. Die Unterseite ist cremefarben, in den Hals- und Brustbereichen oft auch gelblich oder ockerfarben, sie kann weitgehend ungezeichnet oder auffällig dunkel gefleckt oder speerspitzenartig gebändert sein. Braun- und Rosatöne sind in unterschiedlicher Ausprägung vorhanden. Die Gesichtspartie dieser Spechte ist meist weitgehend hell, die Männchen tragen einen deutlichen, leuchtend hellroten Stirn- und Nackenfleck und meist auch einen rötlichen Bartstreif. Diese Merkmale sind bei den Weibchen auf den Nackenbereich reduziert oder fehlen völlig. Bei dem auf der Oberseite meist schwarz-weiß gezeichneten Stützschwanz sind die beiden Zentralfedern verlängert und laufen spitz zu. Der sehr spitze, mittellange bis lange Stocherschnabel ist dunkel hornfarben, gerade oder am First leicht abwärts gebogen. Arten dieses Typs sind vom südlichen Nordamerika, in Mittelamerika, auf vielen Karibikinseln sowie in Südamerika bis zur südlichen Verbreitungsgrenze vertreten.', 'Die Spechte der zweiten Gruppe sind bedeutend uneinheitlicher gefärbt. Gemeinsam ist ihnen eine weitgehend zeichnungslose Schwarzfärbung der Oberseite, die auch für die gesamte Gattung namensgebend wurde. Einige Arten, wie der Rotkopfspecht mit leuchtend rotem Kopf, Nacken, Brust und Schultern oder der Weißspecht sind sehr auffällig und für Spechte ungewöhnlich gefärbt. Letzterer ist überhaupt die einzige Spechtart, bei der die Kopffärbung beider Geschlechter weitgehend weiß ist und die einzige \\"Melanerpes\\"-Art, der jegliches Rot fehlt. Einige Arten, wie der Guadeloupespecht oder der Blutgesichtspecht, weisen dagegen eine düstere, kontrastarme Färbung auf. Insgesamt überwiegen schwarz-weiße Kontraste. Die schwarzen Körperpartien, vor allem das Rückengefieder, können einen leicht grünlichen, bläulichen oder violetten Glanz aufweisen. Gefiederzeichnungen sind nicht oder nur sehr undeutlich vorhanden. Daneben kommen vor allem im Stirn- und Scheitelbereich reine Rottöne vor, an Brust und Flanken dunkle, matte Purpurfärbungen. Der Färbungsdimorphismus ist bei einigen dieser Spechte eher schwach ausgeprägt, beim Rotkopfspecht und beim Blutgesichtspecht sind die Geschlechter im Aussehen gleich. Die meisten Arten innerhalb dieser Gruppe haben einen meißelartigen, an der Basis recht breiten, geraden oder nur geringfügig abwärts gebogenen Schnabel.', 'Zwei Arten, der Gelbbrauenspecht und der Kaktusspecht, sind in je zwei Farbmorphen vertreten.', 'Lautäußerungen.', 'Aufgrund ihrer Unterschiedlichkeit lassen sich die Lautäußerungen der \\"Melanerpes\\"-Spechte nicht gemeinsam beschreiben. Informationen dazu finden sich in den meisten der betreffenden Artbeiträge. Bei sozial lebenden Arten stehen die Gruppenmitglieder in ständigem Rufkontakt und sind deshalb akustisch sehr auffällig. Dies gilt zum Beispiel für Gruppen des Eichelspechts, dessen Mitglieder sich mit lauten \\"Wäka\\"-Rufen verständigen. Andere, wie etwa der Blutgesichtspecht verhalten sich sehr ruhig. Die Spechte dieser Gattung trommeln nur selten und eher leise, einige offenbar überhaupt nicht.', 'Verbreitung und Lebensraum.', 'Die Verbreitung von \\"Melanerpes\\" beschränkt sich auf die Nearktis und die Neotropis. Außer dem kontinentalen Festland Nord-, Mittel- und Südamerikas haben einige Arten verschiedene Karibikinseln besiedelt. Am weitesten nach Norden dringen der Blutgesichtspecht im westlichen Nordamerika und der Rotkopfspecht im zentralen und östlichen Nordamerika vor, am weitesten nach Süden erstreckt sich das Verbreitungsgebiet von Weißspecht und Kaktusspecht, die bis ins nördliche Patagonien vorkommen. Die größte Artenvielfalt auf vergleichsweise engem Raum besteht mit vierzehn Arten in Mittelamerika und auf verschiedenen Karibik-Inseln, auf denen Guadeloupespecht, Scharlachbrustspecht, Haitispecht, Jamaikaspecht und Bahamaspecht Inselendemiten sind. Auch einige mexikanische, beziehungsweise mittelamerikanische Arten, wie der Yucatánspecht, der Graukehlspecht, der Goldwangenspecht oder der Hoffmannspecht kommen nur in kleinen, zudem auch zunehmend fragmentierten Gebieten vor. Im nordwestlichen Südamerika sind die bisher bekannten Verbreitungsgebiete des Buntkopfspechts und des erst kürzlich als eigenständige Art klassifizierten Schmuckspechts sehr klein. Flächenmäßig ausgedehnte Gebiete besiedeln dagegen die meisten nordamerikanischen und, mit Ausnahme der beiden oben genannten, die südamerikanischen Arten.', 'Die Lebensräume der einzelnen Arten sind äußerst vielfältig, immer aber müssen baum-, zumindest aber kakteenbestandene Landschaften zur Verfügung stehen. Insgesamt zeigen die meisten Arten eine Präferenz für offene Landschaften, Waldränder, Rodungsflächen oder für Gebiete mit offenen Strukturen, die von Bränden oder Stürmen geschaffen wurden. Die Baumartenzusammensetzung der Lebensräume ist sehr variabel und spielt offenbar nur für die wenigen Nahrungsspezialisten unter den \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten, wie den Eichelspecht, eine wichtige Rolle. Dieser ist eng an das Vorkommen seiner Nahrungsbäume, verschiedene Eichenarten, gebunden. Für viele Arten ist ein ausreichender Totholzanteil innerhalb des Lebensraumes ein wichtiges Requisit. Zwar dringen einige Arten in dichte Waldgebiete vor, den primären Lebensraum bilden diese jedoch nur für wenige. \\"Melanerpes\\"-Spechte kommen in ausgesprochen feuchten Habitaten, wie Mangrovensümpfen und Schwemmlandgebieten ebenso vor wie in mit Saguaro bestandenen Halbwüsten oder in den Dornbuschsavannen des Chaco. Die meisten Arten sind relativ anpassungsfähig und können innerhalb eines räumlich begrenzten Verbreitungsgebietes sehr unterschiedliche Lebensräume besiedeln; dies gilt besonders für die Inselendemiten. Viele Arten haben sich an die Anwesenheit des Menschen gewöhnt und brüten auch in Stadtgebieten, in großen Parks, Plantagen oder in Obstgärten, auch Futterstellen werden von einigen \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten regelmäßig aufgesucht.', 'Arten dieser Gattung kommen vom Meeresniveau bis zu den regionalen Baumgrenzen vor. Futtersuchende Eichelspechte wurden in Kolumbien noch in Höhen von 3500 Metern festgestellt.', 'Nahrung und Nahrungserwerb.', 'Alle \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten sind sowohl herbivor als auch carnivor. Die Zusammensetzung und die Anteile pflanzlicher und tierischer Nahrung variieren sowohl von Art zu Art als auch innerhalb derselben Art. Generell wird in der Vorbrutzeit und während der Jungenaufzucht mehr tierische Nahrung aufgenommen, im Herbst und Winter verstärkt pflanzliche. Auch die Jungen werden mehrheitlich, aber nicht ausschließlich mit tierischer Nahrung versorgt. Diese Unterschiede gelten vor allem für die Arten der höheren nördlichen und südlichen Breiten, bei den tropischen Arten sind die jahreszeitlichen Unterschiede in der Nahrungszusammensetzung geringer. Die meisten können als Nahrungsgeneralisten bezeichnet werden, das breiteste Nahrungsspektrum unter den \\"Melanerpes\\" weisen wahrscheinlich der Rotkopfspecht und der Gilaspecht auf. Vergleichsweise spezialisiert sind dagegen der Eichelspecht und der Weißspecht, die sich von Eicheln beziehungsweise verschiedenen Früchten ernähren. Soweit bekannt, ist nur der Goldmaskenspecht weitgehend herbivor.', 'Die tierische Nahrung besteht vor allem aus Insekten. Hier überwiegen Ameisen, Termiten, Käfer und ihre holzbewohnenden Larven, Schmetterlingsraupen, Heuschrecken, Grillen und bei den kleinen Arten Blattläuse. Auch Fluginsekten spielen eine Rolle, Rotkopfspecht und Blutgesichtspecht ernähren sich während der Sommermonate vornehmlich von solchen.

Im Lehm sind Geschiebe vorhanden, deren größte Brocken in ur- und frühgeschichtlicher Zeit für Steingräber verwendet wurden. Nach dem Rückzug des Eises bildete das Schmelzwasser Deckgeröll und Decksande, die Hügel (etwa bei Marx) und Rücken (etwa bei Etzel) bildeten.

Die Deckfedern der Flügelunterseite sind bräunlichgrau. Der Schnabel ist horngrau oder hornbraun; die Schnabelwülste rahmgelb.', 'Während die Jugendmauser in Mitteleuropa eine Teilmauser darstellt, ist sie auf der Iberischen Halbinsel umfassender, jedoch keine Vollmauser. In der Schweiz geht die Jugendmauser von Mitte Juli bis über Ende Oktober hinaus.', 'Der Flug des Girlitzes ist auffallend wellenförmig und entspricht dem typischen Flugbild der Finken.', 'Stimme und Gesang.', 'Der Name „Girlitz“ leitet vom zwei- bis dreisilbigen Stimmfühlungsruf des Vogels ab, der aus hohen lauten Trillern besteht. Er klingt wie „tirrilillit“ oder „zirrirrilit“. Der Kontaktaufnahme oder dem Locken dienen Klänge wie „tschizick“, „tschit-tschittschit“. Um Artgenossen zu warnen, gibt der Girlitz ein einzeln oder mehrmals wiederholtes, etwas gequetschtes „nätsch“ oder nasales „wäji“ von sich. Diese Rufe werden gegebenenfalls zwischen Gesangsstrophen eingeschoben.', 'Der Bettelruf der flüggen Jungvögel setzt sich aus einem zweisilbigen hohen „prrrp“ oder „zii“, „ziiz“ und „ziz“ (einzeln oder gereiht) zusammen. Bei Erregung klingt er eher wie „ziiz-ziiz, ziz-ziz-zii“.', 'Der klirrend-sirrende Vollgesang setzt sich aus einer dichten und sehr schnellen Folge kurzer, hoher Laute zusammen, die diesem Vogel die Bezeichnungen „Glasschneider“ und „Hirngrill“ eingetragen haben. Die Tonhöhe liegt hauptsächlich zwischen fünf und neun Kilohertz. Das Gesangsrepertoire umfasst über 50 komplexe Silben, die in einem sehr schnellen Tempo und einer sehr stereotypen Reihenfolge eigene Lieder bilden. Starke Variationen finden sich im Übergang von einer Tour (zusammenhängenden Abfolge von Silben, also (Teil-)Strophe) in eine andere (Modulation). Das Gesangsrepertoire ist unter den Stieglitzartigen (Carduelinae) einzigartig. Zudem umfasst es eine variable Menge an Silben, die auch im Gesang anderer Vögel verwendet werden. Es konnte bewiesen werden, dass die Komposition des Repertoires geographisch variiert.', 'Der Gesang ist in Zyklen strukturiert (Periodizität), die keine feste zeitliche Struktur aufweisen und jederzeit abrupt gestoppt werden können. In einem wiederkehrenden Intervall können an einer begrenzten Anzahl von Stellen neue Elemente integriert werden. Die Strukturierung in Phrasen (Phrase: selbständiger Abschluss eines Musikstücks) ist jedoch wenig ausgeprägt. In den Strophen finden sich sowohl Triller-Touren, die sich aus kurzen Trillern oder schwirrenden „rirr“-, „sirr“-, „sis“-, „sii“-Klängen und „zirr“-, „lirr-“, „lil“- und „lit“-Lauten zusammensetzen, als auch schnelle, wiederholungsfreie Touren mit steilflankigen Elementen (dichte, sehr schnelle Silbenabfolge kurzer, hoher Laute). Letztere stellen im Sonagramm den wichtigsten Teil des Liedes dar. Beide Gesangselemente weisen Unterschiede in Bezug auf den durchschnittlichen Gebrauch von interelementaren Intervallen (Übergang von einer Tour in eine andere) auf. Zudem differenzieren sie wahrscheinlich auch in Bezug auf die Atembewegungen. Die Strophendauer schwankt in der Regel erheblich. Dabei verwendet der Girlitz oft kurze Strophen, insbesondere zu Beginn des Gesangs. Während beim Balz- und Reviergesang zwischen die Strophen manchmal eine klangvollere perlende Tour eingeschoben wird, dominieren insbesondere den Kontergesang fast direkt hintereinander gesetzte Strophen, die in der Regel durch ein „zirrirrilit“ voneinander abgetrennt werden.', 'Der Girlitz trägt die Strophen mit offenem Schnabel und leicht angehobenem Schwanz entweder von einer Singwarte aus oder im Singflug vor. Während des Singflugs bebt er am ganzen Körper und wendet den Kopf immer wieder von einer Seite zur anderen. Oft singt er im Flug von einer Warte zur anderen weiter, häufig macht er auch im Ausdrucksflug langsame und weit ausholende Flügelschläge und wirft sich nach rechts und links.', 'In der Regel beginnt der Reviergesang in Mitteleuropa im Februar, besonders aber in der zweiten Märzhälfte. Von Anfang Juli bis Anfang August verringert sich die Zahl der singenden Vögel zunehmend, auch wenn einzelne Exemplare bis Ende Juli den Vollgesang vortragen und Singflüge zeigen. Von Ende August bis in den Januar hinein lässt der Girlitz vereinzelt den rauen, kratzigen Herbst- und Wintergesang hören, der dem Jugendgesang entspricht. Sowohl im Winterquartier als auch im April im Brutgebiet steigert er sich bisweilen zum Chorgesang. Auf der Rast während des Heimzuges ertönt auch häufig Gesang.', 'Verbreitung.', 'Der Girlitz ist in Nordafrika und Kontinentaleuropa sowie in Kleinasien verbreitet. Das ursprüngliche Verbreitungsgebiet liegt im Mittelmeerraum und reicht von Nordafrika bis nach Südeuropa. Im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert begann der Girlitz sein Verbreitungsgebiet nach Mittel- und Westeuropa zu erweitern und den Nahen Osten zu besiedeln. Auch im Baltikum ist der Girlitz zu finden.

Er bewegt sich auf einer noch exzentrischeren Bahn um die Sonne als der Planet Merkur. Sein Volumen entspricht etwa einem Drittel des Erdmondes.', 'Die astronomischen Symbole des Pluto sind ♇ und, sie sind heute in der Astronomie selten, in der Astrologie jedoch weit verbreitet. Pluto ist nach dem römischen Gott der Unterwelt benannt. Nach dem Zwergplaneten wiederum wurden die neuen Klassen der Plutoiden und der Plutinos benannt.', 'Von seiner Entdeckung am 18. Februar 1930 bis zur Neudefinition des Begriffs „Planet“ am 24. August 2006 durch die Internationale Astronomische Union (IAU) galt Pluto als der neunte und äußerste Planet des Sonnensystems. Nachdem immer mehr Plutoiden – also ähnlich große Körper des Kuipergürtels – gefunden worden waren, wurde eine präzisere Begriffsdefinition entwickelt. Seither wird er der Kategorie \\"Zwergplanet\\" zugeordnet und erhielt die Kleinplanetennummer (134340) Pluto.', 'Im Januar 2006 wurde mit New Horizons erstmals eine Raumsonde zu Pluto ausgesandt; sie passierte ihn am 14. Juli 2015 in 12.500 km Entfernung.', 'Umlaufbahn und Rotation.', 'Bahn.', 'Pluto benötigt für eine Sonnenumrundung 247,94 Jahre. Im Vergleich zu den Planetenbahnen ist die Umlaufbahn Plutos deutlich exzentrischer, mit einer Exzentrizität von 0,2488. Das heißt, der Abstand zur Sonne ist bis zu 24,88 % kleiner oder größer als die große Halbachse.', 'Der sonnenfernste Punkt der Plutobahn, das Aphel, liegt bei 49,305 AE, während der sonnennächste Punkt, das Perihel, mit 29,658 AE näher an der Sonne liegt als die viel kreisförmigere Bahn Neptuns. Beide Bahnen verlaufen nicht in derselben Ebene, die Ebene der Plutobahn ist stärker gegen die Ekliptik geneigt als die der Neptunbahn. Die Bahnkurven schneiden sich nicht, der Abstand der beiden Himmelskörper bleibt stets größer als etwa 17 AE. Vom 7. Februar 1979 bis zum 11. Februar 1999 durchlief Pluto zum letzten Mal den Bereich, in dem er der Sonne näher ist als die Neptunbahn. Das Perihel passierte Pluto 1989. Das nächste Aphel wird er im Jahr 2113 erreichen. Dort beträgt die Sonnenstrahlung nur etwa 0,563 W/m². Auf der Erde ist sie 2430-mal so hoch. Vom Pluto aus betrachtet hat die Sonne einen scheinbaren Durchmesser von nur etwa 50″ und sieht damit wie ein blendend heller Stern etwa der −19. Größenklasse aus (150-mal heller als der Vollmond). Sie schwankt während eines Plutojahres um etwa 1,1 Größenklassen.', 'Wegen Plutos stark exzentrischer Bahn und der unterschiedlichen Albedo seiner zwei Hemisphären ändert sich seine Helligkeit, von der Erde aus gesehen, zwischen 13,8 mag (Erdnähe) und 16,5 mag (Erdferne).', 'In der Zeit, in der Neptun dreimal die Sonne umrundet, bewegt sich Pluto genau zweimal um die Sonne. Man spricht daher von einer 3:2-Bahnresonanz. Viele Kuipergürtelobjekte befinden sich wie Pluto in einer solchen 3:2-Bahnresonanz mit Neptun, und sie werden deswegen als Plutinos bezeichnet. Dass deren typischerweise sehr exzentrische Umlaufbahnen über Jahrmillionen stabil sind, lässt sich mit Methoden der Himmelsmechanik zeigen.', 'Pluto galt bis zur Entdeckung vieler anderer, ähnlicher Objekte als ein entwichener Mond des Neptun. Seine ausgeprägt exzentrische und mit 17° stark gegen die Ekliptik geneigte Bahn und geringe Größe ließen das vermuten. Der große Neptunmond Triton soll von Neptun eingefangen worden sein und dabei das ursprüngliche Mondsystem beträchtlich gestört haben: Pluto sei dadurch aus dem Neptunsystem herauskatapultiert worden und die erhebliche Bahnexzentrizität des Neptunmondes Nereid sei entstanden. Für das Einfangen des Triton spricht dessen rückläufiger Umlaufsinn, weshalb das nach wie vor die gängige Theorie für Triton ist. Jedoch wurde die Hypothese des entwichenen Pluto mittlerweile fallengelassen. Die Entdeckung zahlreicher weiterer transneptunischer Objekte im Sonnensystem hat erwiesen, dass Pluto der größte und jedenfalls der hellste Vertreter des Kuipergürtels ist, einer Anhäufung von tausenden Asteroiden und Kometenkernen in einer scheibenförmigen Region hinter der Neptunbahn. Die Entstehungsgeschichte von Pluto ist demnach eng mit der des Kuipergürtels verknüpft, der aus Resten der Bildung des äußeren Planetensystems besteht. Auch Triton soll vor seinem vermuteten Einfang ein Mitglied dieses Gürtels gewesen sein.', 'Rotation.', 'Pluto rotiert in 6,387 Tagen einmal um seine Achse. Die Äquatorebene ist um 122,53° gegen die Bahnebene geneigt, somit rotiert Pluto rückläufig. Seine Drehachse ist damit noch stärker geneigt als die des Uranus. Im Unterschied zum Uranus und zur Venus ist der Grund dafür allgemein ersichtlich, ebenso die Ursache für Plutos im Vergleich zu anderen Himmelskörpern große Rotationsperiode, denn die Eigendrehung des Zwergplaneten ist durch die Gezeitenkräfte an die Umlaufbewegung seines sehr großen Mondes Charon gebunden. Pluto und Charon waren die ersten und über längere Zeit die einzigen bekannten Körper im Sonnensystem mit einer doppelt gebundenen Rotation, bis im Kuipergürtel sowie im Asteroidengürtel ähnlich geartete Systeme gefunden wurden, wie etwa (90) Antiope mit deren Begleiter Antiope B.', 'Die Bestimmung der Pole erfolgte für den Zwergplaneten so, dass sein Nordpol jener Drehpunkt ist, an dem die Drehung der Oberfläche gegen den Uhrzeigersinn läuft. Durch Plutos retrograden Rotationssinn weist die Achsenrichtung seines Nordpols somit, im Unterschied zu den Planeten, südlich der Ekliptik.', 'Aufbau.', 'Mit einem Durchmesser von lediglich 2374 km ist Pluto deutlich kleiner als die sieben größten Monde im Sonnensystem. Sein Aufbau ähnelt vermutlich dem des größeren und noch kälteren Triton. Er ist von ähnlicher Dichte, besitzt eine sehr dünne Atmosphäre aus Stickstoff, ist ebenso von einer eher rötlichen Färbung, hat Polkappen, und in Richtung des Äquators herrschen dunklere Gebiete vor.', 'Innerer Aufbau.', 'Plutos mittlere Dichte beträgt 1,860 g/cm³; bei einer Dichte von rund 2 g/cm³ ist eine Zusammensetzung aus etwa 70 % Gestein und 30 % Wassereis wahrscheinlich.', 'Nach dem aktuellen Modell von Plutos Aufbau hat sich sein Inneres durch die Wärme von radioaktiven Zerfallsprozessen in eine Kern-Mantel-Struktur differenziert. Der Kern besteht zum größten Teil aus Gestein und misst 70 % von Plutos Durchmesser. Unter der Oberfläche aus vorherrschendem Stickstoffeis wird der Kern von einem Mantel aus Wassereis umhüllt. In der Übergangszone zwischen Kern und Mantel könnte sich durch die inneren Schmelzvorgänge ein möglicherweise heute noch existierender, globaler extraterrestrischer Ozean gebildet haben.', 'Oberfläche.', 'Plutos Oberfläche entspricht mit ihrer Größe von 17,6 Millionen Quadratkilometern knapp der Fläche von Südamerika. Sie zeigt nach der des Saturnmondes Iapetus unter allen übrigen Körpern des Sonnensystems die größten Helligkeitskontraste. Das erklärt die ausgeprägten Helligkeitsschwankungen, die schon von 1985 bis 1990 bei Verfinsterungen Plutos durch seinen großen Mond Charon gemessen wurden.', 'Ab 2004 wurden Pluto und Charon mit dem Spitzer-Weltraumteleskop im thermischen Infrarot beobachtet. Die Lichtkurven zeigten, dass Pluto mit rund 40 Kelvin etwa 10 Kelvin kälter ist als Charon. Ursachen sind eine höhere Albedo, wodurch weniger Sonnenlicht absorbiert wird, und eine größere thermische Trägheit, wodurch die Rotation mehr Wärme auf die Rückseite transportiert.', 'Durch den Vorbeiflug von New Horizons konnten von Plutos Oberfläche die Nordhalbkugel und die südliche Äquatorialzone abgelichtet werden; über den Rest herrschte die jahreszeitliche Polarnacht. Die detailreichsten Aufnahmen wurden von den Bereichen gewonnen, die inmitten der vom Mond Charon ständig abgewandten Seite um den 180. Längengrad liegen. Dort fällt eine helle, näherungsweise herzförmige, homogen erscheinende Region auf. Sie liegt zum flächenmäßig größeren Anteil nördlich des Äquators und hat nach dem Entdecker des Plutos, Clyde Tombaugh, den Namen \\"Tombaugh Regio\\" erhalten. Innerhalb der Tombaugh-Region befindet sich ein Bereich, der \\"Sputnik Planitia\\" getauft wurde. Die Sputnik-Tiefebene – benannt nach dem ersten künstlichen Satelliten Sputnik 1 – ist eine sehr große Eisfläche, die die westliche Hälfte der Tombaugh-Region einnimmt. Da sie frei von Einschlagkratern ist, gehen manche Forscher davon aus, dass sie weniger als 100 Millionen Jahre alt und möglicherweise noch in einem Zustand aktiver geologischer Formung begriffen ist. Ihr Anblick erinnert im ersten Moment an gefrorenen Schlamm. Sichtbare Schlieren in diesem Bereich könnten durch Winde verursacht sein. Andere Forscher gehen dabei von einer geologisch inaktiven, alten Oberfläche aus, auf die sich lediglich Vorgänge der Atmosphäre auswirken und niederschlagen. Stickstoffeis fließt in Gletschern aus einem hellen Bereich von Osten her in die Sputnik Planitia. Man nimmt an, dass es zuvor im Zentrum der Sputnik-Ebene verdampft ist und sich östlich der Ebene niedergeschlagen hat, von wo es zurückfließt.', 'Die auffällige Tombaugh-Region liegt vermutlich nicht zufällig an dem Punkt des Äquators, der von Charon genau abgewandt ist. Nach der bevorzugten Erklärung müssen sie die Fliehkraft von Plutos Rotation und die Gezeitenkraft Charons in diese spezielle Position gebracht haben. Die Sputnik Planitia ist als Tiefebene jedoch von negativer Topologie und käme demnach durch einen Mangel an Masse für eine positive Schwerkraftanomalie, an denen diese Kräfte angreifen könnten, auf den ersten Blick nicht infrage. Bei der Tiefebene handelt es sich vermutlich um ein weniger als 100 Millionen Jahre altes Einschlagbecken, durch dessen durchlöcherten Boden Wasser eines möglichen verborgenen Ozeans eindringen konnte. Die Eisschicht, die das aufgestiegene Wasser gebildet hat, ist zwar dünner als die umgebende Eiskruste, hat aber eine höhere Massendichte, sodass dennoch eine positive Schwerkraftanomalie entstand. Nachfolgende Ablagerungen von Stickstoffeis haben diesen Effekt noch verstärkt.', 'Am Südrand der Sputnik-Ebene ragen bis in eine Höhe von 3500 Metern die \\"Norgay Montes,\\" benannt nach Tenzing Norgay, neben Edmund Hillary einer der beiden Erstbesteiger des Mount: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Pluto, Zwergplanet, Kuipergürtel, Bahn, Rotation, Aufbau, Oberfläche, Tombaugh-Region, Sputnik Planitia, Norgay Montes"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Corpus Platonicum'], 'Der Ion (, ) ist ein in Dialogform verfasstes frühes Werk des griechischen Philosophen Platon. Den Inhalt bildet ein fiktives Gespräch von Platons Lehrer Sokrates mit dem ansonsten unbekannten Ion von Ephesos, nach dem der Dialog benannt ist. Ion ist Rhapsode, das heißt, er rezitiert berufsmäßig bei festlichen Anlässen epische Dichtung und legt sie aus.', 'Das Thema des Gesprächs ist die Frage, worauf die Kompetenz eines Rhapsoden basiert. Darüber hinaus geht es auch um die Quelle der schöpferischen Tätigkeit der Dichter. Den Hintergrund bildet – mit modernen Begriffen ausgedrückt – das ungeklärte Verhältnis zwischen literarischer Technik und überragender künstlerischer Qualität auf dem Gebiet der Schönen Literatur.', 'Sokrates fragt nach dem beruflichen Wissen, das Ion befähigt, Dichtung zu interpretieren. Dabei geht er zunächst von der Annahme aus, dass es sich um ein grundsätzliches Fachwissen über Dichtung handelt. Wenn dies zutrifft, muss der Rhapsode jedes Gedicht verstehen und beurteilen können. Dazu ist Ion aber nicht imstande, denn er ist nur auf die Epen Homers spezialisiert. Somit besitzt er kein allgemein dichtungsbezogenes Wissen. Es kann sich aber auch nicht um sonstiges Fachwissen handeln. Weder Dichter noch Rhapsoden beherrschen ihre Themen fachwissenschaftlich. Beispielsweise erfüllt der Rhapsode die Aufgabe, seinem Publikum Dichtung, die von Kriegstaten handelt, nahezubringen, aber von Kriegsführung versteht er nichts.', 'Demnach ist ein besonderes berufliches Wissen der Dichter und der Rhapsoden nicht benennbar, und es gibt kein Gebiet, auf dem sie mit den jeweiligen Fachleuten konkurrieren können. Somit ist weder die Dichtung noch ihre Auslegung ein Produkt von Wissen. Als Alternative bietet sich die Annahme an, dass göttliche Inspiration die Dichter und die Rhapsoden zu Leistungen befähigt, die sie von sich aus nicht erbringen könnten. Mit dieser von Sokrates vorgeschlagenen Erklärung ist Ion zufrieden.', 'Der in der Antike wenig beachtete Dialog hat in der Neuzeit ein vielfältiges Echo hervorgerufen, wobei konträre Deutungen des Inspirationskonzepts zu gegensätzlichen Ergebnissen führten. Das Spektrum der Interpretationen reicht von der Einschätzung als reine Persiflage bis zur Annahme, es handle sich um eine Huldigung an die poetische Ergriffenheit.', 'Ort, Zeit und Teilnehmer.', 'Der Dialog findet an einem Tag zwischen Mai und August an einem nicht näher bezeichneten Ort in Athen statt. Die Zeit ist nicht angegeben, lässt sich aber eingrenzen: Athen befindet sich im Peloponnesischen Krieg, der 431 v. Chr. ausgebrochen ist, und da Ions Heimatstadt Ephesos noch unter der Kontrolle Athens steht, kommt die Zeit ab 412 nicht in Betracht. Ein plausibler Zeitpunkt ist 413, denn Athen leidet unter akutem Mangel an tüchtigen Truppenführern, was nach dem katastrophalen Ausgang der Sizilienexpedition (415–413) der Fall war. Allerdings ist zu beachten, dass Platon als Schriftsteller von seiner literarischen Freiheit Gebrauch zu machen pflegt und auf historische Genauigkeit keinen Wert legt.', 'Das Gespräch setzt unvermittelt ein, es hat keine Rahmenhandlung. Beteiligt sind nur Sokrates und Ion. Ob Ion eine von Platon erfundene Figur oder eine historische Person ist, ist unbekannt, denn außer dem nach ihm benannten Dialog gibt es keine Quellen, die ihn erwähnen. Jedenfalls repräsentiert er den Berufsstand der Rhapsoden, die damals im kulturellen Leben als Vermittler von Dichtung an breite Schichten einflussreich waren. Rhapsoden wussten die Werke Homers auswendig und konnten großen Ruhm erlangen, wenn sie in Wettkämpfen siegten. Bei ihren Auftritten trugen sie bunte Kleidung und waren mit goldenen Kränzen geschmückt, es konnten etwa zwanzigtausend Zuhörer anwesend sein. Wie auch andere im öffentlichen Leben erfolgreiche Gestalten in Platons Dialogen macht Ion, der kürzlich einen Sieg davongetragen hat, einen sehr selbstbewussten Eindruck. Aus der Schilderung seiner Auftritte geht hervor, dass er sich vor der Menge wie ein Schauspieler verhält. Über seine Herkunft erfährt man nur, dass er aus Ephesos stammt.', 'Vom Naturell her sind die beiden Persönlichkeiten gegensätzlich: Ions Denkweise ist naiv und unphilosophisch, der geübte Debattierer Sokrates hingegen argumentiert aus einer strikt philosophischen Perspektive. Seiner Gewohnheit gemäß entlarvt Sokrates hartnäckig das Scheinwissen seines Gesprächspartners und bringt ihn damit gezielt in Verlegenheit. Der Rhapsode zeigt sich trotz seines stark ausgeprägten Selbstbewusstseins respektvoll und lernbereit, da er die geistige Überlegenheit des Philosophen anerkennt.', 'Inhalt.', 'Das Einleitungsgespräch', 'Sokrates begrüßt Ion, der aus Epidauros nach Athen gekommen ist. In Epidauros hat Ion, wie er stolz berichtet, bei dem Rhapsodenwettkampf anlässlich der \\"Asklepieia\\" genannten panhellenischen Spiele den ersten Preis errungen. Nun will er in Athen an dem Wettstreit teilnehmen, der im August bei den „großen Panathenäen“, einem bedeutenden Fest, abgehalten wird. Sokrates drückt seine Bewunderung für die Rhapsoden aus. Damit ermutigt er den von sich eingenommenen Wettkampfsieger, seine Eitelkeit offen zu zeigen. Zugleich legt er aber auch den hohen Anspruch dar, den er an Ions Berufsstand stellt: Nach seinem Verständnis ist es die Aufgabe des Rhapsoden, den Zuhörern die Gedanken des Dichters zu vermitteln, und das setzt voraus, dass er nicht nur den Wortlaut der Epen kennt, sondern auch den Inhalt vollständig durchdrungen hat. Ion stimmt dem zu und lässt sich zu der Behauptung hinreißen, weder unter den Lebenden noch unter den Verstorbenen sei jemand zu finden, der ihm in der Homerauslegung ebenbürtig oder überlegen sei. Mit dieser Selbsteinschätzung bietet er Sokrates Gelegenheit, die Berechtigung seines Anspruchs auf umfassendes Wissen einer philosophischen Untersuchung – dem Elenchos – zu unterwerfen.', 'Eine Schlüsselrolle spielt bei der philosophischen Untersuchung der Begriff \\"téchnē\\", der oft ungenau mit „Kunst“ übersetzt wird. Gemeint ist nicht speziell Kunst im heutigen engeren Sinn („Schöne Künste“), sondern generell ein systematisch geordnetes, auf ein bestimmtes klar umgrenztes Gebiet bezogenes praktisches („technisches“) Wissen, beispielsweise die Fachkompetenz von Handwerkern, Ärzten oder Truppenführern. Die \\"techne\\" verleiht dem Wissenden die Fähigkeit, sich auf dem betreffenden Gebiet erfolgreich zu betätigen („Fertigkeit“) und andere korrekt darüber zu belehren. Gefragt wird nun, worin die \\"techne\\" des Rhapsoden besteht.', 'Das Verhältnis von allgemeiner und spezieller Kompetenz', 'Nachdem der Rhapsode die Einzigartigkeit seines Homerverständnisses gepriesen hat, beginnt Sokrates die Untersuchung mit der Frage, ob Ion auch die Werke anderer bedeutender Dichter wie Hesiod und Archilochos auslegen könne. Ion muss dies verneinen, und er fügt hinzu, dass ihm die Beschäftigung mit Homer genüge. Bei Homer kenne er sich so gut aus, dass er auch Äußerungen anderer Dichter erklären könne, insoweit deren Aussagen mit denen Homers inhaltlich übereinstimmten. Was aber bei Homer nicht zu finden ist, dafür will er nicht zuständig sein. Sokrates weist darauf hin, dass die anderen Dichter dieselben Themenbereiche behandeln wie Homer, insbesondere Krieg und Begegnungen verschiedenartiger Menschen sowie den Umgang der Götter untereinander und mit den Menschen. Demnach müsste ein vorzüglicher Kenner Homers, der solche Themen beherrscht, auch über ein entsprechendes Verständnis nichthomerischer Gedichte verfügen.', 'Ion rechtfertigt seine Beschränkung auf Homer mit der überragenden Qualität von dessen Epen. Damit liefert er Sokrates ein wichtiges Argument: Wer auf einem Gebiet das Beste als solches erkennen kann, der besitzt einen Maßstab für Qualität, welcher ihm das Vergleichen ermöglicht. Wenn er das Beste zu verstehen und zu beurteilen vermag, ist zu erwarten, dass sich seine Kompetenz auch auf das weniger Anspruchsvolle erstreckt. Das bestreitet Ion zwar grundsätzlich nicht, doch er berichtet, dass es ihm seltsamerweise ganz anders ergeht: Wenn von Dichtung außerhalb seines Spezialgebiets die Rede ist, fühlt er sich nicht in seinem Element und kann nichts beitragen, seine Konzentration lässt nach und er nickt sogar ein.', 'Für dieses Phänomen findet Sokrates eine einfache Erklärung: Er sieht den Grund darin, dass der Rhapsode auch hinsichtlich der homerischen Epen kein wirkliches Verständnis besitze. Anderenfalls wäre er in der Lage, jede beliebige Dichtung, die ebenfalls Themen der gängigen Art behandelt, korrekt auszulegen. Die Dichtkunst sei als Wissensgebiet eine Einheit; Fachkompetenz müsse sich daher, wenn sie tatsächlich vorhanden sei, auf die Gesamtheit des Fachs erstrecken. Wer erklären könne, worin die Vorzüge der besten Maler, Bildhauer oder Musiker bestünden, der müsse daher notwendigerweise auch die schlechteren kompetent beurteilen können. Für Sokrates ergibt sich spezielles, einzelfallbezogenes Wissen ausschließlich und zwangsläufig aus allgemeinem. Ion stimmt dem zu, hält aber an seiner Behauptung fest, der beste Homerinterpret zu sein. Auch alle anderen seien der Meinung, er könne über Homer gut reden, nicht aber über die übrigen Dichter. Er kann sich nicht erklären, warum er über eine so einseitige Fähigkeit verfügt.', 'Inspiration als Alternative zu Sachkenntnis', 'Mit einer längeren Darlegung versucht Sokrates seine Lösung des Rätsels plausibel zu machen. Zur Erläuterung fasst er zunächst die schöpferische Tätigkeit der Dichter ins Auge. Sie ist nach seinem Verständnis ein gänzlich irrationaler Vorgang. Nicht die Beherrschung einer Technik macht den Dichter aus; kein Fachwissen ist die Grundlage der Poesie. Vielmehr erschafft der Dichter seine Werke, wenn eine göttliche Kraft ihn ergreift und in Begeisterung versetzt. Dann ist er leicht, beschwingt und heilig, und der Verstand \\"(nous)\\" wohnt nicht mehr in ihm. Solange er an seinem Verstand festhält, kann er nicht in diesen Zustand geraten und ist unfähig zu dichten. Der Dichter versteht selbst nicht, was er tut, wenn diese Inspiration ihn erfasst hat. Er ist nur ein Vermittler dessen, was die Gottheit ihm eingibt.', 'Sokrates stützt seine Theorie mit me: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Bei Kohleflözbränden kann dies auf natürlichem Wege geschehen, wenn das Flöz durch Gebirgsbildung und Erosion an die Erdoberfläche tritt. Auch werden solche Brände durch den Untertagebau verursacht, wenn Luft durch Bewetterung (Frischluftversorgung) an die Flöze gelangt. Häufig entstehen die Brände unter Tage in einem Alten Mann (verlassenen Hohlraum), in dem sich noch Restkohle befindet.', 'Kohlebrände können ebenfalls nach der Umlagerung der Kohle entstehen. Bekannt sind hier brennende Halden – Brände in Kohle- und Kokshalden, Brände in Abraumhalden, die noch genügend Restkohle, vor allem an vereinzelten Stellen mit erhöhter Konzentration enthalten – und Brände während des Transports von Kohle in Schiffen und in Eisenbahnwagen.', 'Solange die Reaktionstemperaturen im Bereich von ca. 150 bis 500 °C liegen, spricht man von \\"unvollständiger Verbrennung\\" oder \\"Schwelbrand\\". Diese Art der Verbrennung tritt bei Sauerstoffmangel auf.

Dort stammt der Sauerstoff aus der Bewetterung.', 'Spontane Kohlebrände.', 'Ursache spontaner Kohlebrände ist die Entzündlichkeit der Kohle. Bei einem Kohlebrand reagiert der Sauerstoff mit den Feststoffmolekülen des Brennstoffs. Diese exothermen Reaktionen finden bei allen Temperaturen statt. Die Geschwindigkeit ist jedoch stark temperaturabhängig, so steigt die Reaktionsrate mit zunehmender Temperatur annähernd exponentiell an. Wenn ein Brennstoff in zerkleinerter Form vorliegt, etwa als Feststoffschüttung, oder wenn der Feststoff porös ist, ist im gesamten System Sauerstoff vorhanden.', 'Eine unterkritische Lagerung erfolgt, wenn die im Schüttungsinneren freigesetzte Wärmeenergie kleiner ist als die Wärmeenergie, die durch Wärmeleitung an den Rand der Schüttung transportiert und über die Schüttungsoberfläche an die Umgebung abgegeben werden kann. Wird jedoch im Inneren der Feststoffschüttung mehr Wärmeenergie freigesetzt, als nach außen abgeführt werden kann, geht das System in einen kritischen Zustand über. Die Temperatur im Inneren steigt an, führt damit zu einer weiteren Erhöhung der Reaktionsrate und in der Folge zur Selbstentzündung.', 'Zwei wesentliche Faktoren entscheiden, ob eine Selbstentzündung erfolgt oder nicht, die Umgebungstemperatur und die Schüttungsgröße:', 'Die meistgenannte Kenngröße für den Start dieses Prozesses ist die \\"Selbstentzündungstemperatur\\" (SET). Sie ist keine „Stoffkonstante“, sondern immer abhängig von der Schüttungsgröße und -geometrie, insbesondere dem Verhältnis von Volumen zu Oberfläche und nimmt mit steigendem Schüttungsvolumen ab.', 'Natürlich ist die Selbstentzündungstemperatur auch von den Eigenschaften des jeweiligen Brennstoffes abhängig. Dazu zählen unter anderem der Brennwert, die Wärmeleitfähigkeit und die Korngröße. Ihre Angabe ist daher etwas heikel, da man immer die genauen Untersuchungsbedingungen angeben muss. Bei gleichen Bedingungen wird die Selbstentzündungstemperatur für Steinkohle höher liegen als die für Braunkohle.', 'Im Gegensatz zu einer „fassbaren“ Zündquelle, wie einer offenen Flamme oder einer heißen Oberfläche, läuft der Prozess der Selbstentzündung ohne fremde Einwirkung ab. Ist eine Schüttung hinreichend groß, kann dieser Prozess auch schon bei Temperaturen ablaufen, die im Bereich der Jahres-Mitteltemperatur eines Ortes liegen. Dies war zum Beispiel bei der sogenannten Senatsreserve in Berlin der Fall. Die dort auf Vorrat gehaltene Kohle war zum Teil überkritisch und entzündete sich demnach selbst. Dabei ist zu bemerken, dass die Induktionszeiten, also die Zeiten vom Beginn einer Lagerung bis zur Entzündung, umso kürzer werden, je größer die Schüttung und damit umso kleiner die Selbstentzündungstemperatur ist. Im Fall der Senatsreserve betrug die Induktionszeit mehrere Jahre.', 'Braunkohle kann schon bei Temperaturen von ca. 40 °C bis 60 °C spontan zu brennen beginnen, während dies bei der höchstwertigen Anthrazitkohle erst ab 140 °C möglich ist. Der Brand entsteht meist einige Dezimeter innerhalb der Kohle, in einer Tiefe, in der einerseits die Permeabilität der Kohle den Zutritt von Luft noch zulässt, andererseits die Durchlüftung die entstehende Wärme nicht größtenteils abführt. Die niedrige Wärmeleitfähigkeit der Kohle lässt eine Wärmeableitung ohne Fluidzirkulation nicht zu.', 'Faktoren, die die spontane Entzündung beeinflussen, sind unter anderem:', 'Die spontane Entzündung von Kohle braucht Zeit. Sie hängt von vielen Faktoren ab, unter anderem von der Umgebungstemperatur, aber auch von dem Volumen der Kohle, im Laborversuch also von der Probengröße (siehe dazu auch die erkannten Mechanismen der Heuselbstentzündung). Die Zeit bis zur Selbstentzündung ist ein weiteres Maß für die Entzündungsneigung der Kohle. Bei großen Kohlemengen, beispielsweise in situ, ist also zwar die notwendige minimale Umgebungstemperatur kleiner als bei kleinen Kohlemengen, anderseits dauert es sehr lange, üblicherweise Monate, bis sich eine Kohleprobe entzündet.', 'Wo ein Flöz nahe an der Erdoberfläche liegt, hat die Luft einen unmittelbaren und effektiveren Zutritt. Hier entstehen derartige Brände spontan und können jahrzehntelang brennen. Insgesamt werden auf der Welt mindestens 20 bis 30 Millionen Tonnen Kohle jährlich durch diese Brände vernichtet.

Dies gilt insbesondere für Brände unter Tage, aber auch für oberflächennahe Brände, soweit sie im Zusammenhang mit oberflächennahem Bergbau stehen. Mögliche Ursachen sind elektrische Betriebsmittel in unsachgemäßem Zustand, heißgelaufene Rollen von Förderbändern sowie Unachtsamkeit bei Spreng-, Schweiß- oder Schleifarbeiten.', 'In aller Regel spielt auch das Zurücklassen von Restkohle in abgebauten Flözteilen oder die Ansammlung von Kohlestaub in größeren Mengen eine Rolle. Eine konsequente Einhaltung der bergmännischen Vorschriften schließt derartige Fremdentzündungen aus.', 'Untertägige Kohleflözbrände können in Wechselwirkung mit Methanexplosionen oder Kohlestaubexplosionen stehen.

Je nach Kohlenart und -sorte ist dabei eine maximale Schütthöhe festgelegt.', 'In älteren Halden können oft noch erhebliche Mengen an Kohle enthalten sein. Großbritannien hatte erhebliche Probleme mit brennenden Halden. Diese sind jedoch inzwischen ausgegraben und begrünt. Die auch heute in Deutschland noch brennenden Halden werden teilweise aus der Luft mit Wärmebildgeräten überwacht. Diese vergleichsweise kleinen Brände werden durch Injektionen von Zement oder Anhydrit unterdrückt.', 'In Kohlenstaubanlagen wird Kohle mit einer Korngröße kleiner als 0,5 Millimeter verarbeitet. Auslöser eines Brandes ist dabei nur selten eine Selbstentzündung, sondern in der Regel eine fremdentzündete Staubexplosion. Hier sind die Brandschutzvorgaben der Berufsgenossenschaft sehr rigide. Derartige Anlagen werden oft unter dem Einsatz von Inertgas, zur Verringerung des vorhandenen Sauerstoffs, betrieben. Auf Schutz vor Funkenflug, hohen Temperaturen (max. 80 °C) und den Kohlenmonoxid-Wert zur Anzeige von Schwelbränden muss geachtet werden.', 'Kohlebrände beim Transport.', 'In der Zeit der Dampfschifffahrt kam es zu Bränden beim Transport von Kohle. Anfangs wurde die Kohle für die noch wenig verbreiteten Dampfschiffe auf Segelschiffen aus Holz transportiert. In der Zeit von 1871 bis 1880 kamen so 152 britische Schiffe zu Schaden, 68 waren Totalverluste und 84 wurden schwer beschädigt. Nach ersten wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen erkannte man den Zusammenhang, dass die Zahl der Brände mit zunehmender Reisedauer und mitgeführter Menge zunahm. Zwar wurde das erste Eisenschiff bereits 1838 gebaut, aber dieser Schiffstyp konnte sich nicht durchsetzen. Erst als nach 1881 die ersten Stahlschiffe in Großbritannien entstanden, verlor der Kohletransport einen Teil seiner Gefahr, weil die Kohle nun in nicht brennbaren Stahlbunkern transportiert werden konnte.', 'Ein Kohlebrand wird nach den seit 1976 erfolgten Untersuchungen zur Explosion des US-Schlachtschiffes \\"Maine\\" im Februar 1898 im Hafen von Havanna als Auslöser für die Entzündung der Schwarzpulvervorräte in der zum Kohlebunker benachbarten Munitionskammer angenommen.

Sie führt von der Landeshauptstadt Linz über die Bezirksstadt Eferding nach Neumarkt im Hausruckkreis. In Niederspaching zweigt eine Stichstrecke nach Peuerbach ab. Der seit 1908 bestehende, eigenständige Streckenteil Neumarkt – Waizenkirchen – Peuerbach wurde 1998 der Linzer Lokalbahn angegliedert. Mit einem modernen Fahrzeugpark werden jährlich etwa 1,6 Millionen Fahrgäste befördert. Die Lokalbahn ist die bedeutendste der von der Betreibergesellschaft Stern &amp; Hafferl unterhaltenen Bahnen. Sie erschließt das landwirtschaftlich und touristisch bedeutende Gebiet westlich der Stadt Linz an der Donau.', 'Seit 11. Dezember 2016 ist die Linzer Lokalbahn im Abschnitt Linz–Eferding als S 5 Teil der S-Bahn Oberösterreich.', 'Geschichte.', 'Anfänge.', 'Eines der frühesten Bahnprojekte nach Errichtung der wichtigsten Hauptstrecken in Oberösterreich hatte zum Ziel, die Regionen Eferding, Aschach, Waizenkirchen und Peuerbach mit der oberösterreichischen Landeshauptstadt Linz zu verbinden. Bereits Anfang der 1880er Jahre gab es Bestrebungen, eine solche Lokalbahn zu bauen. Nach Eröffnung der Westbahn folgten rasch weitere Planungen für von Wels ausgehende Lokalbahnen. Die Strecke Wels – Haiding – Aschach an der Donau wurde bereits am 20. August 1886 fertiggestellt. Die Betriebsführung dieser Bahn oblag der Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl aus Gmunden. Diese Lokalbahn zweigte von der Staatsbahn nach Passau bei der Station Haiding ab und verband das fruchtbare Eferdinger Becken und den Aschachwinkel mit dem österreichischen Staatsbahnnetz und der Stadt Wels.', 'Wegen dieser bereits vorhandenen Lokalbahn und Unstimmigkeiten zwischen Wels und Linz konnte das Projekt jahrelang nicht verwirklicht werden. Deshalb wurde ein Aktionskomitee unter dem Vorsitz des kaiserlichen Rats Mathias Poche gebildet. 24 weitere namhafte Persönlichkeiten, darunter auch der Linzer Bürgermeister und der Landeshauptmann-Stellvertreter, gehörten dem Komitee an, das sich zur Aufgabe stellte, eine Bahnverbindung zwischen der Landeshauptstadt Linz und Eferding herzustellen. Als Option wurde eine Verlängerung der Bahn nach Waizenkirchen und eventuell bis Neumarkt im Hausruckkreis mit einer Abzweigung nach Peuerbach ins Auge gefasst.', 'Nach vehementem Widerstand der Stadt Wels legte das Aktionskomitee einen Alternativplan vor, der eine von der Station Eferding abzweigende Lokalbahn über Haiding (bei Aschach) nach Aschach an der Donau in die eine Richtung und über Waizenkirchen nach Peuerbach in die andere Richtung vorsah – dagegen gab es keine Einwände. Am 6. und 7. Juli 1900 tagte das \\"Trassenrevision- und Stations-Comitee\\" über dieses Projekt, und, obwohl die Vertreter der Städte Wels und Linz dem Projekt zustimmten, scheiterte die Verwirklichung am Veto der \\"Welser Lokalbahngesellschaft\\". Vertreter von Waizenkirchen fassten daraufhin den Plan, eine von Eferding unabhängige Bahnverbindung zwischen Waizenkirchen und Neumarkt-Kallham entlang der Staatsbahnlinie Wels–Passau mit einer Abzweigung nach Peuerbach zu bauen. Zur Projektausarbeitung wurde wiederum ein eigenes Komitee ins Leben gerufen. Da es gegen dieses Projekt keinerlei Einwände gab, erteilten die Behörden am 13. Oktober 1907 eine Konzession für den \\"„Bau einer mit elektrischer Kraft zu betreibenden normalspurigen Lokalbahn, von der Staatsbahnstation Neumarkt-Kallham nach Waizenkirchen, mit einer Abzweigung nach Peuerbach“\\".', 'Lokalbahn Neumarkt–Waizenkirchen–Peuerbach.', 'Diese Konzession führte noch im selben Jahr zur Gründung der \\"Neumarkt–Waizenkirchen–Peuerbach AG\\". Der Bau der Bahn begann ein Jahr später im Mai 1908. Die Projektierung und Bauleitung führte die Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl aus, die in Waizenkirchen, Peuerbach und Niederspaching Stationsgebäude errichten ließ. In Niederspaching und Peuerbach wurde jeweils eine Fahrzeugremise errichtet. Die Stromversorgung wurde durch ein in Niederspaching errichtetes Umformerwerk gesichert. Die gesamte elektrische Ausrüstung dieser Lokalbahn lieferte die AEG-Union. Alle für die Betriebsaufnahme gebauten Fahrzeuge stammten von der Grazer Waggonfabrik. Nach mehreren Monaten Bauzeit konnte die Bahn am 18. Dezember 1908 eröffnet werden.', '1919 war eine Fortsetzung der Strecke von Peuerbach nach Neukirchen am Walde sowie nach Engelhartszell geplant. Hr. Fuchsing aus Schärding gründete ein Aktionskomitee, um diesen Ausbau zu verwirklichen. Am 24. Februar 1927 fand eine Versammlung mit etwa 300 Teilnehmern statt. Da die für den Ausbau erforderlichen Geldmittel nicht aufgebracht werden konnten, wurde dieses Projekt nicht realisiert.', 'Lokalbahn Linz–Eferding–Waizenkirchen.', '1907 tagte das Aktionskomitee, das für den Bau des eigentlichen Lokalbahnprojektes ins Leben gerufen worden war, erneut. Ingenieur Josef Stern erreichte dabei, dass statt des ursprünglich geplanten Dampfbetriebs die Strecke elektrisch betrieben werden sollte, und erklärte sich bereit, hierüber ein Detailprojekt auf eigenes Risiko und eigene Kosten auszuarbeiten. Dieses Projekt erhielt nach einer Überprüfung der k.k. Staatsbahn-Direktion Linz ein Baukapital von 3,5 Mio. Kronen (knapp 9,5 Mio. Euro). Die Vorschläge von Josef Stern wurden bei einer Sitzung am 4. Mai 1909 angenommen und ein Finanzierungsplan mit dem Ziel erstellt, die Bahn ohne staatliche Subventionen betreiben zu können. Darüber hinaus sollte die Finanzierung mit einer Anleihe von 1,2 Mio. Kronen, Stammaktien um 200.000 Kronen sowie Prioritätsaktien im Wert von 2,1 Mio. Kronen erfolgen. Die Stadt Linz kaufte nach dem Gemeinderatsbeschluss vom 17. November 1909 Prioritätsaktien im Wert von 1,5 Mio. Kronen. Weitere Aktien wurden von verschiedenen angrenzenden Orten und der Allgemeinen Sparkasse Linz erworben. Der Landtag unterstützte die Bahn mit dem Kauf von Stammaktien im Umfang von 200.000 Kronen.', 'Die Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl erklärte sich bereit, den Bau der Bahn zu übernehmen und den Betrieb zwölf Jahre lang gegen eine Zahlung von 50 Heller pro Zugkilometer zu führen. Somit waren alle Bedingungen für eine Konzessionserteilung beim k.k. Eisenbahnministerium erfüllt.', 'Vom 6. bis 17. Oktober sowie vom 9. bis 15. Dezember 1908 wurde eine politische Begehung durchgeführt. Zwei Jahre nach dieser Begehung ordnete das Eisenbahnministerium die Konzessionsverhandlungen an.', 'Bahnbau und Eröffnung.', 'Nachdem am 12. Jänner 1911 die im Reichsgesetzblatt vom 25. Jänner 1911 verlautbarte Konzession zum Bau und Betrieb „der normalspurigen Lokalbahn von Linz über Eferding nach Waizenkirchen“ erteilt worden war, begann am 1. Dezember desselben Jahres der Bau der Lokalbahn.', 'Die Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl gab Obligationen im Wert von 1,2 Mio. Kronen in Zahlung, neben denen auch noch einige Prioritätsaktien gekauft wurden. Die Obligationen wandelte man nach der Eröffnung der Lokalbahn in Aktien um. Das knappe Investitionskapital zwang die Bauleitung unter Ingenieur Josef Stern, den Bau so sparsam wie möglich durchzuführen. Deshalb wurde der Ausgangspunkt der Lokalbahn in Linz, die \\"Lokalbahnstation\\", auf Pachtgrund der Staatsbahn errichtet. Es entstand ein Kopfbahnhof mit zwei Bahnsteiggleisen und einem Nebengleis. Diese als Provisorium gedachte Anlage hielt sich bemerkenswerterweise bis 2005. Nach der polizeitechnischen Überprüfung am 22. Dezember 1911 konnte das erste Teilstück Linz – Eferding am 21. März 1912 in Betrieb genommen werden. Eine offizielle feierliche Einweihung gab es nicht. Weitere Bahnhöfe wurden in Alkoven, Eferding, Prambachkirchen und Waizenkirchen errichtet. An 15 Haltestellen entstanden zudem hölzerne Wartehäuschen.', 'Umformerwerke in Dörnbach, Eferding und Waizenkirchen sicherten die Versorgung der Bahn mit Gleichstrom mit einer Spannung von 750 V. Eine Remise mit Werkstätte für Wartungen und Reparaturen an den Triebfahrzeugen entstand in Eferding. Auf der gesamten Strecke wurden Vignolschienen auf Holzschwellen verlegt und Holzmasten zum Tragen der Oberleitung aufgestellt. Die gesamte elektrische Ausrüstung stammte von den Siemens-Schuckertwerken in Wien. Die Strecke war ursprünglich für eine Achslast von maximal 11 Tonnen und einer Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 30 km/h ausgelegt.', 'Der weiterführende Bau des Teilstücks Eferding – Waizenkirchen kam nicht ganz reibungslos voran. Ein verregneter Sommer und schwieriges Terrain bescherten viele Probleme. Trotz dieser Schwierigkeiten konnte das Teilstück termingerecht fertiggestellt werden. Die behördliche Überprüfung fand am 10. Dezember 1912 statt.', 'Die Linzer Tages-Post blickte in einer Ausgabe vom 13. Dezember 1912 auf den Bau zurück und berichtete über die Fertigstellung:', 'Betrieb in den Anfangsjahren.', 'Für den Betrieb der Bahn wurden vier Motorwagen, vier Beiwagen, vier Arbeitswagen, 16 Güterwagen und eine Elektrolokomotive bei der \\"Grazer Waggonfabrik\\" in Auftrag gegeben.

Demnach kostete eine einfache Fahrt von Linz nach Eferding 1,50 Kronen, bis Waizenkirchen 2,50 Kronen (beides in der 3. Klasse). Für die 2. Klasse musste man den doppelten Preis bezahlen. Eine Hin- und Rückfahrt kostete das Doppelte einer einfachen Fahrt. Beim Güterverkehr gab es zahlreiche verschiedene Frachtxadklassen. Der Transport einer Wagenladung Holz oder Steine nach Eferding kostete 32 Kronen.

Francis de Hoffman gelang es, viele der Physiker, die während des Zweiten Weltkrieges in Los Alamos tätig waren, für eine Tätigkeit bei General Atomics zu gewinnen. Er bot ihnen eine Arbeitsatmosphäre, in der die Wissenschaftler wie in Los Alamos schöpferisch an eigenen Ideen arbeiten konnten, ohne durch Bürokratie gehemmt zu sein. Zu diesen Physikern gehörte Ted Taylor, der seinerseits Freeman Dyson überzeugen konnte, für ein Jahr bei General Atomics zu arbeiten.', 'Zusammen entwickelten sie zunächst den TRIGA-Reaktor, wandten sich dann aber dem gemeinsamen Traum der friedlichen Erforschung des Sonnensystems zu. Taylor war in Los Alamos mit den Ideen Ulams in Berührung gekommen, und so begannen er und Dyson sich mit ersten Entwürfen eines Raumschiffes mit nuklearem Pulsantrieb zu beschäftigen. Unter dem ehrgeizigen Motto „Zum Mars bis 1965, zum Saturn bis 1970“ planten Taylor und Dyson Missionen zur Erforschung des Sonnensystems.', 'Die ersten Entwürfe sahen ein 60 Meter hohes, wie ein Geschoss geformtes Raumschiff mit einer Prallplatte von 40 m Durchmesser vor. Das Raumschiff mit einer Masse von 4000 t sollte eine Nutzlast von 1600 t in den Orbit befördern und vom Boden aus in Jackass Flats, einem Teil der Nevada Test Site, starten. Es sollte 2600 Treibladungen tragen, von diesen wären etwa 800 Treibladungen mit einer Sprengkraft zwischen 0,15 kt und 5 kt nötig gewesen, um den Orbit zu erreichen, die verbleibenden Treibladungen hätten eine Rundreise zum Mars und sogar Saturn ermöglicht.', 'Ausgelöst durch den Sputnikschock wurde im Februar 1958 die \\"Advanced Research Projects Agency\\" (\\"ARPA\\", eine Behörde des Verteidigungsministeriums der Vereinigten Staaten, die Forschungs-Projekte durchführt) gegründet.

Die Air Force sah in Orion keine zukünftige Waffe, die NASA hatte die Entscheidung getroffen, dass ihr ziviles Raumfahrtprogramm nicht-nuklear sein und nicht der Geheimhaltung unterliegen sollte. Das Orion-Projekt verblieb so als einziges Raumfahrtprojekt bei der ARPA.', 'Als für die Finanzierung hinderlich stellte sich heraus, dass viele Budgetverantwortliche das Projekt für „verrückt“ hielten. Sie konnten nicht glauben, dass es möglich war, ein Fahrzeug mit Explosionen anzutreiben, ohne dass dieses dabei beschädigt oder zerstört wird.', 'Um die grundsätzliche technische Machbarkeit eines explosionsgetriebenen Fahrzeuges zu zeigen, wurde deshalb ein Modell mit einer Prallplatte von einem Meter Durchmesser gebaut, der sogenannte \\"Hot-Rod\\" oder \\"Putt-Putt\\". Das Fiberglas-Modell mit 120 kg Gewicht stieß nacheinander bis zu sechs ca. ein Kilogramm schwere Treibladungen aus C4 aus. Mit diesem Modell gelang am 14. November 1959 ein Flug mit einer Gipfelhöhe von 56 m, zwei Tage später wurde sogar eine Flughöhe von etwa 100 m erreicht. Ein Film über die erfolgreichen Flugversuche half in der Folge die weitere Finanzierung zu sichern. Eines der Modelle befindet sich heute im National Air and Space Museum der Smithsonian Institution.', 'Die Flugversuche mit den Modellen erbrachten Kenntnisse, die direkt für die weitere Entwicklung nützlich waren, zum Beispiel welche Form die Prallplatte haben musste, um ein günstiges Verhältnis von Gewicht und Stabilität zu erreichen. Außerdem ergaben die Flugversuche, dass zumindest durch die Temperaturen und Drücke, die mit konventionellen Sprengstoffen erreicht werden konnten, keine Materialabtragungen (Ablation) an der Oberfläche der Prallplatte zu erwarten waren. Die Ablation wurde bei weiteren Experimenten mit Plasma-Generatoren, die das Bombenplasma simulieren sollten, weiter untersucht.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der Air Force.', 'Die ARPA entschied Ende 1959, das Orion-Projekt aus Gründen nationaler Sicherheit nicht weiter zu unterstützen. Die US Air Force übernahm daraufhin das Projekt, allerdings nur unter der Voraussetzung, dass militärische Anwendungen gefunden würden. Das stand aber gegen die eigentlich angestrebte friedliche Nutzung des Projekts.', 'Militärisch sollten kleine Orions jetzt wie eine moderne Interkontinentalrakete mit Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) genutzt werden. Sie sollten aus Silos starten, bis über das Zielgebiet fliegen und dort zunächst eine große Menge Täuschkörper abwerfen. Erst wenn die feindliche Verteidigung durch die Täuschkörper überlastet wäre, sollten die eigentlichen Gefechtsköpfe gestartet werden. Ein anderer Vorschlag sah große Orion-Raumschiffe vor, die mit einem ähnlichen Missionsprofil wie die modernen strategischen U-Boote im tiefen Raum patrouillieren sollten.', 'Die militärischen Möglichkeiten wurden von einigen Militärs durchaus ernst genommen. Der Kalte Krieg war in vollem Gange, das atomare Wettrüsten hatte begonnen. Thomas Power, der Leiter des Strategic Air Command, war gar der Meinung, dass „wer immer Orion kontrolliert, die Welt kontrolliere“. Auf seine Veranlassung wurde im März 1962 das Modell eines militärischen Orion-Raumschiffes unter voller Bewaffnung gebaut. Dieses „Schlachtschiff“ sollte unter anderem eine Bewaffnung von 500 Sprengköpfen tragen. Man führte das Modell Präsident John F. Kennedy vor, als dieser die Vandenberg Air Force Base besuchte. Kennedy war davon geschockt und versagte dem Projekt die nötige politische Unterstützung. Mitten im Kalten Krieg wollte Kennedy kein nukleares Wettrüsten im Weltraum riskieren.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der NASA.', 'Die weitere Entwicklung des Orion-Projekts bei der Air Force wurde von Verteidigungsminister Robert McNamara verhindert. Er sah Orion nicht als militärisches Projekt und verweigerte deshalb eine erweiterte Finanzierung, ohne die der Bau eines Prototyps nicht möglich war. Um das Projekt doch noch über den Status einer Machbarkeitsstudie hinaus zu bringen, wandten sich Taylor und Dyson deshalb an die NASA, von der sie sich zusätzliche Mittel erhofften.', 'Die Entwürfe wurden den Voraussetzungen bei der NASA angepasst. Von einem Bodenstart wollte man absehen, da dieser zu „schmutzig“ gewesen wäre, um ohne massive Proteste der Öffentlichkeit stattfinden zu können. Stattdessen passte man die Größe der Orion-Schiffe an die verfügbaren Trägerraketen an – das an die Saturn-Raketen angepasste Orion-Design hatte jetzt eine Prallplatte mit zehn Meter Durchmesser. Eine Variante (\\"Lofting\\") sah vor, eine Saturn-1C-Stufe als Booster zu benutzen. Diese sollte das Orion-Raumschiff in eine Höhe bringen, in der das gefahrlose Zünden des nuklearen Pulsantriebes möglich war.

Die Melodien des Werkes sind mittlerweile weltberühmt. „Rhapsodie“ bedeutet ursprünglich „vorgetragenes Gedicht“ und bezeichnet heute ein Musikstück ohne kategorische Zuordnung. Wegen seiner Mischung der Musikstile ist die „Rhapsodie in Blau“ daher treffend bezeichnet.', 'Entstehungsgeschichte.', 'Der Bandleader Paul Whiteman hatte schon am 1. November 1923, rund vier Monate vor der Uraufführung, ein Konzert in der Aeolian Hall veranstaltet, das Jazz und Klassik einander gegenüberstellte. Es war ein passabler Erfolg, so dass Whiteman beschloss, ein noch ambitionierteres Projekt in Angriff zu nehmen. Dieses sollte am 12. Februar 1924 stattfinden. Whiteman forderte Gershwin auf, dafür ein Jazzstück für Orchester zu schreiben. Dieser lehnte zuerst ab mit Hinweis auf Terminprobleme und vermutlich, weil er im Komponieren für klassisches Orchester wenig Erfahrung besaß. Erst als Whiteman Gershwin auf eigene Faust auf die Programmliste setzte, komponierte er das Stück schließlich doch.', 'Whiteman und Gershwin hatten bereits bei der höchst erfolgreichen Broadway-Revue \\"George White’s Scandals\\" zusammengearbeitet, die auf Motiven von Gershwins – zumindest in kommerzieller Hinsicht erfolgloser – Jazz-Oper \\"Blue Monday\\" basierte.

Januar, eine Probevorstellung seines neuen Musicals \\"Sweet Little Devil\\" geben und eventuellen Änderungswünschen vor der Premiere am 21. Januar nachkommen musste.', 'Am Abend des 3. Januar 1924 spielte Gershwin mit seinem Freund und Kollegen Buddy DeSylva in der Nähe des Broadway Billard, während sein Bruder Ira Gershwin die Ausgabe des nächsten Tages des New York Tribune las. In einem Artikel mit der Überschrift “What Is American Music?” (\\"Was macht amerikanische Musik aus?\\") über das Konzert von Whiteman wurde angekündigt, dass George Gershwin an einer Jazzkomposition für diese Vorstellung arbeite.', 'Bei einem Telefonat mit Gershwin am nächsten Morgen erklärte Whiteman, dass sein Rivale Vincent Lopez ihm die Idee seines experimentellen Konzertes stehlen wolle und deshalb keine Zeit mit Diskussionen zu verlieren sei. Gershwin ließ sich schließlich zur Komposition überreden. Da nur noch fünf Wochen Zeit bis zur Aufführung waren, begann er umgehend damit und arbeitete einige Wochen unter Hochdruck daran, bevor er sie Whitemans Arrangeur Ferde Grofé übergab.', 'Das erste Manuskript für zwei Klaviere ist auf den 7. Januar 1924 datiert. Es enthält Bemerkungen zur Instrumentation, bei denen nicht die Instrumente, sondern die Namen der Solisten eingetragen sind. Grofé instrumentierte das Werk anscheinend mit Rücksicht auf die individuelle Stilistik, Stärken und Techniken der einzelnen Orchestermitglieder. Am 4. Februar 1924, acht Tage vor der Premiere, beendete er die Orchestrierung.', 'Der Arbeitstitel des Stückes war \\"American Rhapsody\\". Ira Gershwin schlug den Namen \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" vor, nachdem er eine Ausstellung von James McNeill Whistler besucht hatte, der seinen Kunstwerken oft Namen wie \\"Symphony in White\\" oder \\"Arrangement in Grey and Black\\" gab.', 'Den berühmten Beginn der Rhapsodie hatte Gershwin ursprünglich übrigens als Triller mit einem rasch aufsteigenden, aus 17 Noten bestehenden Tonleiterlauf komponiert. Whitemans Klarinettist Ross Gorman spielte die letzte Hälfte der Skala während einer Probe als Glissando. Als Gershwin das hörte, entschloss er sich, diese Variante für die Partitur zu übernehmen. Den entsprechenden Klarinettenpart trug bei der Premiere allerdings nicht Gorman, sondern Chester Hazlett vor.', 'Der breite, melodisch betonte Mittelteil (ab Takt 303 ) wurde auf Anregung von Ira Gershwin, der aus Georges Skizzenbuch ein geeignetes Thema auswählte, in die Komposition aufgenommen.', 'Die Aufführung selbst gestaltete Paul Whiteman und sein \\"Palais Royal Orchestra\\". Das Konzert sollte im Rahmen eines Musikabends unter dem Titel \\"An Experiment in Modern Music\\" („Ein Experiment in moderner Musik“) geboten werden. Namhafte Musiker, darunter Strawinski, Rachmaninow, Leopold Stokowski, Jascha Heifetz und Fritz Kreisler, Musikkritiker und Intellektuelle waren erschienen, um es sich anzuhören. 26 verschiedene Stücke wurden aufgeführt, darunter Edward Elgars \\"Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1\\" und heute kaum noch bekannte Kompositionen wie \\"True form of Jazz\\" und \\"Contrast: legitimate scoring vs. jazzing\\".', '\\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" war das vorletzte Stück. Bis dahin war das Publikum schon äußerst unruhig, da sich viele Werke ähnlich angehört hatten und obendrein das Lüftungssystem der Aeolian Hall ausgefallen war. Heute gilt der Abend aufgrund der Premiere der hier besprochenen Komposition als legendär. Gershwin spielte den Klavierpart selbst. Da er keine ausnotierte Klavierpartitur besaß und Grofé ihm wegen des Zeitdrucks nur eine Bandpartitur mit den hingekritzelten Worten \\"Wait for nods\\" („Warte, bis dir einer zunickt“) aushändigen konnte, ist die Version der Uraufführung heute nicht mehr zu rekonstruieren.', 'Pressestimmen zur Uraufführung.', '\\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" bekam sehr gegensätzliche Kritiken.

Manche spielten in dem Stück vier Instrumente.', 'Die Partitur von 1942 ist für Soloklavier, zwei Flöten, zwei Oboen, zwei Klarinetten, Bassklarinette, zwei Fagotte, drei Hörner, drei Trompeten, drei Posaunen, Tuba, Timpani, Percussion (Cymbal, Snare Bassdrum, Triangel, Gong und Glocken), Klavier, zwei Altsaxophone, Tenorsaxophon, Banjo und eine Streichergruppe (Violinen, Bratschen, Cello und Kontrabass) gesetzt. In der heutigen Aufführungspraxis wird die 2. Altsaxophonstimme „3rd Saxophone (E flat Alto)“ jedoch in der Regel mit einem Baritonsaxophon besetzt. Dies liegt unter anderem daran, dass die beiden Altsaxophonstimmen bei den meisten Passagen des Stückes unisono geschrieben sind (siehe auch Notenbeispiel weiter unten). Durch den Einsatz eines Baritonsaxophons wird hier eine Doppelung vermieden.', '2017 entstand eine neue Instrumentierung des Werkes auf Basis der Grofé-Partitur.

Jahrhunderts wurde der Einfluss des Jazz auf die Arbeit bedeutender Komponisten erkennbar. Dies stand im Zusammenhang mit Tendenzen der Kunstmusik seit 1910: Neoklassizistischen Tendenzen, vertreten etwa durch Strawinski, stand die Neue Musik mit ihrem Vorreiter Arnold Schönberg gegenüber. Beiden – der Zwölftonmusik wohl etwas mehr als der zwar experimentierfreudigen, aber dennoch tonalen Musik der Neoklassizisten – drohten die Hörer verloren zu gehen. Ihr Kreis schrumpfte mehr und mehr auf eine kleine Gemeinde hochspezialisierter Experten.', 'So beschrieb Hermann Danuser in seinem Band \\"Die Musik des 20. Jahrhunderts\\" das Paradox, dass gerade die eigentlich moderne Musik „im Zuge einer tief greifenden Krise in den Augen mancher – und nicht nur in Kreisen der Jugend – zu einem fragwürdigen Teil einer ‚Welt von gestern‘ geworden war.“', 'Joachim Ernst Berendt attestierte den Jazzhörern noch 1953 „ein starkes, lebendiges Gefühl für die Verlogenheit und Getrübtheit, für die Formelhaftigkeit und Indirektheit, kurzerhand für die ‚Spätheit’ unserer Epoche“ und folgerte daraus: „Aus diesem Gefühl heraus sehnt man sich nach etwas Direktem und Ursprünglichen, etwas Lebendigem und Mitreißendem. Das gibt die Jazzmusik.“ Dieses Zitat deutet aber bereits auf die Problematik einer Komposition hin, die Jazzelemente beinhaltet: Begriffe wie Direktheit und Lebendigkeit bis hin zur Emphase sind eng mit der Improvisation verbunden. Dieses wichtige Ausdrucksmittel des Jazz war von den Kunstansprüchen der konzipierten klassischen Musik von vornherein ausgeschlossen.', 'Nun wollten die wenigsten Komponisten, auch nicht Gershwin, echten, spontan improvisierten Jazz schaffen. Vielmehr wichen sie von diesem Modell ab, um die geforderte Stilhöhendifferenz zur Kunstmusik zu überwinden und damit der damaligen Kunstauffassung gerecht zu werden. Zudem lernte Gershwin den Jazz in den 1920er-Jahren in New York wohl schon in der kommerzialisierten Form des \\"Sweet\\" („süß“, aber auch „bequem“, „glatt“) kennen. Diese Stilrichtung vertrat neben Whiteman vor allem der heute fast vergessene Bandleader Guy Lombardo. Er strebte an, dem Jazz seine ursprüngliche „Härte“, „Rohheit“ und „Unordnung“ zu nehmen ( siehe Weblinks) und ihn damit für ein gehobenes, vornehmlich weißes Hörerpublikum attraktiver zu machen.', 'Dem entsprach der Kommentar im Programmheft zur Premiere von \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" von Hugh C. Ernst:', 'George Gershwin als Vorreiter des Third Stream.', 'Gunther Schuller erfand in den 1950er-Jahren den Theoriebegriff \\"Third Stream\\" für die Synthese von Kunstmusik und Jazz. Diesen bezogen dann auch Komponisten wie George Russell und John Lewis auf ihre Musik. Die Idee existierte jedoch schon früher und beschäftigte auch Claude Debussy oder Darius Milhaud.

Sie wurde von dem späthellenistischen König Antiochos I. Theos (69–36 v. Chr.) von Kommagene errichtet, der dafür den Begriff Hierothesion () prägte. Das Heiligtum sollte Zentrum einer neuen Religion sein, die persische und griechische Mythologie vereinte. Antiochos selbst gab sich kurz nach seiner Krönung den Namenszusatz \\"Theos\\" (Gott), eine auch im Rahmen des hellenistischen Herrscherkultes ungewöhnliche Selbstvergöttlichung. In zwei langen griechischen Inschriften legte der König fest, wie genau er zu Lebzeiten und nach seinem Tod verehrt werden sollte. Seine Abstammung führte er väterlicherseits auf die achämenidischen Großkönige Dareios I. und Xerxes I. und mütterlicherseits auf die Seleukiden mit Alexander dem Großen als Ahnherren zurück.', 'Die Kultstätte wurde 1881 vom deutschen Ingenieur Karl Sester wiederentdeckt. Seitdem führten türkische, amerikanische und deutsche Archäologen hier Ausgrabungen durch. Die ersten Erforscher des Hierothesions waren 1882/83 Otto Puchstein und Carl Humann, ihnen folgte in den 1950er und 1960er Jahren ein deutsch-amerikanisches Ausgrabungsteam mit Friedrich Karl Dörner und Theresa Goell von den \\"American Schools of Oriental Research\\". 1987 wurde das Grabheiligtum in die UNESCO-Liste des Welterbes aufgenommen.

Der Schotterhügel ist umgeben von drei Terrassen im Norden, Westen und Osten. Auf der westlichen und östlichen Terrasse sind große Götterstatuen zu sehen, die König Antiochos in Gesellschaft von griechisch-persischen Göttern darstellen. Dazu kommen verschiedene Reihen von Reliefstelen, die die Ahnengalerie des Königs und andere Verwandte darstellen, sowie Abbildungen von rituellen Handlungen. Um Platz für die Errichtung des Heiligtums zu schaffen, wurden rund 300.000 m³ massiver Fels bewegt. Auf den Berg führen Prozessionswege aus drei Richtungen.', 'Im Laufe der Zeit haben Erdbeben, Unwetter und zahlreiche Besucher dazu beigetragen, dass ein großer Teil der Reliefs zerstört und die einstmals 8–10 m hohen Statuen heute kopflos sind. Die Häupter sind vor den Statuen aufgestellt. Im Hügel wird eine Grabkammer vermutet, die allerdings ungeachtet vieler Versuche, in das Innere des Hügels vorzudringen, bis heute nicht nachgewiesen wurde.', 'Die Monumentalstatuen mit dem Altar und den Reliefs bieten, besonders bei Sonnenauf- und -untergang, ein beeindruckendes Bild.

Über letztere führen Passstraßen in die Gegend von Malatya, die militärisch und als Karawanenwege genutzt wurden und zum Teil noch heute in Gebrauch sind. Auch wenn einige Berge des Grenzgebirges im Nordwesten höher sind, ist der Nemrut Dağı eine aus fast allen Richtungen sichtbare Landmarke. Er überblickt nach Südosten Nordmesopotamien und das Euphrattal, nach Südwesten den Fluss \\"Kahta Çayı\\" (auch \\"Cendere Çayı,\\" antiker Name Chabinas) und Adıyaman sowie nach Süden das heute im Atatürk-Stausee verschwundene Samosata und den Euphratübergang bei Zeugma. Von der südwestlich gelegenen Residenzstadt Arsameia am Nymphaios führte ein Prozessionsweg zum Nemrut Dağı.', 'Heute erreicht man den Nemrut Dağı von Kahta aus über die D-360, von der bei Narince eine beschilderte Straße nach Norden abzweigt. Sie ist zunächst asphaltiert, im letzten, steilen Teil dann gepflastert und führt bis zu einem Parkplatz mit einem Touristenzentrum unterhalb des Gipfels, von wo aus die Terrassen mit den Monumentalstatuen nach einem Aufstieg von etwa 25 Minuten zu erreichen sind.', 'Geologie.', 'Die Formationen der Ankar Dağları entstanden im Laufe der Gebirgsbildung aus zahlreichen verschiedenen Gesteinsarten. Für den Gipfel und die nähere Umgebung des Nemrut Dağı waren dabei nur eozäne Kalksteine ausschlaggebend. Dieser Entstehungsprozess begann vor über 35 Millionen Jahren im Eozän und setzte sich im Oligozän fort. Die schroffe Landschaft am Fuß des Berges entstand in dieser Zeit und im nachfolgenden Pliozän durch Verwitterung. Die aufgefalteten Kalksteinschichten treten an den Hängen des Nemrut in Form von Durchbrüchen zu Tage, in den tieferen Zonen sind sie vom Oberboden bedeckt. Im Südosten finden sich dabei typische Formen einer Karstoberfläche. Dazu gehören Senken, die durch eingebrochene, unter dem Mutterboden entstandene Hohlräume im Kalkstein entstanden sind und die der Vermessungs-Ingenieur in Goells Team Heinrich Brokamp, der eine topographische Karte des Berges erstellte, als \\"Ice caves\\" (Eishöhlen) bezeichnet. Dort halten sich das Jahr über Reste von verfestigtem Firnschnee, die im Sommer Tieren zur Tränke dienen.', 'Im Nordosten, etwa zwei Kilometer hangabwärts, treten einzelne Schichten von grau-grünem Sandstein auf. Sie liegen, im Gegensatz zu den schräg aufgeschobenen Kalksteinplatten, waagrecht. Das hat zur Folge, dass an dieser Schnittstelle der beiden Gesteinsarten eine Quelle entspringt, die schon in hellenistischer Zeit, aber auch noch heute, der Wasserversorgung dient.', 'Die Handwerker, die das Heiligtum auf dem Berggipfel erstellten, verwendeten dazu nur Steine aus der direkten Umgebung. Neben Sandstein aus der Umgebung der Quelle kam Kalkstein zum Einsatz, der aus den Durchbrüchen an den Berghängen gebrochen wurde. Möglicherweise wurde auch Material von der abgetragenen Spitze des Berges verarbeitet.', 'Flora und Fauna.', 'Zur kargen Vegetation der Hochgebirgslandschaft gehören weder Bäume noch Sträucher. In einer Untersuchung von Ahmet Zafer von 2009 wurden 250 Arten von Samenpflanzen gezählt, darunter 14 % Korbblütler, 10 % Lippenblütler, 9,2 % Süßgräser, 7,6 % Kreuzblütler und 7,2 % Hülsenfrüchtler. Zur Tierwelt des Nationalparks gehören Bär-, Wolf-, Schakal-, Fuchs- und Dachsarten. Unter den Vogelarten, die beobachtet werden können, sind der Weißkehlsänger, der Steinschmätzer, der Mittelsteinschmätzer und der Rostbürzelsteinschmätzer, weiterhin Schneefink, Ohrenlerche und Brachpieper.', 'Forschungsgeschichte.', 'Der Nemrut Dağı wurde bereits im frühen 19. Jahrhundert durch Helmuth von Moltke kartiert, der als Militärberater im Osmanischen Reich weilte. Obwohl er den Zeugnissen der Antike durchaus Aufmerksamkeit widmete und den Berg als Landmarke bei seinen Landaufnahmen benutzte, war ihm das Heiligtum auf dem Gipfel entgangen. 1881 berichtete der Straßenbauingenieur Karl Sester in einem Brief an die Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin von assyrischen Monumenten auf dem Berg. Der Archäologe Otto Puchstein wurde daraufhin 1882 von Alexander Conze, dem Generalsekretär des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, im Namen der Akademie beauftragt, mit dem Ingenieur zum Nemrut Dağı zu reisen. Am 4. Mai 1882 trafen sie erstmals auf dem Berg ein, den sie noch mit tiefem Schnee bedeckt fanden. Puchstein fand dennoch die griechische Inschrift auf der Rückseite der Statuen und begann mit der Abschrift. Wegen der Witterung, die ihre Untersuchungen behinderte, reisten sie bald wieder ab und Puchstein kehrte im Juni desselben Jahres zurück. Am 19. Oktober gab er vor der philosophisch-historischen Klasse der Akademie einen Bericht ab. Im folgenden Jahr reiste Carl Humann im Auftrag der Akademie in Begleitung von Puchstein und Felix von Luschan zum Nemrut Dağı. Vom 8. bis 23. Juni 1883 erstellten sie Zeichnungen und Photographien der Monumente und brachten zahlreiche Gipsabdrücke nach Berlin in die Königlichen Museen. Auf ihrem Weg besuchten und erforschten sie auch andere Orte der Kommagene, darunter die Hierothesia von Karakuş und Sesönk, Samosata, Perrhe sowie die späthethitischen Fundstätten von Sakçagözü und Zincirli. Der türkische Archäologe Osman Hamdi Bey, der von der Unternehmung erfahren hatte und ebenfalls Kommagene kennenlernen wollte, war bereits im Mai, in Begleitung des Bildhauers Osgan Efendi, auf dem Berg und hatte trotz hohen Schnees Forschungsarbeiten durchgeführt. Ihren Bericht \\"Le tumulus de Nemroud-Dagh: Voyages, description, inscriptions\\" gab das von Osman Hamdi Bey begründete Kaiserlich-Ottomanische Museum im Herbst 1883 heraus. Die Forschungsergebnisse Humanns und Puchsteins erschienen 1890 unter dem Titel \\"Reisen in Kleinasien und Nordsyrien\\".', 'Der deutsche Althistoriker Friedrich Karl Dörner brach 1938 mit dem Bauforscher und Architekten Rudolf Naumann zu einer Forschungsreise durch die Landschaft Kommagene auf und besuchte dabei das Heiligtum, konnte aber seine geplanten Arbeiten wegen des Ausbruchs des Zweiten Weltkriegs zunächst nicht fortsetzen.

Das mit einem Überrollbügel und festen Türrahmen ausgestattete Fahrzeug gilt als eines der ersten Sicherheitscabriolets; es wird in der Literatur auch als „Targa auf Englisch“ bezeichnet. Die Karosserie des Stag ist ein Entwurf des Turiner Designers Giovanni Michelotti. Der Stag wird von einem eigens für ihn entwickelten Achtzylinder-Ottomotor angetrieben, dessen Standfestigkeit anfangs problematisch war. Das in seiner achtjährigen Produktionszeit kaum weiterentwickelte Auto war kein Erfolg. Zwischen 1970 und 1977 entstanden weniger als 26.000 Exemplare.', 'Entwicklungsgeschichte.', 'Die Entwicklung des Triumph Stag fiel in eine Phase größerer, auf politischer Ebene initiierter Umstrukturierungen innerhalb der britischen Automobilindustrie. Die mit diesem Prozess verbundenen Reibungsverluste werden in der rückblickenden Literatur als wesentliche Gründe für die unvollkommene technische Entwicklung und den Misserfolg des Stag genannt. Aus heutiger Sicht besteht der Eindruck, der Stag sei „mehr zufällig als geplant“ und „in einem Umfeld von versteckten Fallen und fatalen Fehlern, von Fusion und Konfusion“ entstanden.', 'Unternehmenspolitisches Umfeld.', 'Das 1896 als Fahrradhersteller gegründete Unternehmen Triumph gehörte ab 1944 zur Standard Motor Company, die ihrerseits 1960 vom Nutzfahrzeug-Hersteller Leyland Motors übernommen wurde. 1967 schloss sich mit Rover ein Automobilhersteller dem Leyland-Konzern an, der bislang in einzelnen Bereichen mit Triumph konkurriert hatte. 1968 schließlich fusionierte Leyland mit British Motor Holdings, zu der neben den Mittelklassemarken Austin und Morris auch der Oberklassehersteller Jaguar gehörte, zur \\"British Leyland Motor Corporation\\". Diese Zusammenschlüsse waren von der Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (IRC) angeregt worden, einer sogenannten Mittlerorganisation (englisch: \\"Quango\\"), die die Labour-Regierung von Harold Wilson 1966 ins Leben gerufen hatte. Die IRC hatte die Aufgabe, Konzepte zu entwickeln, mit denen die internationale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der britischen Industrie und speziell der Automobilindustrie verbessert werden konnte. Dabei ging es insbesondere um die Bündelung der Ressourcen und damit verbunden um die Steigerung der Kosteneffizienz. Diese Absicht ließ sich beim Stag, dessen Entwicklung sich über einen wesentlichen Teil des Fusionierungsprozesses erstreckte, noch nicht umsetzen; der Stag nutzte nahezu keine Komponenten anderer Triumph- oder Leyland-Modelle.', 'Initiative Giovanni Michelottis.', 'Der Triumph Stag geht auf den italienischen Designer Giovanni Michelotti zurück. Michelotti hatte ab den späten 1950er Jahren nahezu jeden Triumph gestaltet und galt als Hausdesigner Triumphs. Ende 1964 entwarf er auf eigene Initiative ein 2+2-sitziges Cabriolet auf der Basis des Triumph 2000, einer 1963 erschienenen Limousine der oberen Mittelklasse, die die technische Grundlage des späteren Stag war. Das Cabriolet war anfänglich nur als \\"Showcar\\" für einen Stand Michelottis auf dem Genfer Auto-Salon 1966 gedacht; eine Serienfertigung hatte Michelotti zunächst nicht beabsichtigt.', 'Michelottis Werkstatt stellte das Cabriolet als Prototyp im Sommer 1965 fertig. Es hatte den ungekürzten Radstand der Triumph-Limousine. Stilistisch entsprach er bereits in weiten Teilen der späteren Karosserie des Stag, hatte aber noch keinen Überrollbügel. Ein weiteres Merkmal, mit dem der Prototyp vom späteren Serienmodell abwich, war die Frontpartie. Hier befand sich eine über die ganze Wagenbreite reichende Kühlergrillmaske, wobei die Frontscheinwerfer hinter einer beweglichen Klappe versteckt waren. Abgesehen davon stimmten die Proportionen und auch die Linienführung im Detail mit dem späteren Stag weitgehend überein.', 'Nachdem das Triumph-Management Michelottis Prototyp begutachtet hatte, kaufte Triumph Anfang 1966 die Rechte an dem Entwurf, bevor der Prototyp auch nur einmal ausgestellt worden war. Wenig später fiel die Entscheidung, das Modell in Serie zu produzieren.', 'Positionierung.', 'Der unter dem Codenamen Stag (deutsch: Hirsch, aber umgangssprachlich auch: ungebundener Herr) entwickelte Wagen war nach dem TR5 beziehungsweise dessen Nachfolger TR6 sowie dem Spitfire das dritte Cabriolet der Marke Triumph. Es sollte ein deutlich höheres Marktsegment bedienen als die beiden anderen offenen Triumph-Modelle und zugleich als Spitzenmodell der Marke fungieren. Innerhalb der British-Leyland-Hierarchie sollte der Stag die Lücke zwischen dem MGB und dem viel teureren Jaguar E-Type schließen, die sich nach der abzusehenden Einstellung des sechszylindrigen MGC auftat.', 'Im internationalen Vergleich zielte der Wagen in erster Linie auf den Mercedes-Benz SL, der seinerzeit noch ausschließlich von Sechszylinder-Ottomotoren angetrieben wurde, sowie auf Lancia und Alfa Romeo. Als vornehmlichen Absatzmarkt sah das Unternehmen wie bei seinen anderen Sportwagen die USA. Zielgruppe war nach Aussage des Entwicklungsingenieurs Harry Webster.', 'Konzeptionell verband der Stag, dieser Vorgabe folgend, Elemente des offenen Sportwagens mit denen eines Gran Turismo.', 'Entwicklungsteam.', '1966 begann die technische Entwicklung des Serienfahrzeugs. Sie war von einem Gegeneinander bislang konkurrierender Entwicklungsteams von Rover und Triumph geprägt, die erst 1967 durch die Rover-Übernahme in einem gemeinsamen Unternehmen zusammengeführt worden waren. Anfänglich leitete der Triumph-Ingenieur Harry Webster die Entwicklungsarbeiten. Nachdem er 1968 zu Austin-Morris gewechselt war, übernahm der von Rover kommende Charles Spencer „Spen“ King seine Position. Die Triumph-Ingenieure standen ihrem neuen Vorgesetzten wegen seiner Rover-Wurzeln kritisch gegenüber. Spen King wurde von ihnen nicht über alle Details unterrichtet und zum Teil auch fehlinformiert. Andererseits ließ King, der gleichzeitig mit der Entwicklung des ersten Range Rover und den konzeptionellen Anfängen des Rover SD1 beschäftigt war, dem Entwicklungsteam des Stag auch bewusst viel Freiraum.', 'Motorisierung: Triumph oder Rover?', 'Die größte Besonderheit des Stag war und ist seine Motorisierung. Der Stag hatte einen von Triumph selbst entwickelten und in keinem anderen Fahrzeug verwendeten Achtzylindermotor, dessen allgemein als unwirtschaftlich angesehene Entstehung im Widerspruch zu den Restrukturierungsbemühungen der \\"Industrial Reorganisation Corporation\\" stand. Sie war nach Auffassung vieler Autoren das Ergebnis einer innerbetrieblichen Rivalität von Triumph und Rover.', 'Entsprechend der Vorgabe für das avisierte Marktsegment war für Triumphs Spitzenmodell ein großvolumiger Ottomotor vorgesehen. Zur Wahl standen zunächst zwei, später drei Motoren:', 'Hinzu kam ein weiterer Achtzylindermotor von Jaguar, dessen Entwicklung in den späten 1960er Jahren unter großer Geheimhaltung begann und letztlich aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen aufgegeben wurde.', 'Anfänglich hatte es Überlegungen gegeben, den Stag mit dem bekannten, 2,5 Liter großen Sechszylindermotor aus dem Triumph 2000 auszurüsten. Frühe Testfahrten ergaben allerdings, dass dessen Motorleistungen wegen des im Vergleich zur Limousine erhöhten Fahrzeuggewichts des Cabriolets nicht die sportlichen Fahrleistungen ermöglichte, die die Unternehmensleitung erwartete. Das Management entschied sich stattdessen dafür, den Stag mit einem Achtzylindermotor anzubieten, um den Wagen technisch näher am Jaguar E-Type zu positionieren; zudem erwartete es eine erhöhte Anziehungskraft eines Achtzylinders auf dem US-amerikanischen Markt.', 'Nach der Fusion von Leyland und Rover erwog Spen King zeitweise, Triumphs Eigenentwicklung zugunsten des Rover-Motors einzustellen. Letztlich entschied er sich aber dafür, im Stag allein die Triumph-Konstruktion anzubieten. Als Folge dieser Entscheidung hatte British Leyland künftig neben Rovers 3,5 Liter großer Einheit einen weiteren Achtzylindermotor im Programm. Beide Triebwerke hatten keinerlei gegenseitig austauschbare Teile, boten aber ein nahezu identisches Leistungsbild (145 bhp beim Triumph- und 143 bhp beim Rover-Motor).', 'Die Entscheidung für den Beibehalt des Triumph-Motors wird vielfach auf gezielte Falschinformationen aus dem Entwicklungsteam, aber auch auf eine nur halbherzige Betreuung des Projekts durch Spen King zurückgeführt. Die Triumph-Techniker gaben unter anderem an, dass die Eigenentwicklung bereits zu weit fortgeschritten sei, um das Projekt noch mit wirtschaftlich vertretbarem Aufwand zu beenden. Ob das tatsächlich zutraf, wird in der Literatur angezweifelt: Tatsächlich benötigte Triumph noch fast zwei Jahre, bis der Stag-Motor annähernd serienreif war. Darüber hinaus vertraten die Triumph-Techniker die Auffassung, dass der Rover-Motor nicht in den schmalen Motorraum des Stag passe. Das war eine unzutreffende Behauptung: Tatsächlich rüsten Stag-Eigentümer bereits seit den 1970er Jahren ihre Wagen immer wieder auf Rover-Motoren um, und 1975 stellte British Leyland sogar werksseitig drei Prototypen mit dem Rover-Motor her. Jahre später bestätigte King, seinerzeit mit falschen Informationen versorgt worden zu sein, führte aber ergänzend aus, dass Rover zu dieser Zeit keine ausreichenden Fertigungskapazitäten hatte, um zusätzlich zu den selbst benötigen Motoren auch Einheiten für den Stag zu fertigen.', 'Konstruktion.', 'Karosserie.', 'Der Stag war Triumphs erster Sportwagen mit selbsttragender Karosserie. Die Karosserie bestand aus Stahl; die einzelnen gepressten Komponenten waren miteinander verschweißt. Der Aufbau und die Bodengruppe ähnelten in konstruktiver Hinsicht denen des Triumph 2000, die Bodengruppe und der Radstand waren allerdings im Vergleich zur Limousine um 12 Zentimeter verkürzt. Insgesamt gab es nur wenige Gleichteile. An verschiedenen Stellen waren Verstärkungen in die Stag-Karosserie eingearbeitet, unter anderem in der Spritzwand und hinter den Rücksitzen. British Leyland bezog anfänglich Stahl aus Großbritannien; ab 1974 wechselte es aus Kostengründen zu italienischem und spanischem Stahl, der nach Ansicht zeitgenössischer Fahrer deutlich rostanfälliger war.', 'Sicherheitscabriolet und Hardtopcoupé.', 'Der Triumph Stag war ein 2+2-sitziges Cabriolet. Michelottis Entwurf war noch ein Vollcabriolet mit Stoffverdeck gewesen, das ohne Überrollbügel auskam. Testfahrten mit dem Prototyp hatten allerdings gezeigt, dass diese Version sehr verwindungsfreudig war. Um die nötige Festigkeit des Aufbaus zu gewährleisten und mit Blick auf eine erwartete Verschärfung US-amerikanischer Sicherheitsbestimmungen entschied sich das Entwicklungsteam bereits im Herbst 1966 dazu, den Wagen mit einem Überrollbügel auszurüsten.', 'Den Überrollbügel gestaltete Michelotti im Auftrag von Triumph.

Das Plateau ist hochwassersicher und war gut zu verteidigen. Am Fuße des Hangs führte eine Furt durch den Main, oben verlief eine vorrömische Altstraße, die Antsanvia oder Hohe Straße, eine Vorläuferin der späteren Elisabethenstraße, zum Taunus führte der \\"Linien- oder Lindenweg\\", von dem die Weinstraße in die Wetterau abzweigte.', 'Eine Besiedelung des Hochplateaus über dem Main lässt sich seit der Jungsteinzeit nachweisen. Zur Römerzeit entstand um die Zeitenwende ein römisches Kastell. Gegen 260 gaben die Römer die rechtsrheinischen Gebiete in dieser Region auf, die Siedlung fiel wüst. Es gibt keine Hinweise auf eine kontinuierliche Besiedlung nach dem römischen Abzug.', 'Hinweise auf eine Besiedlung der Hochfläche über der Niddamündung gibt es erst wieder aus dem 8. Jahrhundert. 790 wurde zum ersten Mal das fränkische Dorf \\"Hostat\\" (hohe Stätte) im Lorscher Codex urkundlich erwähnt. Um 830, wenige Jahrzehnte nach der Ersterwähnung, wurde die weitgehend erhaltene Justinuskirche errichtet, eine der ältesten Kirchen in Deutschland. Das Dorf entwickelte sich in der Folge westlich der Justinuskirche beiderseits der alten Hauptstraße. Über 1000 Jahre gehörte Höchst zu Kurmainz, dem Territorium des Erzbischofs von Mainz. Das Mainzer Rad im Wappen des Stadtteils erinnert daran.', 'Zur Erhebung von Zöllen am Main errichtete die Mainzer Herrschaft in Höchst eine Zollburg. Um die Burg herum begann sich das Dorf langsam zu entwickeln. 1355 verlieh Kaiser Karl IV. dem Dorf \\"Hoisten\\" (Höchst) die Stadtrechte. In einer weiteren Urkunde bekräftigte Karl IV. 1356 die Stadterhebung und verlieh der jungen Stadt das Marktrecht. Grund für die Stadterhebung waren der Machtkampf zwischen Mainz und Frankfurt und die Erhebung des Höchster Mainzolls. Die in Höchst erhobenen Zölle waren für den finanzschwachen mainzischen Staat eine wichtige Einnahmequelle. Da die Handelsstadt Frankfurt durch den Mainzoll ihre wichtigste Lebensader bedroht sah, zerstörten die Frankfurter 1396 Stadt und Burg Höchst, die aber bald danach wiederaufgebaut wurden. Im 15. Jahrhundert wurde die Stadt zweimal erweitert.', 'Beim Großen Stadtbrand 1586 wurde die Hälfte der Stadt zerstört. Im Dreißigjährigen Krieg wurde auch Höchst in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. In der Schlacht bei Höchst am 20. Juni 1622 schlugen die Kaiserlichen Truppen unter der Leitung von Johann T’Serclaes von Tilly die Braunschweiger. 1631 besetzten die Schweden unter Gustav II. Adolf die Stadt; 1635 folgte die Besetzung durch Bernhard von Weimar, wobei das gotische Schloss zerstört wurde.', 'Im 18. Jahrhundert blühte in Höchst am Main der Handel. 1746 erfolgte die Gründung der Höchster Porzellanmanufaktur, die bis 1796 in Betrieb war. Die italienische Handelsfamilie Bolongaro richtete 1771 ein Handelskontor ein und ließ den Bolongaropalast erbauen. 1768 wurde auf Dekret von Kurfürst Emmerich Josef östlich der Altstadt die Höchster Neustadt gegründet.', '1803 wurde Höchst im Rahmen des Reichsdeputationshauptschlusses Teil des Herzogtums Nassau. 1839 erhielt Höchst Anschluss an eine der ersten deutschen Eisenbahnen, die Taunusbahn. 1863 wurde das Unternehmen \\"Theerfarbenfabrik Meister, Lucius &amp; Co.\\" in Höchst gegründet, es wuchs unter dem Namen \\"Farbwerke Höchst\\" und später als \\"Hoechst AG\\" zu einem der größten Chemie-Konzerne Deutschlands heran. Infolge des Deutschen Krieges kam Höchst 1866 mit dem bisherigen Herzogtum Nassau zu Preußen. 1885 wurde die Stadt Kreisstadt des neu gegründeten Landkreises Höchst der preußischen Provinz Hessen-Nassau. Am 1. April 1917 wurden die Gemeinden Unterliederbach, Sindlingen und Zeilsheim in die Stadt eingemeindet.', 'Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg war Höchst 1918 bis 1930 von französischen Truppen besetzt. Am 1. April 1928 kam die Stadt Höchst am Main als Stadtteil zu Frankfurt am Main, die neuen Höchster Stadtteile waren fortan Frankfurter Stadtteile. Hauptgrund der Eingemeindung war die Vereinigung der Hoechst AG mit anderen großen Chemieunternehmen zur I.G. Farben, die ihren Sitz in Frankfurt am Main haben sollte. Aus den Restgemeinden des Landkreises Höchst und weiteren umliegenden Gemeinden wurde der Main-Taunus-Kreis gegründet, dessen Kreisverwaltung sich bis 1987 in Höchst befand.', 'Im Zweiten Weltkrieg wurde die Höchster Altstadt bei den Luftangriffen auf Frankfurt am Main nur leicht beschädigt. Bei Luftangriffen im Jahr 1940 wurden vier Häuser zerstört, 13 Menschen starben dabei. 1945 wurden Höchst und Frankfurt von amerikanischen Truppen besetzt. American Forces Network (AFN) richtete sich im Höchster Schloß ein und blieb dort bis 1963.', 'Einige Vereinbarungen aus dem 1928 geschlossenen Eingemeindungsvertrag wurden nach Protesten der Höchster Bevölkerung erst zu Beginn der 1950er Jahre erfüllt. 1957 fand zum ersten Mal das Höchster Schloßfest statt, ein kultureller Höhepunkt der Region. Nachdem Teile der Höchster Altstadt bereits 1959 geschützt worden waren, wurde 1972 die gesamte Altstadt unter Denkmalschutz gestellt.', 'Seinen Status als Kreisstadt des Main-Taunus-Kreises verlor Höchst im Jahr 1980 durch einen Beschluss des Hessischen Landtags; die Kreisverwaltung verlegte 1987 ihren Sitz in die neue Kreisstadt Hofheim am Taunus.

Sie begann am 18. Januar 1942 mit einem Angriff sowjetischer Partisanen auf den deutsch besetzten Verkehrsknotenpunkt Cholm (). Wenige Tage darauf schloss die Rote Armee die Stadt samt ihrer Besatzung ein. Cholm wurde über drei Monate lang aus der Luft versorgt, bevor deutsche Truppen durch einen Entsatzangriff im Mai 1942 wieder Verbindung mit der Besatzung aufnehmen konnten.', 'Während der Schlacht um Cholm wurden zum ersten Mal an der Ostfront deutsche Truppen über einen längeren Zeitraum von gegnerischen Verbänden eingekesselt. Nach dem Ende der Kämpfe wurde die Schlacht in der NS-Propaganda zum sogenannten Heldenkampf deutscher Soldaten stilisiert.', 'Vorgeschichte.', 'Die Stadt Cholm ist Hauptstadt des gleichnamigen Rajons in der Oblast Nowgorod. Sie liegt am Zusammenfluss von Lovat und Kunja und wird durch den Lauf dieser Flüsse und ihrer Steilufer geteilt. Die Stadt zählte Anfang 1942 etwa 6.100 Einwohner und erlangte ihre Bedeutung zum einen als wichtiger Flussübergang und zum anderen als Kreuzung je einer befestigten Fahrbahn in Nord-Süd sowie in Ost-West-Richtung. Cholm war somit ein Verkehrsknotenpunkt auf der einzigen witterungsbeständigen Nord-Süd-Verbindung zwischen Staraja Russa und Toropez, denn der größte Teil der umliegenden Landschaft war Sumpfgelände. Bereits am 3. August 1941 war der Ort von Verbänden der Wehrmacht eingenommen worden. Danach hatte sich in der Umgebung eine Brigade sowjetischer Partisanen gebildet, die in geringem Maß gegen die rückwärtigen deutschen Verbindungslinien operierte. In den Monaten von August 1941 bis Januar 1942 diente Cholm den deutschen Truppen lediglich als Versorgungsbasis und Umschlagplatz, der in einiger Entfernung von der Front nur von Trossen, rückwärtigen Diensten und schwachen Sicherungskräften besetzt war.', 'Nachdem der deutsche Vormarsch im Dezember 1941 in der Schlacht um Moskau zum Stehen gebracht worden war, schritt die Stavka (sowjetisches Hauptquartier) im Januar 1942 zur Gegenoffensive. Am 8. Januar 1942 begann sie mit Angriffsoperationen gegen den rechten Flügel der Heeresgruppe Nord, der von der 16. Armee südlich des Ilmen-Sees gebildet wurde. Bereits am nächsten Tag erzielten die sowjetischen Verbände erste Einbrüche in die deutsche Front und weiteten sie in den folgenden Tagen aus. Da das Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) eine Absetzbewegung kategorisch ausgeschlossen hatte, um den Anschluss zur Heeresgruppe Mitte nicht zu verlieren, versuchte der neu ernannte Oberbefehlshaber der Heeresgruppe Nord, Generaloberst Georg von Küchler, die feindlichen Einbrüche mit anderswo herausgelösten Truppen abzuriegeln. Er beorderte dazu am 18. Januar 1942 das XXXIX. Armeekorps (mot.), während für die Sicherung des Verkehrsknotenpunktes Cholm die 218. Infanterie-Division vorgesehen war. Diese hatte in Dänemark gestanden; die Verlegung in den Raum Cholm war zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht abgeschlossen. Sie traf mit Teilkräften erst ab dem 28. Januar im Frontgebiet ein.', 'Operationsverlauf.', 'Partisanenangriff.', 'Nachdem der sowjetische Großangriff begonnen hatte, gewann er schnell Raum in Richtung der Lovat, während die deutschen Truppen ausweichen mussten. Bereits am 17. Januar 1942 kämpfte nur noch eine deutsche Kampfgruppe in Regimentsstärke östlich von Cholm. Um diesen wichtigen Verkehrsknotenpunkt zu erobern, plante der sowjetische Stabschef der Nordwestfront, Generalleutnant N. F. Watutin, eine enge Zusammenarbeit mit der 2. Leningrader Partisanenbrigade unter dem Kommando von Oberstleutnant N. G. Wassiljew. Diese sollte die Stadt in der Nacht vom 17. auf den 18. Januar besetzen und bis zum Eintreffen der regulären Truppen halten. Nach sowjetischen Angaben beteiligten sich an der folgenden Aktion acht Partisanen-Abteilungen mit ungefähr 800–1000 Mann aus einem Umkreis von 80 Kilometern.', 'Am Abend des 17. Januar gingen diese in Bereitstellung und sperrten alle Zufahrts- und Verbindungswege zum Ort. Am Morgen des 18. Januar um 4:00 Uhr griffen sie schließlich aus drei Richtungen an, wobei der Hauptstoß von Westen erfolgte, weil dort die Stadt am wenigsten befestigt war. Der Angriff war stark genug, um das OKW aufmerksam zu machen. „Starker Partisanenangriff gegen Cholm“ wurde im Kriegstagebuch notiert, während die sowjetische Geschichtsschreibung später betonte, dass es sich um die bis dahin größte sowjetische Partisanen-Operation gehandelt habe. Die deutschen Soldaten waren davon überrascht und zogen sich bis 11:00 Uhr ins Zentrum der Stadt zurück. Dort leisteten sie von der Kirche und dem GPU-Gefängnis aus erfolgreich Widerstand. Die sowjetische 33. Schützendivision, welche die Partisanen eigentlich erreichen sollte, wurde durch deutsche Truppen östlich von Cholm aufgehalten. Ohne Unterstützung und Munition mussten sich die Partisanen schließlich am frühen Abend zurückziehen. Vereinzelte Kämpfe mit den Partisanen dauerten noch bis zum 21. Januar an.', 'Einschließung der Stadt.', 'In der Nacht zum 19. Januar 1942 traf der Kommandeur der 281. Sicherungs-Division Generalmajor Theodor Scherer mit seinem Divisionsstab ein und übernahm den Gesamtbefehl über die im Raum Cholm stehenden Verbände. Die Division hatte bisher im rückwärtigen Gebiet der Heeresgruppe Nord Sicherungsaufgaben gegen Partisanen wahrgenommen und musste mit Teilen nunmehr die Fronttruppen verstärken. Bis zur Einschließung der Stadt war jedoch nur ihr Kommandeur Scherer in Cholm eingetroffen. Somit standen zur Verteidigung des Ortes nur wenige kleinere Einheiten verschiedener Verbände zur Verfügung. Im Wesentlichen waren dies drei Kompanien des Reserve-Polizei-Bataillons 65, drei Kompanien Infanterie, Teile des Infanterie-Regiments 385, Trosse und Angehörige der rückwärtigen Dienste, die sich im Raum Cholm befanden. Dies waren zunächst nur etwa 3500 Mann. Unter dem Druck des sowjetischen Vormarsches zogen sich weitere Wehrmachtverbände von Osten her auf Cholm zurück, welche in der Folge die „Kampfgruppe Scherer“ verstärkten. Ebenso gelangten noch Teile eines Infanterieregimentes und des Jagdkommandos 8 in den Kessel.', 'Bereits am 16. Januar hatte die sowjetische 3. Stoßarmee des Generals M. A. Purkajev den Befehl zur Einnahme Cholms bis zum 19. Januar erhalten. Am 17. Januar, dem Vorabend des Partisanenüberfalls, standen ihre Verbände 20–25 km östlich der Stadt in der Nähe des Ortes Krasnij Klin. Purkajev konnte nur die 33. Schützendivision (Oberst A. K. Makarjew) von Osten her auf Cholm ansetzen, denn die Panzer des 146. Panzerbataillons waren wegen Treibstoffmangels zurückgeblieben. Allgemein gestaltete sich die Versorgung auch auf sowjetischer Seite schwierig. Die Division erreichte den Stadtrand erst am 20. Januar, während die 257. Schützendivision und die 31. Schützenbrigade die Stadt im Süden umgingen. Bis zum 22. Januar hatten diese drei Verbände den Ort eingeschlossen.', 'Noch am 21. Januar begannen das 73. und 82. sowjetische Schützenregiment der 33. Schützendivision von Süden und Südwesten her einen ersten Großangriff, der zur Eroberung des Westteiles der Stadt und der Lovat-Brücke führte. Für die deutschen Truppen gestaltete sich die Lage dabei schwierig, da es im Kessel bereits an Granaten und sonstiger Munition fehlte und sich der Gefechtsstand der Kampfgruppe selbst schon fast in der vordersten Linie befand.', 'Am folgenden Tag, dem 23. Januar, erhielten die sowjetischen Verbände schließlich Verstärkung durch das 146. Panzer-Bataillon mit dreizehn Panzern (2 T-34, 11 T-60), nachdem dieses mit Treibstoff versorgt worden war. Die T-34 kamen aus ungeklärten Umständen nicht zum Einsatz, während die elf T-60 noch am gleichen Tag zum Angriff auf den östlichen Stadtteil angesetzt wurden. Diese aufzuhalten, bereitete den Verteidigern große Schwierigkeiten, da kaum Panzerabwehrwaffen zur Verfügung standen. Nur unter Einsatz von sechs Minen in Straßenbarrikaden und geballten Ladungen konnte dieser Angriff abgewehrt werden. Am 25. Januar verschlechterte sich die Lage für die deutsche Besatzung weiter durch den Verlust des Verpflegungsdepots, welches in Brand geschossen wurde und von dessen Beständen nur die Hälfte gerettet werden konnte. Unterdessen sammelten sich westlich der Stadt erste Kräfte der eintreffenden 218. Infanterie-Division und anderer deutscher Verbände. Sie wurden unter dem Kommandeur der Division Generalmajor Horst Freiherr von Uckermann zusammengefasst und als \\"„Kampfgruppe Uckermann“\\" zum sofortigen Entsatz von Cholm angesetzt. Am 26. Januar gelang diesen Kräften aus südwestlicher Richtung ein Durchbruch durch die Linien des sowjetischen 73. Schützenregiments, das von einer Abteilung des 44. Artillerieregiments unterstützt wurde. Ungefähr 200 Infanteristen (vom MG-Bataillon 10) gelangten als Verstärkung in den Kessel, bevor dieser von der Roten Armee wieder geschlossen werden konnte. Später gelang auf dem gleichen Weg noch einmal die Zuführung einiger Sturmgeschütze. Mit Hilfe dieser Verstärkungen gelang der „Kampfgruppe Scherer“ die Rückeroberung des nordwestlichen Teils der Stadt, der, neben dem Flugfeld gelegen, unentbehrlich für eine mögliche Luftversorgung war. Bei diesen Kämpfen wurde das sowjetische 162. Schützenregiment bis auf 312 Mann aufgerieben. Noch Ende Januar gingen die Kämpfe um einen Entsatz Cholms weiter. Von außen trat noch einmal die „Kampfgruppe Uckermann“ an und drang bis zum 31. Januar 10–15 Kilometer in Richtung des Kessels vor, während Generalmajor Scherer einen Stoßtrupp zur Vereinigung ansetzte. Dagegen führte das Kommando der 3. Stoßarmee aus seiner Reserve die 45. Schützenbrigade heran, welcher es gelang, eine Vereinigung der deutschen Stoßkeile zu verhindern.', 'Nachdem die Verbände der Roten Armee diesen Entsatzangriff abgewiesen hatten und dabei bereits seit zehn Tagen Cholm selbst angriffen, waren auch sie am Ende ihrer Kräfte. Die Regimenter der 33. Schützendivision zählten wegen der hohen Verluste nur noch je 200–300 Soldaten. Deshalb stellten sie ab dem 1. Februar die Angriffe vorläufig ein.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1. Deutsche Besetzung 2. Kesselschlacht 3.

März 1848. Sie wurden am 22. März 1848 auf dem Lindenberg, der damals höchsten Erhebung des noch im Aufbau befindlichen Volksparks, der im Volksmund auch Kanonenberg genannt wurde, bestattet.', 'Die Berliner Stadtverordnetenversammlung fällte aufgrund eines Antrags von Stadtrat Daniel Alexander Benda die Entscheidung für die Errichtung des neuen Friedhofs auf einer 2,3 Hektar großen Fläche erst am Vortag der Beerdigung. Sie sah vor, dass neben den zivilen Opfern auch die gefallenen Soldaten hier beerdigt werden sollten. Die Entscheidung zu einer gemeinsamen Beerdigung war bereits vorher in der Bevölkerung breit diskutiert und meist abgelehnt worden, letztlich entschied aber das Militär, indem es die Leichen der toten Soldaten nicht zur Verfügung stellte. Die zu dem Zeitpunkt auf dem Lindenberg befindlichen beiden Windmühlen sollten für die Anlage der Begräbnisstätte abgerissen werden. Außerdem sollte ein Denkmal auf dem damals noch nicht zum Berliner Stadtgebiet gehörenden Friedhof und ein weiteres in der Stadt aufgestellt werden. Trotz dieses Beschlusses wurde nur eine Mühle abgerissen und die Fläche war dadurch erheblich kleiner. Die zweite Mühle brannte 1860 nieder. Auch die Beerdigung der Soldaten fand nicht hier statt, sondern erst am 24. März auf dem Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin-Mitte. Die geplanten Monumente wurden ebenfalls nicht errichtet. Der Friedhof war ursprünglich quadratisch angelegt mit Diagonalwegen, die auf einen umlaufenden Weg führten, an dem die Gräber lagen. Das Zentrum der Anlage bildete ein Rondell mit einer Sommerlinde.', 'Nach einer Möglichkeit zur privaten Abschiednahme am 21. März fand das Begräbnis am 22. März statt. An diesem Tag wurde ein Festzug vorbereitet und ganz Berlin einschließlich des Berliner Stadtschlosses und des Scharnhorst- und Blücher-Denkmals in der Innenstadt wurden in Schwarz-Rot-Gold und schwarz geschmückt. Helfer dekorierten die Särge der Gefallenen mit Blumen aus dem königlichen Garten. Auf dem Gendarmenmarkt kam es zur Aufbahrung der Märzgefallenen (1848). Es waren 100.000 Menschen versammelt, Adolf Glaßbrenner sprach gar von 300.000. In der Neuen Kirche, der Kirche am Deutschen Dom auf dem Gendarmenmarkt, versammelten sich die Angehörigen der Toten zu einem evangelischen Gottesdienst. Die Anwesenden sangen den Choral \\"Jesus, meine Zuversicht\\", danach verließen sie die Kirche. Der evangelische Prediger der Neuen Kirche Adolf Sydow, der katholische Kaplan Johann Nepomuk Ruhland von der Sankt-Hedwigs-Kirche und der Rabbiner Michael Sachs hielten vor der Tür eine kurze Weiherede, ein interreligiöses Zusammentreffen, das die \\"Königlich privilegirte Berlinische Zeitung\\" wie folgt kommentierte:.', 'Der Festzug von der Neuen Kirche zum Friedhof bestand aus 20.000 Teilnehmern und 3.000 Ordnern, war etwa 7,5 Kilometer lang und dauerte vier Stunden. Die \\"Königlich privilegirte Berlinische Zeitung\\" (später Vossische Zeitung), deren gesamte Redaktion am Begräbnis teilnahm, bemerkte, in den mitgeführten Symbolen „schien sich die ganze Geschichte unseres Vaterlandes zu verkörpern“. Die Teilnehmer führten Fahnen aus anderen Städten ebenso mit sich wie die von einzelnen Gewerben in der Stadt. Orden und Uniformen waren dagegen kaum vorhanden. Beim Weg über den Berliner Schloßplatz setzte der preußische König Friedrich Wilhelm IV. auf dem Balkon, wie vorher abgesprochen, seinen Helm ab.', 'Auf dem Friedhof selbst predigte zuerst Adolf Sydow, nach ihm hielt Assessor Georg Jung, der Wortführer der Berliner Demokraten, ebenfalls eine Rede. In den folgenden Wochen wurden weitere Opfer der Kämpfe, die ihren Verletzungen erlagen, auf diesem Gelände beigesetzt. Die endgültige Zahl der Gräber stieg auf 254.', '1848–1849.', 'Der Friedhof der Märzgefallenen wurde ab 1848 zu einem Symbol der deutschen Demokratiebewegung. Die Anlage stellte dabei regelmäßig einen wichtigen Gedenk- und Demonstrationsplatz dar.', 'Im Juni 1848 kam es an den Gräbern zu einer ersten Demonstration Berliner Studenten an diesem Ort, an der etwa 100.000 Menschen teilnahmen. Sie wollten der Toten gedenken und zugleich die Regierenden ermahnen, die bei der Revolution erworbenen Veränderungen nicht vorschnell wieder rückgängig zu machen. Ein Schreiben der Studierenden an den Magistrat zeigt dies:', 'Bereits am 25. März 1848 wurde in verschiedenen Berliner Zeitungen in einer öffentlichen Bekanntmachung um Spenden sowie Entwürfe für ein Denkmal auf dem Friedhof gebeten, zu welchem am Jahrestag der Revolution der Grundstein gelegt werden sollte. Dieser Aufruf wandte sich an das gesamte deutsche Volk mit dem Hinweis, dass die Märzrevolution nationaler Natur sei und somit nicht die Berliner allein in der Pflicht seien. Das eingegangene Geld für das Komitee zur Errichtung des Denkmals verwaltete der Kaufmann und Schuhfabrikant F. H. Bathow. Da dieses Komitee allerdings nicht behördlich genehmigt war, wurde Bathow polizeilich gezwungen, das Geld herauszugeben. Der Verbleib und die Summe des gesammelten Geldes blieben ungeklärt, nach widersprüchlichen Meldungen wurde es entweder 1854 beim Stadtgericht deponiert oder ging in die Pensionskasse der Schutzleute über.', 'Wegen der Einziehung des Geldes kam es nicht zu einem Denkmal zum Jahrestag der Revolution. Zu diesem Datum waren noch nicht einmal alle Gräber mit einfachen Holzkreuzen bestückt und die Stadtregierung wollte diese nicht finanzieren. So brachten die Berliner die fehlenden rund 60 Kreuze durch eine spontane Sammlung zwischen dem 18. und 22. März 1849 auf.', 'Aufgrund der politischen Entwicklung bis zum ersten Jahrestag der Revolution rechneten sowohl Magistrat als auch Stadtverordnetenversammlung mit erneuten Aufständen in Berlin. Aus diesem Grunde wurde die Besatzungsstärke des Militärs und der Polizei massiv aufgestockt. Die \\"Königlich privilegirte Berlinische Zeitung\\" schrieb am 20. März 1849:', 'Trotz dieser Präsenz von Militär und Polizei zogen am 18. März Tausende zu den Gräbern der Märzgefallenen. Dabei handelte es sich vor allem um Arbeiter. Bereits in der vorhergehenden Nacht waren die Gräber mit Blumen geschmückt worden und Mitarbeiter der Borsigwerke stellten an den vier Ecken des Friedhofs je eine stählerne Säule auf, die mit zwei Fackeln bestückt wurde. Am Nachmittag des Tages kam es tatsächlich zu den befürchteten Zusammenstößen zwischen Demonstranten und den Schutzleuten, die jedoch verhältnismäßig glimpflich ausgingen.', 'Als im September 1849 Otto von Bismarck den Friedhof besuchte, schrieb er voll Bitterkeit an seine Gattin:', 'Von 1850 bis 1900.', 'Um in den folgenden Jahren Ausschreitungen zu vermeiden, verbot das Preußische Staatsministerium das Betreten des Friedhofs am 18. März 1850 und zu den Jahrestagen der folgenden Jahre. Bereits am 17. März 1850 wurden alle Zugänge von Polizeikräften abgesperrt. Am gleichen und am folgenden Tag trafen Arbeiter am Park ein und versuchten, auf die Friedhofsanlage zu gelangen, um dort Blumen und Kränze niederzulegen. Die Gedenkveranstaltungen fanden daraufhin in den umliegenden Gartenlokalen statt, und es kam auch in diesem Jahr zu Auseinandersetzungen zwischen der Polizei und den Demonstranten.', 'Am 20. März 1850 verkündete die \\"Königlich privilegierte Berlinische Zeitung\\", dass der Friedhof der Märzgefallenen planiert und die Begrabenen umgelagert werden sollten. Der Platz sollte einem Bahnhofsbau weichen. Diese Ankündigung wurde jedoch nie realisiert, und so kamen auch am 18. März 1851 viele Arbeiter zum Friedhof. Dieser Tag endete wieder in Ausschreitungen, die diesmal nicht ohne Verletzte endeten. Bis zum 18. März 1852 wurden alle Wege zum Friedhof mit Ausnahme des Hauptweges vom Landsberger Tor mit Blumen bepflanzt und damit unbegehbar gemacht. Im Vorfeld des Kölner Kommunistenprozesses kamen jedoch in diesem Jahr 10.000 Demonstranten in den Park und wiederum endete der Tag in Gewalt. Ab 1853 war der gesamte Park mit einem hohen Bretterzaun, später einem Stangenzaun, abgeriegelt. Auf diese Weise verhinderten die Ämter in dem Jahr eine Versammlung am Friedhof.', 'Über den geplanten Bahnhofsbau wurde erst im Februar 1854 erneut berichtet, nachdem 1853 der Bau eines Waisenhauses am Rand des Parks mit der Begründung abgelehnt wurde, dass der Anblick des Friedhofes die Jugend täglich an die Märzrevolution 1848 erinnern und so erneut zur Rebellion verleiten könne. Auch hierauf kam es nicht zu einer Verlegung, und bis zum Jahr 1856 versammelten sich jedes Jahr etliche Menschen zum Gedenken an die Revolution und an die Gefallenen am Friedhof. In einem Schreiben vom 22. Oktober 1856 forderte der Polizeipräsident von Berlin den Magistrat der Stadt auf, durch die Pflanzung einer dornigen Hecke den Zugang zu dem Friedhof unmöglich zu machen in „der Absicht, jenen Platz möglichst der Vergessenheit anheimfallen zu lassen.“ Der Magistrat lehnte diese Pläne ab und schlug erneut eine Umlagerung der Toten vor, der der Polizeipräsident zustimmte unter der Voraussetzung, dass dies möglichst ohne großes Aufsehen geschehen sollte.', 'Im Oktober 1857 bekam die Presse und damit die Öffentlichkeit Kenntnis von den Plänen des Magistrats durch Angehörige der Toten, von denen der Magistrat eine Einwilligung zur Verlegung der Toten gegen die Zahlung von Geldern bekommen wollte.

Juli 182; † 21. Mai 252) war der Begründer der chinesischen Wu-Dynastie zur Zeit der Drei Reiche und einer der Söhne des Generals Sun Jian. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters begleitete Sun Quan seinen älteren Bruder Sun Ce auf Feldzügen, während Sun Ce zum Warlord im südöstlichen China aufstieg. Nach Sun Ces Tod im Jahr 200 beerbte Sun Quan diese Position und schaffte es die Macht weiter zu konsolidieren und gegen Übergriffe aus dem Norden zu behaupten. Sein Sieg in der Schlacht von Chibi (208) besiegelte schließlich die Teilung Chinas für die nächsten Jahrzehnte.', 'Im Jahr 221 wurde Sun Quan von Cao Pi, dem Kaiser der Wei-Dynastie, zum \\"Herzog von Wu\\" ernannt. Er schlug seinen westlichen Rivalen Liu Bei in der Schlacht von Xiaoting (222) und wandte sich daraufhin auch gegen Cao Pi. In der Schlacht von Shiting schaffte er es auch die Armee des Kaisers zu schlagen und erklärte sich im Jahr 229 selbst zum Kaiser. Zahlreiche außen- und innenpolitische Rückschläge verhinderten, dass Sun Quan die Macht seines Reiches weiter ausdehnen konnte. Neben einer fehlgeschlagenen Expedition ins Ostchinesische Meer und der misslungenen Unterstützung für den Wei-Rivalen Gongsun Yuan war es besonders seine mangelhafte Kooperation mit dem verbündeten Staat Shu Han im Westen, die seine Position nach außen schwächte. Im Innern machten ihm die mangelhafte Kontrolle der lokalen Statthalter zu schaffen und nach dem Tod seines designierten Thronfolgers Sun Deng führte ein Prinzenstreit am Hof zu weiteren Schwierigkeiten.', 'Das Reich, das Sun Quan nach seinem Tod im Alter von siebzig Jahren nach 52 Jahren Regierung hinterließ, war nicht stark genug, um sich gegen die Bedrohung durch die Wei-Dynastie zu behaupten. Machtkämpfe zwischen den Regenten seiner Nachfolger, den Generälen und den Kaiserinnen schwächten das Reich zusätzlich. Im Jahr 280 wurde es schließlich von Kaiser Wu von Jin erobert, der die Wei-Dynastie fünfzehn Jahre zuvor beendet hatte und die Jin-Dynastie begründete.', 'Leben.', 'Kindheit und Jugend.', 'Sun Quan soll laut den \\"Chroniken der Drei Reiche\\" vom General Sunzi abstammen. Die spätere Tradition weist ihm die \\"Sūn-Insel\\" im Unterlauf des Qiantang-Flusses als Geburtsort zu. Seine Eltern waren der General Sun Jian und dessen Gemahlin Wu.', 'Als Sun Quan am 5. Juli 182 geboren wurde, diente sein Vater Sun Jian unter Kaiser Ling (156–189). Nach dessen Tod diente er dem Warlord Yuan Shu (155–199) im Bürgerkrieg und fiel bei einem Angriff auf den Warlord Liu Biao (142–208) im Jahr 191. Sun Quan hatte drei Schwestern und vier Brüder, von denen einer von einer Konkubine und drei von seiner Mutter Wu stammten. Sun Ce (175–200) war der älteste und übernahm das Kommando seines Vaters. In energischen Feldzügen unterwarf er die südöstlichen Regionen des Reiches, zunächst noch als Gefolgsmann Yuan Shus.', 'Sun Ce verstärkte seine Armee auch durch die Kontingente von Verwandten, etwa seines Onkels Wu Jing, und setzte seine Verwandten in Schlüsselpositionen im Heer und in der Zivilverwaltung ein: Seine etwa gleichaltrigen Vettern Sun Ben und Sun Fu waren Offiziere, Sun Quan ernannte er im Jahr 196 zum Zivilverwalter von Yangxian. Obwohl dieser Posten eher symbolischen Wert besaß, wird seine Verleihung als Zeichen von Sun Ces Achtung vor seinem jüngeren Bruder angesehen.', 'Im Sommer des Jahres 200 wurde Sun Ce auf der Jagd tödlich verwundet und ernannte Sun Quan in Anwesenheit seiner Berater zu seinem Nachfolger. In den \\"Chroniken der Drei Reiche\\" sind die folgenden Worte des sterbenden Sun Ce an seinen Bruder überliefert, mit denen er ihm seine Insignien überreichte: \\"„Truppen westlich des Yang-Flusses aufstellen, die Chancen zweier Schlachtfronten abschätzen, um Vorherrschaft im Reich kämpfen: Darin kommst du mir nicht gleich. Die Würdigen fördern und fähige Männer in die Ämter einsetzen, so dass jeder sein Bestes tut, um die Länder des Ostens zu halten: Darin komme ich dir nicht gleich.“\\"', 'Als Warlord.', 'Konsolidierung.', 'Der fließende Übergang von Sun Ce zu Sun Quan ist ein deutliches Zeichen dafür, dass Sun Quan zum Zeitpunkt seiner Machtergreifung bei seinem Bruder, den Generälen und den Beratern Achtung genoss und als der nächstliegende Nachfolger galt. So konnte die Macht der Sun-Familie vererbt werden, während die Reiche vieler anderer Warlords beim Tod ihres Anführers in Chaos versanken und ein rasches Ende fanden.', 'Eine Alternative zur Wahl Sun Quans scheint es überdies nicht gegeben zu haben. Sun Ce hatte einen leiblichen Sohn Sun Shao, der jedoch im Sommer 200 entweder ungeboren oder ein Säugling war und darum nicht für die Leitung eines kleinen, instabilen Territoriums in Frage kam. Sun Quans leibliche Brüder, Sun Yi und Sun Kuang, waren jünger als er und nicht so profiliert. Das \\"Buch von Wu\\" (zitiert in den \\"Chroniken der Drei Reiche\\") berichtet auch von kurzlebigen Plänen eines Vetters der Sun-Brüder, Sun Gao, die Nachfolge anzutreten. Er hatte sich im Jahr 196 an Sun Ces Feldzügen beteiligt und saß als General mit seinen Truppen in der Kuaiji-Kommandantur. Er traf angeblich Anstalten, mit seinen Truppen die Macht zu ergreifen, erhielt jedoch wie alle Statthalter und Generäle eine Nachricht von Sun Quan, ihm loyal zu bleiben. Sun Gao befolgte das Gebot und gab seinen Plan auf. Er scheint kurz darauf verstorben zu sein, jedenfalls fehlen ab da Nachrichten über ihn.', 'Die Unterstützung durch verdiente Beamte war für Sun Quans Autorität gerade am Beginn seiner Herrschaft entscheidend. Seine wichtigsten Parteigänger waren die Berater Lü Fan, Zhang Zhao und Zhang Hong sowie die verdienten Generäle Cheng Pu und Zhou Yu. Die meisten etablierten Feldherren in seinem Gefolge hatten sich erst unter Sun Ce einen Namen gemacht, nur Cheng Pu, Huang Gai und Han Dang hatten bereits Sun Jian gedient. Sie alle sahen Sun Quan als rechtmäßigen Nachfolger an und unterstützten seine Nachfolge. In historischen Quellen wird Cheng Pu als entscheidende Person genannt, die Sun Quans Autorität in der Provinz befestigte, während die volkstümliche Tradition dem berühmten Zhou Yu diese Rolle zuschreibt.', 'Das Kernland Sun Quans bestand zu dieser Zeit aus den Kommandanturen Danjang, Wu und Kuaiji (etwa die heutige Provinz Zhejiang), die je von Zhu Zhi, Wu Jing und Sun Quan verwaltet wurden. Die Lujiang-Kommandantur, 199 von Sun Ce erobert, stand unter der Statthalterschaft eines Li Shu, der Unabhängigkeit von seinem neuen Herrn anstrebte. Er plante, sich dem Kanzler und mächtigen Warlord Cao Cao (155–220) anzuschließen, der den Norden Chinas beinahe unumschränkt beherrschte und den Kaiser Xian kontrollierte. Er hatte auch Sun Ce und in seiner Nachfolge Sun Quan als Kommandanten von Kuaiji bestätigt. Sun Quan kam jedoch Li Shu zuvor und zeigt ihn bei Cao Cao als Verbrecher an. Li Shu war isoliert und konnte dem Angriff Sun Quans nicht standhalten. Er wurde geköpft und durch Sun He ersetzt, einen älteren Stiefbruder Sun Quans.', 'Cao Cao reagierte, indem er Liu Fu als Inspektor der Yang-Provinz einsetzte. Dieser begann mit dem Ausbau der Stadt Hefei als Festung und gewann die Gefolgschaft der Banditen und Flüchtlinge der Gegend. Er errichtete nach dem Vorbild Cao Caos Wehrbauernkolonien in der Liujiang-Kommandantur und verbesserte das Bewässerungssystem. Sun Quan hatte inzwischen mit Unruhen in der Danyang-Kommandantur zu kämpfen. Dort war Sun Yi, der Nachfolger Wu Jings, im Jahr 204 von seinen Beratern Gui Lan und Dai Yuan ermordet worden. Sun He, der neue Großverwalter von Lujiang, wurde mit den Ermittlungen beauftragt, fiel ihnen aber ebenfalls zum Opfer. Die Berater übernahmen die Verwaltung der Kommandanturen und sandten Botschaft zu Liu Fu mit dem Ziel, ihr Gebiet Cao Cao zu unterstellen. Gui Lan soll jedoch dann um die Gemahlin seines ermordeten Herrn geworben haben, die bei ihrem Schwager Sun Gao Hilfe suchte. Sun Gao ermordete Gui Lan und Dai Yuan und wurde von Sun Quan, der wenig später mit seiner Streitmacht eintraf, belohnt. Neuer Großverwalter von Danyang wurde Sun Yu, Sun Gaos jüngerer Bruder.', 'Die \\"Biografie des Lü Meng\\" berichtet über Sun Quans weitere Personalpolitik dieser Zeit: Er inspizierte die jungen Offiziere, um ihre Truppen nach Verpflegung und Kampfkraft zusammenzulegen. Daneben bemühte er sich um die Gefolgschaft verdienter Männer. Zu ihm zogen Zhuge Jin (174–241) aus Langye, der Bruder des berühmten Zhuge Liang; Bu Zhi († 248) aus Xiapi; Yan Jun aus Pengcheng; und der spätere Oberbefehlshaber Lu Su (172–217) auf Anraten von Zhou Yu.', 'Der Krieg gegen Huang Zu.', 'Nach der Befestigung seiner Aufmarschbasis und Position konnte Sun Quan die Pläne seines Bruders zur Expansion nach Westen und Süden wieder aufnehmen. Sein erstes Ziel war Huang Zu, der als General des Gouverneurs Liu Biao die Jing-Provinz (in der heutigen Provinz Jiangxi) westlich von Danyang bewachte und in der benachbarten Jiangxia-Kommandantur saß. Schon seit den Tagen Sun Jians war er ein Erbfeind der Sun-Familie und stellte für Sun Quan eine ernste Bedrohung dar. Darum fasste der Warlord den Plan, das Gebiet zu erobern. Neben der militärischen Bedeutung dieses Plans spielte auch die Rache für den Tod seines Vaters durch Huang Zu eine Rolle.', 'Im Jahr 203 ging Sun Quan gegen Huang Zus Stellungen am Unterlauf des Jangtse vor. Obwohl er keine Entscheidung herbeiführen konnte, schädigte er die feindliche Flotte empfindlich, so dass eine Gegenaktion Huang Zus verhindert wurde. Im nächsten oder übernächsten Jahr schickte er seine Generäle Cheng Pu und Taishi Ci aus, um die Poyang-Region südlich von Huang Zus Machtbereich zu stabilisieren. Er operierte von Jiaoqiu (heutiges Nanchang) aus, während seine Reserve (unter Sun He, später Sun Shao) und die Zivilverwaltung weiterhin in Dantu stationiert blieb.', 'Als die Poyang-Region um 206 gesichert war, gab Sun Quan Zhou Yu den Befehl, die Jing-Provinz anzugreifen, und sicherte ihm die Unterstützung des Großverwalters Sun Yu aus der Danyang-Kommandantur zu. Zunächst eroberte Zhou Yu die Siedlungen Mo und Bao, die am Pengli-See lagen und durch Sümpfe von Huang Zus Hauptquartier in Xiakou (heutiges Wuhan) abgeschnitten waren. Nach dem Sieg stockte er seine Truppen auf und besiegte Huang Zus Streitmacht, deren Anführer Deng Long er gefangen nahm und zu Sun Quan sandte.', 'Im nächsten Jahr führte Sun Quan den Feldzug selbst an.

Die wohl bedeutendste Rolle spielte dabei sein Vetter Heinrich der Löwe, der als Folge der Absprachen eine königgleiche Stellung in Norddeutschland aufbauen konnte. Seine langjährige Förderung durch den König missachtete jedoch das Gleichgewicht hocharistokratischer Familienverbände und ließ Heinrich schließlich zum Störfaktor für die übrigen Reichsfürsten werden.', 'Barbarossas Herrschaft war zudem vom Doppelkonflikt mit dem lombardischen Städtebund und dem Papsttum geprägt. In einer Gesellschaft, in der Ehre \\"(honor)\\" den sozialen Rang bestimmte, führten Ehrverletzungen und der daraus resultierende Zwang zur Rache zu jahrzehntelangen Konflikten. In den Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den oberitalienischen Städten versuchte Barbarossa eine Vermittlerrolle einzunehmen. Er scheiterte jedoch, zog sich den Vorwurf der Parteilichkeit zu und konnte die traditionellen Herrscheraufgaben der Friedens- und Rechtswahrung nicht ausüben. Die Weigerung einiger Städte, sich dem kaiserlichen Gericht zu stellen, musste angesichts des Konzepts der „Ehre des Reiches“ \\"(honor imperii)\\" aber auch zur Bestätigung des kaiserlichen Herrschaftsanspruchs gesühnt werden. Nachdem Tortona und Mailand zerstört worden waren, beabsichtigte Barbarossa die Königsherrschaft im Regnum Italicum grundsätzlich neu zu ordnen. Alte Hoheitsrechte des Reiches wurden wieder beansprucht oder neu definiert und schriftlich fixiert. Alle Gerichtshoheit und Amtsgewalt sollte vom Reich ausgehen. Die Einsetzung kaiserlicher Verwalter und die umfassende finanzielle Nutzung der dem Kaiser zugesprochenen Regalien trafen jedoch auf den Widerstand der Städte. Sie hatten Regalien und Jurisdiktionsrechte längst schon gewohnheitsrechtlich wahrgenommen.', 'Anders als noch in salischer Zeit führten der Konflikt mit dem Papst und die Exkommunikation des Kaisers nicht zur Entstehung einer größeren Oppositionsbewegung im nördlichen Reichsteil. Erst nach der Niederlage des kaiserlichen Heeres in der Schlacht von Legnano 1176 wurde das jahrzehntelange Schisma im Frieden von Venedig und der Konflikt mit den Kommunen im Konstanzer Frieden 1183 beendet.

In seinen letzten Jahren bereitete er nach der Niederlage des Königs von Jerusalem, Guido von Lusignan, gegen Saladin 1187 einen weiteren Kreuzzug vor. Am 11. Mai 1189 brach der Kaiser auf, doch er ertrank dreizehn Monate später kurz vor seinem Ziel.', 'Der Beiname „Barbarossa“ („Rotbart“) wurde erst im 13. Jahrhundert fester Namensbestandteil. Im Rahmen der deutschen Nationalbewegung des 19. Jahrhunderts entwickelte sich Friedrich Barbarossa zum nationalen Mythos. Mit der Sage vom Kaiser, der im Kyffhäuser schläft und auf bessere Zeiten wartet, wurde die Hoffnung auf die nationale Einheit verbunden.', 'Leben.', 'Herkunft und Aufstieg der Staufer.', 'Friedrich entstammte dem adligen Geschlecht der Staufer. Dieser Name ist jedoch eine Begriffsfindung der Historiker aus dem 15. Jahrhundert. Die Ahnen väterlicherseits waren unbedeutend und wurden nicht überliefert. Abstammung und Herkunft der Familie sind bis heute ungeklärt. Der Familie gelang es durch konsequente Nutzung von Klostervogteien, kluge Inanspruchnahme der Ministerialität und enge Zusammenarbeit mit Klerus und Volk der Bistümer Würzburg, Worms und Speyer ihre Herrschaftsposition vor Antritt des Königtums auszubauen. Für das Anwachsen der staufischen Macht waren auch zahlreiche Eheschließungen vorteilhaft. Über Barbarossas Urgroßvater Friedrich von Büren ist lediglich bekannt, dass er eine Frau namens Hildegard geheiratet hat. Jüngst wurde vermutet, dass der Schlettstädter Besitz nicht Hildegard, sondern Friedrich selbst gehört habe und die Staufer damit ein elsässisches Geschlecht gewesen seien. Erst um 1100 habe sich mit Herzog Friedrich I. der Ausgriff ins ostschwäbische Remstal vollzogen.', 'Weit wichtiger war für die Staufer ihre prestigeträchtige Verwandtschaft mütterlicherseits mit den Saliern. Die Großmutter Friedrich Barbarossas war Agnes, eine Tochter des salischen Herrschers Heinrich IV. Barbarossa verstand sich als Nachkomme des ersten Salierkaisers Konrad II., auf den er sich in Urkunden mehrfach als seinen Vorfahren bezog. Der Aufstieg der Staufer vollzog sich in den Konflikten Heinrichs IV. mit den Fürsten aus Sachsen und Schwaben. Als Reaktion auf die Erhebung des Schwabenherzogs Rudolf von Rheinfelden zum Gegenkönig Heinrichs IV. erhielt Friedrich I. vom König 1079 das Herzogtum Schwaben und wurde mit dessen Tochter Agnes vermählt. Als Schwiegersohn war Friedrich eine wichtige Stütze für den salischen Kaiser gegen die geistlichen und weltlichen Vertreter der gregorianischen Reform. 1105 bekam sein fünfzehnjähriger Sohn Friedrich II., der Vater von Barbarossa, das Herzogtum. Nach dem Sturz des Kaisers durch seinen Sohn Heinrich V. übernahmen 1116 die beiden Brüder Konrad und Friedrich II. die Stellvertreterschaft im nördlichen Reichsteil. Konrad wurde Herzog von Ostfranken. Barbarossas Vater Friedrich II. war in der Verteidigung der salischen Interessen und dem weiteren Ausbau seiner staufischen Hausmacht so erfolgreich, dass über ihn laut Otto von Freising erzählte wurde, er habe am Schwanz seines Pferdes stets eine Burg hinter sich hergezogen.', 'Um 1122 wurde Barbarossa als Sohn Friedrichs II. und der Welfin Judith geboren. Sein Geburtsort war vielleicht Hagenau. Er erlernte das Reiten, Jagen und den Umgang mit Waffen. Barbarossa konnte weder lesen noch schreiben und war auch der lateinischen Sprache nicht mächtig. Die Kandidatur seines Vaters Friedrich II. als Nachfolger des kinderlos verstorbenen salischen Herrschers Heinrich V. blieb 1125 erfolglos, da er die \\"libera electio\\" (freie Wahl) der Fürsten nicht akzeptierte. Gewählt wurde stattdessen der Sachsenherzog Lothar III. Nach dem Tod Lothars wurde am 7. März 1138 Konrad in Koblenz von einer kleinen Fürstengruppe unter der Leitung des Erzbischofs Albero von Trier zum König gewählt. Friedrich Barbarossa nahm 1141 in Straßburg, 1142 in Konstanz, 1143 in Ulm, 1144 in Würzburg und 1145 in Worms an Hoftagen seines königlichen Onkels Konrad teil. Auch in den Folgejahren hielt er sich regelmäßig am Königshof auf. Um 1147 heiratete er Adela, die Tochter des nordbayerischen Markgrafen Diepold III. von Vohburg. Wenige Wochen vor dem Tod seines Vaters wurde Barbarossa zu Weihnachten 1146 in einer königlichen Urkunde als „der jüngere Herzog“ bezeichnet. Von 1147 bis 1149 nahm er am Kreuzzug seines königlichen Onkels Konrad teil. Das Unternehmen schlug fehl, der König erkrankte an der Malaria. Zur Jahreswende 1151/52 traf Konrad Vorbereitungen für die Königswahl seines Sohnes Friedrich von Rothenburg, starb jedoch schon am 15. Februar 1152.', 'Königswahl (1152).', 'Bereits zwei Wochen nach dem Tod Konrads wählten die Fürsten am 4. März 1152 in Frankfurt am Main seinen Neffen Herzog Friedrich III. von Schwaben, den Sohn des Thronkandidaten von 1125, zum neuen König. Otto von Freising zeichnet das Bild einer einmütigen Königserhebung und zwangsläufigen Nachfolge Friedrichs. Friedrich sei gewählt worden, da er den beiden verfeindeten Familien der \\"Heinrici de Gueibelinga\\" (Heinriche von Waiblingen) und der \\"Guelfi de Aldorfio\\" (Welfen von Altdorf) angehöre; er sei damit der „Eckstein“ \\"(angularis lapis)\\" der Versöhnung geworden. Tatsächlich dürfte es jedoch vor der Wahl intensive Verhandlungen, Zugeständnisse und Absprachen zwischen Friedrich und den Großen gegeben haben. Als Herzog von Schwaben musste Barbarossa seine Erhöhung zum König seinen Standesgenossen hinnehmbar machen. Die Unterstützung Heinrichs des Löwen gewann er wohl durch die Zusage, ihm das Herzogtum Bayern zurückzugeben. Auf Konrads letztem Hoftag gelang es Barbarossa, sich die Unterstützung des Bamberger Bischofs Eberhard II. zu sichern. Eberhard hoffte dadurch Bambergs kirchenrechtliche Stellung gegenüber Mainzer Ansprüchen zu wahren. Welf VI. versprach sich vom künftigen König, seinem Neffen, die Sicherung seiner herzoglichen Stellung. Sie wurde durch die Einsetzung als Herzog von Spoleto, Markgraf der Toskana und Fürst von Sardinien \\"(dux Spoletanus et marchio Tusciae et princeps Sardiniae)\\" noch im selben Jahr gefestigt. Durch die Wahl wurde Konrads minderjähriger Königssohn Friedrich bei der Königswahl übergangen – der erste Fall dieser Art bei Königswahlen. Vor diesem Hintergrund bemerkte Otto von Freising in seinem Bericht über die Frankfurter Königswahl von 1152 ausdrücklich, dass die Wahl des Königs ein besonderer Vorzug des römisch-deutschen Reichs sei.', 'Friedrich wurde am 9. März 1152 von Erzbischof Arnold von Köln in der Aachener Münsterkirche Karls des Großen gekrönt. Während der Zeremonie warf sich ein Ministeriale, dem Barbarossa aufgrund schwerer Vergehen die Gunst entzogen hatte, dem frisch gesalbten König in aller Öffentlichkeit vor die Füße. Der Ministeriale wollte dadurch die Wiederaufnahme in die Huld des Herrschers erreichen. Er wurde jedoch von Friedrich mit der Begründung abgewiesen, dass er ihn nicht aus Hass, sondern aus Gerechtigkeitsgründen von seiner Huld ausgeschlossen habe \\"(non ex odio, sed iustitie intuitu illum a gratia sua exclusum fuisse)\\". Die Entscheidung überraschte die meisten der Anwesenden und erhielt ihren Respekt. Die Reaktion Barbarossas wird von der modernen Forschung als Ausdruck des Wandels bei der Einschätzung der Frage gewertet, welche Tugenden von einem Herrscher erwartet wurden.

Les statistiques établies au cours des 30 dernières années montrent que les pays et les entreprises qui favorisent l'entrepreneuriat ont tendance à innover davantage, à croître plus rapidement et à mieux réussir dans les échanges internationaux. En effet, les entrepreneurs sont souvent des innovateurs qui cherchent des opportunités de marché, et qui ont la capacité de créer de la valeur en introduisant des produits ou des services innovants. En développant de nouveaux marchés et en introduisant de nouvelles technologies, ils créent des emplois et des richesses qui stimulent la croissance économique. En outre, les entreprises qui encouragent l'entrepreneuriat bénéficient souvent d'une culture de l'innovation qui contribue à améliorer leur compétitivité à long terme.

Cependant, ils diffèrent dans leur approche et leur utilisation. Voici une étude comparative entre MERISE et UML : 1. Objectifs : MERISE est une méthode orientée traitement qui vise à modéliser les traitements en se concentrant sur les processus métiers. UML, de son côté, est une méthode orientée objet qui se concentre sur la modélisation des objets et de leurs relations. 2. Diagrammes : MERISE utilise des diagrammes de flux de données (DFD), des diagrammes entité-association (EA) et des diagrammes de flux de contrôle (DFC) pour modéliser les processus métiers et les données. UML utilise des diagrammes de classes, d’objets, de séquences, de collaborations, d’états, de composants, de déploiement et d’activités pour modéliser les objets et les processus. 3. Niveaux d’abstraction : MERISE propose trois niveaux d’abstraction : conceptuel, organisationnel et physique. UML propose quatre niveaux d’abstraction : modèle de la structure statique, modèle de la structure dynamique, modèle d’interaction, et modèle de la structure physique. 4. Outils de modélisation : MERISE n’a pas d’outil de modélisation standard. Les diagrammes sont généralement dessinés à la main ou à l’aide de logiciels de dessin. UML a un standard de modélisation bien établi et de nombreux outils de modélisation sont disponibles pour faciliter le travail de modélisation. 5. Utilisation : MERISE est souvent utilisé dans les domaines de la gestion de projets, de la gestion d’entreprise et de la gestion de base de données. UML, quant à lui, est opérationnel depuis près de 20 ans et est utilisé dans une grande variété de domaines, de la conception de systèmes d’information aux systèmes embarqués. En conclusion, MERISE est une méthode de modélisation orientée traitement qui se concentre sur la modélisation des processus métiers, tandis qu'UML est une méthode de modélisation orientée objet qui se concentre sur la modélisation des objets et des relations entre eux.

Das Neue Testament überliefert jedoch nur wenige als zuverlässig geltende biografische Details über ihn. Spätere Notizen werden vielfach als legendarisch angesehen. Ein Aufenthalt Petri in Rom wird in der Bibel nicht erwähnt.', 'Die römisch-katholische Kirche führt den Primatsanspruch des Papsttums über die Gesamtkirche auf die Tradition zurück, Petrus sei der erste Bischof von Rom gewesen und Christus habe Petrus und dieser den folgenden Bischöfen von Rom einen Vorrang als Leiter, Lehrer und Richter aller Christen gegeben. Die Päpste werden daher auch als „Nachfolger Petri“ bezeichnet. Die übrigen Kirchen lehnen diesen Anspruch ab. Historisch gab es im 1. Jahrhundert noch keinen Monepiskopat, das heißt, die christliche Gemeinde wurde nicht von einem einzelnen römischen Bischof geleitet. Dennoch gilt Petrus auch für die altorientalischen, orthodoxen, altkatholischen sowie die anglikanischen Kirchen als erster Bischof von Rom und als Heiliger. Die evangelischen Kirchen erinnern mit einem Gedenktag an ihn.', 'Quellenlage.', 'Alle Quellen zu Simon Petrus stammen aus der christlichen Überlieferung. Mögliche biografische Informationen finden sich vor allem in den Evangelien, den Paulusbriefen, weiteren Apostelbriefen und der Apostelgeschichte des Lukas.

Jahrhundert und verdanken ihre Entstehung, Verbreitung und Überlieferung nicht zuletzt den kirchenpolitischen Interessen der Autoren und Tradenten, die in der Auseinandersetzung mit häretischen Strömungen innerhalb des frühen Christentums den Bibelkanon, das monarchische Bischofsamt und die Idee der apostolischen Sukzession entwickelten. Sie betonen zum einen die Bedeutung Petri für die Vorrangstellung Roms vor den übrigen Patriarchaten und stellen ihn zum anderen als Beispiel für einen „sündigen Heiligen“ dar, dessen Verleugnung und anschließende Reue und Bekehrung zeige, dass allen Menschen das Heil offensteht.', 'Apostelakten zu Simon Petrus werden in der Regel als Legenden beurteilt, die weitgehend ahistorische Erzählungen beinhalten.', 'Archäologische Zeugnisse für eine Petrusverehrung in Rom stammen aus dem 1.

Ob sie seinen Aufenthalt und sein Begräbnis dort belegen, ist stark umstritten.', 'Angaben im Neuen Testament.', 'Name.', 'Alle Evangelien kennen den Jünger unter dem Namen \\"Simon\\"; Jesus redet ihn bis auf eine Ausnahme immer so an. Es handelt sich um die griechische Form des biblischen Namens Simeon (hebräisch \\"Schim’on\\"), dem Tanach zufolge einer der Söhne Jakobs und Stammvater eines der zwölf Stämme Israels. Patriarchennamen waren unter palästinischen Juden dieser Zeit besonders beliebt und wurden häufig auch in der griechischen Übersetzung verwendet. Da auch Simons Bruder Andreas einen griechischen Namen trägt, scheint diese Namensform die ursprünglichere zu sein. und nennen ihn \\"Symeon\\", eine Gräzisierung der hebräischen Namensform.', 'In nennt Jesus seinen Jünger mit Vatersnamen \\"Simon Barjona\\" („Simon, Sohn des Jona“). Zu möglichen politischen Konnotationen dieser Anrede und zu der Frage, ob der Vater der beiden Apostel Jona oder, wie es an anderer Stelle im Neuen Testament heißt, Johannes (hebräisch \\"Jochanan\\") geheißen haben kann, gibt es verschiedene Theorien (siehe unten, Abschnitt „Herkunft und Berufung“).', 'Paulus von Tarsus nennt den Apostel meist \\"Kephas\\" (Κηφᾶς), eine gräzisierte Form des auch in den Evangelien überlieferten Beinamens \\"Kefa\\" (Kēp’, in hebräischen Buchstaben כיפא), ein aramäisches Wort, das als Eigenname kaum belegt ist und eigentlich „Stein“ bedeutet. übersetzt den Namen zweimal ins Griechische zu Πέτρος \\"(Pétros)\\", was ebenfalls „Stein“ bedeutet und mit dem griechischen Wort für „Fels“ (πέτρα) verwandt ist. Im Hebräischen hat das Wort \\"kēp\\" (כֵּף) ebenfalls die Grundbedeutung „Fels“ oder „Stein“. Sowohl das semitische als auch das griechische Wort bezeichnen einen gewöhnlichen Naturstein (Wurfstein, Bruchstein, Kieselstein), im Hebräischen auch einen Felsen (zum Beispiel ), im Aramäischen kann (seltener) ebenfalls ein Felsen, Felsbrocken oder eine Felsenspitze gemeint sein.', 'Jesus selbst soll Simon den Beinamen \\"Kefa\\" verliehen haben; wo und wann, überliefern die Evangelien unterschiedlich. Einige Exegeten nahmen an, Simon habe den Beinamen erst als Apostel der Urgemeinde angenommen, und dies sei nachträglich auf Jesus zurückgeführt worden (vgl. Joh 1,42). Die meisten Forscher (darunter Peter Dschulnigg, Joachim Gnilka, Martin Hengel, John P. Meier, Rudolf Pesch) gehen jedoch davon aus, dass Simon diesen Beinamen bereits im ersten Jüngerkreis trug, da \\"Kephas\\" in einigen der ältesten NT-Schriften als eigentlicher Name oder von Anfang an verwendeter Beiname (; Mt 4,18; 10,2) des Apostels erwähnt ist. Auch wird zumeist angenommen, dass ihm der Beiname tatsächlich von Jesus gegeben wurde. John P. Meier weist darauf hin, dass die Evangelien eine Nennung des Namens \\"Petrus\\" oder \\"Kephas\\" im Munde Jesu an vielen Stellen auffällig vermeiden; er hält es für denkbar, dass dieser Name für den Gebrauch im Verhältnis unter den Jüngern, aber nicht im Verhältnis zu Jesus bestimmt war.', 'Vermutet wurde auch, der ursprüngliche Sinn des Namens erschließe sich aus der angenommenen Wortbedeutung „Edelstein“ im Aramäischen, was die besondere Rolle Simons als Wortführer der Erstberufenen hervorheben könnte. Die Sinnverschiebung zu „Fels“ als Fundament der Kirche sei dann als nachösterliche Umdeutung zu verstehen. Die im Anschluss an Rudolf Pesch vermutete Übersetzung von \\"kefa\\" als „Schmuckstein“ oder „Edelstein“ zur (auszeichnenden) Benennung einer Person ist vom Aramäischen her jedoch nicht hinreichend zu belegen, da der Gebrauch der aramäischen Wurzel \\"kp\\" als Personenname nicht nachgewiesen ist und überhaupt kaum Beispiele einer Verwendung des Wortes in der Bedeutung „Edelstein“ bekannt sind, in denen dieses Verständnis nicht durch Zusammensetzungen, attributive Zusätze (etwa „guter Stein“ im Sinne von „edel“ oder „wertvoll“) oder einen eindeutigen Kontext nahegelegt würde.', 'Der protestantische Heidelberger Judaist und Talmud-Übersetzer Reinhold Mayer (1926–2016) vermutete, der Namensgebung durch Jesus liege neben dem Gedanken an den Grundstein des Jerusalemer Tempels eine ironische Anspielung auf den ungewöhnlichen Namen des zu seiner Zeit amtierenden Hohenpriesters Kajaphas (קיפא) zugrunde. Die in griechischer Umschrift verschieden vokalisierten Namen \\"Kaiphas\\" und \\"Kephas\\" unterscheiden sich in hebräischer Schrift nur in den anlautenden Konsonanten (Koph bei \\"Qajfa\\" statt Kaph bei \\"Kefa\\"), die sehr ähnlich klingen. Damit wohne dem Namen ein (möglicherweise durchaus ernst gemeinter) Anspruch auf die Ablösung des Hohenpriesters durch den Führer der Zwölfergruppe um Jesus inne, der selbst im Rahmen seines Messianismus den Königstitel für sich beanspruchte. Der erst durch die Jerusalemer Inschriftenfunde von 1990, mit denen der Name des Hohepriesters erstmals in hebräischen Schriftzeichen belegbar wurde, ins Bewusstsein der Forschung getretene „verblüffende Gleichklang des Beinamens des Simon mit dem des höchsten Amtsinhabers am Jerusalemer Tempel“ wirft auch für den katholischen Exegeten Martin Ebner ein neues Licht auf den viel umrätselten Beinamen des Simon Petrus. Falls Absicht dahinterstecke, hätte „Jesus mit dieser delikaten Spitznamenwahl eine symbolische Enteignung vorgenommen“.', 'Ähnlich wie \\"Jesus Christus\\" wurde auch \\"Simon Petrus\\" spätestens mit der lateinischen Bibelübersetzung Vulgata (um 385) zum Eigennamen.', 'Herkunft und Berufung.', 'Simon stammte wie Jesus aus Galiläa und war nach Aussage des Markusevangeliums an seiner Sprache als Galiläer erkennbar (Mk 14,70 par.). Er gehörte zu den ersten Jüngern, die Jesus in seine Nachfolge berief. Die Überlieferungen beschäftigen sich praktisch nur mit der Zeit nach dieser Berufung; Angaben über Alter und Geburt des Simon sowie über die Herkunft und den sozialen Status seiner Familie gibt es keine.', 'Nach hieß Simons Vater Johannes. In spricht Jesus ihn als \\"Simon Barjona\\" an, aramäisch „Sohn des Jona“. Jona dürfte hier als Kurzform von Johannes aufzufassen sein. Als Adjektiv bedeutet \\"barjona\\" allerdings auch „impulsiv“ oder „unbeherrscht“. Darin sahen manche Ausleger Hinweise auf eine mögliche frühere Zugehörigkeit Simons zu den Zeloten, da im späteren Talmud jüdische Freiheitskämpfer als \\"barjonim\\" (Plural) bezeichnet wurden.', 'Simon hatte einen Bruder namens Andreas, der wohl jünger als Simon war, da alle Apostellisten diesen zuerst nennen. Beide waren Fischer am See Genezareth. Nach Mk 1,16 traf Jesus sie am Seeufer beim Auswerfen ihrer Fischernetze und forderte sie auf, ihm nachzufolgen.

Elle a impliqué la plupart des nations du monde, y compris les grandes puissances, qui ont finalement formé deux alliances militaires opposées : les Alliés et les forces de l'Axe. Le déclenchement de cette guerre est dû à plusieurs facteurs politiques, économiques et sociaux, dont le traité de Versailles, l'expansionnisme et les idéologies fascistes et nazies. Dans cette dissertation, nous analyserons les principales causes de la seconde guerre mondiale, son déroulement puis les conséquences pour les nations et le monde entier. I. Les causes de la Seconde Guerre mondiale 1. Le Traité de Versailles La première cause majeure de la Seconde Guerre mondiale réside dans les termes du Traité de Versailles (1919), qui mettait fin à la Première Guerre mondiale. Les conditions de ce traité ont imposé de lourdes sanctions économiques et territoriales à l'Allemagne, pour avoir été le principal instigateur du conflit. Le peuple allemand a vu ces sanctions comme une humiliation et les années qui ont suivi ont créé le terreau fertile pour l'émergence de mouvements nationalistes et revanchards. 2. Le nationalisme et les idéologies expansionnistes L'humiliation subie par l'Allemagne après la Première Guerre mondiale a conduit à l'émergence de mouvements nationalistes et militaristes, notamment le national-socialisme ou nazisme, qui prônait un \\"espace vital\\" pour un peuple allemand envahi par les autres nations. À cela s'ajoute le fascisme en Italie, incarné par Benito Mussolini, qui visait à étendre le territoire italien et à restaurer la gloire de l'Empire romain. 3. La montée des dictateurs Adolf Hitler, un fervent national-socialiste, prend le pouvoir en Allemagne en 1933, grâce à une propagande efficace et à un contexte économique et social favorable. En Italie, Benito Mussolini dirigeait déjà le pays depuis 1922. Ces dirigeants, autoritaires et militaristes, étaient convaincus que leur peuple et leur pays devaient retrouver leur grandeur. II. Le déroulement de la Seconde Guerre mondiale 1. Expansionnisme et formation des alliances La Seconde Guerre mondiale commence par la politique expansionniste de l'Allemagne nazie et de l'Italie fasciste. Hitler envahit la Pologne en septembre 1939, provoquant ainsi l'entrée en guerre de la France et du Royaume-Uni. Les forces de l'Axe sont rapidement rejointes par le Japon, qui envahit la Chine en 1937 et attaque les États-Unis à Pearl Harbor en 1941, entraînant l'entrée des États-Unis dans le conflit. 2. Les grands affrontements Le conflit prend une dimension planétaire avec des batailles sur plusieurs fronts : Europe de l'Ouest, Europe de l'Est, Afrique du Nord et Asie-Pacifique. La guerre se caractérise également par la brutalité et l'absence de merci envers les civils, comme le bombardement de Coventry, Londres et Dresde ou encore le siège de Leningrad. 3. La fin du conflit La guerre s'achève en 1945 avec la chute du Troisième Reich d'Adolf Hitler suite à l'offensive des troupes Alliées et la reddition inconditionnelle de l'Allemagne. Le Japon se rend également après les bombardements atomiques sur Hiroshima et Nagasaki. III. Les conséquences de la Seconde Guerre mondiale 1. Les pertes humaines et matérielles Les pertes humaines sont estimées entre 50 et 70 millions de personnes, dont une majorité de civils. Les destructions matérielles sont également massives, particulièrement en Europe et en Asie. 2. Les bouleversements politiques et territoriaux Le monde d'après-guerre voit la fin des empires coloniaux et l'émergence de deux superpuissances : les États-Unis et l'Union soviétique. La guerre froide commence alors, divisant le monde en deux blocs idéologiquement opposés. 3. Les leçons tirées du conflit La communauté internationale met en place une série de mesures pour éviter un nouveau conflit d'une telle ampleur : création de l'Organisation des Nations Unies (ONU), Plan Marshall pour la reconstruction de l'Europe et procès de Nuremberg pour juger les crimes de guerre. Conclusion En définitive, la Seconde Guerre mondiale a été un événement cataclysmique qui a profondément marqué l'histoire du 20e siècle. Ses causes multiples et ses graves conséquences ont conduit la communauté internationale à repenser la manière dont les pays coexistent et interagissent entre eux. Bien qu'il soit impossible de prédire l'avenir, il est crucial de tirer les leçons du passé pour éviter de répéter les erreurs qui ont conduit à un conflit d'une telle ampleur."},{"instruction":"what does Mesostoma Ehrenbergii prey on","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have access to the current location and habitat of species.

She is physically strong and capable, but has a limp caused by a childhood injury. 4.

What is the context that prompted the writing?","output":"The story \\"Everyday Use\\" by Alice Walker is set in the rural South of the United States, most likely in the 1960s or 1970s. The story takes place at Mama's house which is a small, simple, and run-down home with no modern amenities. The context that prompted the writing of the story was the explosion of the Black Power movement during the Civil Rights era in the 1960s and early 1970s. The story is a commentary on the changing views of African Americans towards their cultural heritage during this time. It explores the tension between the old ways of African American life, as embodied by Mama and Maggie, and the desire of some African Americans to reject those traditions and embrace their African roots, as embodied by Dee. The story also explores themes of identity, family, and the role of education in shaping one's understanding of culture and heritage."},{"instruction":"Who are the people to whom the piece is directed?","output":"\\"Everyday Use\\" by Alice Walker is a piece of fiction that is directed towards a general audience. It was written to raise awareness of the changing attitudes and values towards African American heritage during the Civil Rights era and to explore the struggles and conflicts that arose during this time.

Through the characters of Mama, Maggie, and Dee, the story shows how people can have different understandings of the same traditions, and how these differences can cause tension and conflict within families. The story also highlights the importance of valuing and preserving cultural heritage, while also acknowledging that heritage can take different forms and have different meanings for different people. Overall, the purpose of \\"Everyday Use\\" is to prompt readers to think critically about their own relationships with their cultural heritage, to explore the complexities of family dynamics, and to understand the importance of respecting and honoring diverse cultural traditions."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Bayerisches Alpenvorland', 'Ehemalige Kreisstadt in Bayern', 'Gemeinde in Bayern', 'Kreisfreie Stadt in Bayern', 'Memmingen', 'Ort in Oberschwaben', 'Reichsstadt in Bayern'], 'Memmingen ist eine kreisfreie Stadt im bayerischen Regierungsbezirk Schwaben.

Das Memminger Trockental gehört geographisch zum Bereich Ober- beziehungsweise Mittelschwaben. Natürlich begrenzt wird das Stadtgebiet im Westen durch die Buxacher Halde, im Südosten durch das Benninger Ried, im Osten durch die Talflanke, auf der die Gemeinde Memmingerberg liegt. Im Nordosten begrenzt der Ortsteil Eisenburg das Stadtgebiet. Die Frage ob Memmingen im Allgäu liegt, wird von der Stadtverwaltung aus touristischen Gründen meist bejaht. Aufgrund der kultur- und bauhistorischen Geschichte ist Memmingen jedoch dem Bereich Oberschwaben zuzurechnen.', 'Geologie.', 'Memmingen befindet sich auf einem alten Gletscherplateau. Der Boden ist in der Kernstadt meist sandig, in den Ortsteilen und im Memminger Westen lehmig. An einigen Stellen hat der Gletscher Kies hinterlassen (z. B. auf der Steinheimer Flur). Im Osten ist der Grundwasserspiegel sehr hoch (meist 1,5–2,5 Meter unter der Erdoberfläche), dort entspringen viele kleinere Bäche. Die Stadt liegt teilweise auf altem Moorgebiet. Von dort wurden bereits zur Zeit der Stadtgründung Gewässer gebündelt und in die Stadt geleitet. Dadurch entstand die Memminger Ach. Das Industriegebiet Nord befindet sich auf einem fruchtbaren, humusreichen Boden und war ehemals die Kornkammer Oberschwabens. Heute werden nur noch Randgebiete in Richtung Heimertingen und Buxheim landwirtschaftlich genutzt.

Erste Baufunde stammen aus der Römerzeit. Vermutlich befand sich dort ein kleiner Wacht- und Siedlungsposten. Hierfür kommen zwei Namen, oder in Betracht. Reste der Siedlung befinden sich unter der St.-Martins-Kirche und dem Antoniterkloster. Ob nach Abzug der Römer ein neuer \\"Herr\\" die Siedlung übernahm, ist nicht feststellbar. Da der Einflussbereich des Klosters St. Gallen kurz vor Memmingen endete, müssen vor allem im Kloster Augsburg Unterlagen über die Fluren vorhanden gewesen sein. Durch die mehrmalige Zerstörung der Augsburger Bibliothek gingen Dokumente verloren. Aufgrund der Endung \\"-ingen\\" kann allerdings von einer Namensgebung um das 4. und 5. Jahrhundert ausgegangen werden. Ziemlich sicher ist, dass im 5. Jahrhundert eine alemannische Siedlung gegründet wurde. Ab dem 7. Jahrhundert wird ein fränkischer Königshof vermutet. Damals könnte eine erste Kirche erbaut worden sein. Unter der Frauenkirche befinden sich Reste romanischen beziehungsweise frühromanischen Baustils. Der Name \\"Memmingen\\" ist vermutlich auf einen Königshof bei der Siedlung des \\"Mammo\\" zurückzuführen. Im Laufe der Zeit verschwand die Siedlung und nur der Name blieb erhalten.', 'Durch die Salzstraße von Böhmen, Österreich und München nach Lindau und die Straße von Norddeutschland in die Schweiz und nach Italien erlangte der Handelsposten zunehmende Bedeutung. Erstmals erwähnt wurde der Ort \\"Mammingin\\" im Jahre 1128 in einer im Kloster Ochsenhausen verfassten Urkunde, in der die Verhandlung eines Streitfalles und ein Landtag von 1099 erwähnt werden. Daraus ist zu schließen, dass Memmingen für die Welfen bereits ein bedeutender Ort war, da Landtage nur in machtpolitischen Zentren stattfanden. Der Ort Memmingen ist relativ schnell zur Stadt herangewachsen. Verschiedene Funde bei Ausgrabungen 1991 im Bereich des Antoniterklosters und des Marktplatzes belegen, dass die Besiedelung im 9. Jahrhundert noch relativ klein war. Im 11. und 12. Jahrhundert ist allerdings ein hohes Bevölkerungswachstum erkennbar. Der andauernde Streit mit den Welfen veranlasste 1130 den Staufer Friedrich von Schwaben, neben Memmingen auch Ravensburg und Altdorf (heute Weingarten) zu zerstören. Memmingen brannte damals bis auf die Grundmauern ab. Noch heute zeugen Aschespuren im Boden von diesem Ereignis. 1142 siegelte Heinrich der Löwe in der. Im Februar 1151 trafen sich in der Stadt Heinrich der Löwe, Welf VI., der Stauferherzog Friedrich II. von Schwaben, Graf Adolf II., Graf Gottfried von Ronsberg sowie mehrere staufische und welfische Ministeriale, um einen Kompromiss im Streit zwischen den Welfen und den Staufern zu finden. Dies zeigt, welch hohen Rang der Ort bereits zu dieser Zeit gehabt haben muss.', 'Im Jahr 1158 wurde Memmingen durch Herzog Welf VI. zur Stadt erhoben. Nach dessen Tod ging 1191 die Stadt an den Staufer Konrad, den Bruder Kaiser Heinrichs VI. Der letzte Staufer, Konradin von Hohenstaufen, starb 1268 in Neapel. Damit fiel die Stadt an das Reich zurück, wurde 1286 durch den römisch-deutschen König Rudolf I. von Habsburg zur Freien Reichsstadt erklärt und damit direkt dem deutschen König unterstellt. Sie erhielt die königliche Bestätigung des tradierten Stadtrechts und wurde mit Überlinger Recht ausgestattet. Zehn Jahre später erhielt Memmingen zusätzlich das Ulmer Recht. Vom 14. bis zum 16. Jahrhundert war die Blütezeit der Reichsstadt. Dies zeigte sich vor allem in der regen Bautätigkeit, im Handel und im Aufblühen der Kultur.', '1445 wurde die Stadt letztmals mit einem Mauergürtel, dem Ulmer Tor und vier neuen Türmen erweitert. 1478 errichtete Peter Fort eine Papiermühle. 1480 eröffnete Albrecht Kunne aus Duderstadt ein Druck-Offizin, das bis 1520 rund 200 verschiedene Drucke veröffentlichte. Unter anderem wurde dort 1519 \\"America\\" als Bezeichnung des neuen Kontinents verwendet. Es ist einer der frühesten Belege für diesen Namen, der 1507 von dem Kartografen Martin Waldseemüller erstmals verwendet worden war. (Jacob Stoppls ).', 'Im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert besuchte Kaiser Maximilian I. die Stadt insgesamt dreizehn Mal. Er nannte sie seine \\"Ruh- und Schlafzell\\". Den wohl größten Künstler der Stadt, Bernhard Strigel, ernannte er zu seinem Haus- und Hofmaler, der ihn erstmals 1504 porträtierte. Zu dieser Zeit entstand das Chorgestühl in St. Martin, das zu den bedeutendsten Deutschlands zählt. Der großen Handelstätigkeit der Patrizierfamilien der Stadt ist es zu verdanken, dass sie zu Reichtum kam. Bereits 1505–1506 unternahm die Große Deutsche Kompagnie die erste Handelsfahrt von Portugal nach Indien.

In den letzten 30 Jahren starb die Art in Europa in Frankreich, Italien, der Slowakei, Österreich (Bodensee) und Deutschland aus.

Einige Bestände existieren auch in der Schweiz, wo sie eigentlich nicht heimisch ist, so zum Beispiel im Mettmenhaslisee; diese Standorte gehen auf Ansalbungen aus dem Jahre 1908 zurück. Sie sind aber trotzdem streng geschützt, unter anderem, weil sie auf die in Deutschland selbst erloschenen Bestände aus dem Bodensee zurückgeführt werden.', 'Auch in Asien ist die Art im Rückgang begriffen; um die Jahrtausendwende ist die Art als Wildform in Japan ausgestorben, nachgewiesen ist sie noch in Bengalen.', 'In Australien sind die Vorkommen der Wasserfalle noch ungestört. Sie kommt dort sowohl in tropischen Formen (z. B. um Darwin oder in Queensland) als auch subtropisch (z. B. um Esperance) vor.', 'Über detaillierte Standorte der Pflanze in Afrika ist wenig bekannt. Berichtete Vorkommen ziehen sich von Nordostafrika bis nach Zentral- (Sudan, Uganda, Ruanda, Tansania, Simbabwe, Mosambik) und Südafrika (z. B. das Okavango-Delta in Botswana). Aufgrund der vergleichsweise ungestörten afrikanischen Flora und der geringen Agrarisierung des Kontinents ist eine Gefährdung der Art dort als unwahrscheinlich anzusehen.', 'In Australien und allen europäischen Ländern, in denen sie noch existiert, ist die Art streng geschützt.', 'Paläobotanik.', 'Anhand von fossilen Samen- und Pollenfunden lässt sich die Evolution der Gattung weit zurückverfolgen. Mitte der 1980er Jahre wurden im heutigen Tschechien Samenfragmente einer Art aus dem Ende der Kreidezeit gefunden, die als der älteste bekannte Vorgänger der Gattung gedeutet wurden und zugleich den zweitältesten Fossilfund einer karnivoren Art überhaupt darstellten. Die als \\"Palaeoaldrovanda splendens\\" beschriebene Pflanze wäre demnach eine Zeitgenossin der Dinosaurier gewesen und hätte unter tropischen Bedingungen gelebt. Eine Studie aus dem Jahr 2010 zeigte jedoch, dass die vermeintlichen Samenfragmente keiner näher verwandten Droseraceae zuzuordnen sind, sondern dass es sich mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit um die fossilen Eier eines Insektes handelt.', 'Das durch vor 65 Millionen Jahren an der Kreide-Tertiär-Grenze ausgelöste Massensterben beeinträchtigte das weitere Gedeihen dieser Gattung nicht. Fast zwanzig weitere Arten sind aus dem frühen Känozoikum bekannt. Die trennten sich bereits im Eozän in die Sektionen Aldrovanda, Obliquae und Clavatae. Ob nun Warm- oder Kaltzeiten folgten, die Gattung blieb stets mit mehreren Arten präsent. Selbst im Pleistozän, dem unserer Gegenwart vorausgehenden Eiszeitalter, lassen sich noch sechs Arten nachweisen, von denen jedoch nur \\"A. vesiculosa\\" bis in die Gegenwart überlebte.', 'Da auf Grund der geringen Masse der Pflanzen stets nur Samen oder Pollen fossil erhalten sind, lässt sich kaum eine Aussage über die frühere Gestalt der Pflanzen treffen. Umso bedeutender war der bisher einzigartige Fund eines fossilen Blattes einer ca. 6 Millionen Jahre alten \\"Aldrovanda inopinata\\" aus dem Miozän. Dieser Fund wurde 1963 in Wackersdorf gemacht. Das Blatt ist dem der heutigen Art sehr ähnlich; ein wichtiger Unterschied liegt jedoch im Fehlen der sensiblen Härchen im Zentrum der Blattspreite.', 'Botanische Geschichte.', 'Entdeckt wurde die Wasserfalle 1699 von Leonard Plukenet in Indien, der sie \\"Lenticula palustris Indica\\" nannte. Ihren heutigen wissenschaftlichen Namen erhielt sie 1747 durch Giuseppe Monti, der italienische Exemplare beschrieb und zu Ehren des italienischen Gelehrten Ulisse Aldrovandi \\"Aldrovandia vesiculosa\\" nannte. Bei der Übernahme des Namens durch Carl von Linné im Jahre 1753 ging allerdings das erste „i“ des Namens verloren. Ihr erster Nachweis in Deutschland erfolgte 1846 in einem Teich in Pleß (Pszczyna) in Oberschlesien durch Emanuel Friedrich Hausleutner.', 'Systematik.', 'Charles Darwin führte noch eine Unterscheidung der tropischen und subtropischen Formen der Wasserfalle von der temperierten Form unter den Bezeichnungen \\"Aldrovanda vesiculosa\\" var. \\"australis\\" bzw. \\"Aldrovanda vesiculosa\\" var. \\"verticillata\\" an. Von dieser Systematik ist man abgekommen; heutzutage werden trotz unterschiedlicher Wuchsformen alle Wasserfallen als ein Taxon geführt.', 'Die nächstverwandte Art der Wasserfalle ist die morphologisch ähnliche Venusfliegenfalle.', 'Verwendung.', 'Wie alle fleischfressenden Pflanzen ist auch die Wasserfalle Gegenstand des Interesses von Sammlern. In den 1990er Jahren wurde die Art verstärkt in Sammlungen aufgenommen, nachdem australische Typen importiert wurden, deren tropische bzw. subtropische Wuchsform ein Durchkultivieren unter gleichmäßigen Bedingungen ohne Winterruhe ermöglichte.

Ausnahmen stellen Karotten, Äpfel und Tomaten dar, in denen sich der Erreger nicht hält.', 'Lebensmittel tierischer Herkunft sind zumeist sekundär kontaminiert, werden also erst bei der Verarbeitung mit Listerien beimpft. Besonders gefährdet sind Rohmilch und Butter. Milchprodukte wie Hartkäse, Joghurt und Quark gelten dagegen als sicher. Die ordnungsgemäße Pasteurisierung tötet Listerien zuverlässig ab. Pasteurisierte Milch kann aber im Haushalt wieder kontaminiert werden, wodurch es auch bei Kühlschranklagerung zu einer Anreicherung mit Listerien kommen kann. Mayonnaise, Geflügelfleisch und kurzgereifte Rohwürste (Teewurst, Mettwurst) sind ebenfalls kritische Lebensmittel. Vor allem auf den Oberflächen von Roh- und Weichkäsen und Salami können sich Listerien vermehren und Kolonien bilden. Da in solchen Fällen nur jene Menschen erkranken, die zufällig ein Stück mit Kolonien verzehren, andere, die das gleiche Lebensmittel auch essen, jedoch nicht, ist die Aufklärung hier besonders schwierig.

In der jüngeren Zeit wurde dabei eine Zunahme der Listeriosefälle infolge von Lebensmittelinfektionen beobachtet, während die Anzahl der Neugeborenen- und Schwangereninfektionen (siehe unten) konstant blieb. Erstere stellen im Regelfall Einzelerkrankungen, zumeist bei älteren Menschen dar. Die Ursache für diese Zunahme ist nicht bekannt. In den Vereinigten Staaten ist \\"L. monocytogenes\\" für 28 % der durch Lebensmittel verursachten Todesfälle verantwortlich.

Innerhalb der Zellen (intrazellulär) überlebt \\"L. monocytogenes\\" in membranumhüllten Vakuolen und ist so vor den Mechanismen der unspezifischen Abwehr geschützt, selbst in Makrophagen kann der Erreger dem intrazellulären Abbau widerstehen.', 'Bei Vorhandensein bestimmter Virulenzfaktoren (Listeriolysin, Phospholipase) verlässt der Erreger diese Membranhüllen und vermehrt sich im Zytoplasma befallener Zellen. Dabei entstehen im Darm verstreut (disseminiert) Granulome („Listeriome“). Von diesen verteilt sich der Erreger über das Blut (Bakteriämie) und besiedelt andere Organe. Listerien haben die Fähigkeit, sich an die Enden der Aktinfilamente des Zellgerüsts anzukoppeln und sich dadurch innerhalb der Zellen zu bewegen. Da Aktinfilamente auch in bestimmte Zellkontakte einstrahlen, sind Listerien in der Lage, auch in Nachbarzellen einzudringen, und überwinden so auch anatomische Barrieren wie die Blut-Hirn-Schranke und die Plazenta.', 'Der Körper reagiert auf das Eindringen des Erregers mit einer Immunreaktion und entwickelt im Normalfall eine zelluläre Immunität.

Zum Ausbruch der Krankheit kommt es im Regelfall nur bei einem geschwächten Immunsystem.

Auf dem Inseli errichteten sie die Burg Stein, zusätzlich nahe dem Südufer die «alte Burg», wo sich eine Siedlung zu entwickeln begann. Bekanntester Vertreter des Geschlechts ist Rudolf von Rheinfelden, ab 1057 Herzog von Schwaben und ab 1077 Gegenkönig des römisch-deutschen Reiches.

Ihre Glaubensrichtung selbst wird als Sunnitentum oder Sunnismus bezeichnet. Die Bezeichnung ist von dem arabischen Wort Sunna (‚Brauch, Handlungsweise, überlieferte Norm, Tradition‘) abgeleitet. Die Sunniten sehen sich als diejenigen, die der \\"sunnat an-nabī\\", der „Sunna des Propheten“ (Mohammed), folgen. Neben \\"ahl as-sunna\\" wird im Arabischen auch häufig der erweiterte Ausdruck \\"ahl as-sunna wal-ǧamāʿa\\" („Leute der Sunna und der Gemeinschaft“) verwendet. Wenn die Sunniten als Kollektiv der Schia gegenübergestellt werden, werden sie manchmal auch nur als \\"as-Sunna\\" („die Sunna“) bezeichnet. Im Bereich der Normenlehre und der Dogmatik gibt es unter den Sunniten mehrere Lehrrichtungen. Über die Frage, welche dogmatischen Lehrrichtungen dem Sunnitentum angehören, besteht unter den muslimischen Gelehrten allerdings keine Einigkeit. Die sunnitischen Glaubenslehren werden in verschiedenen Glaubensbekenntnissen dargestellt, die sich jedoch in Einzelheiten je nach dogmatischer Ausrichtung der Autoren unterscheiden.', 'Heute gelten die Schiiten als die wichtigste Gegengruppe zu den Sunniten, allerdings hat sich das sunnitische Selbstbewusstsein im Mittelalter nicht nur in Absetzung zu den Schiiten, sondern auch zu den Charidschiten, Qadariten und Murdschi'iten herausgebildet. Die Sunniten verstehen sich hierbei als „die gerettete Sekte“ \\"(al-firqa an-nāǧiya)\\" und die Mitte der Muslime. Seit Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts gibt es heftige Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den Aschʿariten und den Salafisten, die sich gegenseitig aus dem Sunnitentum ausschließen. Die Rivalität zwischen den beiden Gruppen wurde auch auf zwei Sunnitenkonferenzen im Jahre 2016 sichtbar: Während bei der Sunnitenkonferenz von Grosny im August 2016 die Takfīr betreibenden Salafisten, darunter auch die IS-Organisation, aus dem sunnitischen Islam ausgeschlossen wurden, fand wenige Monate später in Kuweit eine zweite Sunnitenkonferenz statt, bei der der Salafismus zur einzig wahren Form des Sunnitentums erklärt wurde.', 'Verbreitung.', 'Nach Schätzungen des Pew Research Center aus dem Jahre 2009 sind 87–90 % aller Muslime weltweit Sunniten. Sunniten stellen in den meisten islamischen Ländern die Mehrheit der Muslime (siehe Liste der Länder nach muslimischer Bevölkerung), allerdings hat eine Umfrage des Pew Research Center von 2012 ergeben, dass die sunnitische Identität bei der muslimischen Bevölkerung nicht in allen diesen Ländern gleich stark ausgeprägt ist. Bei dieser Umfrage wurden Muslime aufgefordert, sich selbst einer der folgenden Kategorien zuzuordnen: „sunnitisch“, „schiitisch“ oder „etwas anderes“. Während sich in Jordanien, Bangladesch und Afghanistan, Türkei und Ägypten rund 90 % Prozent der Muslime als Sunniten betrachten, war dieser Anteil in Ländern wie Kasachstan (16 %), Usbekistan (18 %), Mali (20 %), Indonesien (26 %) und Nigeria (38 %), die ebenfalls als Länder mit sunnitischer Bevölkerungsmehrheit gelten, erheblich geringer. Viele befragte Muslime lehnten es dort ab, sich einer speziellen konfessionellen Gruppe zuzuordnen, und sagten bei der Befragung von sich aus, dass sie „nur Muslime“ seien.', 'Die einzigen Länder, in denen die Sunniten auch statistisch nicht die größte muslimische Bevölkerungsgruppe stellen, sind Irak, Iran, Oman, Libanon, Aserbaidschan und Bahrain. Im Irak gehören fast zwei Drittel der Bevölkerung der Zwölfer-Schia an, doch gibt es auch Regionen wie das Sunnitische Dreieck im Nordwesten des Landes, in denen die Sunniten die Bevölkerungsmehrheit stellen. In Iran stellen die Sunniten ungefähr 9 % der Bevölkerung. Die meisten Sunniten gehören den Volksgruppen der Kurden, Belutschen und Turkmenen an und leben in den nordwestlichen und südöstlichen Grenzregionen des Landes, allerdings gibt es auch unter den Persern und Arabern Sunniten. In Bahrain sind ca. 75 % der Bevölkerung schiitisch, doch wird das politische Leben seit dem 18. Jahrhundert von wenigen tribalen sunnitischen Familien beherrscht.', 'Nach Angabe von REMID leben in Deutschland ungefähr 2,64 Millionen Sunniten. Nach dem Religionsmonitor 2017 der Bertelsmann Stiftung, die sich auf Befragungen von Muslimen stützt, liegt der Anteil der Sunniten unter den Muslimen in Deutschland bei 61 %. Bei einer Gesamtzahl von 4,4 bis 4,7 Millionen Muslimen in Deutschland ergibt dies eine Gesamtzahl von 2,684 bis 2,867 Millionen Sunniten. In Österreich liegt der Anteil der Sunniten unter den Muslimen nach dem Religionsmonitor bei 64 % (in absoluten Zahlen: ca. 320.000), in der Schweiz bei 51 % (in absoluten Zahlen: 172.380). In Vereinigten Königreich liegt der Anteil der Sunniten bei 75 % (entspricht 2,25 Millionen), in Frankreich bei 52 % (entspricht 2,756 Millionen).', 'Lehrrichtungen.', 'Im Bereich der Normenlehre.', 'Im Bereich der Normenlehre (Fiqh) werden heute allgemein vier Lehrrichtungen als sunnitisch anerkannt, nämlich diejenigen der Hanafiten, der Mālikiten, der Schāfiʿiten und der Hanbaliten. Unterschiede zwischen diesen Lehrrichtungen zeigen sich nicht nur bei rechtlichen Fragen, sondern auch auf ritueller Ebene, so zum Beispiel beim rituellen Gebet und den Reinheitsbestimmungen.', 'Diese Vierer-Zahl stand allerdings keineswegs schon immer fest. So rechnete zum Beispiel ʿAbd al-Qāhir al-Baghdādī (gest. 1037) neben diesen vier Gruppen auch die Anhänger von al-Auzāʿī (gest. 774), Sufyān ath-Thaurī (gest. 778), Ibn Abī Lailā (gest. 765) und Abū Thaur (gest. 854) sowie die Zahiriten zu den Sunniten. Das System von vier sunnitischen Lehrrichtungen im Fiqh lässt sich bis ins späte 12. Jahrhundert zurückverfolgen. In dieser Zeit berichtet der andalusische Reisende Ibn Dschubair von „vier sunnitischen Imamen“ im Haram von Mekka, die dort eigene Gebetsgruppen anführten.', 'Im Bereich der Glaubenslehre.', 'Die Lehre von den drei Gruppen.', 'Hinsichtlich der Frage, welche dogmatischen Richtungen den Sunniten zuzurechnen sind, besteht unter den muslimischen Gelehrten keine Einigkeit. Seit der frühen Neuzeit ist die Vorstellung nachweisbar, dass insgesamt drei Gruppen den Sunniten zugehören: 1. die nach Abū l-Hasan al-Aschʿarī (gest. 935) benannten Aschʿariten, 2. die nach Abū Mansūr al-Māturīdī (gest. 941) benannten Māturīditen und 3. eine unterschiedlich benannte dritte Gruppe, die traditionalistisch orientiert ist und die von Māturīditen und Aschʿariten befürwortete rationale Spekulation des Kalām ablehnt. Der syrische Gelehrte ʿAbd al-Bāqī Ibn Faqīh Fussa (gest. 1661) bezeichnet diese dritte traditionalistische Gruppe als Hanbaliten. Sein ein Jahrhundert später lebender Landsmann Muhammad ibn Ahmad as-Saffārīnī (gest. 1774) verwendet für sie den Namen Atharīya, der von dem arabischen Wort für die tradierten Überlieferungen \\"(āṯār)\\" abgeleitet ist; allerdings meint er damit ebenfalls die Anhänger von Ahmad ibn Hanbal.', 'Der spätosmanische Denker İsmail Hakkı İzmirli (gest. 1946), der ebenfalls die Lehre von den drei Gruppen des Sunnitentums vertrat, nannte die traditionalistische Gruppe Salafīya, verwendete als Alternativnamen aber auch Atharīya. Bei der Māturīdīya gibt er \\"Nasafīya\\" als einen möglichen Alternativnamen an.', 'Ein weiterer Name, der für die traditionalistisch orientierte Gruppe verwendet wird, ist „Leute des Hadith“ \\"(ahl al-ḥadīṯ)\\". Er wird zum Beispiel im Abschlussdokument der Konferenz von Grosny verwendet. Allerdings wird hier nur denjenigen „Leuten des Hadith“ die Zugehörigkeit zum Sunnitentum zugesprochen, die \\"tafwīḍ\\" betreiben, also bei den mehrdeutigen Aussagen des Korans auf Interpretation verzichten.', 'Engere Definitionen.', 'Daneben gab es muslimische Gelehrte, die den Sunniten-Begriff allein auf die Aschʿariten und Māturīditen beschränken wollten. So schrieb zum Beispiel Murtadā az-Zabīdī (gest. 1790) in seinem Kommentar zu al-Ghazālīs \\"Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm ad-dīn\\": „Wenn [sc. der Begriff] \\"ahl as-sunna wal-ǧamāʿa\\" verwendet wird, dann sind damit die Aschʿariten und Māturīditen gemeint.“ Diese Position wurde im Juli 2013 auch vom Ägyptischen Fatwa-Amt übernommen. In osmanischer Zeit wurden viele Bemühungen unternommen, zwischen den Lehren der Aschʿarīya und der Māturīdīya weitgehende Harmonie herzustellen.', 'Schließlich gab es die Sichtweise, dass allein die Aschʿariten Sunniten sind. So schreibt Averroes (gest. 1198) in seiner Abhandlung \\"al-Kašf ʿan manāhiǧ al-adilla fī ʿaqāʾid al-milla\\" („Enthüllung der Beweismethoden hinsichtlich Glaubenssätze der Gemeinschaft“), dass von den zahlreichen Gruppen, in die die islamische Gemeinschaft in seiner Zeit zerfallen sei, die Aschʿariten diejenigen seien, die die meisten Menschen für die Sunniten \\"(ahl as-sunna)\\" hielten. Später erklärte der marokkanische Sufi Ahmad ibn ʿAdschība (gest. 1809) in seinem Kommentar zur Fātiha: „Was die Sunniten betrifft, so sind es die Aschʿariten und diejenigen, die ihnen in ihrer richtigen Glaubensüberzeugung folgen.“ Allerdings gab es umgekehrt auch Gelehrte, die die Aschʿariten aus dem Sunnitentum ausschlossen. So meinte Ibn Hazm (gest. 1064), dass Abū l-Hasan al-Aschʿarī den Murdschi'a zugehöre, und zwar denjenigen, die den Sunniten glaubensmäßig besonders fernständen.', 'Sunniten im allgemeinen und im speziellen Sinne.', 'Der hanbalitische Gelehrte Ibn Taimīya (gest. 1328) unterschied in seinem Werk \\"Minhāǧ as-sunna\\" zwischen Sunniten im allgemeinen Sinne \\"(ahl as-sunna al-ʿāmma)\\" und Sunniten im speziellen Sinne \\"(ahl as-sunna al-ḫāṣṣa)\\".

An dem fiktiven, literarisch gestalteten Dialog beteiligen sich sieben Personen, darunter Platons Brüder Glaukon und Adeimantos und der Redner Thrasymachos. Platons Lehrer Sokrates ist die Hauptfigur. Weitere Anwesende hören lediglich zu.', 'Die \\"Politeia\\" ist die erste abendländische Schrift, die ein ausgearbeitetes Konzept der politischen Philosophie vorstellt. Sie ist ein Grundlagentext der Naturrechtslehre und zählt zu den wirkmächtigsten Werken der gesamten Philosophiegeschichte. Im 20. Jahrhundert wurde intensiv und kontrovers darüber diskutiert, inwieweit sich die modernen Begriffe Totalitarismus, Kommunismus und Feminismus auf Positionen in dem antiken Dialog anwenden lassen. Liberale, sozialistische und marxistische Kritiker haben das Konzept des Idealstaats angegriffen. Die neuere Forschung distanziert sich von diesen weltanschaulich gefärbten, teils polemischen Debatten und Bewertungen. Ferner ist umstritten, ob es sich bei der \\"Politeia\\" um ein rein utopisches Modell oder zumindest ansatzweise um ein politisches Programm handelt.', 'Der in zehn Bücher gegliederte Dialog besteht aus zwei sehr unterschiedlichen Teilen. Am Anfang (Buch 1) führt Sokrates mit Thrasymachos ein Streitgespräch über die Frage, wie die Gerechtigkeit zu definieren sei. Im Hauptteil (Bücher 2–10) bemühen sich Sokrates, Glaukon und Adeimantos, die Natur der Gerechtigkeit zu bestimmen und ihren Wert zu erfassen. Sokrates meint, Gerechtigkeit sei zwar in der Seele des Menschen zu finden, doch im sozialen Kontext, im Staat, sei sie leichter erkennbar. Daher lenkt er das Gespräch auf die Frage, unter welchen Voraussetzungen im Staat Gerechtigkeit zustande kommt. Nach seinem Verständnis ist ein zusammengesetztes Ganzes dann gerecht, wenn jeder Teil seine naturgemäße Aufgabe erfüllt. Davon ausgehend entwirft Sokrates das Modell eines ständisch geordneten idealen Staates. Dessen Bevölkerung ist in drei Teile gegliedert: den Stand der Bauern und Handwerker, den Stand der Krieger oder Wächter und den Stand der „Philosophenherrscher“, die als kleine Elite aus dem Wächterstand hervorgehen und den Staat regieren. Zu den Kernelementen des Konzepts zählen zwei Bestimmungen, die nur für die Wächter und die Herrscher gelten: die Aufhebung des Privateigentums und die Abschaffung der Familie, die als elementare soziale Einheit beseitigt wird. Die herkömmlichen Aufgaben der Familie, insbesondere die gesamte Erziehung der Kinder, übernimmt die Gemeinschaft des Wächterstandes. Ein weiteres markantes Merkmal ist die Zensur: Dichtung, die sich auf die Charakterbildung ungünstig auswirken kann, wird nicht zugelassen.', 'In Analogie zum dreiteiligen Aufbau des idealen Staates beschreibt Platons Dialogfigur Sokrates die Struktur der Seele, die ebenfalls aus drei Teilen zusammengesetzt sei. In diesem Modell wird die Verschiedenartigkeit der Menschentypen und der zu ihnen passenden Staatsformen auf unterschiedliche Machtverhältnisse zwischen den Seelenteilen zurückgeführt. Die Seele ist diesem Verständnis zufolge unsterblich und kann zur Ideenwelt Zugang finden, einem metaphysischen Bereich, in dem sich die ewigen, unveränderlichen „platonischen Ideen“ befinden. Die Ideenlehre, die Platon hier seinem Lehrer in den Mund legt, bildet einen Kernbestandteil seiner eigenen Philosophie, nicht der des historischen Sokrates. Eine zentrale Rolle spielt darin die Idee des Guten. Aus didaktischem Grund wird diese anspruchsvolle Thematik mit drei Gleichnissen veranschaulicht: dem Sonnengleichnis, dem Liniengleichnis und dem Höhlengleichnis.', 'Ort und Zeit.', 'Der Schauplatz des Dialogs ist das Haus des Polemarchos, eines reichen Metöken, in der zu Athen gehörenden Hafenstadt Piräus. Die Zeit der fiktiven Dialoghandlung ist unklar und in der Forschung umstritten, da die chronologisch relevanten Angaben im Text widersprüchlich sind. Jedenfalls fällt die Handlung in die Zeit des Peloponnesischen Krieges, der mit Unterbrechungen von 431 bis 404 v. Chr. dauerte. Es ist von einer Schlacht bei Megara die Rede, an der Glaukon und Adeimantos teilgenommen haben. Im Rahmen einer historisch korrekten Chronologie kann damit nur die Schlacht von 409 v. Chr. gemeint sein, denn zur Zeit früherer Kampfhandlungen am selben Ort, die 424 v. Chr. stattfanden, waren Platons Brüder noch Kinder. Andererseits war aber der alte Kephalos, einer der Gesprächspartner, 409 v. Chr. bereits seit Jahren tot. Dieser Widerspruch bildet einen nicht auflösbaren Anachronismus. Das ist aber nicht problematisch, denn Platon nahm sich auch sonst gern die Freiheit, in seinen literarischen Werken chronologisch unstimmige Angaben zu machen. Möglicherweise war das erste Buch der \\"Politeia\\", in dem Kephalos auftritt, ursprünglich ein separates Werk mit dramatischem Datum in den 420er Jahren; dann kann das im restlichen Teil des Dialogs dargestellte Gespräch mit der Erwähnung der Schlacht bei Megara um 408/407 datiert werden.', 'Die Gesprächsteilnehmer.', 'Sokrates ist – wie in den meisten Dialogen Platons – die stark dominierende Hauptfigur. Er lenkt das Gespräch auf die Thematik, um die es ihm geht, und steuert die wesentlichen Einfälle bei. Zu seinem Gedankengut zählen das Modell des Ständestaats und das Konzept der dreiteiligen Seele ebenso wie die Ideenlehre und die Kritik an der Dichtung. Historisch gesehen handelt es sich bei der Ideenlehre allerdings um einen Hauptbestandteil der platonischen Philosophie, den Platon sicher nicht von seinem Lehrer Sokrates übernommen, sondern selbst entwickelt hat. Dieser Umstand zeigt, dass die Auffassungen, die der Autor seiner Dialogfigur Sokrates in den Mund legt, nicht ohne weiteres mit denen des historischen Sokrates gleichgesetzt werden dürfen.', 'Zwar sind nicht alle Äußerungen der Dialogfigur Sokrates als Meinungsäußerungen Platons zu verstehen, doch ihre Kerngedanken entsprechen zweifellos seinen Überzeugungen.', 'Unter den übrigen Beteiligten hat Glaukon quantitativ den größten Anteil an der Diskussion. Seine Beiträge sind auch philosophisch gewichtiger als die der anderen Gesprächspartner des Sokrates. In der \\"Politeia\\" wird Glaukon als liebeserfahren, gebildet, streitlustig und im Auftreten sehr entschieden beschrieben. Er erweist sich im Gespräch als ehrgeizig, optimistisch, geradlinig und erfolgsbewusst. Inwieweit diese Eigenschaften der Dialogfigur dem historischen Glaukon zukamen, ist unbekannt. Dieser war ein Bruder Platons, gehörte also einer vornehmen Familie Athens an.', 'Eine weniger bedeutende Rolle spielt Adeimantos. Der historische Adeimantos wurde wohl um 432 geboren, er war der ältere der beiden Brüder Platons. Im Dialog wird er als ehrliebend und statusbewusst dargestellt. Er will zwar Ansehen genießen, empfindet aber große Anstrengungen als abschreckend. Die gewichtigen Verpflichtungen eines Bürgers des platonischen Idealstaats würde er auf sich nehmen, sofern sein sozialer Rang unangetastet bliebe. Bei den philosophischen Erörterungen zeigt er sich skeptisch, er ist schwer von seinen Überzeugungen abzubringen, nachdenklich und von ernster Gesinnung. Er denkt pragmatisch und wägt die Vor- und Nachteile von Verhaltensoptionen nüchtern, umsichtig und realistisch ab.', 'Der Redner Thrasymachos beteiligt sich nur im ersten Buch an der Debatte, später hört er – abgesehen von zwei knappen Einwürfen im fünften Buch – schweigend zu. Er tritt grob auf und diskutiert polemisch. Zwischen ihm und Sokrates entzündet sich eine Kontroverse in gespannter Atmosphäre. Sein konfrontativer Stil prägt einen großen Teil des ersten Buches, während ab dem zweiten Buch Sokrates, Glaukon und Adeimantos konstruktiv und freundschaftlich bei der Wahrheitssuche zusammenwirken. Als reiner Machtmensch ist Thrasymachos zumindest prima facie ethischen Erwägungen nicht zugänglich, für ihn ist der Vorrang selbstsüchtiger Motive eine offenkundige Naturgegebenheit; dabei ist in der Forschung unterschiedlich bewertet worden, ob der platonische Thrasymachos überhaupt eine und wenn ja, welche normative Position vertritt.', 'Der historische Thrasymachos ist in mehreren Quellen bezeugt. Er stammte aus Chalkedon, einer bedeutenden Hafenstadt in Kleinasien. In Athen, wo er möglicherweise auch als Diplomat für seine Heimatstadt auftrat, machte er sich als Redner und Rhetoriklehrer einen Namen. Er verfasste ein Lehrbuch der Rhetorik. Politisch setzte er sich für die Autonomie der griechischen Städte ein und wandte sich gegen Angriffskriege und imperialistische Bestrebungen.', 'Der mit Sokrates befreundete Greis Kephalos und sein Sohn Polemarchos, in dessen Haus der Dialog stattfindet, sind in der \\"Politeia\\" Randfiguren, die nur im ersten Buch an der Diskussion teilnehmen. Bei beiden handelt es sich um historische Gestalten. Der historische Kephalos stammte aus Syrakus und war ein außerordentlich erfolgreicher Geschäftsmann, unter den Familien der in Attika wohnhaften Ausländer war seine die reichste. Seinem Sohn wurde der Reichtum zum Verhängnis: Während der Herrschaft der Dreißig, einer Zeit des Terrors, wurde Polemarchos 404 v. Chr. ohne Anklage und Gerichtsverfahren hingerichtet, sein Vermögen wurde konfisziert.', 'Außerdem greift im ersten Buch der \\"Politeia\\" Kleitophon kurz in die Debatte ein. Wie Thrasymachos tritt er als Widersacher des Sokrates auf. Der historische Kleitophon war ein gemäßigt oligarchischer Politiker. Er wurde von dem Komödiendichter Aristophanes als schlauer Pragmatiker dargestellt.', 'Inhalt.', 'Unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Gesprächsführung zerfällt das Werk in zwei verschiedenartige Teile: das anfängliche Streitgespräch über die Gerechtigkeit und den Hauptteil, in dem das Modell des Idealstaats dargelegt wird und bestehende Verfassungsformen analysiert werden. Inhaltlich ist die Klammer, die das Ganze zusammenhält, die Untersuchung der Frage, worin die Gerechtigkeit besteht und was sie erstrebenswert macht. Ein Leitmotiv ist die Parallelität zwischen der Gerechtigkeit im Staat und der Gerechtigkeit innerhalb der Seele. Für den als Stadtstaat (Polis) konzipierten Idealstaat wird an einer einzigen Stelle die Bezeichnung „Kallipolis“ („Schönstadt“) verwendet, die als Name historischer antiker Städte bezeugt ist.

Insgesamt enthält die Atmosphäre etwa 400 Megatonnen (Mt). Auf der Nordhalbkugel liegt die mittlere Konzentration heute bei 140 ppbv, vor der Industrialisierung waren es etwa 90 ppbv. Auf der Südhalbkugel blieb die mittlere Konzentration mit 50 ppbv auf ihrem natürlichen Niveau.', 'Das Satelliten-Instrument \\"Terra’s Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere\\" (MOPITT) erstellte die erste globale Karte für die CO-Konzentration in der niedrigeren Erdatmosphäre. Die MOPITT-Abbildung anbei zeigt die durchschnittliche CO-Konzentration von April, Mai und Juni für die Jahre 2000 bis 2004.', 'Kohlenstoffmonoxid hat eine mittlere atmosphärische Lebensdauer von etwa zwei Monaten. Die wichtigste Reaktion ist die mit Hydroxyl-Radikalen in der Atmosphäre, wodurch jährlich 2300 Mt (2000–2800 Mt) Kohlenstoffmonoxid zu Kohlenstoffdioxid oxidiert werden. Böden tragen zur CO-Oxidation mit etwa 300 Mt (200–600 Mt) jährlich bei. Die Oxidationsgeschwindigkeit hängt von der Konzentration der Hydroxyl-Radikale ab, die mit stärkerer Sonneneinstrahlung und höherem Wasserdampfgehalt zunimmt. In den Tropen beträgt die Lebensdauer etwa einen Monat, in gemäßigten und nördlichen Breiten bewegt sie sich zwischen zwei Monaten im Sommer und mehr als einem Jahr im Winter. Für den Ausgleich der Kohlenstoffmonoxidkonzentrationen zwischen Nord- und Südhalbkugel wäre eine mittlere atmosphärische Lebensdauer von ungefähr einem Jahr erforderlich. Die höheren anthropogenen Emissionen auf der Nordhalbkugel führen daher zu einem deutlichen Konzentrationsunterschied zwischen den Hemisphären. Durch Wettereinflüsse wie den indischen Monsun und durch Emissionen von Ballungszentren gibt es regional, etwa in Ostasien, erhebliche Konzentrationsunterschiede.', 'Weltweit gelangen jährlich etwa 2500 Megatonnen (2000–2900 Mt) Kohlenstoffmonoxid in die Atmosphäre oder werden dort gebildet. Etwa die Hälfte davon entsteht bei der unvollständigen Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe oder von Biomasse, auch bei Wald- und Buschbränden. Ein weiterer großer Anteil wird erst in der Atmosphäre durch die Oxidation von Kohlenwasserstoffen wie Methan oder anderen flüchtigen organischen Verbindungen gebildet. Insgesamt sind etwa 60 % des Kohlenstoffmonoxids vom Menschen verursacht, der Rest ist natürlichen Ursprungs.', 'Angaben zu den globalen Emissionsraten beruhen auf Schätzungen und sind mit Unsicherheitsfaktoren behaftet. So werden die Kohlenstoffmonoxid-Emissionen aus dem Verkehr mit 500 Mt (300–600 Mt) angegeben, stationäre Anlagen zur Energiegewinnung aus fossilen Brennstoffen emittieren 100 Mt (80–200 Mt), die Biomasseverbrennung 600 Mt (300–800 Mt).

Außerhalb der Trockengebiete überwiegt der Abbau durch Prokaryoten, abhängig vom Sauerstoff- und Wassergehalt des Bodens entweder durch Reduktion zu Methan (Methanbildner) oder durch die Oxidation zu Kohlendioxid.', 'Ozeane sind in Bezug auf Kohlenstoffmonoxid übersättigt. Im Atlantischen Ozean beträgt die Konzentration etwa das zehn- bis vierzigfache der atmosphärischen Gleichgewichtskonzentration, wobei biologische Quellen als Verursacher angenommen werden. Die Ozeane stellen demnach eine Quelle atmosphärischen Kohlenstoffmonoxids dar, deren Anteil auf 5 bis 29 % der durch Verbrennung freigesetzten Menge geschätzt wird.', 'In den Gasen hawaiianischer Vulkane wurde eine Konzentration von 3700 ppm (parts per million) Kohlenstoffmonoxid gemessen. Für die globale Bilanz spielen Vulkane keine Rolle.', 'Die Hauptinfrarotabsorptionsbande des Kohlenstoffmonoxids liegt bei einer Wellenzahl von 2143 cm−1 (Wellenlänge etwa 4,67 µm) und damit weit vom spektralen Maximum der Infrarotstrahlung der Erde, die bei einer Wellenzahl von ungefähr 1000 cm−1 (10 µm) liegt, entfernt. Kohlenstoffmonoxid trägt daher durch direkte Absorption nur wenig zum Treibhauseffekt bei. In der Troposphäre erfolgt die Oxidation von Kohlenwasserstoffen wie Methan zu Kohlenstoffdioxid ebenfalls über Hydroxyl-Radikale. Als Zwischenprodukt entsteht bei der Methanoxidation ebenfalls Kohlenstoffmonoxid. Der Effekt des Kohlenstoffmonoxids bezüglich des Treibhauseffekts liegt in seiner Bedeutung als Senke für diese Hydroxyl-Radikale, die dadurch der Umwandlung von direkten Treibhausgasen wie Methan nicht mehr zur Verfügung stehen. Auch Methanol, nach Methan das zweithäufigste organische Gas in der Erdatmosphäre, das in Konzentrationen von 0,1 bis 10 ppbv vorkommt, ist eine bedeutende atmosphärische Quelle für Kohlenstoffmonoxid, wobei ein Großteil des Methanols von Pflanzen emittiert wird.', 'In städtischen Umgebungen können durch unbehandelte Autoabgase die Werte zwischen 100 und 200 ppm liegen. Die Konzentration von Kohlenstoffmonoxid im unverdünnten Abgas eines Automobils ohne Abgaskatalysator beträgt etwa 7000 ppm. Bei Fahrzeugen mit Drei-Wege-Katalysator und richtig eingestellter Lambdasondenregelung dient Kohlenstoffmonoxid im Idealfall zur Reduktion der Stickoxide, wobei es selbst zu Kohlenstoffdioxid oxidiert wird.

Wie alle Salze bestehen sie aus Anionen und Kationen. Durch deren Variation können die physikalisch-chemischen Eigenschaften einer ionischen Flüssigkeit in weiten Grenzen variiert und auf technische Anforderungen hin optimiert werden. Ionische Flüssigkeiten werden vor allem als Lösungsmittel verwendet und auf Grund ihrer strukturellen Vielfalt auch als \\"designer solvents\\" bezeichnet. So können sie zum Lösen von Cellulose und in elektrochemischen Prozessen eingesetzt werden. Auf Grund ihres geringen Dampfdrucks werden sie auch als grüne Lösungsmittel bezeichnet, dem entgegen steht jedoch ihr Bioakkumulationspotential sowie ihre Toxizität. Aktuelle Forschung beschäftigt sich mit der Synthese von biokompatiblen ionischen Flüssigkeiten.', 'Ionische Flüssigkeiten besitzen einen für Salze untypischen niedrigen Schmelzpunkt. Dieser kann durch den sterischen Anspruch, also die räumlich Ausdehnung der Ionen und durch Ladungsdelokalisierung in Anion und Kation erklärt werden. Bereits geringe thermische Energie genügt daher, um die Gitterenergie zu überwinden und die feste Kristallstruktur aufzubrechen.', 'Typische Kationen sind Imidazolium oder Pyridinium, Ammonium und Phosphonium. Als Anionen kommen Halogenide und schwach koordinierende Ionen, wie Tetrafluoroborate oder Hexafluorophosphate, aber auch Trifluoracetate, Triflate und Tosylate in Frage.', 'Geschichte.', 'Die neuere Geschichte der ionischen Flüssigkeiten lässt sich in drei Generationen gliedern, wobei die Grenzen fließend sind. Lediglich für die erste und zweite Generation lassen sich Publikationen finden, die den Beginn der Generation klar abstecken. Die Generationszählung beginnt allerdings erst in den 1980ern, als ionische Flüssigkeiten gezielt auf Grund ihrer Eigenschaften hergestellt und untersucht wurden. Die ersten Beschreibungen von Salzen, die die Definition der ionischen Flüssigkeiten erfüllen, wurden bereits 1876 publiziert.', 'Erste Beschreibungen (1876–1929).', 'William Ramsay beschrieb 1876 Picolin und seine Derivate, darunter Picoliniumtribromid und Picoliniumtriiodid. Die Herstellung erfolgt durch Mischen der Halogene mit den entsprechenden Picolin-Hydrohalogeniden, wodurch sich die Trihalogenidionen Br3− und I3− bilden. Für das Picoliniumtribromid wird ein Schmelzpunkt von etwa 85 °C, für das Picoliniumtriiodid von 79 °C angegeben. Durch Alkylierung von Picolin konnten 1899 weitere ionische Flüssigkeiten erhalten werden. Für 1-Propyl-2-picoliniumiodid konnte beispielsweise ein Schmelzpunkt von 77 °C berichtet werden. Auch das homologe 1-Butyl-2-picoliniumiodid ist mit einem Schmelzpunkt von 98 °C eine ionische Flüssigkeit. Eine analoge Verbindung mit einem Isobutylrest zeigt einen Schmelzpunkt von unter −15 °C und stellt damit die erste ionische Flüssigkeit dar, die bei Raumtemperatur flüssig ist.', 'Eine weitere Substanz, deren exakte Struktur und damit auch die Einordnung als ionische Flüssigkeit über 100 Jahre unbekannt blieb, ist das sogenannte \\"red oil\\" (dt. rotes Öl). Dieses fällt bei Friedel-Crafts-Alkylierungen als Nebenprodukt an, welche 1877 zum ersten Mal beschrieben wurden. Strukturell handelt es sich beim \\"red oil\\" um ein flüssiges Salz mit dem Wheland-Intermediat als Kation und einem Dialuminiumheptachlorid-Komplex als Anion.', '1888 folgten Synthese und Beschreibung von Ethanolammoniumnitrat mit einem Schmelzpunkt von 52 °C durch Gabriel und Weiner.', 'Trotz vorheriger Beschreibungen wird in der Literatur häufig Ethylammoniumnitrat (EAN) als erste ionische Flüssigkeit beschrieben. 1914 synthetisierte Paul Walden EAN, das einen Schmelzpunkt von 12 °C aufweist, durch Reaktion von Ethylamin und Salpetersäure. Zwar konnte Walden die Leitfähigkeit des EANs messen, allerdings blieb das Potential der ionischen Flüssigkeiten unentdeckt. Lediglich eine Studie über den Parachor (ein Maß für das Molvolumen bei gleicher Oberflächenspannung) einiger Salze von 1929 untersuchte die Eigenheiten von ionischen Flüssigkeiten.', 'Weitere Entwicklungen (1950–1972).', '1951 konnte die erste Anwendung einer ionischen Flüssigkeit beschrieben werden. Hurley und Wier mischten 1-Ethylpyridiniumbromid mit Aluminiumchlorid und erhielten so ionische Flüssigkeiten mit verschiedenen Zusammensetzungen. Beim Variieren der Mischungsverhältnisse von Aluminiumchlorid zum Ethylpyridiniumbromid fanden sie zwei Eutektika: eines beim Verhältnis von 1:2 mit einem Schmelzpunkt von 45 °C und ein weiteres beim Verhältnis 2:1 mit einem Schmelzpunkt von −40 °C. Die 1:1-Mischung schmilzt bei 88 °C und ist damit ebenfalls eine ionische Flüssigkeit. Diese ionischen Flüssigkeiten konnten zur elektrochemischen Abscheidung von Aluminium auf verschiedenen Metallen verwendet werden.', '1963 beschrieb Yoke die Reaktion von Triethylammoniumhydrochlorid mit Kupfer(I)-chlorid, welche in einem flüssigen Produkt resultierte. Da die Verbindung allerdings nicht luftstabil ist, da das Cu(I) oxidiert wird, wurde sie nicht weiter untersucht.', 'Eine erste ionische Flüssigkeit mit einem Tetrafluoroborat-Anion konnte 1966 von Kornblum und Coffey beschrieben werden. Durch Umsetzung des Natriumsalzes des 2-Pyridon mit Triethyloxoniumtetrafluorborat kann \\"N\\"-Ethyl-2-ethoxypyridiniumtetrafluoroborat gewonnen werden, das bei 47,5–48,5 °C schmilzt.', 'Die Anwendung von ionischen Flüssigkeiten als Lösungsmittel konnte erstmals 1972 gezeigt werden. Parshall gelang es, zwei ionische Flüssigkeiten auf Tetraethylammonium-Basis herzustellen. Als Anionen dienten Trichlorstannat und Trichlorgermanat. Insbesondere das Tetraethylammoniumstannat kann als Lösungsmittel verwendet werden, da es bis zu 7 Gewichtsprozent Platin(II)-chlorid lösen kann. Diese Lösung kann als katalytisch wirksames Reaktionsmedium für Olefine dienen, welche hydriert, hydroformyliert oder carboalkoxyliert werden können.', 'Erste Generation ionischer Flüssigkeiten (ab 1978).', 'Als erste Generation ionischer Flüssigkeiten werden Haloaluminate bezeichnet. Diese wurden zwar bereits 1951 von Hurley und Wier beschrieben, aber erst in den 1970ern rückten sie in den Fokus der Forschung. Die US Air Force Academy forschte bereits seit Anfang der 1960er an niedrig schmelzenden Elektrolyten für die Anwendung in Batterien unter anderem in Kooperation mit Robert Osteryoung. Die Publikationen beider Forschungsgruppen markieren den Start der modernen Ära der ionischen Flüssigkeiten: 1978 konnte Osteryoung erstmals das System Aluminiumchlorid:1-Butylpyridiniumchlorid (AlCl3-BPC) beschreiben und untersuchen. Im gleichen Jahr meldete die US Air Force das Patent \\"AlCl3 /1-alkyl pyridinium chloride room temperature electrolytes\\" an. Zwar schmelzen diese Salze früher als die bis dahin von der Air Force als Elektrolyte genutzten Mischungen aus Aluminiumchlorid und Natriumchlorid, allerdings ist die Mischung Aluminiumchlorid:1-Butylpyridiniumchlorid (1:1) nicht bei Raumtemperatur flüssig, sondern schmilzt erst bei 40 °C. Ein weiterer Nachteil ist das verschmälerte elektrochemische Fenster des Pyridinium-Kations, das reduziert werden kann. Die Gruppe um Wilkes und Hussey begann darauf hin mit der Suche nach einem geeigneteren Kation, das gegenüber dem Aluminium reduktionsstabil ist. Durch semi-empirische Molekülorbital-Rechnungen konnten sie 1982 Dialkylimidazolium-Kationen als geeignete Kandidaten ausmachen und synthetisieren.', 'Sowohl AlCl3-BPC als auch eine 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-Variante können als nicht wässrige und polare Lösungsmittel für Übergangsmetallkomplexe genutzt werden. So konnten z. B. Hexachloromolybdat(III)- und Hexachloromolybdat(IV)-Anionen erstmals in den ionischen Flüssigkeiten hergestellt und untersucht werden. In den folgenden Jahren wurden ionische Flüssigkeiten immer öfter als katalytisch aktive Lösungsmittel untersucht. Anwendungen sind nukleophile aromatische Substitutionen in Tetraalkylphosphonium-ILs oder Friedel-Crafts-Alkylierungen und -Acetylierungen in 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrachloroaluminat.', 'Zweite Generation ionischer Flüssigkeiten (ab 1992).', 'Ein großer Nachteil der Chloroaluminat-basierten ionischen Flüssigkeiten ist ihre Anfälligkeit gegenüber Wasser. Bei der Hydrolyse entsteht unter anderem korrosive Salzsäure. Für die ursprüngliche Anwendung in der Batterietechnik war die Hydrolyseempfindlichkeit zwar unerheblich, da die Batterien ohnehin unter Feuchtigkeitsausschluss arbeiten mussten, jedoch war die Handhabung im Labor fast ausschließlich in der Glove-Box möglich. 1990 begann Mike Zaworotko bei der Air Force Academy und publizierte 1992, gemeinsam mit Wilkes, das erste Paper über Luft- und Wasser-stabile ionische Flüssigkeiten. Diese erhöhte Stabilität konnte durch Austausch des Chloroaluminat-Anions erreicht werden. Typische Anionen in ionischen Flüssigkeiten der zweiten Generation sind die Halide Chlorid, Bromid und Iodid, sowie Tetrafluoroborat, Hexafluorophosphat oder Benzoat. 1996 wurden erstmals perfluorierte Anionen, wie Bis(trifluormethylsulfonyl)amid, Triflat oder Trifluoroacetat in Imidazolium-basierten ionischen Flüssigkeiten genutzt. Diese ionischen Flüssigkeiten zeichnen sich durch ihre Hydrophobie, einen niedrigen Schmelzpunkt, teils unter −30 °C und eine hohe Leitfähigkeit aus.', 'Dritte Generation ionischer Flüssigkeiten (um 2000 bis heute).', 'Nachdem die neuen Anionen der zweiten Generation das Feld der ionischen Flüssigkeiten vergrößerten, sollte die dritte Generation das Spektrum auf geschätzte 1018 mögliche Kombinationen erweitern.

Der darauf folgende Anstieg des Meeresspiegels, massive Klimaveränderungen und weltweit ausbrechende Konflikte um die verbleibenden Ressourcen führen zum Tod von drei Milliarden Menschen, was der Hälfte der Weltbevölkerung entspricht. Offiziell gilt der mit annähernd Lichtgeschwindigkeit erfolgte Einschlag eines Mini-Meteoriten als Auslöser dieser Katastrophe. Die wahre Ursache der Katastrophe ist jedoch ein „Kontaktexperiment“, das von den Mitgliedern einer Expedition mit einem kurz zuvor in der Antarktis entdeckten humanoiden Wesen, das man als den \\"ersten Engel Adam\\" bezeichnet, durchgeführt wird. Hinter dieser von Dr. Katsuragi geleiteten Expedition und dem Experiment steht die mysteriöse Organisation \\"SEELE\\". Diese handelt nach einem Szenario, das aus den Schriftrollen von Qumran, die sich in SEELEs Besitz befinden, entwickelt wurde. SEELE beabsichtigt, die Menschheit im Rahmen der für die nähere Zukunft vorausgesagten Apokalypse auf eine höhere, gottgleiche Stufe der Evolution zu stellen.', 'Zur Durchführung dieses \\"Plans zur Vollendung der Menschheit\\" wird die Geheimorganisation \\"GEHIRN\\" gegründet, deren Aufgabe die Erforschung und Entwicklung geeigneter Abwehrmaßnahmen gegen die laut Szenario noch zu erwartenden Engel ist. Das Hauptquartier der Organisation wird in einem riesigen unterirdischen Hohlraum am Ufer des Ashi-Sees beim Vulkan Hakone errichtet.

Dabei handelt es sich um riesige, künstliche Humanoide, die aus Adam oder dem zweiten Engel \\"Lilith\\" geklont wurden und von einem Menschen gesteuert gegen die Engel kämpfen sollen. Im Jahr 2004 löst sich Yui Ikari beim Testlauf eines Evangelion-Prototypen spurlos in dessen Pilotenkapsel auf. Im folgenden Jahr verliert Kyōko Zeppelin Sōryū, die Mutter von Asuka Langley Sōryū, bei einem ähnlichen Experiment einen Teil ihrer Seele und erhängt sich kurze Zeit später. Im Jahr 2010 wird der Bau der \\"MAGI\\", der drei Supercomputer der Organisation, abgeschlossen. Naoko Akagi, die Konstrukteurin der MAGI, fühlt sich von Gendō Ikari, mit dem sie ein Verhältnis hat, ausgenutzt und hintergangen. Im Zorn erwürgt sie dessen vorgebliches Mündel Rei Ayanami, bei der es sich in Wahrheit um einen Klon aus Bestandteilen von Gendōs Ehefrau Yui und des Engels Lilith handelt, und begeht im Anschluss Selbstmord. Kurz darauf wird die Geheimorganisation GEHIRN, deren Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaufgaben erfüllt sind, aufgelöst und unter dem Namen \\"NERV\\" als Exekutivorgan für SEELEs Pläne neu gegründet. Rei wird von einem neuen Klon ersetzt.', 'Haupthandlung.', 'Im Jahr 2015 kommt der 14-jährige Schüler Shinji Ikari, der nach dem Tod seiner Mutter Yui bei einem Lehrer aufgewachsen ist, auf Wunsch seines Vaters Gendō nach Neo Tokyo-3.

Aufgrund des sehr distanzierten Verhältnisses zu seinem Vater wird Shinji der NERV-Offizierin Misato Katsuragi anvertraut, bei der er auch wohnt. Die Eingewöhnung in seine neue Umgebung ist für Shinji mühsam. Rei Ayanami, die Pilotin des Evangelion-Prototypen Einheit 00, mit der er zusammen die Schule besucht, scheint nur zu seinem Vater eine engere Beziehung zu haben und ist allen anderen Menschen gegenüber sehr verschlossen. Auch zu anderen Schülern und Schülerinnen kann Shinji nur schwer Kontakte knüpfen. Als er, ohnehin an seiner Befähigung zum Piloten zweifelnd, von seinem Mitschüler Tōji Suzuhara geschlagen wird, weil dessen kleine Schwester bei Shinjis erstem Einsatz schwer verletzt wurde, will er NERV und Neo Tokyo-3 verlassen. Kurz vor seiner Abreise kann er jedoch von Tōji und dessen Freund Kensuke Aida von der Wichtigkeit seiner Aufgabe als EVA-Pilot überzeugt werden und bleibt.', 'Bald darauf kommt das \\" Asuka Langley Sōryū zusammen mit EVA-02 aus Deutschland an und zieht ebenfalls bei Misato ein.

Im Kampf gelingt es den drei Asuka, Rei und Shinji hingegen trotz diverser Unstimmigkeiten, ein Team zu bilden und die Angriffe der Engel erfolgreich abzuwehren. Zusammen mit Asuka kommt auch Misatos Exfreund Kaji Ryōji nach Japan. Er schmuggelt im Auftrag von NERV den auf die Größe eines Embryos geschrumpften Engel Adam nach Neo Tokyo-3 und übergibt ihn an Gendō Ikari. Offiziell ist Kaji NERV-Mitarbeiter und wird ins Hauptquartier versetzt, inoffiziell ist er jedoch als Spion für die japanische Regierung und für SEELE tätig.

Dort stellt sich bei der ersten Aktivierung heraus, dass die Einheit von einem Engel übernommen wurde. Shinji erhält den Befehl, den außer Kontrolle geratenen EVA-03 zu zerstören, weigert sich jedoch, da er dessen Piloten nicht gefährden will. Daraufhin lässt sein Vater Gendō das sogenannte \\"Dummy-Plug-System\\" aktivieren, mit dem Shinjis Evangelion vom NERV-Hauptquartier ferngesteuert werden kann. EVA-01 zerfetzt den übernommenen Evangelion-03 und zerquetscht dessen Pilotenkapsel. Der Pilot, Shinjis Freund Tōji, überlebt schwer verletzt. Nach diesem Erlebnis will Shinji NERV und Neo Tokyo-3 endgültig verlassen und nie wieder einen Evangelion steuern. Er ändert seine Meinung jedoch, als der 14. Engel die Stadt angreift und Reis und Asukas Evangelions praktisch mühelos besiegt und kampfunfähig macht. Als auch Shinji mit EVA-01 dem Engel zu unterliegen droht, kommt es erneut zu einem Amoklauf des Evangelion, der den Engel schließlich besiegt und auffrisst. Shinji wird dabei, wie seine Mutter mehrere Jahre zuvor, vom Evangelion absorbiert, kann jedoch später gerettet werden. Bei SEELE mehren sich die Zweifel an Gendō Ikaris Zuverlässigkeit bei der Umsetzung des Szenarios, sodass sie Gendōs Stellvertreter Fuyutsuki durch Kaji entführen lassen, um ihn über Gendōs Absichten zu befragen. Fuyutsuki wird jedoch vorzeitig von Kaji aus der Gefangenschaft von SEELE befreit. Kurz darauf wird Kaji von einer unbekannten Person erschossen.', 'Asukas Selbstwertgefühl leidet unter der Niederlage gegen den letzten Engel und der Tatsache, dass Shinji sie mit seinen Leistungen als Pilot überflügelt hat. Als sich der 15. Engel nähert, sieht Asuka die Chance, sich den anderen zu beweisen. Durch eine Psychoattacke des Engels, die sie mit ihrer eigenen Unzulänglichkeit konfrontiert, verliert Asuka jedoch den Lebensmut und ist daraufhin nicht mehr in der Lage, EVA-02 zu steuern. Besiegt wird der Engel, der sich im Erdorbit außerhalb der Reichweite konventioneller Waffen befindet, schließlich mithilfe der \\"Longinuslanze\\", die von Rei in EVA-00 auf ihn geschleudert wird und dann in eine Mondumlaufbahn eintritt. Bei der Longinuslanze handelt es sich um einen riesigen Speer, der bis dahin der unter dem NERV-Hauptquartier ans Kreuz geschlagenen Lilith in der Brust steckte und für SEELEs Pläne von großer Bedeutung ist. Der Angriff des 16. Engels wird von Rei vereitelt, indem sie sich selbst zusammen mit ihm und EVA-00 in die Luft sprengt. Als sie kurz darauf jedoch wieder auftaucht, offenbart die NERV-Wissenschaftlerin Ritsuko Akagi Misato und Shinji, dass Rei ein Klon aus Lilith und Shinjis Mutter Yui ist. Zahlreiche Rei-Klone ohne Seele und Bewusstsein bilden das Herz des Dummy-Plug-Systems oder dienen als Ersatzkörper für das Bewusstsein der einen wahren Rei.

A Hospital Management System (HMS) based on a robust Management Information System (MIS) has the potential to significantly improve the delivery of medical services, leading to enhanced operational efficiency, improved patient outcomes, and reduced administrative costs. This final year project presents the development and implementation of an MIS-driven HMS for healthcare institutions to streamline their operations and ultimately provide better care to patients. Our proposed HMS incorporates critical functional modules such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, electronic medical records, diagnostic and laboratory management, pharmacy management, staff management, and financial management. The system leverages modern technologies and practices, including cloud-based computing, data analytics, and strong data security protocols to ensure smooth functioning and timely access to relevant information. The methodology employed in this project involves a comprehensive review of existing hospital management systems, identification of challenges in current practices, and the development of solutions that address these issues in an efficient and scalable manner. We conducted pilot tests in selected healthcare institutions to evaluate the effectiveness, ease of use, and interoperability of our HMS. The results of the system implementation demonstrated marked improvements in key performance indicators, signifying reduced operational bottlenecks, efficient resource utilization, and enhanced patient satisfaction levels. The MIS-driven HMS has the potential to transform hospital management by offering actionable insights for informed decision-making, fostering greater collaboration among various stakeholders, and catalyzing the transition towards value-based healthcare. In conclusion, this final year project demonstrates that a well-designed, MIS-focused HMS is a powerful tool for modern healthcare institutions striving to maintain high-quality patient care in the face of ever-increasing demands and resource limitations. Our proposed system provides a foundation for further research and development in this area, with the potential to contribute significantly to the future of healthcare management."},{"instruction":"what is the Mesostoma Ehrenbergii in competition with","output":"As an AI language model, I am not able to access the current environmental situation of a specific Mesostoma ehrenbergii population.

With regard to the Russian Federation, the environmental activities of Greenpeace are actually accompanied by the active promotion of a political position, attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the state and are aimed at undermining its economic foundations.” This decision entails a ban on any Greenpeace activities in Russia, ending Greenpeace Russia’s proud 30-year history of defending the environment. Greenpeace International condemns the decision. This misguided decision effectively indicates that it is ‘undesirable’ to protect nature in Russia. What, then, is desirable? To run industrial production that is harmful to nature and human health, spill oil, discharge toxic waste into clean water, make people breathe toxic emissions, burn coal, produce mountains of plastic waste, cut down protected forests, ignore forest fires and do nothing to tackle climate crisis? It’s clear that Greenpeace International – and subsequently Greenpeace Russia – was labelled undesirable because we do not allow disastrous plans threatening nature to be carried out. Every time we oppose them, we have had to overcome intense pressure from those who treat nature solely as a source of commercial income. Consequently, nature protection is now falsely presented as a threat to national security and the interests of Russia. Anyone who describes Greenpeace Russia as such plainly has no idea of what Greenpeace Russia has been doing for 30 years. Here are just a few examples: At the initiative of Greenpeace Russia, in 1995 the Virgin Komi Forests became the first site in Russia to get UNESCO protection. Greenpeace Russia not only helped these territories obtain the prestigious international World Heritage status, but also stopped more than 10 attempts to start destructive gold mining there. For 30 years, thanks to our work, other Russia’s territories have become UNESCO World Heritage Sites, for example, Volcanoes of Kamchatka or Lake Baikal. Together with volunteers, Greenpeace plants and protects forests in national parks, fights forest fires in nature reserves in the Urals, Siberia and the Far East. For more than twenty years, Greenpeace Russia has worked tirelessly to defend Lake Baikal, fighting poachers hunting the Baikal seal and helping bring to an end the Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill, which had poisoned the waters of the unique lake for decades. Together with Greenpeace, caring Russians managed to move the site of an oil pipeline which had been planned to be laid just 800 metres from the lake shore. Recently, Greenpeace has been studying Baikal plastic pollution and contamination of its waters with dangerous chemicals, and made efforts to ban mass logging near its shores. For many years, Greenpeace Russia has fought dangerous toxic pollution with dioxins and other chemicals, preventing hazardous waste imports from other countries. Together with volunteers, Greenpeace patrols identified and removed oil from numerous spills in the North and Siberia. With the help of Greenpeace, the Norilsk Nickel was forced to pay an unprecedented fine of about two billion dollars for the vast Norilsk oil spill in 2020. Greenpeace Russia was the first to speak out about problems in waste segregation and processing in Russia. After years of work, fighting the construction of hazardous waste incinerators, expert assessments and protests, waste segregation became an everyday routine. In order to help people lead a sustainable lifestyle, Greenpeace and hundreds of volunteers across the country designed and constantly updates the unique Recyclemap, a map indicating about 30,000 waste collection points in 64 cities. Greenpeace experts conducted studies of the coasts of Russian lakes, rivers and seas, made a nation-wide public audit of coastal pollutants and other research and used these as the basis for a demand to restrict single-use plastic packaging. A ban on its use is expected around 2025. Together with leading experts, we have done extensive research and proposed concrete solutions to achieve climate neutrality through the development of a circular economy, waste reduction, forest protection, fire prevention, the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Greenpeace and other environmental organisations in Russia helped to start the public debate on the climate crisis in the country and steps to resolve it. Our experts studied renewable energy sites in Russia, made public proposals that regional authorities include the development of renewable energy sources in their climate change adaptation plans, and in many regions received official support for them. Thanks to Greenpeace and its supporters, a ban on grass burning was introduced; 25 groups of volunteer forest firefighters were created throughout the country, and now a whole movement of highly skilled volunteers have been working together with Greenpeace to save forests and peat bogs from fires for more than a decade. These are just a few achievements of Greenpeace in the protection of nature in Russia over 30 years. The organisation has always relied on its supporters – the residents of the country. More than a million people signed petitions, put information on maps, planted forests, put out fires and helped conduct research. Tens of thousands of ordinary Russian citizens supported us financially so that Greenpeace could exist without funding from the state, political parties or businesses. With Greenpeace banned for its critical position on environmental issues, Russia will be deprived of one of its leading experts on environmental problems and solutions, and the people who tried to protect nature will now be deprived of a strong ally. The ban on the Greenpeace activities in Russia is an absurd, irresponsible and destructive step in the face of the climate and biodiversity crises.

As if in response to his call, a group of startled peasants emerged from makeshift huts, rubbing their eyes groggily. They looked up at Daylen as he swooped down gracefully, almost as if he floated. \\"Oh great, just who I wanted to see... peasants,\\" Daylen said with an eye-roll, his voice dripping with sarcasm. The peasants stared at him, their mouths agape in awe as they started to tremble in fear. \\"Wh-who are you?\\" stammered one of the peasants, an old man with a gray beard that went down to his waist. Before the man could continue, a smirked settled on Daylen's lips, and his eyes gleamed with malevolence. \\"My name is Daylen, and I am the most handsome and ruthless warlord the world has ever known. You shall bow before me.\\" \\"I bow down to no one, especially someone like you,\\" a brave young woman dared to challenge, her fiery eyes locked with his cold ones.

The peasants' screams were drowned out by their terror as the floating island began to crumble. The tremors caused by the quake knocked the poor inhabitants off their feet. They tried to regain their balance, but their attempts were futile. The great warlord yawned, unimpressed by the feeble peasants. \\"Wow, you're all so incredibly weak. I could destroy these pathetic little floating islands like I crush ants with my thumb.\\" His declaration sent the peasants into an even greater panic. While they scrambled, the defiant woman stood her ground, even though her knees were shaking. Her voice trembled as she tried to face Daylen head-on, but her fear leaked through in her pitch. \\"What do you want from us?

Elle a pour objectif de faciliter la compréhension, l'analyse et la communication entre les différents intervenants du projet. La modélisation peut être faite à l'aide de plusieurs outils de modélisation. Parmi ces outils, on peut citer MERISE et UML qui sont deux méthodes très utilisées dans le domaine de la modélisation. I. MERISE MERISE est une méthode de modélisation développée en France dans les années 70 par les ingénieurs Hubert Tardieu et René Colletti. La méthode MERISE est basée sur une approche fonctionnelle et est destinée à modéliser les systèmes d'information. Elle intègre des notions de modélisation de données, de traitement et de présentation des informations. La méthode MERISE est basée sur 3 niveaux de modélisation : - Le niveau conceptuel : il permet de décrire les entités et leurs relations à partir desquelles seront conçues les tables de la base de données. - Le niveau logique : il permet de décrire les tables de la base de données ainsi que les contraintes d'intégrité. - Le niveau physique : il permet de décrire la mise en œuvre concrète de la base de données sur un système informatique. II. UML UML (Unified Modeling Language) est une méthode de modélisation orientée objet qui a été créée dans les années 90 par Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson et James Rumbaugh. Cette méthode est utilisée pour modéliser les systèmes d'information, les applications et les interfaces utilisateurs. UML est composé de plusieurs diagrammes : - Le diagramme de classes : il permet de décrire la structure statique des systèmes en représentant les classes, les attributs, les opérations et les relations entre les classes. - Le diagramme d'objets : il permet de décrire les instances d'un système en représentant les objets, leurs attributs et leurs liens. - Le diagramme de séquence : il permet de décrire les interactions entre les objets en représentant les messages échangés entre les objets. - Le diagramme d'état : il permet de décrire les différentes étapes par lesquelles passe un objet au cours de son existence. - Le diagramme d'activité : il permet de décrire les processus métiers en représentant les activités, les actions et les transitions. Conclusion : MERISE et UML sont deux méthodes de modélisation utilisées pour modéliser les systèmes d'information. La méthode MERISE est basée sur une approche fonctionnelle, alors que UML est basé sur une approche orientée objet. UML offre une plus grande variété de diagrammes que MERISE, et il est donc plus approprié pour la modélisation des systèmes d'information complexes. Toutefois, MERISE est plus adapté pour modéliser les systèmes d'information simples. En somme, le choix de la méthode de modélisation dépend du projet et de ses exigences.

Bei den Kaiserwahlen gehörte das Stadtgeläute zum traditionellen Eröffnungszeremoniell, wenn die Kurfürsten gemeinsam vom Römer zur Wahlkapelle in der Bartholomäuskirche schritten.', 'Das Domgeläute vom Mittelalter bis heute.', 'Einen besonderen Schwerpunkt bildete dabei immer das Geläute des Domes St. Bartholomäus. 1438 wurden die ersten Glocken im Turm der Bartholomäuskirche aufgehängt, dessen Neubau 1415 begonnen hatte. Nach und nach erhielt der Pfarrturm ein Geläute von zehn Glocken, von denen sechs dem Bartholomäusstift und vier der Stadt gehörten. Über den Gebrauch der Glocken lagen das katholische Stift und der Rat der Stadt in beständigem Streit, besonders nach der Einführung der Reformation in Frankfurt im Jahr 1533. Die Stiftsglocken durften im Wesentlichen nur zu liturgischen Anlässen läuten. Drei der städtischen Glocken dienten als Schlagglocken für die Turmuhr, während die \\"Sturmglocke\\" nur in Notfällen geläutet wurde.', 'Alle Domglocken wurden am 15. August 1867 beim Dombrand zerstört. 1877 erhielt der wiederaufgebaute Dom ein neues Geläute, das von der Gießerei Hermann Große in Dresden geschaffen wurde. Die neun Glocken wiegen zusammen 23.385 kg. Darunter ist auch die 11.850 kg schwere Gloriosa, eine der größten Glocken in Deutschland. Vorbild für diese Glocke war die berühmte Erfurter Gloriosa des Gerhard van Wou im Erfurter Dom.', 'Für das Geläute wurden fünf Tonnen Bronze aus den Trümmern der zerstörten Glocken sowie 13 Tonnen aus erbeuteten französischen Geschützen des Krieges von 1870/1871 verwendet.', 'Am 22. März 1878 fand zum Geburtstag des deutschen Kaisers Wilhelm I. das erste Große Stadtgeläute unter Beteiligung der neuen Domglocken statt.', 'Am 24. Dezember 1878 erließ der Magistrat eine bis heute gültige Satzung, in der der Gebrauch der städtischen Domglocken durch die katholische Kirchengemeinde geregelt ist. Im Gegenzug behielt sich die Stadt das Recht vor, das gesamte Domgeläute für \\"städtische oder nationale öffentliche, nicht kirchliche Zwecke\\" jederzeit zur Verfügung zu behalten. Die Läutemannschaft (für ein einstündiges Geläute aller Domglocken waren 44 Personen erforderlich) wurde zur Hälfte aus dem städtischen Etat bezahlt.', 'Das Domgeläute überstand den Ersten Weltkrieg unbeschädigt, lediglich die historisch bedeutsame, aber musikalisch unwesentliche Sturmglocke wurde 1917 eingeschmolzen und nicht mehr ersetzt.', 'Außer den Glocken in den sogenannten Glockenböden des Pfarrturms verfügte der Dom zeitweise noch über weitere Glocken, die nicht Teil des Stadtgeläutes waren. So befand sich z. B. bis zum Dombrand 1867 in der Laterne auf dem Turm eine kleine Sturmglocke, das \\"Gemperlin\\". Im Dachreiter auf der Vierung hing ebenfalls bis 1867 die Prim- oder Ratsglocke, die zur ersten Morgenmesse um 6 Uhr sowie zu den Ratssitzungen geläutet wurde. Das Messglöckchen im kleinen Dachreiter auf dem Chor musste 1942 abgeliefert werden.', 'Am 27. August 2005 wurde der Dachreiter auf der Vierung nach eineinhalbjähriger Restaurierung wieder an seinen Platz gesetzt. Bei dieser Gelegenheit wurde auch eine 132 kg schwere Sakramentsglocke aufgehängt, die seitdem während der Messe zur Wandlung läuten soll. Gleichzeitig erhielt auch der Dachreiter auf dem Chor wieder eine kleine Messglocke, die nur 76 kg schwere \\"Marienglocke\\". Beide Glocken wurden 2004 von der Gießerei Petit &amp; Gebr. Edelbrock in Gescher gegossen und sind nicht Bestandteil des Stadtgeläutes.', 'Dotationskirchen.', 'Seit der Einführung der Reformation 1533 wurden die sechs lutherischen Kirchen von der Stadt unterhalten. Mit der Säkularisation 1803 fielen auch alle katholischen Stifts- und Klosterkirchen sowie der übrige Kirchenbesitz an die Stadt, die damit auch für ihren Unterhalt zu sorgen hatte. Am 2. Februar 1830 erließ die Freie Stadt Frankfurt nach langen Verhandlungen die beiden Dotationsurkunden für die evangelisch-lutherischen (nicht jedoch die evangelisch-reformierten) und die katholischen Kirchen, in denen die staatlichen Pflichten für den Unterhalt der Kirchen und ihrer Ausstattung sowie für die Besoldung der Geistlichkeit geregelt waren. Die Kirchen wurden den jeweiligen Gemeinden „für deren Cultus zum immerwährenden und alleinigen Gebrauch“ übertragen. Die Stadt ist verpflichtet, die „Kirchengebäude und Zugehörungen, wie die Orgeln und dergleichen, fortwährend in gutem Zustande“ zu erhalten.', '1866 annektierte Preußen die Freie Stadt Frankfurt. Im \\"Frankfurter Rezeß\\" wurde 1869 das Vermögen der Freien Stadt aufgeteilt. Vermögen mit eher staatlichem Charakter sollte dem Königreich Preußen anheimfallen, kommunales Vermögen der preußischen Stadt Frankfurt am Main. Dabei wurden die Dotationsverpflichtungen auf die Stadt Frankfurt am Main übertragen.', 'Nach einer Reihe von Veränderungen im Laufe der Zeit gibt es heute acht Dotationskirchen in Frankfurt am Main: fünf evangelische (Katharinenkirche, Peterskirche, Heiliggeistkirche, Dreikönigskirche und Alte Nikolaikirche), sowie drei katholische (Dom, Liebfrauenkirche und Leonhardskirche). Das Karmeliterkloster und die Paulskirche gehören ebenfalls der Stadt, zählen aber nicht zu den Dotationskirchen, weil sie nicht mehr kirchlich genutzt werden.', 'Die Stadt Frankfurt hat ihre Verpflichtung aus der Dotation stets wahrgenommen. Dazu gehörte auch der Wiederaufbau der im Zweiten Weltkrieg während der Luftangriffe auf Frankfurt am Main zerstörten Kirchen. Aus der Dotation ergibt sich die im Vergleich zu anderen deutschen Städten einmalige Situation, dass auch sämtliche Glocken innerhalb der historischen Stadtmauern nicht den Kirchengemeinden, sondern der städtischen Gemeinde gehören. Einzige Ausnahme ist die Deutschordenskirche in Sachsenhausen, die bei der Säkularisation nicht an die Stadt Frankfurt fiel, sondern an den Fürsten Friedrich August von Nassau-Usingen und nach verschiedenen Eigentümerwechseln 1881 wieder in den Besitz der katholischen Kirche gelangte.', 'Das Große Stadtgeläute als städtische Institution.', 'Am 6. Mai 1856 beschloss der Senat der Freien Stadt Frankfurt: „Es hat inskünftig an den hohen Festen: Ostern, Pfingsten und Weihnachten jeweils am Abend vorher von 5–6 Uhr, als auch am ersten Festtage Morgens von 7 bis 8 Uhr ein allgemeines Geläute durch sämtliche Glocken stattzufinden.“ Dieses heute so genannte \\"Große Stadtgeläute\\" wurde mehrmals bestätigt, zuletzt durch Magistratsbeschluss vom 29. September 1978. Seitdem findet das Große Stadtgeläute viermal jährlich „als Bereicherung für die Bürger“ und als „Beitrag zur Förderung des Fremdenverkehrs“ regelmäßig statt.', 'Zweiter Weltkrieg und Wiederaufbau.', 'Bis zum Zweiten Weltkrieg waren die Glocken des Stadtgeläutes musikalisch nicht aufeinander abgestimmt. Obwohl schon im Ersten Weltkrieg viele wertvolle Glocken eingeschmolzen wurden, blieben die älteren Glocken der Dotationskirchen und auch das Domgeläute unbeschädigt. 1944 wurden sämtliche Dotationskirchen außer der Leonhardskirche im Bombenkrieg bei den Luftangriffen auf Frankfurt am Main zerstört. In den meisten Fällen bedeutete das auch für die in den Kirchen verbliebenen Glocken das Ende. Allerdings waren bereits 1940 alle Bronzeglocken im Reich als Metallspende des deutschen Volkes zur Schaffung einer langfristigen Rohstoffreserve beschlagnahmt worden. Lediglich eine Glocke, meist die kleinste eines Geläutes, durfte jeweils als \\"Läuteglocke\\" auf den Türmen verbleiben.', 'Auch die meisten Frankfurter Glocken mussten 1942 an die Reichsstelle für Metalle abgeliefert werden, darunter acht der neun Domglocken bis auf die Bartholomäusglocke. Aufgrund günstiger Umstände blieben die Domglocken aber unversehrt. Sie befanden sich bei Kriegsende auf dem Hamburger Glockenfriedhof und konnten im Oktober 1947 wieder nach Frankfurt zurückgeholt werden, wo auch die verbliebene Bartholomäusglocke den Krieg unbeschädigt überstanden hatte.', '1954 ließ die Stadt durch den Mainzer Glocken- und Orgelsachverständigen Paul Smets (1901–1960) und den Glockengießer Fritz Rincker (1895–1969) aus Sinn ein Gutachten erstellen, um die beim anstehenden Wiederaufbau der Dotationskirchen neu zu schaffenden Geläute zu konzipieren. Smets schlug vor, alle Glocken harmonisch aufeinander abzustimmen. Das zwei Oktaven umfassende neunstimmige Domgeläute bildet dabei die Grundlage. Die übrigen Dotationskirchen erhielten neue Geläute, deren Stimmung von Smets festgelegt wurde. Eine Besonderheit bildete lediglich die Paulskirche, die bereits 1948 wiederaufgebaut worden war und dabei ein neues Geläute erhalten hatte. Die drei erhaltenen historischen Glocken von 1685 bzw. 1830 waren dabei nicht berücksichtigt worden. 1987 wurden deshalb die klanglich nicht zum Stadtgeläute passenden Glocken von 1948 dem Historischen Museum der Stadt übergeben und durch neugegossene Glocken entsprechend dem Smets-Gutachten ersetzt.', 'Mit dem neuen Paulskirchengeläute war das musikalische Konzept eines harmonisch abgestimmten Stadtgeläutes im Wesentlichen verwirklicht, wenn auch im strengen Sinne erst die 1995 gegossenen Glocken des Karmeliterklosters das Stadtgeläute vollendeten. Eine zentrale elektronische Steuerung erhielten die zehn Geläute nicht. Mit den in vielen Kirchen vorhandenen dezentralen Steuerungen können die Läutemaschinen individuell für das Stadtgeläute programmiert werden, wenn nicht die Handbedienung bevorzugt wird.', 'Wegen der COVID-19-Pandemie in Deutschland und der damit verbundenen Kontaktbeschränkungen konnte das Stadtgeläute 2020 n: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Das Stück wurde erstmals am 12. Februar 1924 in der Aeolian Hall in New York aufgeführt. Angekündigt wurde das Konzert unter dem Titel \\"An Experiment in Modern Music\\". Bei der Uraufführung saß Gershwin selbst am Klavier.', 'Die \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" verbindet erfolgreich Jazz, Blues und konzertante Sinfonik. Die Melodien des Werkes sind mittlerweile weltberühmt. „Rhapsodie“ bedeutet ursprünglich „vorgetragenes Gedicht“ und bezeichnet heute ein Musikstück ohne kategorische Zuordnung. Wegen seiner Mischung der Musikstile ist die „Rhapsodie in Blau“ daher treffend bezeichnet.', 'Entstehungsgeschichte.', 'Der Bandleader Paul Whiteman hatte schon am 1. November 1923, rund vier Monate vor der Uraufführung, ein Konzert in der Aeolian Hall veranstaltet, das Jazz und Klassik einander gegenüberstellte. Es war ein passabler Erfolg, so dass Whiteman beschloss, ein noch ambitionierteres Projekt in Angriff zu nehmen. Dieses sollte am 12. Februar 1924 stattfinden. Whiteman forderte Gershwin auf, dafür ein Jazzstück für Orchester zu schreiben. Dieser lehnte zuerst ab mit Hinweis auf Terminprobleme und vermutlich, weil er im Komponieren für klassisches Orchester wenig Erfahrung besaß. Erst als Whiteman Gershwin auf eigene Faust auf die Programmliste setzte, komponierte er das Stück schließlich doch.', 'Whiteman und Gershwin hatten bereits bei der höchst erfolgreichen Broadway-Revue \\"George White’s Scandals\\" zusammengearbeitet, die auf Motiven von Gershwins – zumindest in kommerzieller Hinsicht erfolgloser – Jazz-Oper \\"Blue Monday\\" basierte. Gershwin lehnte den Vorschlag ab, da er wenige Tage später, am 7. Januar, eine Probevorstellung seines neuen Musicals \\"Sweet Little Devil\\" geben und eventuellen Änderungswünschen vor der Premiere am 21. Januar nachkommen musste.', 'Am Abend des 3. Januar 1924 spielte Gershwin mit seinem Freund und Kollegen Buddy DeSylva in der Nähe des Broadway Billard, während sein Bruder Ira Gershwin die Ausgabe des nächsten Tages des New York Tribune las. In einem Artikel mit der Überschrift “What Is American Music?” (\\"Was macht amerikanische Musik aus?\\") über das Konzert von Whiteman wurde angekündigt, dass George Gershwin an einer Jazzkomposition für diese Vorstellung arbeite.', 'Bei einem Telefonat mit Gershwin am nächsten Morgen erklärte Whiteman, dass sein Rivale Vincent Lopez ihm die Idee seines experimentellen Konzertes stehlen wolle und deshalb keine Zeit mit Diskussionen zu verlieren sei. Gershwin ließ sich schließlich zur Komposition überreden. Da nur noch fünf Wochen Zeit bis zur Aufführung waren, begann er umgehend damit und arbeitete einige Wochen unter Hochdruck daran, bevor er sie Whitemans Arrangeur Ferde Grofé übergab.', 'Das erste Manuskript für zwei Klaviere ist auf den 7. Januar 1924 datiert. Es enthält Bemerkungen zur Instrumentation, bei denen nicht die Instrumente, sondern die Namen der Solisten eingetragen sind. Grofé instrumentierte das Werk anscheinend mit Rücksicht auf die individuelle Stilistik, Stärken und Techniken der einzelnen Orchestermitglieder. Am 4. Februar 1924, acht Tage vor der Premiere, beendete er die Orchestrierung.', 'Der Arbeitstitel des Stückes war \\"American Rhapsody\\". Ira Gershwin schlug den Namen \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" vor, nachdem er eine Ausstellung von James McNeill Whistler besucht hatte, der seinen Kunstwerken oft Namen wie \\"Symphony in White\\" oder \\"Arrangement in Grey and Black\\" gab.', 'Den berühmten Beginn der Rhapsodie hatte Gershwin ursprünglich übrigens als Triller mit einem rasch aufsteigenden, aus 17 Noten bestehenden Tonleiterlauf komponiert. Whitemans Klarinettist Ross Gorman spielte die letzte Hälfte der Skala während einer Probe als Glissando. Als Gershwin das hörte, entschloss er sich, diese Variante für die Partitur zu übernehmen. Den entsprechenden Klarinettenpart trug bei der Premiere allerdings nicht Gorman, sondern Chester Hazlett vor.', 'Der breite, melodisch betonte Mittelteil (ab Takt 303 ) wurde auf Anregung von Ira Gershwin, der aus Georges Skizzenbuch ein geeignetes Thema auswählte, in die Komposition aufgenommen.', 'Die Aufführung selbst gestaltete Paul Whiteman und sein \\"Palais Royal Orchestra\\". Das Konzert sollte im Rahmen eines Musikabends unter dem Titel \\"An Experiment in Modern Music\\" („Ein Experiment in moderner Musik“) geboten werden. Namhafte Musiker, darunter Strawinski, Rachmaninow, Leopold Stokowski, Jascha Heifetz und Fritz Kreisler, Musikkritiker und Intellektuelle waren erschienen, um es sich anzuhören. 26 verschiedene Stücke wurden aufgeführt, darunter Edward Elgars \\"Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1\\" und heute kaum noch bekannte Kompositionen wie \\"True form of Jazz\\" und \\"Contrast: legitimate scoring vs. jazzing\\".', '\\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" war das vorletzte Stück. Bis dahin war das Publikum schon äußerst unruhig, da sich viele Werke ähnlich angehört hatten und obendrein das Lüftungssystem der Aeolian Hall ausgefallen war. Heute gilt der Abend aufgrund der Premiere der hier besprochenen Komposition als legendär. Gershwin spielte den Klavierpart selbst. Da er keine ausnotierte Klavierpartitur besaß und Grofé ihm wegen des Zeitdrucks nur eine Bandpartitur mit den hingekritzelten Worten \\"Wait for nods\\" („Warte, bis dir einer zunickt“) aushändigen konnte, ist die Version der Uraufführung heute nicht mehr zu rekonstruieren.', 'Pressestimmen zur Uraufführung.', '\\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" bekam sehr gegensätzliche Kritiken. Olin Downes rezensierte das Stück für die New York Times:', 'Einige Kritiker warfen Gershwin eine fehlende Form vor: Er habe nur einzelne Melodien aneinander gereiht. Lawrence Gilman schrieb im New York Tribune:', 'Besetzung.', 'Grofé arbeitete nach der Premiere in den Jahren 1926 und 1942 zwei weitere Partituren von \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" aus, beide für ein jeweils vergrößertes Orchester. Die jüngere Version wird im heutigen Repertoire mit Abstand am häufigsten gespielt.', 'Die Premiere war mit Flöte, Oboe, Klarinetten, Heckelphon, mehreren Saxophonen, zwei Hörnern, zwei Trompeten, zwei Flügelhörnern, Euphonium, zwei Posaunen, Bassposaune, Tuba, zwei Klavieren, Celesta, Banjo, Schlagzeug, Pauke, mehreren Violinen, Kontrabass und Akkordeon besetzt. Paul Whitemans damals aus dreiundzwanzig Musikern bestehende Band wurde zusätzlich um neun Personen verstärkt. Dennoch übernahmen mehrere Musiker der Band zwei oder mehr Instrumente. Manche spielten in dem Stück vier Instrumente.', 'Die Partitur von 1942 ist für Soloklavier, zwei Flöten, zwei Oboen, zwei Klarinetten, Bassklarinette, zwei Fagotte, drei Hörner, drei Trompeten, drei Posaunen, Tuba, Timpani, Percussion (Cymbal, Snare Bassdrum, Triangel, Gong und Glocken), Klavier, zwei Altsaxophone, Tenorsaxophon, Banjo und eine Streichergruppe (Violinen, Bratschen, Cello und Kontrabass) gesetzt. In der heutigen Aufführungspraxis wird die 2. Altsaxophonstimme „3rd Saxophone (E flat Alto)“ jedoch in der Regel mit einem Baritonsaxophon besetzt. Dies liegt unter anderem daran, dass die beiden Altsaxophonstimmen bei den meisten Passagen des Stückes unisono geschrieben sind (siehe auch Notenbeispiel weiter unten). Durch den Einsatz eines Baritonsaxophons wird hier eine Doppelung vermieden.', '2017 entstand eine neue Instrumentierung des Werkes auf Basis der Grofé-Partitur. Der deutsche Saxofonist Benjamin Steil arrangierte das Werk für Bigband-Standardbesetzung (5 Saxofone, 4 Trompeten, 4 Posaunen, Rhythmusgruppe und optionale Percussionparts).', 'Die Synthese von Jazz und Kunstmusik.', 'Zu Beginn der Musik des 20. Jahrhunderts wurde der Einfluss des Jazz auf die Arbeit bedeutender Komponisten erkennbar. Dies stand im Zusammenhang mit Tendenzen der Kunstmusik seit 1910: Neoklassizistischen Tendenzen, vertreten etwa durch Strawinski, stand die Neue Musik mit ihrem Vorreiter Arnold Schönberg gegenüber. Beiden – der Zwölftonmusik wohl etwas mehr als der zwar experimentierfreudigen, aber dennoch tonalen Musik der Neoklassizisten – drohten die Hörer verloren zu gehen. Ihr Kreis schrumpfte mehr und mehr auf eine kleine Gemeinde hochspezialisierter Experten.', 'So beschrieb Hermann Danuser in seinem Band \\"Die Musik des 20. Jahrhunderts\\" das Paradox, dass gerade die eigentlich moderne Musik „im Zuge einer tief greifenden Krise in den Augen mancher – und nicht nur in Kreisen der Jugend – zu einem fragwürdigen Teil einer ‚Welt von gestern‘ geworden war.“', 'Joachim Ernst Berendt attestierte den Jazzhörern noch 1953 „ein starkes, lebendiges Gefühl für die Verlogenheit und Getrübtheit, für die Formelhaftigkeit und Indirektheit, kurzerhand für die ‚Spätheit’ unserer Epoche“ und folgerte daraus: „Aus diesem Gefühl heraus sehnt man sich nach etwas Direktem und Ursprünglichen, etwas Lebendigem und Mitreißendem. Das gibt die Jazzmusik.“ Dieses Zitat deutet aber bereits auf die Problematik einer Komposition hin, die Jazzelemente beinhaltet: Begriffe wie Direktheit und Lebendigkeit bis hin zur Emphase sind eng mit der Improvisation verbunden. Dieses wichtige Ausdrucksmittel des Jazz war von den Kunstansprüchen der konzipierten klassischen Musik von vornherein ausgeschlossen.', 'Nun wollten die wenigsten Komponisten, auch nicht Gershwin, echten, spontan improvisierten Jazz schaffen. Vielmehr wichen sie von diesem Modell ab, um die geforderte Stilhöhendifferenz zur Kunstmusik zu überwinden und damit der damaligen Kunstauffassung gerecht zu werden. Zudem lernte Gershwin den Jazz in den 1920er-Jahren in New York wohl schon in der kommerzialisierten Form des \\"Sweet\\" („süß“, aber auch „bequem“, „glatt“) kennen. Diese Stilrichtung vertrat neben Whiteman vor allem der heute fast vergessene Bandleader Guy Lombardo. Er strebte an, dem Jazz seine ursprüngliche „Härte“, „Rohheit“ und „Unordnung“ zu nehmen ( siehe Weblinks) und ihn damit für ein gehobenes, vornehmlich weißes Hörerpublikum attraktiver zu machen.', 'Dem entsprach der Kommentar im Programmheft zur Premiere von \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" von Hugh C. Ernst:', 'George Gershwin als Vorreiter des Third Stream.', 'Gunther Schuller erfand in den 1950er-Jahren den Theoriebegriff \\"Third Stream\\" für die Synthese von Kunstmusik und Jazz. Diesen bezogen dann auch Komponisten wie George Russell und John Lewis auf ihre Musik. Die Idee existierte jedoch schon früher und beschäftigte auch Claude Debussy oder Darius Milhaud.

Er stellte sich dort mit einem Programm zur Universitätsreform vor. Als einer der damals besten Kenner des Griechischen sah er im Studium der drei alten Sprachen einen Weg der Persönlichkeitsbildung. In den 1520er Jahren konnte er als Rektor in Wittenberg sowie als Schulgründer seine Reformpläne verwirklichen. Die Regeln der Rhetorik machte er für das Verständnis antiker Texte fruchtbar, und die Fähigkeit, ein Thema im Zusammenhang und in ansprechender Form darzustellen, wurde von den Wittenberger Studenten anstelle der traditionellen scholastischen Disputationen eingeübt.', 'Melanchthon begleitete Luther 1519 zur Leipziger Disputation und profilierte sich danach als dessen Parteigänger. Mit den \\"Loci communes\\" legte er 1521 eine evangelische Dogmatik vor. Da Luther als Geächteter in seinen Reisemöglichkeiten eingeschränkt war, vertrat Melanchthon die Wittenberger Positionen bei Reichstagen und Religionsgesprächen. Mit der \\"Confessio Augustana\\" und der zugehörigen Apologie verfasste er 1530/31 zwei bis heute maßgebliche Bekenntnisschriften der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche. Nach der Niederlage der Protestanten im Schmalkaldischen Krieg (1547) suchte Melanchthon Kompromisslösungen, was ihn in Gegensatz zu Matthias Flacius und seinem Kreis brachte. Der Adiaphoristische Streit war auch ein Streit um Melanchthons persönliche Integrität, in dem sich das konfessionelle Luthertum letztlich gegen ihn entschied.', 'Obwohl Melanchthon seit 1560 als \\"Praeceptor Germaniae\\" („Lehrer Deutschlands“) bezeichnet wurde, gingen von seinem Werk auch europaweite Wirkungen aus: Melanchthonschüler prägten die lutherischen Kirchen in Skandinavien und Südosteuropa. Melanchthon stand in extensivem brieflichem Austausch mit anderen Reformatoren, darunter Johannes Calvin in Genf und Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich. Melanchthons Einfluss auf die Reformierte Kirche geht vor allem über den Heidelberger Katechismus, dessen Hauptverfasser, Zacharias Ursinus, sein Schüler war.', 'Lange galt Melanchthon vor allem als Mitarbeiter Luthers. Die neuere Forschung nimmt stärker die Eigenständigkeit seines Denkens wahr. Als Bildungsreformer trug Melanchthon zur Etablierung der heutigen Naturwissenschaften an den Universitäten bei. Er sah den Fortschritt stets in der Erschließung antiker Quellentexte. Das heliozentrische Weltbild des Nikolaus Kopernikus hielt er für Spielerei, akzeptierte es aber zögernd als Denkmodell.

Vier Jahre nach der Eheschließung 1493, am 16. Februar 1497, brachte Barbara Schwartzerdt dort ihren ältesten Sohn zur Welt. Bei der Taufe in der Brettener Stiftskirche erhielt der Junge den Namen Philipp zu Ehren des Kurfürsten Philipp der Aufrichtige von der Pfalz. Er hatte vier jüngere Geschwister: Anna (* 5. April 1499), Georg (* 1500/1501), Margarete (* 17. März 1506) und Barbara (* 1508).', 'Philipp Schwartzerdt wuchs in Brettheim auf, wie Bretten damals genannt wurde.

Die Familie meinte, sein Leiden sei eine Folge davon, dass er aus einem vergifteten Brunnen getrunken habe. Aber seine Krankheit kann auch Folge seines berufsbedingten ständigen Kontakts mit Chemikalien gewesen sein.', 'In Melanchthons Elternhaus wurde eine intensive Laienfrömmigkeit nach klösterlichem Vorbild gelebt. Mit großem zeitlichem Abstand erinnerte sich Melanchthon 1554 in einem Brief, dass der Vater ihn zwei Tage vor seinem Tod zu sich rief, ihn zu einem religiösen Leben ermahnte und betete, dass Philipp in künftigen politischen Veränderungen von Gott geleitet werden möge. Dann sei er nach Speyer geschickt worden, um das Sterben seines Vaters am 27. Oktober 1508 nicht mitzuerleben. Kurz zuvor, am 17. Oktober, war bereits der Großvater verstorben.

Philipp Schwartzerdt gehörte zu diesem Kreis, der nach Schulschluss von Simler unterrichtet wurde. Reuchlin, der in Stuttgart lebte und in Tübingen als einer der obersten Richter des Schwäbischen Bundes tätig war, beobachtete die Fortschritte des Zwölfjährigen und belohnte sie mit einem Exemplar der griechischen Grammatik von Konstantinos Laskaris.

Oktober 1509 an der Universität Heidelberg immatrikuliert. Er wohnte bei dem Theologieprofessor Pallas Spangel, wo auch Jakob Wimpfeling gelegentlich zu Besuch war. 1511 veröffentlichte Wimpfeling in seinen eigenen Büchern Melanchthons erste lateinische Gedichte. Unter den Mitstudenten knüpfte Melanchthon Kontakt mit Theobald Billicanus, Johannes Brenz und Erhard Schnepf. Das Studienprogramm bewältigte Melanchthon problemlos und erwarb am 10. Juni 1511, zum frühestmöglichen Zeitpunkt, den untersten akademischen Grad eines \\"Baccalaureus artium\\".', 'Nach dem Tode von Spangel wechselte Melanchthon an die Universität Tübingen, wo er am 17. September 1512 immatrikuliert wurde. Dort studierte er Arithmetik, Geometrie, Musik und Astronomie (Quadrivium). Nebenher beschäftigte er sich mit Griechisch, Hebräisch und Latein. Er las antike Autoren sowie humanistische Dichter und machte Bekanntschaft mit neuen Lehrmethoden. So lernte er auch die Schriften von Rudolf Agricola zur Logik kennen und entnahm ihnen ein neues Verständnis der Dialektik. Seit Beginn seiner Tübinger Zeit war Melanchthon eng mit Ambrosius Blarer befreundet.', 'Als Reuchlin durch ein Gutachten über das hebräische Schrifttum in einen Prozess verwickelt wurde (Judenbücherstreit), setzte Melanchthon sich für seinen Förderer publizistisch ein. In den satirischen Dunkelmännerbriefen wurde er deshalb als schlimmster Tübinger Reuchlinanhänger bezeichnet (was aber ein Lob darstellte). Am 25. Januar 1514 schloss Melanchthon sein Studium an der Artistenfakultät mit dem Magistertitel ab. Danach war er verpflichtet, zwei Jahre an der Universität zu lehren. Melanchthon besuchte, wie es üblich war, daneben auch Vorlesungen an der theologischen und der artistischen Fakultät. Johannes Stöffler weckte durch seine Astronomievorlesungen Melanchthons Interesse an der Mathematik. Bereits in Tübingen war er als Tutor zweier Grafensöhne tätig und wirkte als Griechischlehrer. Somit war der Übergang vom Lernenden zum Lehrenden bei Melanchthon fließend erfolgt.', 'Professor in Wittenberg (ab 1518).', 'Antrittsvorlesung.', '1518 stiftete Kurfürst Friedrich der Weise an seiner 1502 gegründeten Universität Wittenberg einen Lehrstuhl für Griechisch. Der damals bekannteste Gräzist Johannes Reuchlin lehnte aus Altersgründen den Ruf nach Wittenberg ab und empfahl Melanchthon, seinen „gesippten Freund“, für die Stelle. Die Berufung des 21-jährigen Melanchthon geschah auf Wunsch des Kurfürsten; Martin Luther bevorzugte den Leipziger Petrus Mosellanus. Melanchthon traf am 25. August 1518 in Wittenberg ein. Der schmächtige und etwa 1,50 Meter kleine Tübinger Humanist mit dünner Stimme und einem leichten Sprachfehler erregte dort zunächst Befremden.

Sie führte als Stichbahn von Bad Friedrichshall nach Ohrnberg und folgte dem Unterlauf des Kochers.', 'Mit einer Länge von 22,6 km war sie die längste Strecke der WEG. Sie wurde in zwei Etappen eröffnet: Am 15. September 1907 erreichte die Bahn Neuenstadt, am 1. August 1913 wurde sie bis Ohrnberg verlängert. Nach der Einstellung des Betriebs zum 27. Dezember 1993 scheiterte die zunächst geplante Integration in das Netz der Heilbronner Stadtbahn. Die Trasse ist nun als Radwanderweg befahrbar.', 'Geschichte.', 'Vorgeschichte, Planung und Bau.', 'Neuenstadt lag im Zeitalter vor dem Eisenbahnbau an der Postkutschen-Route von Heilbronn über Mergentheim nach Würzburg und war damit verkehrstechnisch gut erschlossen. Mit der durchgehenden Eröffnung der Linie Stuttgart–Heilbronn–Würzburg (heutige Frankenbahn) 1869, die von Jagstfeld aus in nördliche Richtung entlang der Jagst verlief (Westliche Gabelbahn), geriet Neuenstadt ins Abseits. Abhilfe versprachen die Planungen für den Bau der 1862 eröffneten Kocherbahn Heilbronn–Hall, die über Neckarsulm und den Unterlauf des Kochers ostwärts geführt werden sollte. Allerdings gelang es den Orten im Weinsberger Tal und der Stadt Heilbronn, eine südlichere Streckenführung über Weinsberg unter Umgehung Neckarsulms und Neuenstadts durchzusetzen, für die der aufwändige Bau des Weinsberger Tunnels in Kauf genommen wurde. Beweggrund für Heilbronn waren die Pläne des württembergischen Staats für einen Neckarhafen als Umschlagort zwischen Schiff und Schiene in Neckarsulm, so dass Heilbronn als alleiniger Verkehrsknoten der Region seine Vorrangstellung in Gefahr sah.', 'Nachdem weder der Anschluss über die Kocherbahn noch über die Westliche Gabelbahn gelang, petitionierten die Städte und Gemeinden 1873 um den Bau einer Bahnstrecke im unteren Kochertal, allerdings ohne Erfolg. 19 Jahre später, anlässlich der Eröffnung der Kochertalbahn Waldenburg–Künzelsau am 1. Oktober 1892, stellte der württembergische Ministerpräsident von Mittnacht eine Verlängerung der Strecke kocherabwärts in Aussicht. Unter Berufung darauf reichten die Anlieger bald danach eine Eingabe für den Weiterbau ein, die von der württembergischen Regierung jedoch mit Verweis auf mangelnde Planungskapazitäten und die starke Belastung durch den Bau von Hauptbahnen abgelehnt wurde. Zu einer Verlängerung der Kochertalbahn kam es erst 1924, allerdings nur bis Forchtenberg.', 'Während Heilbronn und Neckarsulm durch die Industrialisierung aufblühten und sich Jagstfeld zu einem wichtigen Eisenbahnknoten entwickelte, führte der fehlende Verkehrsanschluss im unteren Kochertal zu einer schleichenden Entvölkerung. In Neuenstadt schrumpften Handel und Gewerbe. Neue Hoffnung brachte die Konzessionierung privater Eisenbahnunternehmen in Württemberg seit den 1890er Jahren. Am 15. April 1898 formierte sich aus Neuenstadt und den Gemeinden Kochertürn, Degmarn und Oedheim ein Eisenbahn-Komitee, das das Unternehmen Arthur Koppel mit Studien für eine Bahn beauftragte. Erste Vorschläge, die Strecke von der Oberamtsstadt Neckarsulm oder von Kochendorf aus ins Kochertal zu führen, fanden nicht die Zustimmung der vier Gemeinden und der königlichen Regierung, da ein Anschluss an den Bahnknoten Jagstfeld (heute Bad Friedrichshall Hauptbahnhof) verkehrsgünstiger und damit wirtschaftlicher erschien. Auch die topografischen Verhältnisse sprachen gegen Neckarsulm aus Ausgangspunkt.', 'Koppel schlug daraufhin am 18. Dezember 1898 eine Schmalspurbahn mit einer Spurweite von 750 Millimetern von Jagstfeld nach Neuenstadt vor. Am 25. Januar 1899 einigten sich Koppel und die Kommunen auf die genaue Streckenführung, die Lage der Bahnhöfe und die weiteren Formalitäten. Die Kommunen hatten Grund und Boden für die Trasse kostenlos zur Verfügung zu stellen und darüber hinaus einen einmaligen Zuschuss von 50.000 Mark pro Bahn-Kilometer zu leisten. Daraufhin legten die Orte die Planungen der württembergischen Regierung vor, die am 29. Juli 1899 die Konzession für den Bau der Schmalspurbahn erteilte und einen staatlichen Zuschuss von 20.000 Mark pro Bahn-Kilometer bewilligte. Dies motivierte auch die Gemeinden entlang des Kochers zwischen Neuenstadt und Künzelsau, um einen Lückenschluss zur Kochertalbahn Waldenburg–Künzelsau zu ersuchen.', 'Zwischenzeitlich löste sich am 13. Mai 1899 die WEG mit dem Koppel-Bevollmächtigten Köhler als erstem Direktor aus dem Unternehmen Arthur Koppel heraus. Die WEG übernahm landesweit sieben weitere Bau- und Betriebs-Konzessionen für Nebenbahnen von Koppel. Sie begutachtete die vorliegenden Pläne und schlug aufgrund der günstigen Geländeverhältnisse und der Wirtschaftlichkeit (Güterwagen konnten durchgehend befördert werden) eine Anpassung auf Normalspur vor. Die Kommunen stimmten dem zu und verpflichteten sich mit dem neuen Vertrag vom 2. Januar 1901, die Mehrkosten von 5000 Mark pro Bahnkilometer selbst zu tragen. Der Staat Württemberg genehmigte das Vorhaben mit seiner neuen Konzession vom 25. Juli 1902. Diese sah nun einen staatlichen Zuschuss von 28.000 Mark pro Kilometer, maximal aber 338.000 Mark vor. Der Streckenbau war binnen vier Jahren zu vollenden.', 'Ende 1904 konnten die Bauarbeiten aus westlicher Richtung mit der Strecke durch Jagstfeld und der Kocherbrücke bei Hagenbach in Angriff genommen werden. Beim Bau des oberen Teilstücks kam es dagegen zu Verzögerungen: Da sich Neuenstadt und Bürg nicht über die Lage des Endbahnhofs einigen konnten – Bürg forderte den Bahnhof direkt auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite des Kochers –, kündigte Bürg seine Unterstützung für das Projekt auf. Erst als die anderen Kommunen den offenen Betrag übernahmen, konnte 1906 der Bau am östlichen Streckenende aufgenommen werden.', 'Mit einem Jahr Verzögerung gegenüber der staatlichen Vorgabe wurden die Bauarbeiten 1907 abgeschlossen. Der Bau verlief ohne größere Unfälle; die Baukosten beliefen sich auf 1,49 Millionen Mark. Am 14. September 1907 fand schließlich die feierliche Einweihung der Nebenbahn Jagstfeld–Neuenstadt statt. Am darauf folgenden Tag nahm die WEG den regulären Betrieb auf.', 'Verlängerung nach Ohrnberg.', 'Noch während des Baus bis Neuenstadt nahm die WEG Planungen für die Verlängerung der Strecke nach Ohrnberg auf, nachdem Anfang 1907 die Gemeinden Gochsen, Kochersteinsfeld, Möglingen und Ohrnberg für die Verlängerung der Strecke petitioniert hatten. Württemberg erteilte der WEG am 17. Mai 1910 die Konzession für Bau und Betrieb der Verlängerung mit einer Laufzeit bis zum 1. November 2000. Pro Bahn-Kilometer betrug der staatliche Zuschuss 30.000 Mark. Die Anlieger-Gemeinden verpflichteten sich, in Summe 80.000 Mark beizutragen und Grund und Boden unentgeltlich zur Verfügung zu stellen.', 'Am 1. November 1911 konnten die Bauarbeiten aufgenommen werden, die den Bau zweier weiterer Brücken über den Kocher einschlossen. Die Bauzeit erstrecke sich über anderthalb Jahre bis Juli 1913, die Baukosten betrugen 1,072 Mio. Mark. Am 1. August 1913 konnte der Abschnitt Neuenstadt–Ohrnberg der Unteren Kochertalbahn feierlich eröffnet werden. Die Vervollständigung des Nebenbahnnetzes auf dem Gebiet des heutigen Landkreises Heilbronn fand damit ihren Abschluss.', '1924 verlängerte die Deutsche Reichsbahn die Kochertalbahn Waldenburg–Künzelsau noch bis Forchtenberg. Der rund 13 Kilometer lange Lückenschluss zwischen Forchtenberg und Ohrnberg kam – obwohl noch 1953 am 40-jährigen Bestehen der Strecke bis Ohrnberg debattiert – nicht mehr zu Stande. Planungen für eine Fortsetzung von Ohrnberg nach Öhringen oder nach Brettach–Bitzfeld–Bretzfeld erwiesen sich ebenfalls als nicht mehr realisierbar.', 'Weitere Entwicklung (1912–1990).', 'Nach der Eröffnung entwickelte sich das Verkehrsaufkommen vielversprechend. Bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg beförderte die Bahn jährlich rund 120.000 Personen. Dank des wirtschaftlichen Aufschwungs in den späteren 1920er Jahren erhöhte sich das Verkehrsaufkommen bis auf 350.000 Personen pro Jahr. Da wegen des Ersten Weltkriegs und der Krisen in den 1920er Jahren notwendige Instandhaltungsarbeiten an der Strecke unterblieben, konnte erst 1933 eine Sanierung in Angriff genommen werden.', 'Während der NS-Zeit wurde 1937 für den Militärflugplatz Oedheim auf Höhe des heutigen Hirschfeldparks ein Anschlussgleis eingerichtet, das rund zwei Kilometer in südöstlicher Richtung aus dem Kochertal herausführte. Gegen Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs erlitt die Strecke schwere Schäden, besonders durch Tieffliegerangriffe und Bombenabwürfe im Bereich des Bahnhofs Bad Friedrichshall-Jagstfeld, bei denen auch das Empfangsgebäude zerstört wurde. Am 8. November 1944 traf eine Bombe das Bahngleis nahe der Kocherbrücke bei Bad Friedrichshall-Hagenbach, der Betrieb konnte jedoch vorerst fortgesetzt werden. Erst nachdem die Wehrmacht auf ihrem Rückzug nach Süden am 1. April 1945 zwischen 18:00 und 20:00 Uhr alle drei Kocherbrücken gesprengt hatte, war kein Zugverkehr mehr möglich.', 'Im Laufe des Jahres 1946 konnte der Betrieb wiederaufgenommen werden: am 15. August bis Neuenstadt, am 23. September bis Möglingen und am 21. Dezember bis Ohrnberg. Von 1944 bis Kriegsende wurden auf dem Flugplatz die Wracks abgeschossener alliierter Flugzeuge gesammelt, die über das Anschlussgleis hierher gelangten. Nachdem der Schrottlagerplatz 1948 aufgelöst worden war, wurde das Gleis überflüssig und bald darauf entfernt.', 'Von 1951 bis 1952 errichtete die Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) für das zerstörte Empfangsgebäude des Bahnhofs Bad Friedrichshall-Jagstfeld einen Neubau. Das bis zur Zerstörung in Insellage gelegene Gebäude wurde durch einen Bau auf der östlichen Seite der Bundesbahn-Anlagen ersetzt, an der sich zuvor die Personenzug-Gleise der WEG befunden hatten.

Das mit einem Überrollbügel und festen Türrahmen ausgestattete Fahrzeug gilt als eines der ersten Sicherheitscabriolets; es wird in der Literatur auch als „Targa auf Englisch“ bezeichnet. Die Karosserie des Stag ist ein Entwurf des Turiner Designers Giovanni Michelotti. Der Stag wird von einem eigens für ihn entwickelten Achtzylinder-Ottomotor angetrieben, dessen Standfestigkeit anfangs problematisch war. Das in seiner achtjährigen Produktionszeit kaum weiterentwickelte Auto war kein Erfolg. Zwischen 1970 und 1977 entstanden weniger als 26.000 Exemplare.', 'Entwicklungsgeschichte.', 'Die Entwicklung des Triumph Stag fiel in eine Phase größerer, auf politischer Ebene initiierter Umstrukturierungen innerhalb der britischen Automobilindustrie. Die mit diesem Prozess verbundenen Reibungsverluste werden in der rückblickenden Literatur als wesentliche Gründe für die unvollkommene technische Entwicklung und den Misserfolg des Stag genannt. Aus heutiger Sicht besteht der Eindruck, der Stag sei „mehr zufällig als geplant“ und „in einem Umfeld von versteckten Fallen und fatalen Fehlern, von Fusion und Konfusion“ entstanden.', 'Unternehmenspolitisches Umfeld.', 'Das 1896 als Fahrradhersteller gegründete Unternehmen Triumph gehörte ab 1944 zur Standard Motor Company, die ihrerseits 1960 vom Nutzfahrzeug-Hersteller Leyland Motors übernommen wurde. 1967 schloss sich mit Rover ein Automobilhersteller dem Leyland-Konzern an, der bislang in einzelnen Bereichen mit Triumph konkurriert hatte. 1968 schließlich fusionierte Leyland mit British Motor Holdings, zu der neben den Mittelklassemarken Austin und Morris auch der Oberklassehersteller Jaguar gehörte, zur \\"British Leyland Motor Corporation\\". Diese Zusammenschlüsse waren von der Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (IRC) angeregt worden, einer sogenannten Mittlerorganisation (englisch: \\"Quango\\"), die die Labour-Regierung von Harold Wilson 1966 ins Leben gerufen hatte. Die IRC hatte die Aufgabe, Konzepte zu entwickeln, mit denen die internationale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der britischen Industrie und speziell der Automobilindustrie verbessert werden konnte. Dabei ging es insbesondere um die Bündelung der Ressourcen und damit verbunden um die Steigerung der Kosteneffizienz. Diese Absicht ließ sich beim Stag, dessen Entwicklung sich über einen wesentlichen Teil des Fusionierungsprozesses erstreckte, noch nicht umsetzen; der Stag nutzte nahezu keine Komponenten anderer Triumph- oder Leyland-Modelle.', 'Initiative Giovanni Michelottis.', 'Der Triumph Stag geht auf den italienischen Designer Giovanni Michelotti zurück. Michelotti hatte ab den späten 1950er Jahren nahezu jeden Triumph gestaltet und galt als Hausdesigner Triumphs. Ende 1964 entwarf er auf eigene Initiative ein 2+2-sitziges Cabriolet auf der Basis des Triumph 2000, einer 1963 erschienenen Limousine der oberen Mittelklasse, die die technische Grundlage des späteren Stag war. Das Cabriolet war anfänglich nur als \\"Showcar\\" für einen Stand Michelottis auf dem Genfer Auto-Salon 1966 gedacht; eine Serienfertigung hatte Michelotti zunächst nicht beabsichtigt.', 'Michelottis Werkstatt stellte das Cabriolet als Prototyp im Sommer 1965 fertig. Es hatte den ungekürzten Radstand der Triumph-Limousine. Stilistisch entsprach er bereits in weiten Teilen der späteren Karosserie des Stag, hatte aber noch keinen Überrollbügel. Ein weiteres Merkmal, mit dem der Prototyp vom späteren Serienmodell abwich, war die Frontpartie. Hier befand sich eine über die ganze Wagenbreite reichende Kühlergrillmaske, wobei die Frontscheinwerfer hinter einer beweglichen Klappe versteckt waren. Abgesehen davon stimmten die Proportionen und auch die Linienführung im Detail mit dem späteren Stag weitgehend überein.', 'Nachdem das Triumph-Management Michelottis Prototyp begutachtet hatte, kaufte Triumph Anfang 1966 die Rechte an dem Entwurf, bevor der Prototyp auch nur einmal ausgestellt worden war. Wenig später fiel die Entscheidung, das Modell in Serie zu produzieren.', 'Positionierung.', 'Der unter dem Codenamen Stag (deutsch: Hirsch, aber umgangssprachlich auch: ungebundener Herr) entwickelte Wagen war nach dem TR5 beziehungsweise dessen Nachfolger TR6 sowie dem Spitfire das dritte Cabriolet der Marke Triumph. Es sollte ein deutlich höheres Marktsegment bedienen als die beiden anderen offenen Triumph-Modelle und zugleich als Spitzenmodell der Marke fungieren. Innerhalb der British-Leyland-Hierarchie sollte der Stag die Lücke zwischen dem MGB und dem viel teureren Jaguar E-Type schließen, die sich nach der abzusehenden Einstellung des sechszylindrigen MGC auftat.', 'Im internationalen Vergleich zielte der Wagen in erster Linie auf den Mercedes-Benz SL, der seinerzeit noch ausschließlich von Sechszylinder-Ottomotoren angetrieben wurde, sowie auf Lancia und Alfa Romeo. Als vornehmlichen Absatzmarkt sah das Unternehmen wie bei seinen anderen Sportwagen die USA. Zielgruppe war nach Aussage des Entwicklungsingenieurs Harry Webster.', 'Konzeptionell verband der Stag, dieser Vorgabe folgend, Elemente des offenen Sportwagens mit denen eines Gran Turismo.', 'Entwicklungsteam.', '1966 begann die technische Entwicklung des Serienfahrzeugs. Sie war von einem Gegeneinander bislang konkurrierender Entwicklungsteams von Rover und Triumph geprägt, die erst 1967 durch die Rover-Übernahme in einem gemeinsamen Unternehmen zusammengeführt worden waren. Anfänglich leitete der Triumph-Ingenieur Harry Webster die Entwicklungsarbeiten. Nachdem er 1968 zu Austin-Morris gewechselt war, übernahm der von Rover kommende Charles Spencer „Spen“ King seine Position. Die Triumph-Ingenieure standen ihrem neuen Vorgesetzten wegen seiner Rover-Wurzeln kritisch gegenüber. Spen King wurde von ihnen nicht über alle Details unterrichtet und zum Teil auch fehlinformiert. Andererseits ließ King, der gleichzeitig mit der Entwicklung des ersten Range Rover und den konzeptionellen Anfängen des Rover SD1 beschäftigt war, dem Entwicklungsteam des Stag auch bewusst viel Freiraum.', 'Motorisierung: Triumph oder Rover?', 'Die größte Besonderheit des Stag war und ist seine Motorisierung. Der Stag hatte einen von Triumph selbst entwickelten und in keinem anderen Fahrzeug verwendeten Achtzylindermotor, dessen allgemein als unwirtschaftlich angesehene Entstehung im Widerspruch zu den Restrukturierungsbemühungen der \\"Industrial Reorganisation Corporation\\" stand. Sie war nach Auffassung vieler Autoren das Ergebnis einer innerbetrieblichen Rivalität von Triumph und Rover.', 'Entsprechend der Vorgabe für das avisierte Marktsegment war für Triumphs Spitzenmodell ein großvolumiger Ottomotor vorgesehen. Zur Wahl standen zunächst zwei, später drei Motoren:', 'Hinzu kam ein weiterer Achtzylindermotor von Jaguar, dessen Entwicklung in den späten 1960er Jahren unter großer Geheimhaltung begann und letztlich aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen aufgegeben wurde.', 'Anfänglich hatte es Überlegungen gegeben, den Stag mit dem bekannten, 2,5 Liter großen Sechszylindermotor aus dem Triumph 2000 auszurüsten. Frühe Testfahrten ergaben allerdings, dass dessen Motorleistungen wegen des im Vergleich zur Limousine erhöhten Fahrzeuggewichts des Cabriolets nicht die sportlichen Fahrleistungen ermöglichte, die die Unternehmensleitung erwartete. Das Management entschied sich stattdessen dafür, den Stag mit einem Achtzylindermotor anzubieten, um den Wagen technisch näher am Jaguar E-Type zu positionieren; zudem erwartete es eine erhöhte Anziehungskraft eines Achtzylinders auf dem US-amerikanischen Markt.', 'Nach der Fusion von Leyland und Rover erwog Spen King zeitweise, Triumphs Eigenentwicklung zugunsten des Rover-Motors einzustellen. Letztlich entschied er sich aber dafür, im Stag allein die Triumph-Konstruktion anzubieten. Als Folge dieser Entscheidung hatte British Leyland künftig neben Rovers 3,5 Liter großer Einheit einen weiteren Achtzylindermotor im Programm. Beide Triebwerke hatten keinerlei gegenseitig austauschbare Teile, boten aber ein nahezu identisches Leistungsbild (145 bhp beim Triumph- und 143 bhp beim Rover-Motor).', 'Die Entscheidung für den Beibehalt des Triumph-Motors wird vielfach auf gezielte Falschinformationen aus dem Entwicklungsteam, aber auch auf eine nur halbherzige Betreuung des Projekts durch Spen King zurückgeführt. Die Triumph-Techniker gaben unter anderem an, dass die Eigenentwicklung bereits zu weit fortgeschritten sei, um das Projekt noch mit wirtschaftlich vertretbarem Aufwand zu beenden. Ob das tatsächlich zutraf, wird in der Literatur angezweifelt: Tatsächlich benötigte Triumph noch fast zwei Jahre, bis der Stag-Motor annähernd serienreif war. Darüber hinaus vertraten die Triumph-Techniker die Auffassung, dass der Rover-Motor nicht in den schmalen Motorraum des Stag passe. Das war eine unzutreffende Behauptung: Tatsächlich rüsten Stag-Eigentümer bereits seit den 1970er Jahren ihre Wagen immer wieder auf Rover-Motoren um, und 1975 stellte British Leyland sogar werksseitig drei Prototypen mit dem Rover-Motor her. Jahre später bestätigte King, seinerzeit mit falschen Informationen versorgt worden zu sein, führte aber ergänzend aus, dass Rover zu dieser Zeit keine ausreichenden Fertigungskapazitäten hatte, um zusätzlich zu den selbst benötigen Motoren auch Einheiten für den Stag zu fertigen.', 'Konstruktion.', 'Karosserie.', 'Der Stag war Triumphs erster Sportwagen mit selbsttragender Karosserie. Die Karosserie bestand aus Stahl; die einzelnen gepressten Komponenten waren miteinander verschweißt. Der Aufbau und die Bodengruppe ähnelten in konstruktiver Hinsicht denen des Triumph 2000, die Bodengruppe und der Radstand waren allerdings im Vergleich zur Limousine um 12 Zentimeter verkürzt. Insgesamt gab es nur wenige Gleichteile. An verschiedenen Stellen waren Verstärkungen in die Stag-Karosserie eingearbeitet, unter anderem in der Spritzwand und hinter den Rücksitzen. British Leyland bezog anfänglich Stahl aus Großbritannien; ab 1974 wechselte es aus Kostengründen zu italienischem und spanischem Stahl, der nach Ansicht zeitgenössischer Fahrer deutlich rostanfälliger war.', 'Sicherheitscabriolet und Hardtopcoupé.', 'Der Triumph Stag war ein 2+2-sitziges Cabriolet. Michelottis Entwurf war noch ein Vollcabriolet mit Stoffverdeck gewesen, das ohne Überrollbügel auskam. Testfahrten mit dem Prototyp hatten allerdings gezeigt, dass diese Version sehr verwindungsfreudig war. Um die nötige Festigkeit des Aufbaus zu gewährleisten und mit Blick auf eine erwartete Verschärfung US-amerikanischer Sicherheitsbestimmungen entschied sich das Entwicklungsteam bereits im Herbst 1966 dazu, den Wagen mit einem Überrollbügel auszurüsten.', 'Den Überrollbügel gestaltete Michelotti im Auftrag von Triumph. Er war gepolstert, reichte hinter den Türen in Dachhöhe über die gesamte Wagenbreite und war in der Mitte durch eine Strebe mit dem Windschutzscheibenrahmen verbunden.

November 1904 in St. Joseph, Missouri; † 19. Mai 1969 in New York) war ein US-amerikanischer Jazzmusiker (Tenorsaxophon und Klarinette). Er gilt als „Vater“ des Tenorsaxophonspiels und war neben Lester Young einer der ersten stilbildenden Solisten auf dem Instrument. In seiner von 1922 bis 1969 währenden Karriere wurde er zuletzt dem Mainstream Jazz zugeordnet, nahm aber immer wieder Herausforderungen an und spielte mit den jeweiligen Avantgardisten ihrer Zeit. Seine Spitznamen waren \\"Hawk\\" und \\"Bean\\".', 'Leben.', 'Frühe Jahre (1904–1934).', 'Coleman Hawkins stammte aus einer Mittelschichtfamilie und wuchs im Mittleren Westen der USA auf. Seine Mutter spielte Klavier und Orgel; mit vier Jahren brachte sie den jungen Hawkins dazu, Klavierspiel zu lernen; mit sieben Jahren begann er Cello zu spielen und mit neun Jahren bekam er ein C-Melody-Saxophon. Seine ersten Auftritte hatte er im Alter von zwölf Jahren bei Schulveranstaltungen in einer Trio-Besetzung mit Piano und Schlagzeug; durch diese Auftritte wurde er bald zu einer lokalen Berühmtheit. Seine Eltern schickten ihn daraufhin zur weiteren musikalischen Ausbildung nach Topeka; dort traf er mit dem Pianisten Jesse Stone und seinen \\"Blue Serenaders\\" zusammen und gehörte der Band einige Monate an. Deren Musik war ein \\"Territory Jazz\\" mit einem lockeren Two-Beat-Rhythmus.', 'Ab 1921 war er als Musiker in Kansas City aktiv; im April nahm die Vaudeville-Blues-Sängerin Mamie Smith den Siebzehnjährigen in ihre Begleitband \\"Jazz Hounds\\" auf und konnte seine Eltern überreden, ihn mit ihr auf Tournee gehen zu lassen. Hawk spielte dort Blues und New-Orleans-Jazz im Stil von King Oliver und Louis Armstrong. Sein damaliger Kollege Garvin Bushell erinnerte sich, dass Hawkins vor allem deshalb in die Band geholt wurde, weil er Noten lesen konnte; „er war auf diesem Instrument in allem weiter, als ich je gesehen hatte … Er konnte alles lesen und irrte sich in keiner einzigen Note … Und er spielte sein Saxophon nicht, als sei es eine Trompete oder Klarinette, wie es damals üblich war. Er spielte auf den Akkorden, weil er als Kind Klavier gespielt hatte.“', 'Anfang Mai 1922 gastierten die \\"Jazz Hounds\\" für Schallplatten-Aufnahmen in New York City („Mean Daddy Blues“); in dieser Zeit gab Hawkins auch Einlagen mit dem Cello. Inzwischen war er zum Star und zur Attraktion der Band geworden, bekam aber nur wenige solistische Freiräume, was ihn dazu bewog, auszusteigen und in New York zu bleiben. Dort bekam er Jobs in den Bands von Ralph Jones und Cecil Smith, bis er im angesehenen Orchester von Wilbur Sweatman landete. Dort hörte ihn Fletcher Henderson, der ihn 1924 in seine Band holte. Zunächst war er aber nur bei einigen Plattenaufnahmen anwesend, wie bei „Dicty Blues“ am 9. August 1923.', 'Fest zur Band gehörte er erst, als diese ein Engagement im Club \\"Alabam\\" bekam. Schließlich war es der \\"Roseland Ballroom\\", wo er ab September 1924 an der Seite von Don Redman und Louis Armstrong zum führenden Solisten aufstieg und seinen eigenen Stil entwickelte, wie etwa in „The Stampede“ 1926 und dem Hit „Queer Notions“ 1933. In diese Zeit fiel seine erste Ehe mit einer Tänzerin namens Gertrude, die er noch aus seiner Zeit mit Mamie Smith kannte. 1929 ließen sich die beiden wieder scheiden.', '„Spätestens ab 1929 war Hawkins’ Ruf als bester Tenorsaxophonist durch die Platten und Auftritte mit Fletcher Henderson unumstritten, und sein Einfluss auf andere Saxophonisten, nicht nur Tenorsaxophonisten, war überwältigend“, schrieb sein Biograph Teddy Doering. So wurde Hawkins immer häufiger zu Aufnahmen anderer Bandleader oder Produzenten herangezogen, so bei den \\"Little Chocolade Dandies\\" im September 1929, kurz darauf bei den McKinney’s Cotton Pickers und mit Red McKenzies \\"Mound City Blue Blowers\\", mit denen er „If I Could Be with You“ einspielte. Ende 1930 wechselte die Henderson-Band vom \\"Roseland\\" zu \\"Connie’s Inn\\", einem Kellerclub mit hohem Ansehen, aus dem Auftritte im Radio ausgestrahlt wurden.', \\"Ein Höhepunkt in Hawkins’ Werk bei Henderson war „It's the Talk of the Town“ von 1932, nach Joachim-Ernst Berendt wahrscheinlich die erste große Solo-Balladen-Interpretation der Jazzgeschichte. Am 29. September 1932 entstanden Hawkins’ erste Einspielungen unter eigenem Namen mit dem Engländer Spike Hughes, durch den er erfuhr, wie hoch sein Ansehen in Europa war. Zuvor hatte er einen soeben aus Europa zurückgekehrten Kollegen darüber reden gehört, wie gut dort die Arbeitsbedingungen für Musiker seien, besonders für Schwarze. Umgehend schickte er ein Telegramm an Jack Hylton, den „englischen Paul Whiteman“, in dem nur stand: „Ich möchte nach England kommen.“ Hylton antwortete schon am nächsten Tag; Hawkins nahm Urlaub bei Fletcher Henderson, weil er glaubte, nur ein oder zwei Monate in Europa zu bleiben. Letztlich blieb er aber bis 1939.\\", \\"Kurz vor seiner Abreise nach Europa produzierte John Hammond im März 1934 Duoaufnahmen des Saxophonisten mit dem Pianisten Buck Washington; es scheint, als ob diese Aufnahmen („I Ain't Got Nobody“ und „It Sends Me“) teilweise mit ihrer „Schroffheit und Kühnheit aus heutiger Sicht wie ein Vorschatten des Bebop“ wirkten.\\", 'Zu der Entscheidung, eine Weile in Europa zu arbeiten, trug auch die „Entthronung“ Hawkins’ Anfang des Jahres 1934 bei, als er mit dem Henderson-Orchester in Kansas City weilte und im neu eröffneten Nachtclub \\"Cherry Blossom\\" auf Lester Young, Ben Webster, Herschel Evans und weitere Kansas-City-Tenoristen traf. Mary Lou Williams war Ohrenzeugin dieser Jamsession: „Bean Hawkins hatte nicht damit gerechnet, dass die Kaycee-Tenoristen so gewaltig waren, und war unsicher und konnte keine rechte Linie finden, obgleich er den ganzen Morgen spielte.“', 'In Europa (1934–1939).', 'Er verließ New York am 30. März und spielte nach seiner Ankunft in London zunächst in Jack Hyltons großem Orchester wie auch in dem kleineren Ensemble, das von seiner Frau Ennis geleitet wurde; Weihnachten 1934 kam Hawkins erstmals nach Paris. Im Anschluss waren einige Auftritte in Deutschland geplant, doch das nationalsozialistische Regime verbot dem Schwarzen Hawkins die Einreise. Hylton ließ Hawkins in Holland zurück, wo dieser mit Theo Uden Masman und seinen \\"Ramblers\\" spielte. Die Zusammenarbeit mit den \\"Ramblers\\" gipfelte in drei Aufnahmesitzungen, im Februar und August 1935 („I Wanna Go Back to Harlem“). Schon nach der ersten Session beschloss Hawkins, nicht mit Hylton nach England zurückzukehren; ihn lockte Paris. Im Februar trat er bei einem Konzert mit französischen Musikern im Salle Pleyel auf, das der Hot Club de France organisiert hatte. Im März nahm er mit dem Orchester von Michel Warlop auf; mit dabei die Stars des Quintette du Hot Club de France, Django Reinhardt und Stéphane Grappelli. Anschließend ging Hawkins auf eine ausgedehnte Skandinavien-Tournee, wo er begeistert gefeiert wurde. Nach einem längeren Aufenthalt in der Schweiz fanden am 28. April 1937 seine berühmte Aufnahmen mit Benny Carter, Reinhardt und Grappelli für \\"Swing\\" in Paris statt, wo „Honeysuckle Rose“ und „Crazy Rhythm“ eingespielt wurden.', 'Das Jahr 1938 verbrachte Hawkins vorwiegend in den Niederlanden, wo er unter anderem im \\"Negro Palace\\" in Amsterdam spielte, und in Belgien; dort spielte er in Namur in der Band seines Landsmannes Arthur Briggs. Er versuchte eine Arbeitserlaubnis für England zu bekommen, die ihm jedoch von der Musiker-Gewerkschaft verweigert wurde. Mit einem Trick gelang es seinen englischen Fans, ihn ins Land zu holen: der Saxophon-Hersteller Selmer organisierte eine Tournee durch Großbritannien, die der „Schulung“ dienen sollte, da Hawkins nur für Musiker spielen werde. Darauf hatten die Gewerkschaften keinen Einfluss, und Hawkins ging im März/April auf England-Tournee. Danach wollte er eigentlich nach Holland zurückkehren; die angespannte politische Lage in Europa bewog ihn aber zur Rückkehr in die Vereinigten Staaten. Es kam noch zu einigen Auftritten in England, erneut mit Hylton; Hawkins wurde als „Variety-Künstler“ angekündigt. Die letzten Vorkriegsaufnahmen entstanden Ende Mai mit dem Hylton-Orchester; dann kehrte er Anfang Juli nach Holland zurück und war am 31. Juli wieder in New York.', 'Swing Combos, \\"Body and Soul\\" und Bebop (1939–1945).', 'In den fünf Jahren seiner Abwesenheit hatte sich die Szene in den USA verändert; neue Saxophonisten wie Chu Berry und Ben Webster (diese hatten hintereinander Hawkins Platz bei Henderson eingenommen) hatten sich Achtung verschafft, insbesondere aber Lester Young, der nicht mehr die Konkurrenz seines wenige Monate zuvor verstorbenen Rivalen Herschel Evans fürchten musste. In diese Situation kam Coleman Hawkins zurück; und seine Rückkehr machte sofort „die Runde“. Lester Young trat gerade mit Billie Holiday auf, als Hawkins hereintrat; Rex Stewart berichtete von diesem Moment: „Bean marschierte herein, packte sein Instrument aus und spielte zu jedermanns Überraschung mit ihnen.“', 'Schon vor seiner Abreise in die USA hatte Coleman Hawkins seine künftigen Arbeitsmöglichkeiten abgeklärt; er hatte die Option, mit eigener Band in \\"Kelly’s Stable\\" (141 West, 51st Street) aufzutreten. Da seine Wunschmusiker wie Red Allen, Benny Carter, Roy Eldridge, John Kirby oder Teddy Wilson in anderen Bands erfolgreich arbeiteten, stellte er ein achtköpfiges Ensemble mit jungen Musikern und der Sängerin Thelma Carpenter zusammen. Mit seiner Band trat er im \\"Arkadia\\" auf, einem Tanzlokal am Broadway. Am 11. Oktober 1939 ging die Band ins Studio, um für das Label Bluebird vier Titel einzuspielen.', '„Drei Stücke sind bereits im Kasten, und quasi als Dreingabe, damit zwei Platten gefüllt werden können, steht ‚Body and Soul‘ auf dem Programm, das gewöhnlich als Abschluss der Clubauftritte diente“, schrieb der Kritiker Werner Wunderlich zu der historischen Session. „Herausragende Musiker hat Hawkins nicht in seinem Ensemble, folglich ist er mit seinem Tenorsaxophon der alleinige Solist bei diesem Stück. Und genau diese, seine Version des oft gespielten Standards wird in einem Meilenstein, zu einer Jahrhundertaufnahme des Jazz, exemplarisch für eine Jazz-Ballade. Mit ‚Body and Soul‘ weist sich Coleman Hawkins als einer der ganz Großen aus, als der ‚Vater des Tenorsaxophons‘“, meinte Wunderlich in seiner Besprechung der „Jahrhundertaufnahmen des Jazz“. „Die vollendete Architektur seines Solos, in dem jeder Ton mit zugleich zwingender Logik und glühender Intensität zum nächsten führt, wurde unzähligen Generationen zur unvergesslichen Lektion über den dramaturgischen Aufbau von Improvisation“, stellt Marcus A. Woelfle fest in seinem Beitrag zu „Body and Soul“ im Buch über Jazz-Standards.

Geschützt durch einen massiven Schutzschild und ein Stoßdämpfersystem „reitet“ das Raumschiff auf den Schockwellen der Explosionen. Ein nukleares Pulstriebwerk nach dem Orion-Prinzip vereint einen hohen spezifischen Impuls mit einem hohen Schub. Dies ist unter den Antriebsmethoden für die Raumfahrt eine einzigartige Eigenschaft.', 'Das Orion-Projekt wurde 1957 von General Atomics unter der Leitung von Theodore B. Taylor und Freeman Dyson gestartet. Es wurde nacheinander von der US-amerikanischen militärischen Forschungsbehörde ARPA, der United States Air Force und der NASA gefördert. Die Finanzierung blieb immer in einem Rahmen, der das Projekt auf der Stufe einer Machbarkeitsstudie hielt. Es kam nie zu einem Probelauf des Antriebes oder dem Bau eines Prototyps, es wurden lediglich Modellversuche mit konventionellen Sprengstoffen durchgeführt. Das Projekt wurde 1965 aus politischen Gründen und wegen des 1963 in Kraft getretenen Vertrags zum Verbot von Nuklearwaffentests in der Atmosphäre, im Weltraum und unter Wasser abgebrochen.', 'Entwicklungsgeschichte.', 'Die Geschichte des Orion-Projektes wird durch den Versuch bestimmt, eine dauerhafte Versorgung mit finanziellen Mitteln zu erreichen. Das Projekt wurde nacheinander an eine Reihe von Geldgebern weitergereicht, die auch für die jeweiligen Entwurfsphasen kennzeichnend sind. Die Geldgeber stellten zwar jeweils genug Mittel bereit, um das Projekt weiterzuführen, es gelang aber nicht, eine für einen Prototyp ausreichende Finanzierung zu erwirken. Das Projekt kam dadurch letztlich nie über den Status einer Machbarkeitsstudie hinaus.', 'Ursprünge.', 'Das Prinzip eines durch Schwarzpulverexplosionen angetriebenen Raumfahrzeuges geht auf unabhängige Arbeiten von Hermann Ganswindt (vorgeschlagen ab ca. 1880, publiziert 1891) und Nikolai Iwanowitsch Kibaltschitsch (vorgeschlagen 1881, publiziert 1918) zurück. Ganswindt beschreibt z. B. ein „Weltenfahrzeug“, das mit einer Reihe von Dynamitexplosionen angetrieben werden sollte. Die erste wissenschaftliche Studie zu einem durch Dynamitexplosionen angetriebenen Fahrzeug wurde 1900 von Roman Gostkowski veröffentlicht.', 'Den ersten Vorschlag, ein Raumschiff mit Atombomben anzutreiben, machte 1946 Stanisław Marcin Ulam in einer 1956 mit Cornelius Everett veröffentlichten Publikation über die mathematischen Grundlagen für einen nuklearen Pulsantrieb. Der Atomic Energy Commission wurde später ein auf diesem Entwurf basierendes Patent zugesprochen.', 'Beginn des Projekts.', '1956 wurde das Unternehmen General Atomics unter der Führung von Frederic de Hoffmann als eine Tochter von General Dynamics gegründet; es hatte sich als Unternehmensziel gesetzt, die damals ungeahnten Möglichkeiten der neu entdeckten Atomenergie nutzbar zu machen. Francis de Hoffman gelang es, viele der Physiker, die während des Zweiten Weltkrieges in Los Alamos tätig waren, für eine Tätigkeit bei General Atomics zu gewinnen. Er bot ihnen eine Arbeitsatmosphäre, in der die Wissenschaftler wie in Los Alamos schöpferisch an eigenen Ideen arbeiten konnten, ohne durch Bürokratie gehemmt zu sein. Zu diesen Physikern gehörte Ted Taylor, der seinerseits Freeman Dyson überzeugen konnte, für ein Jahr bei General Atomics zu arbeiten.', 'Zusammen entwickelten sie zunächst den TRIGA-Reaktor, wandten sich dann aber dem gemeinsamen Traum der friedlichen Erforschung des Sonnensystems zu. Taylor war in Los Alamos mit den Ideen Ulams in Berührung gekommen, und so begannen er und Dyson sich mit ersten Entwürfen eines Raumschiffes mit nuklearem Pulsantrieb zu beschäftigen. Unter dem ehrgeizigen Motto „Zum Mars bis 1965, zum Saturn bis 1970“ planten Taylor und Dyson Missionen zur Erforschung des Sonnensystems.', 'Die ersten Entwürfe sahen ein 60 Meter hohes, wie ein Geschoss geformtes Raumschiff mit einer Prallplatte von 40 m Durchmesser vor. Das Raumschiff mit einer Masse von 4000 t sollte eine Nutzlast von 1600 t in den Orbit befördern und vom Boden aus in Jackass Flats, einem Teil der Nevada Test Site, starten. Es sollte 2600 Treibladungen tragen, von diesen wären etwa 800 Treibladungen mit einer Sprengkraft zwischen 0,15 kt und 5 kt nötig gewesen, um den Orbit zu erreichen, die verbleibenden Treibladungen hätten eine Rundreise zum Mars und sogar Saturn ermöglicht.', 'Ausgelöst durch den Sputnikschock wurde im Februar 1958 die \\"Advanced Research Projects Agency\\" (\\"ARPA\\", eine Behörde des Verteidigungsministeriums der Vereinigten Staaten, die Forschungs-Projekte durchführt) gegründet. Diese sollte Raumfahrtprojekte gebündelt fördern. Im April des gleichen Jahres stellten Taylor und Dyson der ARPA ihren Raumschiffentwurf vor, die daraufhin das Projekt mit 1 Million Dollar finanzierte.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der ARPA.', 'Nach der Gründung der NASA im Juli 1958 wurden die Raumfahrtprojekte der ARPA zwischen ihr und der Air Force aufgeteilt. Die NASA übernahm alle zivilen Raumfahrtprojekte, die Air Force die militärischen. Allerdings zeigten weder die NASA noch die Air Force Interesse an dem Orion-Projekt. Die Air Force sah in Orion keine zukünftige Waffe, die NASA hatte die Entscheidung getroffen, dass ihr ziviles Raumfahrtprogramm nicht-nuklear sein und nicht der Geheimhaltung unterliegen sollte. Das Orion-Projekt verblieb so als einziges Raumfahrtprojekt bei der ARPA.', 'Als für die Finanzierung hinderlich stellte sich heraus, dass viele Budgetverantwortliche das Projekt für „verrückt“ hielten. Sie konnten nicht glauben, dass es möglich war, ein Fahrzeug mit Explosionen anzutreiben, ohne dass dieses dabei beschädigt oder zerstört wird.', 'Um die grundsätzliche technische Machbarkeit eines explosionsgetriebenen Fahrzeuges zu zeigen, wurde deshalb ein Modell mit einer Prallplatte von einem Meter Durchmesser gebaut, der sogenannte \\"Hot-Rod\\" oder \\"Putt-Putt\\". Das Fiberglas-Modell mit 120 kg Gewicht stieß nacheinander bis zu sechs ca. ein Kilogramm schwere Treibladungen aus C4 aus. Mit diesem Modell gelang am 14. November 1959 ein Flug mit einer Gipfelhöhe von 56 m, zwei Tage später wurde sogar eine Flughöhe von etwa 100 m erreicht. Ein Film über die erfolgreichen Flugversuche half in der Folge die weitere Finanzierung zu sichern. Eines der Modelle befindet sich heute im National Air and Space Museum der Smithsonian Institution.', 'Die Flugversuche mit den Modellen erbrachten Kenntnisse, die direkt für die weitere Entwicklung nützlich waren, zum Beispiel welche Form die Prallplatte haben musste, um ein günstiges Verhältnis von Gewicht und Stabilität zu erreichen. Außerdem ergaben die Flugversuche, dass zumindest durch die Temperaturen und Drücke, die mit konventionellen Sprengstoffen erreicht werden konnten, keine Materialabtragungen (Ablation) an der Oberfläche der Prallplatte zu erwarten waren. Die Ablation wurde bei weiteren Experimenten mit Plasma-Generatoren, die das Bombenplasma simulieren sollten, weiter untersucht.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der Air Force.', 'Die ARPA entschied Ende 1959, das Orion-Projekt aus Gründen nationaler Sicherheit nicht weiter zu unterstützen. Die US Air Force übernahm daraufhin das Projekt, allerdings nur unter der Voraussetzung, dass militärische Anwendungen gefunden würden. Das stand aber gegen die eigentlich angestrebte friedliche Nutzung des Projekts.', 'Militärisch sollten kleine Orions jetzt wie eine moderne Interkontinentalrakete mit Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) genutzt werden. Sie sollten aus Silos starten, bis über das Zielgebiet fliegen und dort zunächst eine große Menge Täuschkörper abwerfen. Erst wenn die feindliche Verteidigung durch die Täuschkörper überlastet wäre, sollten die eigentlichen Gefechtsköpfe gestartet werden. Ein anderer Vorschlag sah große Orion-Raumschiffe vor, die mit einem ähnlichen Missionsprofil wie die modernen strategischen U-Boote im tiefen Raum patrouillieren sollten.', 'Die militärischen Möglichkeiten wurden von einigen Militärs durchaus ernst genommen. Der Kalte Krieg war in vollem Gange, das atomare Wettrüsten hatte begonnen. Thomas Power, der Leiter des Strategic Air Command, war gar der Meinung, dass „wer immer Orion kontrolliert, die Welt kontrolliere“. Auf seine Veranlassung wurde im März 1962 das Modell eines militärischen Orion-Raumschiffes unter voller Bewaffnung gebaut. Dieses „Schlachtschiff“ sollte unter anderem eine Bewaffnung von 500 Sprengköpfen tragen. Man führte das Modell Präsident John F. Kennedy vor, als dieser die Vandenberg Air Force Base besuchte. Kennedy war davon geschockt und versagte dem Projekt die nötige politische Unterstützung. Mitten im Kalten Krieg wollte Kennedy kein nukleares Wettrüsten im Weltraum riskieren.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der NASA.', 'Die weitere Entwicklung des Orion-Projekts bei der Air Force wurde von Verteidigungsminister Robert McNamara verhindert. Er sah Orion nicht als militärisches Projekt und verweigerte deshalb eine erweiterte Finanzierung, ohne die der Bau eines Prototyps nicht möglich war. Um das Projekt doch noch über den Status einer Machbarkeitsstudie hinaus zu bringen, wandten sich Taylor und Dyson deshalb an die NASA, von der sie sich zusätzliche Mittel erhofften.', 'Die Entwürfe wurden den Voraussetzungen bei der NASA angepasst. Von einem Bodenstart wollte man absehen, da dieser zu „schmutzig“ gewesen wäre, um ohne massive Proteste der Öffentlichkeit stattfinden zu können. Stattdessen passte man die Größe der Orion-Schiffe an die verfügbaren Trägerraketen an – das an die Saturn-Raketen angepasste Orion-Design hatte jetzt eine Prallplatte mit zehn Meter Durchmesser. Eine Variante (\\"Lofting\\") sah vor, eine Saturn-1C-Stufe als Booster zu benutzen. Diese sollte das Orion-Raumschiff in eine Höhe bringen, in der das gefahrlose Zünden des nuklearen Pulsantriebes möglich war. Eine zweite Variante (\\"Boost-to-Orbit\\") sah drei Einzelteile vor, die jeweils von einer Saturn-V-Rakete in den Orbit gebracht werden und dort zusammengebaut werden sollten.', 'Als mögliches Ziel sah man eine Marsmission mit acht Mann Besatzung und 100 t Nutzlast vor.

Das Neue Testament überliefert jedoch nur wenige als zuverlässig geltende biografische Details über ihn. Spätere Notizen werden vielfach als legendarisch angesehen. Ein Aufenthalt Petri in Rom wird in der Bibel nicht erwähnt.', 'Die römisch-katholische Kirche führt den Primatsanspruch des Papsttums über die Gesamtkirche auf die Tradition zurück, Petrus sei der erste Bischof von Rom gewesen und Christus habe Petrus und dieser den folgenden Bischöfen von Rom einen Vorrang als Leiter, Lehrer und Richter aller Christen gegeben. Die Päpste werden daher auch als „Nachfolger Petri“ bezeichnet. Die übrigen Kirchen lehnen diesen Anspruch ab. Historisch gab es im 1. Jahrhundert noch keinen Monepiskopat, das heißt, die christliche Gemeinde wurde nicht von einem einzelnen römischen Bischof geleitet. Dennoch gilt Petrus auch für die altorientalischen, orthodoxen, altkatholischen sowie die anglikanischen Kirchen als erster Bischof von Rom und als Heiliger.

Jahrhundert und verdanken ihre Entstehung, Verbreitung und Überlieferung nicht zuletzt den kirchenpolitischen Interessen der Autoren und Tradenten, die in der Auseinandersetzung mit häretischen Strömungen innerhalb des frühen Christentums den Bibelkanon, das monarchische Bischofsamt und die Idee der apostolischen Sukzession entwickelten. Sie betonen zum einen die Bedeutung Petri für die Vorrangstellung Roms vor den übrigen Patriarchaten und stellen ihn zum anderen als Beispiel für einen „sündigen Heiligen“ dar, dessen Verleugnung und anschließende Reue und Bekehrung zeige, dass allen Menschen das Heil offensteht.', 'Apostelakten zu Simon Petrus werden in der Regel als Legenden beurteilt, die weitgehend ahistorische Erzählungen beinhalten.', 'Archäologische Zeugnisse für eine Petrusverehrung in Rom stammen aus dem 1. Jahrhundert. Ob sie seinen Aufenthalt und sein Begräbnis dort belegen, ist stark umstritten.', 'Angaben im Neuen Testament.', 'Name.', 'Alle Evangelien kennen den Jünger unter dem Namen \\"Simon\\"; Jesus redet ihn bis auf eine Ausnahme immer so an. Es handelt sich um die griechische Form des biblischen Namens Simeon (hebräisch \\"Schim’on\\"), dem Tanach zufolge einer der Söhne Jakobs und Stammvater eines der zwölf Stämme Israels. Patriarchennamen waren unter palästinischen Juden dieser Zeit besonders beliebt und wurden häufig auch in der griechischen Übersetzung verwendet. Da auch Simons Bruder Andreas einen griechischen Namen trägt, scheint diese Namensform die ursprünglichere zu sein. und nennen ihn \\"Symeon\\", eine Gräzisierung der hebräischen Namensform.', 'In nennt Jesus seinen Jünger mit Vatersnamen \\"Simon Barjona\\" („Simon, Sohn des Jona“). Zu möglichen politischen Konnotationen dieser Anrede und zu der Frage, ob der Vater der beiden Apostel Jona oder, wie es an anderer Stelle im Neuen Testament heißt, Johannes (hebräisch \\"Jochanan\\") geheißen haben kann, gibt es verschiedene Theorien (siehe unten, Abschnitt „Herkunft und Berufung“).', 'Paulus von Tarsus nennt den Apostel meist \\"Kephas\\" (Κηφᾶς), eine gräzisierte Form des auch in den Evangelien überlieferten Beinamens \\"Kefa\\" (Kēp’, in hebräischen Buchstaben כיפא), ein aramäisches Wort, das als Eigenname kaum belegt ist und eigentlich „Stein“ bedeutet. übersetzt den Namen zweimal ins Griechische zu Πέτρος \\"(Pétros)\\", was ebenfalls „Stein“ bedeutet und mit dem griechischen Wort für „Fels“ (πέτρα) verwandt ist. Im Hebräischen hat das Wort \\"kēp\\" (כֵּף) ebenfalls die Grundbedeutung „Fels“ oder „Stein“. Sowohl das semitische als auch das griechische Wort bezeichnen einen gewöhnlichen Naturstein (Wurfstein, Bruchstein, Kieselstein), im Hebräischen auch einen Felsen (zum Beispiel ), im Aramäischen kann (seltener) ebenfalls ein Felsen, Felsbrocken oder eine Felsenspitze gemeint sein.', 'Jesus selbst soll Simon den Beinamen \\"Kefa\\" verliehen haben; wo und wann, überliefern die Evangelien unterschiedlich. Einige Exegeten nahmen an, Simon habe den Beinamen erst als Apostel der Urgemeinde angenommen, und dies sei nachträglich auf Jesus zurückgeführt worden (vgl. Joh 1,42). Die meisten Forscher (darunter Peter Dschulnigg, Joachim Gnilka, Martin Hengel, John P. Meier, Rudolf Pesch) gehen jedoch davon aus, dass Simon diesen Beinamen bereits im ersten Jüngerkreis trug, da \\"Kephas\\" in einigen der ältesten NT-Schriften als eigentlicher Name oder von Anfang an verwendeter Beiname (; Mt 4,18; 10,2) des Apostels erwähnt ist. Auch wird zumeist angenommen, dass ihm der Beiname tatsächlich von Jesus gegeben wurde. John P. Meier weist darauf hin, dass die Evangelien eine Nennung des Namens \\"Petrus\\" oder \\"Kephas\\" im Munde Jesu an vielen Stellen auffällig vermeiden; er hält es für denkbar, dass dieser Name für den Gebrauch im Verhältnis unter den Jüngern, aber nicht im Verhältnis zu Jesus bestimmt war.', 'Vermutet wurde auch, der ursprüngliche Sinn des Namens erschließe sich aus der angenommenen Wortbedeutung „Edelstein“ im Aramäischen, was die besondere Rolle Simons als Wortführer der Erstberufenen hervorheben könnte. Die Sinnverschiebung zu „Fels“ als Fundament der Kirche sei dann als nachösterliche Umdeutung zu verstehen. Die im Anschluss an Rudolf Pesch vermutete Übersetzung von \\"kefa\\" als „Schmuckstein“ oder „Edelstein“ zur (auszeichnenden) Benennung einer Person ist vom Aramäischen her jedoch nicht hinreichend zu belegen, da der Gebrauch der aramäischen Wurzel \\"kp\\" als Personenname nicht nachgewiesen ist und überhaupt kaum Beispiele einer Verwendung des Wortes in der Bedeutung „Edelstein“ bekannt sind, in denen dieses Verständnis nicht durch Zusammensetzungen, attributive Zusätze (etwa „guter Stein“ im Sinne von „edel“ oder „wertvoll“) oder einen eindeutigen Kontext nahegelegt würde.', 'Der protestantische Heidelberger Judaist und Talmud-Übersetzer Reinhold Mayer (1926–2016) vermutete, der Namensgebung durch Jesus liege neben dem Gedanken an den Grundstein des Jerusalemer Tempels eine ironische Anspielung auf den ungewöhnlichen Namen des zu seiner Zeit amtierenden Hohenpriesters Kajaphas (קיפא) zugrunde. Die in griechischer Umschrift verschieden vokalisierten Namen \\"Kaiphas\\" und \\"Kephas\\" unterscheiden sich in hebräischer Schrift nur in den anlautenden Konsonanten (Koph bei \\"Qajfa\\" statt Kaph bei \\"Kefa\\"), die sehr ähnlich klingen. Damit wohne dem Namen ein (möglicherweise durchaus ernst gemeinter) Anspruch auf die Ablösung des Hohenpriesters durch den Führer der Zwölfergruppe um Jesus inne, der selbst im Rahmen seines Messianismus den Königstitel für sich beanspruchte. Der erst durch die Jerusalemer Inschriftenfunde von 1990, mit denen der Name des Hohepriesters erstmals in hebräischen Schriftzeichen belegbar wurde, ins Bewusstsein der Forschung getretene „verblüffende Gleichklang des Beinamens des Simon mit dem des höchsten Amtsinhabers am Jerusalemer Tempel“ wirft auch für den katholischen Exegeten Martin Ebner ein neues Licht auf den viel umrätselten Beinamen des Simon Petrus. Falls Absicht dahinterstecke, hätte „Jesus mit dieser delikaten Spitznamenwahl eine symbolische Enteignung vorgenommen“.', 'Ähnlich wie \\"Jesus Christus\\" wurde auch \\"Simon Petrus\\" spätestens mit der lateinischen Bibelübersetzung Vulgata (um 385) zum Eigennamen.', 'Herkunft und Berufung.', 'Simon stammte wie Jesus aus Galiläa und war nach Aussage des Markusevangeliums an seiner Sprache als Galiläer erkennbar (Mk 14,70 par.). Er gehörte zu den ersten Jüngern, die Jesus in seine Nachfolge berief. Die Überlieferungen beschäftigen sich praktisch nur mit der Zeit nach dieser Berufung; Angaben über Alter und Geburt des Simon sowie über die Herkunft und den sozialen Status seiner Familie gibt es keine.', 'Nach hieß Simons Vater Johannes. In spricht Jesus ihn als \\"Simon Barjona\\" an, aramäisch „Sohn des Jona“. Jona dürfte hier als Kurzform von Johannes aufzufassen sein. Als Adjektiv bedeutet \\"barjona\\" allerdings auch „impulsiv“ oder „unbeherrscht“. Darin sahen manche Ausleger Hinweise auf eine mögliche frühere Zugehörigkeit Simons zu den Zeloten, da im späteren Talmud jüdische Freiheitskämpfer als \\"barjonim\\" (Plural) bezeichnet wurden.', 'Simon hatte einen Bruder namens Andreas, der wohl jünger als Simon war, da alle Apostellisten diesen zuerst nennen. Beide waren Fischer am See Genezareth. Nach Mk 1,16 traf Jesus sie am Seeufer beim Auswerfen ihrer Fischernetze und forderte sie auf, ihm nachzufolgen.

Inside the OnServerEvent function, we wait for the player’s character to load, then create a new Animation instance and set its AnimationId property to the appropriate animation ID from the “Animations” table. Next, we load the animation onto the player’s humanoid and play the animation track. Finally, we print a message to the console indicating which animation was played for which player.

Aus einem Marktflecken am Südufer des Rheins entwickelte sich im Laufe des 12. Jahrhunderts, während der Herrschaft der Zähringer, eine befestigte Stadt. Die Burg war mehrere Jahrzehnte Hauptwohnsitz der Habsburger, während die Stadt von 1218 bis 1330 sowie ab 1415 reichsfrei war, bis sie schliesslich 1439 dauerhaft unter habsburgische bzw. österreichische Herrschaft geriet. Rheinfelden war direkt von den Auswirkungen des Dreissigjährigen Krieges betroffen und nach der Schlacht bei Rheinfelden von 1638 bis 1650 von schwedischen und französischen Truppen besetzt. 1797 von Frankreich erobert, gelangte die Stadt 1802 zur Schweiz und ist seit 1803 Bezirkshauptort im Kanton Aargau. Seit den 1970er Jahren wuchs die Einwohnerzahl stark an, als die Stadt zu einem Teil der Agglomeration Basel wurde.', 'Bedeutende Wirtschaftsfaktoren sind die Herstellung von Bier (die hier ansässige Brauerei Feldschlösschen ist die grösste der Schweiz) und der Abbau umfangreicher Salzvorkommen durch die Saline Riburg.

Jahrhunderts die Entwicklung Rheinfeldens zu einem Kurort, der sich schrittweise den Erfordernissen des modernen Tourismus anpasste und heute überwiegend auf Therapie und Rehabilitation ausgerichtet ist.', 'Geographie.', 'Rheinfelden liegt 17 Kilometer östlich von Basel, im nordwestlichen Zipfel des Kantons Aargau an der Grenze zu Deutschland. Das Stadtgebiet erstreckt sich entlang dem linken Ufer des Hochrheins über eine Länge von rund neun Kilometern, bei einer durchschnittlichen Breite von etwa zweieinhalb Kilometern. Prägend für die Entstehung der Stadt ist das \\"Inseli\\", eine rund 150 Meter lange und 47 Meter vom linken Ufer entfernt befindliche Insel aus Muschelkalkfelsen. Diese dient gleichzeitig als natürlicher (Zwischen-)Brückenkopf für die Rheinquerung. Im Flussbett verläuft ein steilwandiger Graben, eine tektonische Plattengrenze am äussersten südöstlichen Rand der Oberrheinischen Tiefebene. Der 700 Meter lange Graben beginnt bei einer als \\"Höllhaken\\" bezeichneten Stromschnelle und endet bei der Rheinbrücke im St.-Anna-Loch, einem 32 Meter tiefen Becken mit gefährlichen Strudeln.

Die Altstadt Rheinfeldens befindet sich auf einer Felsterrasse, die zur gleichen Formation wie das Inseli gehört. Im Westen fällt die Terrasse zum \\"Heimendeckenloch\\" ab. Diese im Jahr 1903 weitgehend überdeckte, einst bis zu 14 Meter tiefe Schlucht bildete in prähistorischer Zeit ein Rheinbett, durch das später der von Süden herkommende Magdenerbach floss. Seit der Zeit der Stadtgründung fliesst der Bach östlich an der Altstadt vorbei in den Rhein. In fast ihrer gesamten Breite wird die Altstadt von einer ausgeprägten Hangkante durchzogen, ihr östlichster Teil ist durch künstliche Verfüllung ausnivelliert. Südlich der Altstadt und westlich des Magdenerbaches erhebt sich eine weitere Terrasse, der Kapuzinerberg. Dieser geht in einen Ausläufer des Tafeljuras über, den \\"Berg\\" (). Östlich des Baches erhebt sich der \\"Steppberg\\" ().

Durch das spätere Stadtgebiet Rheinfeldens verlief eine Römerstrasse ostwärts über den Bözbergpass nach Vindonissa (Windisch). Eine Strassenkreuzung im Bereich des heutigen Gasthofes «Drei Könige» war vermutlich Standort einer Zollstation, die in einem vor 537 kompilierten Verzeichnis als \\"Caistena Cassangita\\" bezeichnet wird und im 8. Jahrhundert beim Geographen von Ravenna erscheint. Dort zweigte ein Weg ins Magdenertal ab, ein weiterer führte zu einer Fähre am Rhein (mit einem Treidelpfad am gegenüberliegenden Ufer zur Überwindung der Stromschnellen). 2001 wurden zwei nach Augusta Raurica führende römische Wasserleitungen freigelegt, im selben Jahr im Augarten Reste einer befestigten Anlage mit Getreidespeicher aus dem 4.

Der Aargau scheint nach 900 dem sich ausweitenden hochburgundischen Reich einverleibt worden zu sein. Rudolf II. gelang es jedoch 919 in der Schlacht bei Winterthur die weitere Expansion zu beenden und 920 Anerkennung als schwäbischer Herzog durch König Heinrich I. zu finden. Der Augstgau, das Gebiet im spitzen Winkel zwischen Rhein und Aare, bildete fortan den nordöstlichsten Zipfel des Königreichs Burgund. 1006 erhielt Heinrich II., König des Ostfrankenreichs und späterer römisch-deutscher Kaiser, das Gebiet vom letzten Burgunderkönig Rudolf III. geschenkt.', 'Ebenfalls im 10.

Die meist auffällig gefärbten, baumbewohnenden Spechte sind klein bis mittelgroß. Ihr Verbreitungsgebiet erstreckt sich vom nördlichen Nordamerika bis ins zentrale Südamerika, wo sie in unterschiedlichen, meist aber eher offenen, baumbestandenen Landschaften vorkommen. Einige Arten sind Endemiten der größeren Karibikinseln. Nur die an den nördlichen Arealgrenzen beheimateten Populationen sind obligate Zugvögel, einige Arten weisen jedoch ein unstetes, wenig ortsgebundenes Verhalten auf und neigen zu irruptiven Wanderungen. Die meisten Arten ernähren sich von verschiedenen baum- oder bodenbewohnenden Insekten sowie von Samen, Früchten und Beeren, nur wenige ernähren sich überwiegend von Früchten und anderen pflanzlichen Nahrungsbestandteilen. Alle sind Höhlenbrüter, die ihre Nachkommen in selbst gebauten Höhlen großziehen, die in toten oder stark geschädigten Bäumen, in Palmen oder Kakteen gebaut werden. Zumindest acht Arten leben in zum Teil stark differenzierten sozialen Verbänden, außerhalb der Brutzeit werden fast alle Arten in Familienverbänden oder kleinen, gelegentlich auch artlich gemischten Gruppen angetroffen. Einige, wie zum Beispiel der Eichelspecht, betreiben eine intensive Vorratshaltung. Zurzeit werden 24 Arten unterschieden, von denen der Rotkopfspecht und der Guadeloupespecht auf der Vorwarnliste der IUCN stehen.', 'Aussehen.', 'Sowohl im Aussehen als auch in der Größe sind die Vertreter dieser Spechtgattung sehr variabel. Die kleinsten Arten, wie etwa der Yucatánspecht erreichen mit 16 Zentimetern gerade Kleinspechtgröße, bei vielen Arten liegt die Körpergröße um die 23 Zentimeter, sie sind also gut buntspechtgroß, und die größte Art, der Bahamaspecht, ist mit 32 Zentimetern etwa so groß wie der heimische Grünspecht.', 'Alle \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten sind vierzehig mit zygodactyler Zehenanordnung.', 'In Bezug auf die Gefiederfärbung lassen sich zwei etwa gleich große Gruppen unterscheiden: Die Vertreter der einen sind auf der Oberseite auffällig schwarz-weiß, oder, wie beim Haitispecht schwarz-gelb, meist leiterartig gebändert, zuweilen aber auch gefleckt oder punktiert. Je nach Gewichtung der Farbelemente erscheint die Oberseite insgesamt eher hell oder dunkel. Gelbtöne können vor allem in den Schulterpartien vorhanden sein. Die Unterseite ist cremefarben, in den Hals- und Brustbereichen oft auch gelblich oder ockerfarben, sie kann weitgehend ungezeichnet oder auffällig dunkel gefleckt oder speerspitzenartig gebändert sein. Braun- und Rosatöne sind in unterschiedlicher Ausprägung vorhanden. Die Gesichtspartie dieser Spechte ist meist weitgehend hell, die Männchen tragen einen deutlichen, leuchtend hellroten Stirn- und Nackenfleck und meist auch einen rötlichen Bartstreif. Diese Merkmale sind bei den Weibchen auf den Nackenbereich reduziert oder fehlen völlig. Bei dem auf der Oberseite meist schwarz-weiß gezeichneten Stützschwanz sind die beiden Zentralfedern verlängert und laufen spitz zu. Der sehr spitze, mittellange bis lange Stocherschnabel ist dunkel hornfarben, gerade oder am First leicht abwärts gebogen. Arten dieses Typs sind vom südlichen Nordamerika, in Mittelamerika, auf vielen Karibikinseln sowie in Südamerika bis zur südlichen Verbreitungsgrenze vertreten.', 'Die Spechte der zweiten Gruppe sind bedeutend uneinheitlicher gefärbt. Gemeinsam ist ihnen eine weitgehend zeichnungslose Schwarzfärbung der Oberseite, die auch für die gesamte Gattung namensgebend wurde. Einige Arten, wie der Rotkopfspecht mit leuchtend rotem Kopf, Nacken, Brust und Schultern oder der Weißspecht sind sehr auffällig und für Spechte ungewöhnlich gefärbt. Letzterer ist überhaupt die einzige Spechtart, bei der die Kopffärbung beider Geschlechter weitgehend weiß ist und die einzige \\"Melanerpes\\"-Art, der jegliches Rot fehlt. Einige Arten, wie der Guadeloupespecht oder der Blutgesichtspecht, weisen dagegen eine düstere, kontrastarme Färbung auf. Insgesamt überwiegen schwarz-weiße Kontraste. Die schwarzen Körperpartien, vor allem das Rückengefieder, können einen leicht grünlichen, bläulichen oder violetten Glanz aufweisen. Gefiederzeichnungen sind nicht oder nur sehr undeutlich vorhanden. Daneben kommen vor allem im Stirn- und Scheitelbereich reine Rottöne vor, an Brust und Flanken dunkle, matte Purpurfärbungen. Der Färbungsdimorphismus ist bei einigen dieser Spechte eher schwach ausgeprägt, beim Rotkopfspecht und beim Blutgesichtspecht sind die Geschlechter im Aussehen gleich. Die meisten Arten innerhalb dieser Gruppe haben einen meißelartigen, an der Basis recht breiten, geraden oder nur geringfügig abwärts gebogenen Schnabel.', 'Zwei Arten, der Gelbbrauenspecht und der Kaktusspecht, sind in je zwei Farbmorphen vertreten.', 'Lautäußerungen.', 'Aufgrund ihrer Unterschiedlichkeit lassen sich die Lautäußerungen der \\"Melanerpes\\"-Spechte nicht gemeinsam beschreiben. Informationen dazu finden sich in den meisten der betreffenden Artbeiträge. Bei sozial lebenden Arten stehen die Gruppenmitglieder in ständigem Rufkontakt und sind deshalb akustisch sehr auffällig. Dies gilt zum Beispiel für Gruppen des Eichelspechts, dessen Mitglieder sich mit lauten \\"Wäka\\"-Rufen verständigen. Andere, wie etwa der Blutgesichtspecht verhalten sich sehr ruhig. Die Spechte dieser Gattung trommeln nur selten und eher leise, einige offenbar überhaupt nicht.', 'Verbreitung und Lebensraum.', 'Die Verbreitung von \\"Melanerpes\\" beschränkt sich auf die Nearktis und die Neotropis. Außer dem kontinentalen Festland Nord-, Mittel- und Südamerikas haben einige Arten verschiedene Karibikinseln besiedelt. Am weitesten nach Norden dringen der Blutgesichtspecht im westlichen Nordamerika und der Rotkopfspecht im zentralen und östlichen Nordamerika vor, am weitesten nach Süden erstreckt sich das Verbreitungsgebiet von Weißspecht und Kaktusspecht, die bis ins nördliche Patagonien vorkommen. Die größte Artenvielfalt auf vergleichsweise engem Raum besteht mit vierzehn Arten in Mittelamerika und auf verschiedenen Karibik-Inseln, auf denen Guadeloupespecht, Scharlachbrustspecht, Haitispecht, Jamaikaspecht und Bahamaspecht Inselendemiten sind. Auch einige mexikanische, beziehungsweise mittelamerikanische Arten, wie der Yucatánspecht, der Graukehlspecht, der Goldwangenspecht oder der Hoffmannspecht kommen nur in kleinen, zudem auch zunehmend fragmentierten Gebieten vor. Im nordwestlichen Südamerika sind die bisher bekannten Verbreitungsgebiete des Buntkopfspechts und des erst kürzlich als eigenständige Art klassifizierten Schmuckspechts sehr klein. Flächenmäßig ausgedehnte Gebiete besiedeln dagegen die meisten nordamerikanischen und, mit Ausnahme der beiden oben genannten, die südamerikanischen Arten.', 'Die Lebensräume der einzelnen Arten sind äußerst vielfältig, immer aber müssen baum-, zumindest aber kakteenbestandene Landschaften zur Verfügung stehen. Insgesamt zeigen die meisten Arten eine Präferenz für offene Landschaften, Waldränder, Rodungsflächen oder für Gebiete mit offenen Strukturen, die von Bränden oder Stürmen geschaffen wurden. Die Baumartenzusammensetzung der Lebensräume ist sehr variabel und spielt offenbar nur für die wenigen Nahrungsspezialisten unter den \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten, wie den Eichelspecht, eine wichtige Rolle. Dieser ist eng an das Vorkommen seiner Nahrungsbäume, verschiedene Eichenarten, gebunden. Für viele Arten ist ein ausreichender Totholzanteil innerhalb des Lebensraumes ein wichtiges Requisit. Zwar dringen einige Arten in dichte Waldgebiete vor, den primären Lebensraum bilden diese jedoch nur für wenige. \\"Melanerpes\\"-Spechte kommen in ausgesprochen feuchten Habitaten, wie Mangrovensümpfen und Schwemmlandgebieten ebenso vor wie in mit Saguaro bestandenen Halbwüsten oder in den Dornbuschsavannen des Chaco. Die meisten Arten sind relativ anpassungsfähig und können innerhalb eines räumlich begrenzten Verbreitungsgebietes sehr unterschiedliche Lebensräume besiedeln; dies gilt besonders für die Inselendemiten. Viele Arten haben sich an die Anwesenheit des Menschen gewöhnt und brüten auch in Stadtgebieten, in großen Parks, Plantagen oder in Obstgärten, auch Futterstellen werden von einigen \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten regelmäßig aufgesucht.', 'Arten dieser Gattung kommen vom Meeresniveau bis zu den regionalen Baumgrenzen vor. Futtersuchende Eichelspechte wurden in Kolumbien noch in Höhen von 3500 Metern festgestellt.', 'Nahrung und Nahrungserwerb.', 'Alle \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten sind sowohl herbivor als auch carnivor. Die Zusammensetzung und die Anteile pflanzlicher und tierischer Nahrung variieren sowohl von Art zu Art als auch innerhalb derselben Art. Generell wird in der Vorbrutzeit und während der Jungenaufzucht mehr tierische Nahrung aufgenommen, im Herbst und Winter verstärkt pflanzliche. Auch die Jungen werden mehrheitlich, aber nicht ausschließlich mit tierischer Nahrung versorgt. Diese Unterschiede gelten vor allem für die Arten der höheren nördlichen und südlichen Breiten, bei den tropischen Arten sind die jahreszeitlichen Unterschiede in der Nahrungszusammensetzung geringer. Die meisten können als Nahrungsgeneralisten bezeichnet werden, das breiteste Nahrungsspektrum unter den \\"Melanerpes\\" weisen wahrscheinlich der Rotkopfspecht und der Gilaspecht auf. Vergleichsweise spezialisiert sind dagegen der Eichelspecht und der Weißspecht, die sich von Eicheln beziehungsweise verschiedenen Früchten ernähren. Soweit bekannt, ist nur der Goldmaskenspecht weitgehend herbivor.', 'Die tierische Nahrung besteht vor allem aus Insekten. Hier überwiegen Ameisen, Termiten, Käfer und ihre holzbewohnenden Larven, Schmetterlingsraupen, Heuschrecken, Grillen und bei den kleinen Arten Blattläuse. Auch Fluginsekten spielen eine Rolle, Rotkopfspecht und Blutgesichtspecht ernähren sich während der Sommermonate vornehmlich von solchen. In geringerem Maße werden auch Spinnen, Tausendfüßer, Schnecken, gelegentlich auch kleine Eidechsen und kleine Säugetiere erbeutet.

Er entsteht oft spontan durch Selbstentzündung. Voraussetzung ist, dass die Kohle mit Sauerstoff in Kontakt kommt. Bei Kohleflözbränden kann dies auf natürlichem Wege geschehen, wenn das Flöz durch Gebirgsbildung und Erosion an die Erdoberfläche tritt. Auch werden solche Brände durch den Untertagebau verursacht, wenn Luft durch Bewetterung (Frischluftversorgung) an die Flöze gelangt. Häufig entstehen die Brände unter Tage in einem Alten Mann (verlassenen Hohlraum), in dem sich noch Restkohle befindet.', 'Kohlebrände können ebenfalls nach der Umlagerung der Kohle entstehen. Bekannt sind hier brennende Halden – Brände in Kohle- und Kokshalden, Brände in Abraumhalden, die noch genügend Restkohle, vor allem an vereinzelten Stellen mit erhöhter Konzentration enthalten – und Brände während des Transports von Kohle in Schiffen und in Eisenbahnwagen.', 'Solange die Reaktionstemperaturen im Bereich von ca. 150 bis 500 °C liegen, spricht man von \\"unvollständiger Verbrennung\\" oder \\"Schwelbrand\\". Diese Art der Verbrennung tritt bei Sauerstoffmangel auf. Oberhalb von 500 °C geht der Brand bei ausreichender Sauerstoffzufuhr in einen \\"Glimmbrand\\" (bis ca. 1000 °C) oder einen \\"Flammbrand\\" (bis 1200 °C) über, es erfolgt eine \\"vollständige Verbrennung\\".', 'Arten von Kohlebränden.', 'Kohleflözbrände.', 'Kohleflözbrände können unterteilt werden in oberflächennahe Brände in ausstreichenden, also an der Oberfläche zu Tage tretenden Flözen, wo der Sauerstoff aus der Luft stammt, und in Brände in Bergwerken in größerer Tiefe. Dort stammt der Sauerstoff aus der Bewetterung.', 'Spontane Kohlebrände.', 'Ursache spontaner Kohlebrände ist die Entzündlichkeit der Kohle. Bei einem Kohlebrand reagiert der Sauerstoff mit den Feststoffmolekülen des Brennstoffs. Diese exothermen Reaktionen finden bei allen Temperaturen statt. Die Geschwindigkeit ist jedoch stark temperaturabhängig, so steigt die Reaktionsrate mit zunehmender Temperatur annähernd exponentiell an. Wenn ein Brennstoff in zerkleinerter Form vorliegt, etwa als Feststoffschüttung, oder wenn der Feststoff porös ist, ist im gesamten System Sauerstoff vorhanden.', 'Eine unterkritische Lagerung erfolgt, wenn die im Schüttungsinneren freigesetzte Wärmeenergie kleiner ist als die Wärmeenergie, die durch Wärmeleitung an den Rand der Schüttung transportiert und über die Schüttungsoberfläche an die Umgebung abgegeben werden kann. Wird jedoch im Inneren der Feststoffschüttung mehr Wärmeenergie freigesetzt, als nach außen abgeführt werden kann, geht das System in einen kritischen Zustand über. Die Temperatur im Inneren steigt an, führt damit zu einer weiteren Erhöhung der Reaktionsrate und in der Folge zur Selbstentzündung.', 'Zwei wesentliche Faktoren entscheiden, ob eine Selbstentzündung erfolgt oder nicht, die Umgebungstemperatur und die Schüttungsgröße:', 'Die meistgenannte Kenngröße für den Start dieses Prozesses ist die \\"Selbstentzündungstemperatur\\" (SET). Sie ist keine „Stoffkonstante“, sondern immer abhängig von der Schüttungsgröße und -geometrie, insbesondere dem Verhältnis von Volumen zu Oberfläche und nimmt mit steigendem Schüttungsvolumen ab.', 'Natürlich ist die Selbstentzündungstemperatur auch von den Eigenschaften des jeweiligen Brennstoffes abhängig. Dazu zählen unter anderem der Brennwert, die Wärmeleitfähigkeit und die Korngröße. Ihre Angabe ist daher etwas heikel, da man immer die genauen Untersuchungsbedingungen angeben muss. Bei gleichen Bedingungen wird die Selbstentzündungstemperatur für Steinkohle höher liegen als die für Braunkohle.', 'Im Gegensatz zu einer „fassbaren“ Zündquelle, wie einer offenen Flamme oder einer heißen Oberfläche, läuft der Prozess der Selbstentzündung ohne fremde Einwirkung ab. Ist eine Schüttung hinreichend groß, kann dieser Prozess auch schon bei Temperaturen ablaufen, die im Bereich der Jahres-Mitteltemperatur eines Ortes liegen. Dies war zum Beispiel bei der sogenannten Senatsreserve in Berlin der Fall. Die dort auf Vorrat gehaltene Kohle war zum Teil überkritisch und entzündete sich demnach selbst. Dabei ist zu bemerken, dass die Induktionszeiten, also die Zeiten vom Beginn einer Lagerung bis zur Entzündung, umso kürzer werden, je größer die Schüttung und damit umso kleiner die Selbstentzündungstemperatur ist. Im Fall der Senatsreserve betrug die Induktionszeit mehrere Jahre.', 'Braunkohle kann schon bei Temperaturen von ca. 40 °C bis 60 °C spontan zu brennen beginnen, während dies bei der höchstwertigen Anthrazitkohle erst ab 140 °C möglich ist. Der Brand entsteht meist einige Dezimeter innerhalb der Kohle, in einer Tiefe, in der einerseits die Permeabilität der Kohle den Zutritt von Luft noch zulässt, andererseits die Durchlüftung die entstehende Wärme nicht größtenteils abführt. Die niedrige Wärmeleitfähigkeit der Kohle lässt eine Wärmeableitung ohne Fluidzirkulation nicht zu.', 'Faktoren, die die spontane Entzündung beeinflussen, sind unter anderem:', 'Die spontane Entzündung von Kohle braucht Zeit. Sie hängt von vielen Faktoren ab, unter anderem von der Umgebungstemperatur, aber auch von dem Volumen der Kohle, im Laborversuch also von der Probengröße (siehe dazu auch die erkannten Mechanismen der Heuselbstentzündung). Die Zeit bis zur Selbstentzündung ist ein weiteres Maß für die Entzündungsneigung der Kohle. Bei großen Kohlemengen, beispielsweise in situ, ist also zwar die notwendige minimale Umgebungstemperatur kleiner als bei kleinen Kohlemengen, anderseits dauert es sehr lange, üblicherweise Monate, bis sich eine Kohleprobe entzündet.', 'Wo ein Flöz nahe an der Erdoberfläche liegt, hat die Luft einen unmittelbaren und effektiveren Zutritt. Hier entstehen derartige Brände spontan und können jahrzehntelang brennen. Insgesamt werden auf der Welt mindestens 20 bis 30 Millionen Tonnen Kohle jährlich durch diese Brände vernichtet. Für den Bergbau unbrauchbar gemacht wird mindestens die zehnfache Kohlemenge, weil die verbleibende Restkohle nicht mehr zugänglich oder nicht mehr wirtschaftlich abbaubar ist.', 'Es gibt zwei wärmeproduzierende Adsorptions-Vorgänge:', 'Die wesentlichen Reaktionen des Kohlenstoffs mit dem Luftsauerstoff sind:', 'Fremdentzündete Kohleflözbrände.', 'Kohleflözbrände entstehen zum überwiegenden Teil durch Prozesse der Selbstentzündung. In wenigen Fällen ist jedoch eine Fremdentzündung möglich. Dem Brand ist dann letztlich nicht anzusehen, wie er entstanden ist. Dies gilt insbesondere für Brände unter Tage, aber auch für oberflächennahe Brände, soweit sie im Zusammenhang mit oberflächennahem Bergbau stehen. Mögliche Ursachen sind elektrische Betriebsmittel in unsachgemäßem Zustand, heißgelaufene Rollen von Förderbändern sowie Unachtsamkeit bei Spreng-, Schweiß- oder Schleifarbeiten.', 'In aller Regel spielt auch das Zurücklassen von Restkohle in abgebauten Flözteilen oder die Ansammlung von Kohlestaub in größeren Mengen eine Rolle. Eine konsequente Einhaltung der bergmännischen Vorschriften schließt derartige Fremdentzündungen aus.', 'Untertägige Kohleflözbrände können in Wechselwirkung mit Methanexplosionen oder Kohlestaubexplosionen stehen. Oberflächennahe Kohleflözbrände entzünden häufig Waldbrände und umgekehrt. Dieses wurde aus den USA, insbesondere aber von der indonesischen Insel Sumatra berichtet.', 'Kohlebrände nach der Förderung.', 'Brände in Kohlelagern.', 'Die abgebaute Kohle, aber auch Koks wird auf großen Halden oft monatelang gelagert. Hierbei gibt es gesetzliche Vorschriften zur Vermeidung von Selbstentzündung. So wurde zum Beispiel für \\"Kohlen- und Kokshalden im Bereich der Bergaufsicht\\" von Nordrhein-Westfalen festgelegt, dass die Kohle in horizontalen Scheiben von jeweils höchstens sechs Meter Höhe zu lagern ist. Je nach Kohlenart und -sorte ist dabei eine maximale Schütthöhe festgelegt.', 'In älteren Halden können oft noch erhebliche Mengen an Kohle enthalten sein. Großbritannien hatte erhebliche Probleme mit brennenden Halden. Diese sind jedoch inzwischen ausgegraben und begrünt. Die auch heute in Deutschland noch brennenden Halden werden teilweise aus der Luft mit Wärmebildgeräten überwacht. Diese vergleichsweise kleinen Brände werden durch Injektionen von Zement oder Anhydrit unterdrückt.', 'In Kohlenstaubanlagen wird Kohle mit einer Korngröße kleiner als 0,5 Millimeter verarbeitet. Auslöser eines Brandes ist dabei nur selten eine Selbstentzündung, sondern in der Regel eine fremdentzündete Staubexplosion. Hier sind die Brandschutzvorgaben der Berufsgenossenschaft sehr rigide. Derartige Anlagen werden oft unter dem Einsatz von Inertgas, zur Verringerung des vorhandenen Sauerstoffs, betrieben. Auf Schutz vor Funkenflug, hohen Temperaturen (max. 80 °C) und den Kohlenmonoxid-Wert zur Anzeige von Schwelbränden muss geachtet werden.', 'Kohlebrände beim Transport.', 'In der Zeit der Dampfschifffahrt kam es zu Bränden beim Transport von Kohle. Anfangs wurde die Kohle für die noch wenig verbreiteten Dampfschiffe auf Segelschiffen aus Holz transportiert. In der Zeit von 1871 bis 1880 kamen so 152 britische Schiffe zu Schaden, 68 waren Totalverluste und 84 wurden schwer beschädigt. Nach ersten wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen erkannte man den Zusammenhang, dass die Zahl der Brände mit zunehmender Reisedauer und mitgeführter Menge zunahm. Zwar wurde das erste Eisenschiff bereits 1838 gebaut, aber dieser Schiffstyp konnte sich nicht durchsetzen. Erst als nach 1881 die ersten Stahlschiffe in Großbritannien entstanden, verlor der Kohletransport einen Teil seiner Gefahr, weil die Kohle nun in nicht brennbaren Stahlbunkern transportiert werden konnte.', 'Ein Kohlebrand wird nach den seit 1976 erfolgten Untersuchungen zur Explosion des US-Schlachtschiffes \\"Maine\\" im Februar 1898 im Hafen von Havanna als Auslöser für die Entzündung der Schwarzpulvervorräte in der zum Kohlebunker benachbarten Munitionskammer angenommen.

Es gibt keine Hinweise auf eine kontinuierliche Besiedlung nach dem römischen Abzug.', 'Hinweise auf eine Besiedlung der Hochfläche über der Niddamündung gibt es erst wieder aus dem 8. Jahrhundert. 790 wurde zum ersten Mal das fränkische Dorf \\"Hostat\\" (hohe Stätte) im Lorscher Codex urkundlich erwähnt. Um 830, wenige Jahrzehnte nach der Ersterwähnung, wurde die weitgehend erhaltene Justinuskirche errichtet, eine der ältesten Kirchen in Deutschland. Das Dorf entwickelte sich in der Folge westlich der Justinuskirche beiderseits der alten Hauptstraße. Über 1000 Jahre gehörte Höchst zu Kurmainz, dem Territorium des Erzbischofs von Mainz. Das Mainzer Rad im Wappen des Stadtteils erinnert daran.', 'Zur Erhebung von Zöllen am Main errichtete die Mainzer Herrschaft in Höchst eine Zollburg. Um die Burg herum begann sich das Dorf langsam zu entwickeln. 1355 verlieh Kaiser Karl IV. dem Dorf \\"Hoisten\\" (Höchst) die Stadtrechte. In einer weiteren Urkunde bekräftigte Karl IV. 1356 die Stadterhebung und verlieh der jungen Stadt das Marktrecht. Grund für die Stadterhebung waren der Machtkampf zwischen Mainz und Frankfurt und die Erhebung des Höchster Mainzolls. Die in Höchst erhobenen Zölle waren für den finanzschwachen mainzischen Staat eine wichtige Einnahmequelle. Da die Handelsstadt Frankfurt durch den Mainzoll ihre wichtigste Lebensader bedroht sah, zerstörten die Frankfurter 1396 Stadt und Burg Höchst, die aber bald danach wiederaufgebaut wurden. Im 15. Jahrhundert wurde die Stadt zweimal erweitert.', 'Beim Großen Stadtbrand 1586 wurde die Hälfte der Stadt zerstört. Im Dreißigjährigen Krieg wurde auch Höchst in Mitleidenschaft gezogen.

Der Trommelwolf ist neben der in Griechenland endemischen Art \\"H. strandi\\" einer von zwei in Europa vorkommenden Sumpfwölfen (\\"Hygrolycosa\\") und außerdem Spinne des Jahres 2022.', 'Bei dem Trommelwolf handelt es sich um eine tagaktive Wolfspinne, die, wie die meisten Arten der Familie, als freilaufender Lauerjäger und demzufolge ohne ein Spinnennetz vorzugsweise verschiedene Insekten erlegt. Die Spinne erhält ihren Trivialnamen durch das markante Balzverhalten des Männchens, bei dem es mit dem Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) auf trockene Blätter trommelt und dabei ein charakteristisches Schnurrgeräusch erzeugt, das auch noch aus einer Entfernung von mehreren Metern für das menschliche Gehör wahrnehmbar ist. Einige Zeit nach der Paarung fertigt das Weibchen einen Eikokon an, den es nach Eigenart der Familien an den Spinnwarzen angeheftet permanent mit sich herumträgt. Die geschlüpften Jungtiere verbleiben anfangs – für Wolfspinnen atypisch – nicht auf dem Opisthosoma des Muttertiers, sondern an den Resten des Kokons, ehe sie sich verselbstständigen und über mehrere Fresshäute (Häutungsstadien) heranwachsen.', 'Die ungewöhnliche Balz sowie der anfängliche Verbleib der Jungtiere waren mitunter Gründe, weshalb der Trommelwolf von der Arachnologischen Gesellschaft (AraGes) zur Spinne des Jahres 2022 gekürt wurde. Ein anderer Grund ist, dass damit auf die von ihm bewohnten und gefährdeten Habitate und insbesondere auf das Austrocknen der Moore aufmerksam gemacht werden soll. Auch soll damit die bisher nicht ganz geklärte Verbreitung der Spinne näher in den Fokus geraten.', 'Merkmale.', 'Das Weibchen des Trommelwolfs erreicht nach Sven Almquist (2005) eine Körperlänge von 4,5 bis 6,9 Millimetern, wobei der Durchschnittswert 5,5 ± 0,7 Millimeter ist. Das Männchen kann 4,9 bis 5,6 Millimeter lang werden. Der grundsätzliche Körperbau der Art gleicht dem anderer Sumpfwölfe (\\"Hygrolycosa\\").', 'Sexualdimorphismus.', 'Wie viele andere Spinnen weist auch der Trommelwolf einen ausgeprägten Sexualdimorphismus (Unterschied der Geschlechter) auf. Dieser kann sich mitunter in der Größe der Geschlechter bemerkbar machen, da das Weibchen der Art im Regelfall größer als das Männchen wird. Die optischen Hauptunterschiede beider Geschlechter liegen jedoch in der Farbgebung.', 'Weibchen.', 'Der Carapax (Rückenschild des Prosomas bzw. Vorderkörpers) des Weibchens ist nach Almquist 2,44 bis 3,03 Millimeter und durchschnittlich 2,85 ± 3,03 Millimeter lang sowie 1,79 bis 2,13 und durchschnittlich 2,11 ± 0,18 Millimeter breit. Das Verhältnis zwischen Länge und Breite des Carapax beläuft sich laut demselben Autor beim Weibchen auf 1,28 bis 1,43 und dabei durchschnittlich auf 1,35 ± 0,04 Millimeter. Er ist außerdem um 13° geneigt.', 'Beim Weibchen ist der Carapax leicht gelbbraun gefärbt und mit zwei rötlichen ab den posterior (vorgesetzt) lateralen (seitlichen) Augen beginnenden Bändern versehen. An den Flanken befinden sich braune Punkte. Die Färbung der Ränder ist rotbraun. Die Cheliceren (Kieferklauen) des Weibchens sind rotgelb und frontal mit dunkleren Linien versehen. Das Sternum (Brustschild des Prosomas) besitzt eine leicht gelbliche Färbung und an den Flanken dunkelrote Punkte.', 'Die Beine des Weibchens sind gelbbraun gefärbt. Die Femora (Schenkel) und die Patellae (Glieder zwischen den Femora und den Tibien) erscheinen heller und haben braune Punkte.', 'Das Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) des Weibchens hat dorsal (oberhalb) eine blasse rotbräunliche Grundfarbe. Anterior (vorne) befindet sich auf dieser Seite ein ebenfalls blasser Lanzettfleck und posterior (hinten) verläuft dort ein breites median (mittig) angelegtes Band, das braun gefärbt ist und Reihen weißer Punkte enthält. Die Flanken des Opisthosomas sind ebenfalls geblasst und besitzen schwarze Punkte. Ventral (unten) hat es eine gelbweiße Farbgebung. Beim Weibchen befinden sich an diesem Bereich des Opisthosomas anders als bei dem der meisten Wolfspinnen (Lycosidae) keine Setae (chitinisierte Haare) mit apikalen (von der Körpermitte entfernt liegenden) Noppen.', 'Männchen.', 'Das Männchen hat nach Almquist 2,33 bis 2,68 Millimeter Körperlänge und ist 1,78 bis 1,95 Millimeter breit. Die Neigung des Carapax beträgt beim Männchen 5°.', 'Der Carapax des Männchens ist ähnlich wie beim Weibchen gelbbraun, aber nicht aufgehellt. Je zwei dunkelbraune breite Bänder verlaufen lateral auf diesem Körperteil. Submarginal (unterrandig) befinden sich auf dem Carapax des Männchens ebenfalls dunkelbraune Punkte. Die gleiche Farbgebung haben die Ränder des Carapax. Die Cheliceren des Männchens sind gelbbraun und tragen frontal dunkelbraune Bänder. Das Sternum ist gelbbraun, an dessen Rand sind große, dunkle und gerundete Punkte.', 'Die Beine sind wie beim Weibchen gelbbraun, die Femora und die Patellae unterscheiden sich beim Männchen lediglich dadurch, dass diese dunkelbraun gefärbt sind. Die Femora der Pedipalpen tragen beim Männchen dunkelbraunen Ringe, während die Patellae und die Tibien (Schienen) eine braune Färbung haben.', 'Stark herausstechende gelbweiße Punkte befinden sich auf der braunen Dorsalseite des Opisthosomas. Der Lanzettfleck ist anders als beim Weibchen gelbbraun gefärbt. Die Seiten des Opisthosomas tragen beim Männchen gelbweiße Streifen. Die Ventralseite des Opisthosomas ist gelbbraun gefärbt mit kleinen dunkelbraunen Punktierungen. Diese Fläche ist verdickt und hat mehrere spezialisierte Setae. Beide Eigenschaften dienen dem Revierkampf.', 'Genitalmorphologische Merkmale.', 'Ein einzelner Bulbus (männliches Geschlechtsorgan) des Trommelwolfs wird unter anderem durch sein Cymbium (erstes und vorderstes Sklerit bzw. Hartteil des Bulbus) charakterisiert, dessen Spitze mit mehreren Makrosetae (längeren Setae) bedeckt ist. Das Tegulum (zweites und mittleres Sklerit) hat eine spitz zulaufende Apophyse (chitinisierter Fortsatz) und der gekurvte Embolus (drittes und letztes Sklerit) besitzt eine teilweise transparente Lamina (Gewebeschicht) auf seiner konkaven Fläche.', 'Die Platte der Epigyne (weibliches Geschlechtsorgan) ist beim Trommelwolf länger als breit. Teile des weiblichen Geschlechtsapparats der Art sind durch das Integument (äußere Körperhülle) bereits von außen erkennbar. Die Kopulationsöffnungen der Epigyne befinden sich posterior an zwei medianen Rissen. Die Kopulationskanäle sind vergleichsweise kurz. Die Spermatheken (Samentaschen) zeichnen sich mitunter durch ihre lange und teilweise kurvige Gestalt aus. Der breitere Teil der Samentaschen ist zwiebelförmig und mit Knoten ausgestattet.', 'Verwechslung mit dem Gewöhnlichen Stachelbein.', 'Der Trommelwolf ähnelt dem Gewöhnlichen Stachelbein (\\"Zora spinimana\\") aus der Familie der Wanderspinnen (Miturgidae), das eine ähnliche Färbung wie der Trommelwolf hat und ähnliche Habitate bewohnt. Sonst gibt es in Mitteleuropa keine weitere Spinnenart, die dem Trommelwolf ähnelt.', 'Vorkommen.', 'Das Verbreitungsgebiet des Trommelwolfs erstreckt sich von Europa über Russland bis nach Südsibirien. In Europa ist die Art flächendeckend verbreitet und wurde bislang in Kontinentaleuropa lediglich in Portugal, Kroatien, Serbien, Bosnien und Herzegowina, Montenegro, dem Kosovo, Nordmazedonien, Griechenland, Moldau und dem europäischen Teil der Türkei sowie auf den Inselgruppen Franz-Josef-Land und Spitzbergen, der russischen Doppelinsel Nowaja Semlja, Island, der Insel Irland und den Mittelmeerinseln nicht nachgewiesen. In Österreich ist der Trommelwolf in Höhen von bis zu 800 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel anzutreffen.', 'Auf Großbritannien ist die Art überwiegend in den Distrikten West Suffolk, King’s Lynn and West Norfolk, der Grafschaft Suffolk sowie in der Grafschaft Cambridgeshire in England nachgewiesen. Weitere Funde des Trommelwolfs auf der Insel gab es vereinzelt im ebenfalls zu Suffolk zählenden Distrikt East Suffolk, in der Landschaft New Forest und der Grafschaft Hampshire sowie früher im Landschaftspark Sherwood Forest und in den Grafschaften Nottinghamshire und Lincolnshire.', 'Lebensräume.', 'Der Trommelwolf ist eine hygrophile (feuchtigkeitsliebende) Art und bewohnt unter anderem Moore, Sümpfe, Feuchtwiesen oder feuchte Wälder. Außerdem bewohnt er Niedermoore mit Buschwerk. In Großbritannien wurde die Art auch in Bruchwäldern in der Nähe von Fahrwegen nachgewiesen.', 'Häufigkeit und Gefährdung.', 'Die Häufigkeit des Trommelwolfs variiert je nach geographischer Lage. In Mitteleuropa ist die Art weitverbreitet, im Norden deutlich häufiger als im Süden. Die Populationsdichte kann mitunter hoch sein, sodass auf einem Quadratmeter eine zweistellige Individuendichte vorkommen kann. Die Exemplare werden aufgrund der versteckten Lebensweise oftmals übersehen.', 'Die Populationsgefährdung der Spinne wird je nach Land und Region unterschiedlich aufgefasst. In der Roten Liste gefährdeter Tiere, Pflanzen und Pilze Deutschlands bzw. der Roten Liste und Gesamtartenliste der Spinnen Deutschlands (2016) wird der Trommelwolf in der Kategorie 3 (gefährdet) gelistet, da die Art dort als selten gilt. Langfristig sind die Bestände der Art in Deutschland als mäßig zurückgehend zu werten. Für kurzfristige Analysen sind keine ausreichenden Daten vorhanden. Eine Änderung der Bestandswertigkeit der vorherigen Roten Liste (1996), in der der Trommelwolf in gleicher Kategorie gelistet wurde, erfolgte demzufolge nicht. In Österreich gilt die Art als vom Aussterben bedroht.', 'In der Roten Liste Großbritanniens (2017) wird der Trommelwolf ähnlich wie in Deutschland nach IUCN-Maßstab in der Kategorie EN (\\"Endangered\\" bzw. gefährdet) aufgeführt. In der Roten Liste der Spinnentiere (Arachnida) Norwegens (2015) sind die Bestände der Art in der Kategorie NT (\\"Near Threatened\\" bzw. potenziell gefährdet) und in der Roten Liste der Spinnen Tschechiens (2015) in der Kategorie VU (\\"Vulnerable\\" bzw. verletzlich) erfasst.', 'Lebensweise.', 'Der Trommelwolf zählt zu den tagaktiven Vertretern der Wolfspinnen (Lycosidae).

Zu seinem Auftreten gehörte, dass er auch im Rennwagen stets Fliege oder Krawatte und ein weißes Hemd trug.', 'Biografie.', 'Jugend.', 'Mike Hawthorn wurde in Mexborough, einer kleinen Industriestadt in der Nähe von Doncaster in Yorkshire, geboren.', '1931 zog die Familie in den Süden Englands nach Farnham. Dort eröffnete Hawthorns Vater, Leslie Hawthorn, eine Kraftfahrzeug-Reparatur- und Verkaufswerkstatt, die als \\"„The Tourist Trophy Garage“\\" firmierte. Eine saubere Begriffstrennung gab es zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht, da Werksverträge mit Motorrad- oder Automobilfirmen nur vereinzelt gegeben waren. Auf die üblichen Reparaturarbeiten aller Fabrikate konnte man angesichts der damaligen Typenvielfalt nicht verzichten. Besitzer von JAP-Motoren und Riley-Sportwagen waren somit ein angestrebter Kundenkreis des Vaters, der sein Geschäft daher nach dem renommierten „Tourist Trophy“-Rennen auf der Isle of Man benannt hatte.', 'Zu diesem Zeitpunkt kränkelte Mike Hawthorn häufig. Es stellte sich heraus, dass er an einer Nierenkrankheit litt, was ihn wohl ständig behindern würde. An eine Mechanikerausbildung im Betrieb des Vaters nach Abschluss der Volksschule war daher nicht zu denken. Rheuma und Arthrose galten bereits damals als die typischen Berufskrankheiten infolge zugiger Werkstatthallen. Die besorgten Eltern dachten daher wahrscheinlich oft an die Zukunft ihres einzigen Sohnes, der rasch von der allgemeinen Motorsportbegeisterung jener Ära „angesteckt“ wurde. So beeilten sich Winnifred und Leslie Hawthorn, ihn nach Möglichkeit zu unterstützen. Denn in seiner Tuningwerkstatt südwestlich von London präparierte der Vater Sportwagen für Renneinsätze oder verkaufte sie an Privatiers. Außerdem versuchte sich Leslie bei Motorradrennen auf dem nahen Brooklands-Kurs. Die Vorbedingungen für eine erfolgversprechende Rennsportkarriere waren vor diesem Hintergrund gelegt. Ein 2009 herausgegebenes Buch, \\"Tales from the Toolbox: A Collection of Behind the Scenes Tales from Grand Prix Mechanics\\", betonte den wichtigen Aspekt des Einflusses des Umfeldes von Kfz-Werkstätten auf eine ganze Generation von Rennfahrern.', 'Der Einstieg in den Rennsport.', 'Als Mike Hawthorn 21 Jahre alt war, stellte der Vater ihm einen Riley-Sportwagen zur Verfügung. Außerdem ließ er es sich nicht nehmen, selbst als Teammanager seines Sohnes zu arbeiten. Sein eigentliches Renndebüt feierte Hawthorn am 2. September 1950, als er mit einem 1934er Riley Ulster Imp, KV 9475, in der 1100-cm³-Klasse bei den Brighton Speed Trials gewinnen konnte. Bereits 1951 trug der jüngere Hawthorn Rennduelle mit den anderen aufstrebenden Talenten des Vereinigten Königreichs aus: Peter Collins und Stirling Moss. So vermochte er in diesem Jahr mit seinem Wagen auf dem Goodwood Circuit die \\"Motor Sport Brooklands Memorial Trophy\\" gewinnen, die sich über das gesamte Jahr erstreckte. Darüber hinaus entschied er 1951 das \\"Ulster Trophy Handicap\\" auf dem Dundrod Circuit und die \\"Leinster Trophy\\" in Wicklow siegreich für sich.', 'Dadurch ermutigt entschloss sich Bob Chase, ein väterlicher und vermögender Freund der Familie, den fortan \\"„Farnham-Flyer“\\" genannten Mike Hawthorn mit einem Cooper-Bristol für Formel-2-Rennen zu melden.', 'Ohne Umwege in die Formel 1.', 'Da durch den Rückzug Alfa Romeos ein zu kleines Fahrerfeld befürchtet wurde, hatten die Verantwortlichen in jenem Jahr das Formel-1-Reglement bis zum Ende der Formel-1-Saison 1953 nach demjenigen der Formel 2 ausgeschrieben. Dies sollte möglichst viele Teams ermutigen, in die Weltmeisterschaftskonkurrenz einzutreten.', 'Gegen den Ferrari 500, der zu den handlichsten Rennwagen aller Zeiten gezählt wird, kämpften alle anderen Teams mit unterlegenem Material, da ihnen in der Regel 30 PS auf die Konkurrenz aus Maranello fehlten. Achtungserfolge konnten nur bei schwierigen Wetterbedingungen von Fahrern erzielt werden, die ein robustes und gut zu beherrschendes Fahrzeug zur Verfügung hatten. Schließlich gewann der Ferrari 500 vierzehn von 15 möglichen Rennen und benötigte keine besonderen Verbesserungen in den zwei Weltmeisterschaftsjahren, in denen er eingesetzt wurde. Lediglich eine leicht verlängerte Version mit veränderter Fahrzeugnase wurde für Hochgeschwindigkeitskurse vorgestellt.', 'So war Mike Hawthorn mit seinem Cooper T20 dann auch der aufstrebende Fahrer der Saison 1952: Er erkämpfte sich einen vierten Rang beim Grand Prix in Spa-Francorchamps und einen dritten Platz beim Grand Prix von Großbritannien in Silverstone sowie einen weiteren vierten Rang beim GP der Niederlande in Zandvoort. Damit rangierte er im Endklassement als bester Pilot, der keinen Ferrari steuerte, auf dem vierten Platz. Dies verschaffte ihm schon während der Saison den Respekt Enzo Ferraris.', 'Der Wechsel zu Ferrari.', 'Auf Empfehlung des motorsportbegeisterten Industriellen und späteren Teamchefs Tony Vandervell lud Enzo Ferrari den jungen Briten nach Modena ein. Dieser erschien mitsamt seinem Vater und einem Cooper-Bristol in Italien, um beide Modelle miteinander vergleichen zu können.', 'Aus dem Verständnis des \\"„Commendatore“\\" heraus ging es jedoch nicht um einen Test des Ferraris, sondern den des \\"Piloten\\". Daher verwies er ihn sichtlich verstimmt darauf, dass er den Cooper gerne weiterhin fahren könne, wenn es seinem Glauben nach das bessere Auto sei. Doch angesichts der guten Fahrleistungen Hawthorns konnte Enzo Ferrari seinen Ärger schnell vergessen. Hawthorn seinerseits war begeistert von dem Tipo 500 und beteuerte, dass er diesen Ferrari unbedingt fahren möchte.', 'Am nächsten Tag sollte in Modena ein außerhalb der Weltmeisterschaft stattfindender Grand Prix abgehalten werden. Daher plante man den Start Hawthorns mit einem untypischerweise in „British Racing Green“ lackierten Ferrari beim dortigen Training. Aus welchen Gründen auch immer – der grüne Ferrari wurde nicht fertig, sodass Hawthorn mit seinem Cooper am Rennen teilnahm. Dabei beging er allerdings den Fehler, unbedingt an die Rundenzeiten der Ferraris anknüpfen zu wollen. Mike Hawthorn wählte nach einer langen Geraden allzu optimistisch den Bremspunkt nach dem Tipo-500-Maßstab, sodass er mit 130 km/h in die Strohballen prallte und aus dem Monoposto geschleudert wurde. Mit schweren Rückenprellungen lieferte man ihn ins nächste Hospital ein. Dort verkündete ihm der Teammanager Ferraris, dass sich der „Chef“ freuen würde, wenn er für sie fahren könne.', 'Hawthorn, der lieber einen englischen Wagen pilotieren wollte (laut eigenem Bekunden in seiner Autobiografie), erbat sich zunächst Bedenkzeit. Da es keine bessere Alternative gab, unterzeichnete er jedoch.', 'Anstatt sich über diesen Aufstieg in das schon damals beste Team zu freuen, startete die britische Boulevard-Presse eine fast beispiellose Hetzkampagne. Man prangerte Hawthorn geradezu als Vaterlandsverräter an, der mit seinem Wechsel nach Italien seinem Militärdienst entgehen wolle. Selbst dem englischen Unterhaus war Hawthorns Weg nach Italien eine kurze Debatte wert. Dabei wurde außer Acht gelassen, dass er wegen seines chronischen Nierenleidens ohnehin vom Dienst an der Waffe freigestellt war. Doch der Anblick eines nach heutigen Begriffen zum Leistungssport fähigen, großgewachsenen Mannes, der vor Selbstbewusstsein nur so strotzte und keine äußeren Kennzeichen seines Leidens zeigte, war insbesondere für die rechte Presse Provokation genug. Lediglich ein Vorzeigen seiner medizinischen Atteste, die seine häufigen Nierenentzündungen belegten, brachte diese Kampagne zum Erliegen.', 'Mike Hawthorn, den daraufhin eine ihn selbst schützende Arroganz charakterisierte, beeilte sich, diese Irritationen vergessen zu machen. Schon bei seinem insgesamt neunten Formel-1-Grand-Prix schlug er beim GP von Frankreich 1953 in Reims nach einem erbitterten Windschatten-Duell über fast das ganze Rennen hinweg den großen Juan Manuel Fangio (Maserati). Erst in der letzten Kurve gelang Hawthorn das Überholmanöver, er bedankte sich damit bei seinem vierten Einsatz für das Vertrauen des \\"Commendatore\\". Zwei dritte Plätze bei den Großen Preisen von Deutschland und der Schweiz, zwei vierte Ränge in Argentinien und den Niederlanden, sowie ein fünfter Platz in Silverstone ließen ihn erneut auf dem vierten Rang der Weltmeisterschaft landen.', 'Abgerundet wurde dieses Jahr durch den Gewinn der 1953 erstmals ausgetragenen Sportwagen-Weltmeisterschaft, bei der er mit soliden Rennergebnissen an der Seite Alberto Ascaris und Giuseppe Farinas einen der Grundsteine für den Erfolg gelegt hatte. Er siegte als Partner von Farina beim 24-Stunden-Rennen von Spa-Francorchamps.', 'Die Formel-1-Saison 1954 schien einen Erfolg versprechenden Weg zu nehmen, als er im März des Jahres beim Grand Prix von Syrakus auf Sizilien einen folgenschweren Unfall hatte: Als vor ihm Onofre Marimón mit seinem Maserati verunglückte und über die Piste kreiselte, entzündeten sich die damals als Streckenbegrenzung aufgestellten Heuballen durch den brennenden Treibstoff. Hawthorn raste unweigerlich in dieses Flammeninferno und wurde nur mit Mühe von seinem Teamkollegen José Froilán González, der ebenfalls Verbrennungen erlitt und mit dem havarierten Wagen kollidiert war, aus dem Monoposto gezogen.', 'Hawthorn lag nach dem Unfall mit Verbrennungen zweiten und dritten Grades im Gesicht, an Armen und Oberschenkel zwei Monate lang in Rom und Mailand im Krankenhaus. Dem Veranstalter von Syrakus war dieser Vorfall offensichtlich so peinlich, dass er Hawthorn später eine 18-karätige Goldmedaille verlieh – in der heutigen Zeit ein undenkbares Eingeständnis der Sicherheitsmängel. Strohballen blieben bis in die 1960er-Jahre hinein bei vielen Autorennen und bis weit in die 1980er Jahre hinein auch bei Motorradrennen der Standard bei den Streckenbegrenzungen.', 'Gerade nach Farnham zurückgekehrt, verunglückte sein Vater Leslie Hawthorn tödlich auf der Rückfahrt von einem Rennen in Goodwood. Den Rest der Saison spulte der sichtlich betroffene Mike Hawthorn mehr als Pflichtprogramm ab, obwohl er beim letzten WM-Lauf in Spanien seinen zweiten Grand-Prix-Sieg erzielte.

Jahrhundert', 'Gestorben im 6. Jahrhundert', 'Grieche (Antike)', 'Mann', 'Neuplatoniker', 'Philosoph (6. Jahrhundert)', 'Philosoph (Antike)'], 'Simplikios von Kilikien (, ; * um 480; † um 560) war ein spätantiker griechischer Philosoph der neuplatonischen Richtung. Er lebte im Oströmischen Reich und trat vor allem als Kommentator von Schriften des Aristoteles hervor, die er neuplatonisch deutete. Gemäß der im spätantiken Neuplatonismus vorherrschenden Sichtweise hielt er Aristoteles für einen Platoniker und bemühte sich, platonische und aristotelische Lehren zu harmonisieren. Dabei ging es ihm auch um die Verteidigung der klassischen philosophischen Tradition und des religiösen Weltbilds der Neuplatoniker gegen christliche Kritik. Er erörterte die Beschaffenheit des Weltalls, bemühte sich um die Definition des Begriffs Materie, untersuchte das Phänomen Zeit und setzte sich mit dem Problem des Ursprungs der Übel auseinander. In seinem Kommentar zum \\"Handbüchlein\\" des Stoikers Epiktet, einer Einführung in die Ethik, stellte er die begründenden Prinzipien des aus seiner Sicht richtigen Handelns dar. Dabei legte er großes Gewicht auf die menschliche Fähigkeit zu einer selbstbestimmten Lebensführung und verteidigte die Willensfreiheit.', 'Im Spätmittelalter erzielte die Aristoteles-Kommentierung des Simplikios eine beträchtliche Nachwirkung. Moderne Altertumswissenschaftler schätzen seine Schriften als wertvolle Quellen für frühere Epochen der griechischen Philosophiegeschichte, insbesondere für die Zeit der Vorsokratiker, denn er hatte Zugang zu einer Fülle von heute verlorenem Material. Wegen seiner Gewissenhaftigkeit und Gründlichkeit in der Auseinandersetzung mit älteren Lehrmeinungen sowie seinen durchdachten Analysen und umsichtigen Stellungnahmen gilt er als einer der bedeutendsten Gelehrten seiner Zeit.', 'Leben.', 'Simplikios stammte aus Kilikien, einer Region an der Südküste Kleinasiens; ansonsten ist über seine Herkunft nichts bekannt. Seine philosophische Ausbildung erhielt er zunächst in Alexandria, wo der einflussreiche Neuplatoniker Ammonios Hermeiou sein Lehrer war. Wie Ammonios lebte Simplikios in der Tradition der alten griechischen Religion. Er gehörte also zu einer schrumpfenden Minderheit; im Oströmischen Reich herrschte schon seit langem die christliche Staatsreligion. Unter den Schülern des Ammonios waren eifrige Vertreter des paganen („heidnischen“) Glaubens, aber auch Christen. Ammonios ging religiösen Auseinandersetzungen aus dem Weg und bemühte sich in seiner Schule um ein relativ entspanntes Verhältnis zwischen den Religionen.', 'Später begab sich Simplikios nach Athen, wo sich die paganen Neuplatoniker traditionell schärfer von ihrer christlichen Umgebung abgrenzten als in Alexandria. Sein dortiger Lehrer war Damaskios, ein entschiedener Gegner des Christentums, der ebenfalls in Alexandria bei Ammonios studiert hatte und spätestens 515 der letzte Leiter (Scholarch) der neuplatonischen Philosophenschule in Athen wurde. Diese Schule, die Plutarch von Athen gegründet hatte, nahm für sich in Anspruch, die Tradition der Platonischen Akademie fortzusetzen. Sie blieb bis zuletzt ein Hort der paganen Religion, die für die dortigen Philosophen untrennbar mit dem Platonismus verbunden war. Nachdem die Aktivitäten der Neuplatoniker in Athen lange von den christlichen Kaisern geduldet worden waren, spitzte sich unter Kaiser Justinian der religiöse Gegensatz zu. Im Jahr 529 untersagte der Kaiser den paganen Lehrbetrieb, etwas später wiederholte und verschärfte er das Verbot. Die staatlichen Maßnahmen führten zur Schließung der Schule. Simplikios, Damaskios und fünf weitere Philosophen entschlossen sich zur Emigration. Vielleicht schon 531, spätestens 532 wanderten sie in das persische Sasanidenreich aus. Dort bot ihnen der seit September 531 regierende Großkönig Chosrau I. Zuflucht an seinem Hof in Ktesiphon, wo sie mit Toleranz rechnen konnten.', 'Chosrau nahm gegenüber den Neuplatonikern und der alten griechischen Religion eine wohlwollende Haltung ein; er förderte alle Bestrebungen, die der religiösen Einheit des Oströmischen Reichs entgegenwirkten und dieses damit schwächten. Dennoch waren die Philosophen bald von den Verhältnissen am persischen Hof enttäuscht. Als im Herbst 532 die Oströmer mit den Persern einen „Ewigen Frieden“ schlossen, bestand der Großkönig in einer der Klauseln des Friedensvertrags darauf, dass die Philosophen unbehelligt ins Oströmische Reich zurückkehren und dort an ihren religiösen Überzeugungen festhalten durften. Noch im selben Jahr verließen die Neuplatoniker das Perserreich.', 'Vielleicht ließ sich Simplikios nun in Carrhae nieder, einer im Grenzgebiet zum Perserreich gelegenen Stadt, und gründete dort eine neue platonische Schule. Diese erstmals 1984 von dem Gnosisforscher Michel Tardieu auf einem Kongress vorgetragene Hypothese hat seither beträchtlichen Anklang gefunden, ist aber auch auf Widerspruch gestoßen. Sie stützt sich auf Indizien wie den Umstand, dass Carrhae ein günstiges Umfeld bot, weil in der Bevölkerung der Stadt pagane Traditionen noch stark verwurzelt waren. Zugunsten der Hypothese wird vor allem geltend gemacht, dass dort noch im Jahr 943 eine griechische Philosophenschule bestand, wie einem Bericht des zeitgenössischen Gelehrten Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusain al-Masʿūdī zu entnehmen ist. Daneben existieren in der Forschung noch weitere Vermutungen, denen zufolge Simplikios nach Athen zurückkehrte, wieder nach Alexandria zog, sich mit seinem Lehrer Damaskios in Syrien niederließ oder fortan in seiner Heimatlandschaft Kilikien lebte.', 'Den Großteil seiner erhaltenen Werke – vielleicht sogar alle – verfasste Simplikios erst nach der Rückkehr aus dem Perserreich; offenbar stand ihm weiterhin eine reichhaltige Bibliothek zur Verfügung. Bei der Aristoteles-Kommentierung polemisierte er heftig gegen den christlichen Philosophen Johannes Philoponos, dem er Ruhmsucht und unberechtigte Kritik an der Kosmologie des Aristoteles vorwarf. Der Angegriffene hatte wie Simplikios bei Ammonios Hermeiou studiert. Daher legte Simplikios Wert auf die Feststellung, er kritisiere Philoponos zwar hart, hege aber keinen persönlichen Groll aus der Vergangenheit gegen ihn, denn er könne sich nicht erinnern, ihm jemals begegnet zu sein.', 'Wann Simplikios starb, ist unbekannt; gewöhnlich wird angenommen, dass er um die Mitte des 6. Jahrhunderts noch lebte. Sicher ist, dass er seinen Lehrer Damaskios, der im Jahr 538 noch am Leben war, überlebt hat. Häufig wird ohne weitere Begründung ein Todesjahr um 560 angegeben.', 'Werke.', 'Das umfangreiche, ausschließlich aus Kommentaren bestehende Œuvre des Simplikios ist nur teilweise erhalten geblieben. Zum erhaltenen Teil zählen die Kommentare zu drei Schriften des Aristoteles: den \\"Kategorien,\\" der \\"Physik\\" und der Abhandlung \\"Über den Himmel\\". Sie sind erst nach der Rückkehr aus dem Perserreich entstanden und zeugen von der Belesenheit und Sachkenntnis des Verfassers. Der \\"Physik\\"-Kommentar enthält zwei Exkurse, die in der modernen Forschung als \\"Corollarium de tempore\\" („Exkurs über die Zeit“) und \\"Corollarium de loco\\" („Exkurs über den Ort“) bezeichnet werden. Ferner kommentierte Simplikios die als \\"Encheiridion\\" \\"(Handbüchlein)\\" verbreitete Fassung der \\"Lehrgespräche\\" des Stoikers Epiktet. Das \\"Encheiridion\\" behandelt Grundsätze der Ethik, die im neuplatonischen Unterricht zur Propädeutik gehörten. Die dort beschriebenen Tugenden galten den Neuplatonikern als Voraussetzung für ein philosophisches Leben.', 'Diese Kommentare zählen zu den wertvollsten Quellen für die antike Philosophiegeschichte. Im Unterschied zu vielen anderen neuplatonischen Kommentarwerken handelt es sich nicht um Schülermitschriften aus Lehrveranstaltungen, sondern um Texte, die der Autor selbst schriftlich formuliert hat. Sie enthalten eine Fülle von Zitaten aus heute verlorenem Schrifttum und Darstellungen von Lehrmeinungen anderer Denker, über die anderweitig wenig oder nichts überliefert ist. Insbesondere ist Simplikios ein erheblicher Teil der Fragmente der Vorsokratiker zu verdanken, darunter die wichtigsten wörtlich überlieferten Stellen aus den Lehrgedichten des Parmenides (rund zwei Drittel der erhaltenen Verse) und des Empedokles. Groß ist auch seine Bedeutung als Vermittler von Gedankengut stoischer und peripatetischer Philosophen. Über die Auffassungen von Angehörigen der Platonischen Akademie sowie von Mittel- und Neuplatonikern und Pythagoreern liefert Simplikios ebenfalls zahlreiche wichtige Informationen. Manche seiner Berichte ermöglichen eine Rekonstruktion der Lehren, die in den verlorenen Schriften dieser Autoren dargelegt waren. Die Ausführlichkeit und Detailfülle seiner Werke ist vor dem Hintergrund der damaligen Verhältnisse zu sehen: Angesichts der Gefährdung der paganen Bildungsgüter durch militante christliche Kreise, die sich in der zwangsweisen Schließung der Athener Philosophenschule zeigte, versuchte er den Ertrag der jahrhundertelangen Bemühungen der Philosophen durch eine gründliche Darstellung für die Zukunft zu retten.', 'Die Aristoteles-Auslegung lässt erkennen, dass Simplikios im Umgang mit den Texten, mit denen er sich befasste, sehr umsichtig und gewissenhaft verfuhr. Er berücksichtigte auch philologische Aspekte, indem er Handschriften verglich und textkritische Bemühungen unternahm, um den authentischen Wortlaut zu ermitteln. Seine Sorgfalt bei der Auswertung seiner Quellen war für einen antiken Philosophen außergewöhnlich. Als Merkmale eines guten Kommentators nannte er Unvoreingenommenheit und Vertrautheit nicht nur mit der einzelnen interpretierten Schrift, sondern mit dem Gesamtwerk und der Ausdrucksweise des Aristoteles. Ausdrücklich missbilligte er Autoritätshörigkeit. Er stellte fest, ein guter Kommentator versuche nicht, alle Thesen des Aristoteles als richtig zu erweisen, als ob dieser unfehlbar wäre. Zwar schätzte er Aristoteles und betrachtete ihn als Platoniker, doch wahrte er Distanz, prüfte die aristotelischen Argumente und nahm teils zustimmend, teils ablehnend Stellung. Dabei setzte er sich auch mit den Ansichten früherer Kommentatoren wie Alexander von Aphrodisias und Iamblichos von Chalkis auseinander. Er berichtete über die Positionen seiner Vorgänger, deren Werke heute zum Teil verloren sind, und untersuchte sie auf ihre Plausibilität. Kritik an Thesen anerkannter Autoritäten übte er, wo es ihm nötig schien. Als besten Aristoteles-Kommentator bezeichnete er den Peripatetiker Eudemos von Rhodos, aus dessen heute verlorener \\"Physik\\" er viel Material durch seine Zitate für die Nachwelt gerettet hat.

Although many people might not think much about it, this little creature has a significant impact on my life. Firstly, swimming in freshwater lakes is one of my favourite summer activities. Unfortunately, this means that I often come into contact with various types of freshwater worms, including the Mesostoma Ehrenbergii. While some people might find these creatures repulsive, I am fascinated by their unique appearance and behaviour. These worms are incredibly small, often only a few millimetres in length, and they can be found swimming near the bottom of the lake. Observing these worms swim is always an interesting experience, and it's exciting to learn about their biology and ecology. Aside from my personal interest in the species, the Mesostoma Ehrenbergii has significant ecological importance. These worms are a vital part of the aquatic food chain, providing a food source for many other freshwater animals such as fish, insects, and birds. Without the Mesostoma Ehrenbergii, the ecological balance of freshwater ecosystems would be seriously disrupted, leading to potentially disastrous consequences. As someone interested in science and dedicated to environmentalism, I can appreciate the importance of every species, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. In conclusion, the Mesostoma Ehrenbergii has a more significant impact on my life than I initially realised. As someone who loves swimming and learning about science, encountering this freshwater worm has given me deeper insights into the importance of every species and their role in the greater ecosystem. With this new understanding, I can better appreciate and contribute to environmental conservation efforts, which is essential in today's world."},{"instruction":"На станции техобслуживания аккумулятор заряжают током силой 6,5 А в течении 5 ч.

Im Gelände werden mehrere Kontrollpunkte festgelegt, die mit Hilfe von Landkarte und Kompass gefunden werden müssen. Dabei wählt der Läufer die für ihn optimale Route selbst. OL erfordert dadurch neben körperlicher Fitness auch ein hohes Maß an geistiger Leistung. Der Orientierungslauf entwickelte sich zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts in Skandinavien, wo er inzwischen Volkssport ist. Orientierungslauf wird heute weltweit betrieben.', 'Der internationale Orientierungslaufsport ist in der International Orienteering Federation (IOF) mit zurzeit 76 Mitgliedsländern (Stand: März 2020) organisiert. Der Orientierungslauf zählt zu den vom Internationalen Olympischen Komitee (IOC) anerkannten Sportarten, wurde bislang jedoch noch nicht bei Olympischen Spielen ausgetragen. Neben dem klassischen Orientierungslauf gibt es zahlreiche Varianten des Sports, so etwa das Mountainbike-Orienteering (in der Schweiz Bike-OL) und den Ski-Orientierungslauf. Da die meisten Spielarten des Orientierungslaufs in naturnahen Gebieten stattfinden, werden die ökologischen Auswirkungen von Wettkämpfen auch kontrovers diskutiert.', 'Grundlagen.', 'Das grundsätzliche Ziel des Orientierungslaufs ist das schnellstmögliche Ablaufen von Kontrollpunkten im Gelände in einer festgelegten Reihenfolge. Die Wahl der Laufroute zwischen den einzelnen Kontrollpunkten, die Posten genannt werden, ist dem Läufer dabei im Allgemeinen völlig freigestellt. Als Hilfsmittel zum Finden der bestmöglichen Laufstrecke stehen jedem Sportler ausschließlich Karte und Kompass zur Verfügung, andere technische Hilfsmittel sind untersagt. Orientierungsläufe werden meist in naturnahem Gelände ausgetragen, vor allem im Wald, jedoch eignen sich auch verhältnismäßig gut erschlossene Gebiete wie Parks für den Sport. Da zu großen Teilen auch abseits von Wegen gelaufen wird, ist der Orientierungslauf als Zuschauersport meist nur wenig attraktiv.', 'Praktische Durchführung.', 'Vor dem Start stehen dem Orientierungsläufer neben der allgemeinen Geländebeschaffenheit meist nur wenige Informationen zur Verfügung, insbesondere die Streckenlänge (gemessen in Luftlinie) und die zu absolvierenden Höhenmeter (Mindeststeigung auf einer angenommenen Optimalroute). Darüber hinaus sind ihm Anzahl und Beschreibung der Kontrollposten sowie eventuell zu absolvierende Pflichtstrecken bekannt. Die Karte wird dem Sportler üblicherweise erst unmittelbar vor dem Start ausgehändigt. Darauf aufgedruckt finden sich die anzulaufenden Posten in der vorgegebenen Reihenfolge, die sogenannte \\"Bahn\\". Das Absolvieren der Posten in der vorgeschriebenen Reihenfolge wird durch mitgeführte Postenkontrollsysteme, heute meist elektronische Geräte, überprüft.', 'Ein grundsätzliches Problem beim Orientierungslauf ist, so weit wie möglich gleiche Voraussetzungen für alle Teilnehmer zu gewährleisten. Insbesondere gilt es, ein einfaches Nachlaufen zu verhindern und so dafür zu sorgen, dass alle Läufer sich selbständig orientieren. Aus diesem Grund gibt es beim OL zumeist keinen Massenstart. Vielmehr starten die Konkurrenten einzeln in Abständen von zwei bis fünf Minuten, sodass jeder Läufer möglichst auf sich allein gestellt ist. Darüber hinaus werden bei OL-Veranstaltungen eine große Anzahl verschiedener Bahnen für einzelne \\"Kategorien\\" (Geschlechts-, Alters- und Leistungsklassen) angeboten. Dadurch ist die Teilnehmerzahl pro Kategorie nicht zu hoch, die Teilnehmer werden im Gelände stärker verteilt und der Nutzen eines Hinterherlaufens wird weiter verringert. An großen Orientierungslauf-Veranstaltungen können so mehrere Tausend Sportler in unterschiedlichen Alters- und Leistungsklassen mit adäquaten Streckenlängen teilnehmen.', 'Um gleiche Voraussetzungen für alle Teilnehmer zu schaffen, werden für Wettkämpfe nur lange Zeit nicht mehr belaufene Gebiete und neue Karten verwendet. Das Betreten des Laufgebietes vor dem Wettkampf ist untersagt.', 'Die Länge der zu absolvierenden Bahnen kann je nach Wettkampf sehr unterschiedlich sein. Bei offiziellen Weltcuprennen und Titelkämpfen nach der Norm der International Orienteering Federation (IOF) werden die Bahnlängen beispielsweise so gewählt, dass die Siegerzeiten zwischen 12 und 15 Minuten im \\"Sprint\\" und bis zu 100 Minuten in der Disziplin \\"Langdistanz\\" liegen; es gibt aber auch wesentlich längere Orientierungsläufe. Die konkreten, in einer bestimmten Zeit zurückgelegten Strecken und Steigungen können dabei je nach Geländebeschaffenheit und Schwierigkeit der Orientierungsaufgaben stark variieren. Beispielsweise liegt die Streckenlänge (Luftlinie) in der Langdistanz bei den Herren üblicherweise bei etwa 10 bis 15 Kilometern.', 'Ausrüstung.', 'Orientierungslaufkarte.', 'Die Karte ist das wichtigste Hilfsmittel für den Orientierungslauf. Heute werden zumeist speziell angefertigte OL-Karten verwendet, die sich von herkömmlichen topografischen Karten durch ihre höhere Detailgenauigkeit unterscheiden. Sie stellen daher das Gelände in besonders großem Maßstab dar, gemäß IOF-Reglement 1:10.000 oder 1:15.000, bei Sprints auch bis zu 1:4.000. Die Äquidistanz, also der vertikale Abstand zwischen zwei Höhenlinien, beträgt meist fünf Meter, in besonders flachem Terrain auch zweieinhalb. OL-Karten sind besonders genau, so werden auch sehr kleine Objekte dargestellt, beispielsweise Felsen in der Größe von einem Meter. Neben Genauigkeit und Lesbarkeit ist die Darstellung der Belaufbarkeit des Geländes besonders wichtig. Die von der IOF vorgegebenen Signaturen unterscheiden sich daher teilweise stark von handelsüblichen topografischen Karten. So wird etwa Wald durch weiße Farbe dargestellt, Grüntöne bezeichnen hingegen unterschiedlich schwer durchdringliches Dickicht.', 'Auf der Karte rot aufgedruckt finden sich die zurückzulegende Bahn (Start, Posten und Ziel, in zu laufender Reihenfolge durch Luftlinie verbunden) und zusätzliche wettbewerbsbezogene Informationen wie Verpflegungs- und Sanitätsposten und etwaige Sperrgebiete oder Pflichtstrecken.', 'Kompass.', 'Nach der Karte ist der Kompass die wichtigste Orientierungshilfe. Üblicherweise werden für den Orientierungslauf spezielle OL-Kompasse verwendet, die sich durch einfache und schnelle Handhabung auszeichnen. Der Kompass dient einerseits zum Einnorden, also zum richtigen Ausrichten der Karte, und andererseits zum Anpeilen des gesuchten Punktes. Diese Technik wird besonders dann angewandt, wenn das Gelände sehr wenig strukturiert ist und wenige auf der Karte erkennbare Anhaltspunkte bietet. Allerdings kann auch extrem stark strukturiertes und detailreiches Gelände mit einer unüberschaubaren Menge an Information ein Grund für verstärkten Einsatz des Kompasses sein. Am häufigsten ist eine Kombination von Karten- und Kompassorientierung. Mit der zunehmenden Genauigkeit des Kartenmaterials seit den Anfängen des Orientierungslaufs hat der Kompass gegenüber der Karte tendenziell an Bedeutung verloren.', 'Postenbeschreibung.', 'Die meist bereits vor dem Start ausgegebene Postenbeschreibung ist ein kleines Stück Papier, das in Form normierter Symbole zusätzliche Informationen zu den angelaufenen Posten enthält. Die Postenbeschreibung soll die eindeutige Identifikation des Postens ermöglichen und beinhaltet daher neben einer Kontrollnummer auch eine Beschreibung des genauen Standorts des Postens im Postenraum sowie etwaige Zusatzinformationen (z. B. Verpflegungsposten). Darüber hinaus sind auch allgemeine Informationen wie Bahnlänge, zu absolvierende Höhenmeter oder Länge von Pflichtstrecken angegeben.', 'Postenkontrollsystem.', 'Postenkontrollsysteme müssen mitgeführt werden, um das Absolvieren der Kontrollposten nachzuweisen. Während lange Zeit \\"Kontrollkarten\\" verwendet wurden, die mittels am Posten angebrachter Lochzangen mit individuellen Mustern markiert werden mussten, überwiegen heute elektronische Systeme (\\"SportIdent\\", \\"EMIT\\"). Dabei wird ein vom Läufer getragener Chip am Postenstandort elektronisch markiert.', 'Kleidung und Schuhwerk.', 'Viele Läufer laufen mit speziell für den Orientierungslauf gefertigten OL-Schuhen. Hierbei handelt es sich um leichte und feste Schuhe mit harten Sohlen, häufig mit kurzen Stahlspikes („Dobb-Spikes“), um die Rutschfestigkeit zu erhöhen. Es gibt niedrige Modelle und solche, die bis über den Knöchel reichen. Zusätzlich zu den Schuhen werden häufig Gamaschen oder verstärkte Strümpfe verwendet, die die Schienbeine vor Verletzungen durch Bodenvegetation schützen sollen.', 'Die Bekleidung ist relativ nebensächlich, soll jedoch reißfest und wasserdurchlässig sein. Spezielle OL-Anzüge sind meist aus Polyamid oder ähnlichen Materialien gefertigt, die gut vor Verletzungen durch Brennnesseln, Dornen oder Ästen schützen.', 'Wettkampfformen, Varianten und verwandte Sportarten.', 'Vom Einzelwettkampf abgesehen sind im Orientierungslauf hauptsächlich der Staffelorientierungslauf und der Mannschaftsorientierungslauf von Bedeutung. Beim Staffellauf bewältigt eine Staffel, die meist aus drei bis fünf, aber auch mehr Läufern besteht, verschiedene Strecken nacheinander. Im Gegensatz zum Einzellauf werden solche Wettkämpfe meist mit Massenstart ausgetragen, da das Problem des Nachlaufens hier durch unterschiedliche Reihung der von den einzelnen Läufern zurückzulegenden Teilstrecken umgangen werden kann.', 'Beim Mannschaftslauf besteht eine Mannschaft meist aus drei bis vier Läufern. Diese starten gemeinsam, teilen sich dann jedoch auf, um die erforderlichen Posten ohne festgelegte Reihenfolge abzulaufen. Hierbei kann es von allen Teammitgliedern anzulaufende Pflichtposten geben, aber auch solche, die nur von einem Teilnehmer erreicht werden müssen.

Sie ist Teil des Amtes Beetzsee im Landkreis Potsdam-Mittelmark und entstand 2002 durch den freiwilligen Zusammenschluss der Stadt Pritzerbe und der Gemeinden Fohrde, Briest und Hohenferchesar im Vorfeld der geplanten brandenburgischen Gemeindegebietsreform 2003. 2008 kam als fünfter Ortsteil das Dorf Marzahne hinzu. Namensgeber Havelsees sind die Havel und der Pritzerber See, die das Bild der Stadt weitgehend dominieren.', 'Geographie.', 'Geographische Lage.', 'Die Stadt Havelsee hat eine Fläche von 81 Quadratkilometern. Sie erscheint dabei annähernd in Form eines Dreiecks, dessen Ecken nach Süden, Nordwesten und Osten zeigen. Der weitaus überwiegende Teil der Stadt liegt östlich der Havel, die sie aus Süden kommend in Richtung Nordwesten durchfließt. Nahezu zentral liegt der Pritzerber See. Direkte Nachbarstädte sind die Mittelstadt Brandenburg an der Havel im Süden als das Oberzentrum der Region und die Kleinstadt Premnitz im Nordwesten. Havelsee befindet sich etwa 45 Kilometer westlich der Bundeshauptstadt Berlin und fast am äußeren Rand der Metropolregion Berlin/Brandenburg. Das Havelufer nördlich des Ortsteils Pritzerbe hat eine Höhe von 28 Metern über Normalnull und ist die niedrigste Stelle des Kreises Potsdam-Mittelmark. Der höchstgelegene Punkt Havelsees befindet sich auf der Grenze zur Gemeinde Beetzsee. Diese führt über den Nordwesthang des insgesamt 89,3 Meter hohen Schwarzen Bergs auf einer Höhe von 83,9 Metern. Die Erhebung ist Teil einer Hügelkette im Osten der Stadt, die durch den Fohrder Berg (67,6 Meter), den Gallberg (68,2 Meter), den Schwarzen Berg, den Eichberg (74,7 Meter), den Mühlenberg (70,8 Meter), den Rabenberg und den Fuchsberg (77,2 Meter) gebildet wird. Zwischen den Hügeln liegen Trockentäler. Östlich der Hügelkette befindet sich das eiszeitliche Gletscherzungenbecken beziehungsweise die Schmelzwasserrinne des Marzahner Fenns.', 'Stadtgliederung.', 'Die Stadt gliedert sich in fünf Orts- und drei Gemeindeteile. Die Ortsteile sind im Einzelnen: Briest als altes Fischerdorf an der Havel im Süden, nördlich davon Fohrde zwischen dem südlichen Ufer des Pritzerber Sees und dem Fluss, Hohenferchesar am östlichen Ufer des Sees und die ehemalige Stadt Pritzerbe zwischen dem nördlichen Seeufer und der Havel. Der Ortsteil Marzahne liegt abseits der Havel und des Sees im Osten der Stadt. Ein Gemeindeteil Havelsees ist das zur Zeit der Stadtgründung zu Fohrde gehörende Tieckow. Es liegt etwa einen Kilometer südwestlich von Fohrde. Kützkow befindet sich als einziger Teil Havelsees auf der westlichen Havelseite. Der Gemeindeteil Seelensdorf liegt im Norden im Seelensdorfer Forst. Daneben gibt es noch einzelne Wohnplätze. Namentlich benannt sind das zu Briest gehörende Kaltenhausen südlich des Dorfes und Krahnepuhl nördlich, etwa auf halbem Weg nach Tieckow. Tieckow hat circa einen Kilometer südlich des Dorfes ein altes Vorwerk, den Wohnplatz Kolonie Tieckow. Zu Fohrde gehört die an der Havel gelegene Rote Ziegelei, zu Pritzerbe der Heidehof, und bei Hohenferchesar liegt der Bruderhof.', 'Geologie.', 'Der westliche Teil Havelsees liegt in einem Zwischenurstromtal, das in der jüngsten, der Weichsel-Eiszeit vor etwa 15.000 Jahren durch den Abfluss von Schmelzwässern entstand und für die Ablagerung fluviatiler Talsande sorgte. In dieser Urstromtalung fließt die Havel, die neue Sedimente anschwemmt. Westlich von Kützkow und nördlich von Pritzerbe gibt es zwei kleine Grundmoränenkomplexe, die von Sedimenten der alten Urstromtalung umgeben sind. Unterbrochen werden diese Sedimente an mehreren Stellen von großflächigen Moorbildungen. Nordöstlich der Linie Pritzerbe–Fohrde erstreckt sich eine Rinnenbeckenreihe mit dem Pritzerber See und weiteren kleineren Seen. Weiter nordöstlich queren Dünenzüge die flacher werdende Rinnenniederung, bis sie sich verliert.', 'Der östliche Teil Havelsees hin zum Ortsteil Marzahne liegt auf Grundmoränenhochflächen der Nauener Platte. Von Hohenferchesar am östlichen Rande des Pritzerber Sees ansteigend, erstreckt sich die Grundmoränenplatte ostwärts und bildet schließlich eine Hügelkette mit den Stauchmoränenkuppen Fohrder Berg, Schwarzer Berg und Fuchsberg mit typischen, vorwiegend kiesigen bis feinsandigen Ablagerungen. Zwischen diesen Endmoränenkomplexen befinden sich sandige Schmelzwassersedimente der sogenannten Vorschüttphase. Östlich der Hügelkette liegt ein Gletscherzungenbecken beziehungsweise eine Schmelzwasserrinne, das Marzahner Fenn, das von Moorbildung geprägt ist. Südwestlich des Schwarzen Berges beziehungsweise südöstlich des Gallberges beginnt die nach Süden laufende glaziale Rinne Bohnenland-Görden-Rinne. Sie verläuft etwa einen Kilometer auf dem Gebiet Havelsees.', 'Böden.', 'Im Gebiet der Stadt gibt es verschiedene Böden, wobei die westlichen Bereiche von unterschiedlichen Subtypen des Gleys dominiert werden. Im Osten des Stadtgebietes sind dagegen Braunerde- und Fahlerdeböden vorherrschend. Nördlich von Pritzerbe bis nördlich von Marzahne erstreckt sich ein breiter Streifen Podsol. Ausgedehnte Erdniedermoore gibt es an verschiedenen Stellen im gesamten Gebiet Havelsees, im Nordwesten in der Pritzerber Laake, im Osten im Marzahner Fenn, südlich und östlich des Pritzerber Sees, unmittelbar westlich Marzahnes, östlich von Briest und nordwestlich von Pritzerbe beiderseits der Havel.', 'Flächennutzung.', 'Havelsee ist vorrangig ländlich geprägt. Fast 90 Prozent des Stadtgebietes machen Wald, Wasser und Ackerland aus, wobei mit 42,4 Prozent der größte Anteil auf landwirtschaftliche Flächen entfällt. Dabei liegt der Anteil unter dem Landesdurchschnitt von etwa 49 Prozent. Etwas über dem Landesdurchschnitt liegt mit 39,2 Prozent der Anteil an Waldflächen, der brandenburgweit 35,6 Prozent ausmacht. Das größte Waldgebiet Havelsees ist der Seelensdorfer Forst, der das gesamte nördliche Stadtgebiet einnimmt. Auch Wasserflächen haben mit 7,2 Prozent einen deutlich größeren Anteil an der Gesamtfläche als im Landesdurchschnitt des schon gewässerreichen Bundeslandes (3,4 Prozent). Ein nur geringer Flächenanteil Havelsees ist bebaut. Die Art der tatsächlichen Nutzung der Flächen in Havelsee ist in der Tabelle Flächennutzung 2012 aufgeschlüsselt.', 'Gewässer.', 'Wichtigstes Gewässer und einziger Fluss in der Stadt ist die Havel, die den Ort von Süden kommend nach Nordwesten in einer alten Urstromtalung durchfließt. Der Fluss ist in Havelsee als Bundeswasserstraße Teil der Unteren Havel-Wasserstraße und mit der Binnenwasserstraßenklasse III klassifiziert. Die biologische Gewässergüte der Havel erreicht im Ort die Güteklasse II bis III, womit sie als kritisch belastet gilt. Bis auf ein Gebiet im Norden der Stadt in der Seelensdorfer Heide und der Pritzerber Laake, das zum Wassereinzugsgebiet des Großen Havelländischen Hauptkanals gehört, ist die Stadt direktes Einzugsgebiet der Havel. Weite an den Fluss grenzende Flächen, vor allem Bereiche nordwestlich Pritzerbes, sind als zwei- beziehungsweise zehnjährige Überschwemmungsflächen ausgewiesen.', 'Inmitten des Stadtgebietes liegt als größter See auf einer Fläche von circa 190 Hektar der maximal 6 Meter tiefe Pritzerber See, der zur Havel entwässert. Dieser See ist ein eutrophes beziehungsweise schwach polytrophes stehendes Gewässer mit sehr flachen und vermoorten Ufern. Der südliche Bereich zwischen den Ortsteilen Fohrde und Hohenferchesar ist vollständig verlandet. Ebenso wie an der Havel sind auch am Pritzerber See ausgedehnte Uferbereiche zwei- beziehungsweise zehnjährige Überschwemmungsflächen und stehen regelmäßig unter Wasser. Der Zu- beziehungsweise Abfluss ist durch einen Damm, über den zwei Brücken zwischen Pritzerbe und Fohrde führen, eingeengt. Neben dem Pritzerber See gibt es im Stadtgebiet mehrere kleinere Seen wie den Kranepfuhl und den Weißen See. Der Weiße See nordöstlich des Pritzerber Sees ist als schwach eutrophes stehendes Gewässer beschrieben.', 'Eine Vielzahl von Gräben durchzieht das Stadtgebiet, die in erster Linie für die Drainage von Feuchtgebieten, Mooren und Überschwemmungsflächen angelegt wurden. Die Gräben dienen teilweise auch dem Abfluss kleinerer Seen in der Stadt. Das Marzahner Fenn wird über ein Grabensystem ostwärts zu den sogenannten Erdelöchern in der Nähe Radeweges und weiter zum Beetzsee entwässert. Im Hauptgraben, dem sogenannten Russengraben, befinden sich im Stadtgebiet drei der vier Wehre dieses Systems, die der Regulierung des Abflusses dienen. Ein anderes Grabensystem führt vom Waldsee des Weißen Fenn Marzahne zum Pritzerber See und nimmt unter anderem Wasser aus den Moorflächen westlich Marzahnes und aus dem Weißen See auf. Dieses Drainagesystem wird über ein Wehr kurz vor dem Pritzerber See reguliert. Der Hauptgraben dieses Systems heißt Roter Graben. Der Bohnenländer See im Stadtgebiet Brandenburgs wird über einen Graben in die Havel südlich von Tieckow entwässert. Innerhalb von Havelsee wird das Eisengraben genannte Fließgewässer über drei Wehre gesteuert und nimmt unter anderem einen Abflussgraben aus dem Kranepfuhl auf. Ein weiteres System von Gräben, mit dem die Überschwemmungsflächen der Havel entwässert werden können, befindet sich nordwestlich von Pritzerbe. Dort steht auch das einzige Schöpfwerk der Stadt, über das höhergelegene und trockene Bereiche bewässert werden können. Die Stadtgebiete auf der westlichen Havelseite verfügen ebenfalls über ein eigenes Grabensystem zur Havel, der Abfluss aus Teilen des Seelensdorfer Forstes und der Pritzerber Laake erfolgt in Richtung des Havelländischen Hauptkanals.', 'Im Stadtgebiet gibt es zwei ausgewiesene Trinkwasserschutzgebiete.

Zur Römerzeit entstand um die Zeitenwende ein römisches Kastell. Gegen 260 gaben die Römer die rechtsrheinischen Gebiete in dieser Region auf, die Siedlung fiel wüst. Es gibt keine Hinweise auf eine kontinuierliche Besiedlung nach dem römischen Abzug.', 'Hinweise auf eine Besiedlung der Hochfläche über der Niddamündung gibt es erst wieder aus dem 8. Jahrhundert. 790 wurde zum ersten Mal das fränkische Dorf \\"Hostat\\" (hohe Stätte) im Lorscher Codex urkundlich erwähnt. Um 830, wenige Jahrzehnte nach der Ersterwähnung, wurde die weitgehend erhaltene Justinuskirche errichtet, eine der ältesten Kirchen in Deutschland. Das Dorf entwickelte sich in der Folge westlich der Justinuskirche beiderseits der alten Hauptstraße. Über 1000 Jahre gehörte Höchst zu Kurmainz, dem Territorium des Erzbischofs von Mainz. Das Mainzer Rad im Wappen des Stadtteils erinnert daran.', 'Zur Erhebung von Zöllen am Main errichtete die Mainzer Herrschaft in Höchst eine Zollburg. Um die Burg herum begann sich das Dorf langsam zu entwickeln. 1355 verlieh Kaiser Karl IV. dem Dorf \\"Hoisten\\" (Höchst) die Stadtrechte. In einer weiteren Urkunde bekräftigte Karl IV. 1356 die Stadterhebung und verlieh der jungen Stadt das Marktrecht. Grund für die Stadterhebung waren der Machtkampf zwischen Mainz und Frankfurt und die Erhebung des Höchster Mainzolls. Die in Höchst erhobenen Zölle waren für den finanzschwachen mainzischen Staat eine wichtige Einnahmequelle. Da die Handelsstadt Frankfurt durch den Mainzoll ihre wichtigste Lebensader bedroht sah, zerstörten die Frankfurter 1396 Stadt und Burg Höchst, die aber bald danach wiederaufgebaut wurden. Im 15. Jahrhundert wurde die Stadt zweimal erweitert.', 'Beim Großen Stadtbrand 1586 wurde die Hälfte der Stadt zerstört. Im Dreißigjährigen Krieg wurde auch Höchst in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. In der Schlacht bei Höchst am 20. Juni 1622 schlugen die Kaiserlichen Truppen unter der Leitung von Johann T’Serclaes von Tilly die Braunschweiger. 1631 besetzten die Schweden unter Gustav II. Adolf die Stadt; 1635 folgte die Besetzung durch Bernhard von Weimar, wobei das gotische Schloss zerstört wurde.', 'Im 18.

Die Spinne erhält ihren Trivialnamen durch das markante Balzverhalten des Männchens, bei dem es mit dem Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) auf trockene Blätter trommelt und dabei ein charakteristisches Schnurrgeräusch erzeugt, das auch noch aus einer Entfernung von mehreren Metern für das menschliche Gehör wahrnehmbar ist. Einige Zeit nach der Paarung fertigt das Weibchen einen Eikokon an, den es nach Eigenart der Familien an den Spinnwarzen angeheftet permanent mit sich herumträgt. Die geschlüpften Jungtiere verbleiben anfangs – für Wolfspinnen atypisch – nicht auf dem Opisthosoma des Muttertiers, sondern an den Resten des Kokons, ehe sie sich verselbstständigen und über mehrere Fresshäute (Häutungsstadien) heranwachsen.', 'Die ungewöhnliche Balz sowie der anfängliche Verbleib der Jungtiere waren mitunter Gründe, weshalb der Trommelwolf von der Arachnologischen Gesellschaft (AraGes) zur Spinne des Jahres 2022 gekürt wurde. Ein anderer Grund ist, dass damit auf die von ihm bewohnten und gefährdeten Habitate und insbesondere auf das Austrocknen der Moore aufmerksam gemacht werden soll. Auch soll damit die bisher nicht ganz geklärte Verbreitung der Spinne näher in den Fokus geraten.', 'Merkmale.', 'Das Weibchen des Trommelwolfs erreicht nach Sven Almquist (2005) eine Körperlänge von 4,5 bis 6,9 Millimetern, wobei der Durchschnittswert 5,5 ± 0,7 Millimeter ist.

Das Stück wurde erstmals am 12. Februar 1924 in der Aeolian Hall in New York aufgeführt. Angekündigt wurde das Konzert unter dem Titel \\"An Experiment in Modern Music\\". Bei der Uraufführung saß Gershwin selbst am Klavier.', 'Die \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" verbindet erfolgreich Jazz, Blues und konzertante Sinfonik. Die Melodien des Werkes sind mittlerweile weltberühmt. „Rhapsodie“ bedeutet ursprünglich „vorgetragenes Gedicht“ und bezeichnet heute ein Musikstück ohne kategorische Zuordnung. Wegen seiner Mischung der Musikstile ist die „Rhapsodie in Blau“ daher treffend bezeichnet.', 'Entstehungsgeschichte.', 'Der Bandleader Paul Whiteman hatte schon am 1. November 1923, rund vier Monate vor der Uraufführung, ein Konzert in der Aeolian Hall veranstaltet, das Jazz und Klassik einander gegenüberstellte. Es war ein passabler Erfolg, so dass Whiteman beschloss, ein noch ambitionierteres Projekt in Angriff zu nehmen. Dieses sollte am 12. Februar 1924 stattfinden. Whiteman forderte Gershwin auf, dafür ein Jazzstück für Orchester zu schreiben. Dieser lehnte zuerst ab mit Hinweis auf Terminprobleme und vermutlich, weil er im Komponieren für klassisches Orchester wenig Erfahrung besaß. Erst als Whiteman Gershwin auf eigene Faust auf die Programmliste setzte, komponierte er das Stück schließlich doch.', 'Whiteman und Gershwin hatten bereits bei der höchst erfolgreichen Broadway-Revue \\"George White’s Scandals\\" zusammengearbeitet, die auf Motiven von Gershwins – zumindest in kommerzieller Hinsicht erfolgloser – Jazz-Oper \\"Blue Monday\\" basierte. Gershwin lehnte den Vorschlag ab, da er wenige Tage später, am 7. Januar, eine Probevorstellung seines neuen Musicals \\"Sweet Little Devil\\" geben und eventuellen Änderungswünschen vor der Premiere am 21. Januar nachkommen musste.', 'Am Abend des 3. Januar 1924 spielte Gershwin mit seinem Freund und Kollegen Buddy DeSylva in der Nähe des Broadway Billard, während sein Bruder Ira Gershwin die Ausgabe des nächsten Tages des New York Tribune las. In einem Artikel mit der Überschrift “What Is American Music?” (\\"Was macht amerikanische Musik aus?\\") über das Konzert von Whiteman wurde angekündigt, dass George Gershwin an einer Jazzkomposition für diese Vorstellung arbeite.', 'Bei einem Telefonat mit Gershwin am nächsten Morgen erklärte Whiteman, dass sein Rivale Vincent Lopez ihm die Idee seines experimentellen Konzertes stehlen wolle und deshalb keine Zeit mit Diskussionen zu verlieren sei. Gershwin ließ sich schließlich zur Komposition überreden. Da nur noch fünf Wochen Zeit bis zur Aufführung waren, begann er umgehend damit und arbeitete einige Wochen unter Hochdruck daran, bevor er sie Whitemans Arrangeur Ferde Grofé übergab.', 'Das erste Manuskript für zwei Klaviere ist auf den 7. Januar 1924 datiert. Es enthält Bemerkungen zur Instrumentation, bei denen nicht die Instrumente, sondern die Namen der Solisten eingetragen sind. Grofé instrumentierte das Werk anscheinend mit Rücksicht auf die individuelle Stilistik, Stärken und Techniken der einzelnen Orchestermitglieder. Am 4. Februar 1924, acht Tage vor der Premiere, beendete er die Orchestrierung.', 'Der Arbeitstitel des Stückes war \\"American Rhapsody\\". Ira Gershwin schlug den Namen \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" vor, nachdem er eine Ausstellung von James McNeill Whistler besucht hatte, der seinen Kunstwerken oft Namen wie \\"Symphony in White\\" oder \\"Arrangement in Grey and Black\\" gab.', 'Den berühmten Beginn der Rhapsodie hatte Gershwin ursprünglich übrigens als Triller mit einem rasch aufsteigenden, aus 17 Noten bestehenden Tonleiterlauf komponiert. Whitemans Klarinettist Ross Gorman spielte die letzte Hälfte der Skala während einer Probe als Glissando. Als Gershwin das hörte, entschloss er sich, diese Variante für die Partitur zu übernehmen. Den entsprechenden Klarinettenpart trug bei der Premiere allerdings nicht Gorman, sondern Chester Hazlett vor.', 'Der breite, melodisch betonte Mittelteil (ab Takt 303 ) wurde auf Anregung von Ira Gershwin, der aus Georges Skizzenbuch ein geeignetes Thema auswählte, in die Komposition aufgenommen.', 'Die Aufführung selbst gestaltete Paul Whiteman und sein \\"Palais Royal Orchestra\\". Das Konzert sollte im Rahmen eines Musikabends unter dem Titel \\"An Experiment in Modern Music\\" („Ein Experiment in moderner Musik“) geboten werden. Namhafte Musiker, darunter Strawinski, Rachmaninow, Leopold Stokowski, Jascha Heifetz und Fritz Kreisler, Musikkritiker und Intellektuelle waren erschienen, um es sich anzuhören. 26 verschiedene Stücke wurden aufgeführt, darunter Edward Elgars \\"Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1\\" und heute kaum noch bekannte Kompositionen wie \\"True form of Jazz\\" und \\"Contrast: legitimate scoring vs. jazzing\\".', '\\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" war das vorletzte Stück. Bis dahin war das Publikum schon äußerst unruhig, da sich viele Werke ähnlich angehört hatten und obendrein das Lüftungssystem der Aeolian Hall ausgefallen war. Heute gilt der Abend aufgrund der Premiere der hier besprochenen Komposition als legendär. Gershwin spielte den Klavierpart selbst. Da er keine ausnotierte Klavierpartitur besaß und Grofé ihm wegen des Zeitdrucks nur eine Bandpartitur mit den hingekritzelten Worten \\"Wait for nods\\" („Warte, bis dir einer zunickt“) aushändigen konnte, ist die Version der Uraufführung heute nicht mehr zu rekonstruieren.', 'Pressestimmen zur Uraufführung.', '\\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" bekam sehr gegensätzliche Kritiken. Olin Downes rezensierte das Stück für die New York Times:', 'Einige Kritiker warfen Gershwin eine fehlende Form vor: Er habe nur einzelne Melodien aneinander gereiht. Lawrence Gilman schrieb im New York Tribune:', 'Besetzung.', 'Grofé arbeitete nach der Premiere in den Jahren 1926 und 1942 zwei weitere Partituren von \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" aus, beide für ein jeweils vergrößertes Orchester. Die jüngere Version wird im heutigen Repertoire mit Abstand am häufigsten gespielt.', 'Die Premiere war mit Flöte, Oboe, Klarinetten, Heckelphon, mehreren Saxophonen, zwei Hörnern, zwei Trompeten, zwei Flügelhörnern, Euphonium, zwei Posaunen, Bassposaune, Tuba, zwei Klavieren, Celesta, Banjo, Schlagzeug, Pauke, mehreren Violinen, Kontrabass und Akkordeon besetzt. Paul Whitemans damals aus dreiundzwanzig Musikern bestehende Band wurde zusätzlich um neun Personen verstärkt. Dennoch übernahmen mehrere Musiker der Band zwei oder mehr Instrumente. Manche spielten in dem Stück vier Instrumente.', 'Die Partitur von 1942 ist für Soloklavier, zwei Flöten, zwei Oboen, zwei Klarinetten, Bassklarinette, zwei Fagotte, drei Hörner, drei Trompeten, drei Posaunen, Tuba, Timpani, Percussion (Cymbal, Snare Bassdrum, Triangel, Gong und Glocken), Klavier, zwei Altsaxophone, Tenorsaxophon, Banjo und eine Streichergruppe (Violinen, Bratschen, Cello und Kontrabass) gesetzt. In der heutigen Aufführungspraxis wird die 2. Altsaxophonstimme „3rd Saxophone (E flat Alto)“ jedoch in der Regel mit einem Baritonsaxophon besetzt. Dies liegt unter anderem daran, dass die beiden Altsaxophonstimmen bei den meisten Passagen des Stückes unisono geschrieben sind (siehe auch Notenbeispiel weiter unten). Durch den Einsatz eines Baritonsaxophons wird hier eine Doppelung vermieden.', '2017 entstand eine neue Instrumentierung des Werkes auf Basis der Grofé-Partitur. Der deutsche Saxofonist Benjamin Steil arrangierte das Werk für Bigband-Standardbesetzung (5 Saxofone, 4 Trompeten, 4 Posaunen, Rhythmusgruppe und optionale Percussionparts).', 'Die Synthese von Jazz und Kunstmusik.', 'Zu Beginn der Musik des 20. Jahrhunderts wurde der Einfluss des Jazz auf die Arbeit bedeutender Komponisten erkennbar. Dies stand im Zusammenhang mit Tendenzen der Kunstmusik seit 1910: Neoklassizistischen Tendenzen, vertreten etwa durch Strawinski, stand die Neue Musik mit ihrem Vorreiter Arnold Schönberg gegenüber. Beiden – der Zwölftonmusik wohl etwas mehr als der zwar experimentierfreudigen, aber dennoch tonalen Musik der Neoklassizisten – drohten die Hörer verloren zu gehen. Ihr Kreis schrumpfte mehr und mehr auf eine kleine Gemeinde hochspezialisierter Experten.', 'So beschrieb Hermann Danuser in seinem Band \\"Die Musik des 20. Jahrhunderts\\" das Paradox, dass gerade die eigentlich moderne Musik „im Zuge einer tief greifenden Krise in den Augen mancher – und nicht nur in Kreisen der Jugend – zu einem fragwürdigen Teil einer ‚Welt von gestern‘ geworden war.“', 'Joachim Ernst Berendt attestierte den Jazzhörern noch 1953 „ein starkes, lebendiges Gefühl für die Verlogenheit und Getrübtheit, für die Formelhaftigkeit und Indirektheit, kurzerhand für die ‚Spätheit’ unserer Epoche“ und folgerte daraus: „Aus diesem Gefühl heraus sehnt man sich nach etwas Direktem und Ursprünglichen, etwas Lebendigem und Mitreißendem. Das gibt die Jazzmusik.“ Dieses Zitat deutet aber bereits auf die Problematik einer Komposition hin, die Jazzelemente beinhaltet: Begriffe wie Direktheit und Lebendigkeit bis hin zur Emphase sind eng mit der Improvisation verbunden. Dieses wichtige Ausdrucksmittel des Jazz war von den Kunstansprüchen der konzipierten klassischen Musik von vornherein ausgeschlossen.', 'Nun wollten die wenigsten Komponisten, auch nicht Gershwin, echten, spontan improvisierten Jazz schaffen. Vielmehr wichen sie von diesem Modell ab, um die geforderte Stilhöhendifferenz zur Kunstmusik zu überwinden und damit der damaligen Kunstauffassung gerecht zu werden. Zudem lernte Gershwin den Jazz in den 1920er-Jahren in New York wohl schon in der kommerzialisierten Form des \\"Sweet\\" („süß“, aber auch „bequem“, „glatt“) kennen. Diese Stilrichtung vertrat neben Whiteman vor allem der heute fast vergessene Bandleader Guy Lombardo. Er strebte an, dem Jazz seine ursprüngliche „Härte“, „Rohheit“ und „Unordnung“ zu nehmen ( siehe Weblinks) und ihn damit für ein gehobenes, vornehmlich weißes Hörerpublikum attraktiver zu machen.', 'Dem entsprach der Kommentar im Programmheft zur Premiere von \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" von Hugh C. Ernst:', 'George Gershwin als Vorreiter des Third Stream.', 'Gunther Schuller erfand in den 1950er-Jahren den Theoriebegriff \\"Third Stream\\" für die Synthese von Kunstmusik und Jazz. Diesen bezogen dann auch Komponisten wie George Russell und John Lewis auf ihre Musik. Die Idee existierte jedoch schon früher und beschäftigte auch Claude Debussy oder Darius Milhaud.

Er stellte sich dort mit einem Programm zur Universitätsreform vor. Als einer der damals besten Kenner des Griechischen sah er im Studium der drei alten Sprachen einen Weg der Persönlichkeitsbildung. In den 1520er Jahren konnte er als Rektor in Wittenberg sowie als Schulgründer seine Reformpläne verwirklichen. Die Regeln der Rhetorik machte er für das Verständnis antiker Texte fruchtbar, und die Fähigkeit, ein Thema im Zusammenhang und in ansprechender Form darzustellen, wurde von den Wittenberger Studenten anstelle der traditionellen scholastischen Disputationen eingeübt.', 'Melanchthon begleitete Luther 1519 zur Leipziger Disputation und profilierte sich danach als dessen Parteigänger. Mit den \\"Loci communes\\" legte er 1521 eine evangelische Dogmatik vor. Da Luther als Geächteter in seinen Reisemöglichkeiten eingeschränkt war, vertrat Melanchthon die Wittenberger Positionen bei Reichstagen und Religionsgesprächen. Mit der \\"Confessio Augustana\\" und der zugehörigen Apologie verfasste er 1530/31 zwei bis heute maßgebliche Bekenntnisschriften der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche. Nach der Niederlage der Protestanten im Schmalkaldischen Krieg (1547) suchte Melanchthon Kompromisslösungen, was ihn in Gegensatz zu Matthias Flacius und seinem Kreis brachte. Der Adiaphoristische Streit war auch ein Streit um Melanchthons persönliche Integrität, in dem sich das konfessionelle Luthertum letztlich gegen ihn entschied.', 'Obwohl Melanchthon seit 1560 als \\"Praeceptor Germaniae\\" („Lehrer Deutschlands“) bezeichnet wurde, gingen von seinem Werk auch europaweite Wirkungen aus: Melanchthonschüler prägten die lutherischen Kirchen in Skandinavien und Südosteuropa. Melanchthon stand in extensivem brieflichem Austausch mit anderen Reformatoren, darunter Johannes Calvin in Genf und Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich. Melanchthons Einfluss auf die Reformierte Kirche geht vor allem über den Heidelberger Katechismus, dessen Hauptverfasser, Zacharias Ursinus, sein Schüler war.', 'Lange galt Melanchthon vor allem als Mitarbeiter Luthers. Die neuere Forschung nimmt stärker die Eigenständigkeit seines Denkens wahr. Als Bildungsreformer trug Melanchthon zur Etablierung der heutigen Naturwissenschaften an den Universitäten bei. Er sah den Fortschritt stets in der Erschließung antiker Quellentexte. Das heliozentrische Weltbild des Nikolaus Kopernikus hielt er für Spielerei, akzeptierte es aber zögernd als Denkmodell.

Die Familie meinte, sein Leiden sei eine Folge davon, dass er aus einem vergifteten Brunnen getrunken habe. Aber seine Krankheit kann auch Folge seines berufsbedingten ständigen Kontakts mit Chemikalien gewesen sein.', 'In Melanchthons Elternhaus wurde eine intensive Laienfrömmigkeit nach klösterlichem Vorbild gelebt. Mit großem zeitlichem Abstand erinnerte sich Melanchthon 1554 in einem Brief, dass der Vater ihn zwei Tage vor seinem Tod zu sich rief, ihn zu einem religiösen Leben ermahnte und betete, dass Philipp in künftigen politischen Veränderungen von Gott geleitet werden möge. Dann sei er nach Speyer geschickt worden, um das Sterben seines Vaters am 27. Oktober 1508 nicht mitzuerleben. Kurz zuvor, am 17. Oktober, war bereits der Großvater verstorben.

Philipp Schwartzerdt gehörte zu diesem Kreis, der nach Schulschluss von Simler unterrichtet wurde. Reuchlin, der in Stuttgart lebte und in Tübingen als einer der obersten Richter des Schwäbischen Bundes tätig war, beobachtete die Fortschritte des Zwölfjährigen und belohnte sie mit einem Exemplar der griechischen Grammatik von Konstantinos Laskaris.

Oktober 1509 an der Universität Heidelberg immatrikuliert. Er wohnte bei dem Theologieprofessor Pallas Spangel, wo auch Jakob Wimpfeling gelegentlich zu Besuch war. 1511 veröffentlichte Wimpfeling in seinen eigenen Büchern Melanchthons erste lateinische Gedichte. Unter den Mitstudenten knüpfte Melanchthon Kontakt mit Theobald Billicanus, Johannes Brenz und Erhard Schnepf. Das Studienprogramm bewältigte Melanchthon problemlos und erwarb am 10. Juni 1511, zum frühestmöglichen Zeitpunkt, den untersten akademischen Grad eines \\"Baccalaureus artium\\".', 'Nach dem Tode von Spangel wechselte Melanchthon an die Universität Tübingen, wo er am 17. September 1512 immatrikuliert wurde. Dort studierte er Arithmetik, Geometrie, Musik und Astronomie (Quadrivium). Nebenher beschäftigte er sich mit Griechisch, Hebräisch und Latein. Er las antike Autoren sowie humanistische Dichter und machte Bekanntschaft mit neuen Lehrmethoden. So lernte er auch die Schriften von Rudolf Agricola zur Logik kennen und entnahm ihnen ein neues Verständnis der Dialektik. Seit Beginn seiner Tübinger Zeit war Melanchthon eng mit Ambrosius Blarer befreundet.', 'Als Reuchlin durch ein Gutachten über das hebräische Schrifttum in einen Prozess verwickelt wurde (Judenbücherstreit), setzte Melanchthon sich für seinen Förderer publizistisch ein. In den satirischen Dunkelmännerbriefen wurde er deshalb als schlimmster Tübinger Reuchlinanhänger bezeichnet (was aber ein Lob darstellte). Am 25. Januar 1514 schloss Melanchthon sein Studium an der Artistenfakultät mit dem Magistertitel ab. Danach war er verpflichtet, zwei Jahre an der Universität zu lehren. Melanchthon besuchte, wie es üblich war, daneben auch Vorlesungen an der theologischen und der artistischen Fakultät. Johannes Stöffler weckte durch seine Astronomievorlesungen Melanchthons Interesse an der Mathematik. Bereits in Tübingen war er als Tutor zweier Grafensöhne tätig und wirkte als Griechischlehrer.

Der damals bekannteste Gräzist Johannes Reuchlin lehnte aus Altersgründen den Ruf nach Wittenberg ab und empfahl Melanchthon, seinen „gesippten Freund“, für die Stelle. Die Berufung des 21-jährigen Melanchthon geschah auf Wunsch des Kurfürsten; Martin Luther bevorzugte den Leipziger Petrus Mosellanus. Melanchthon traf am 25. August 1518 in Wittenberg ein.

Oberhalb von 500 °C geht der Brand bei ausreichender Sauerstoffzufuhr in einen \\"Glimmbrand\\" (bis ca. 1000 °C) oder einen \\"Flammbrand\\" (bis 1200 °C) über, es erfolgt eine \\"vollständige Verbrennung\\".', 'Arten von Kohlebränden.', 'Kohleflözbrände.', 'Kohleflözbrände können unterteilt werden in oberflächennahe Brände in ausstreichenden, also an der Oberfläche zu Tage tretenden Flözen, wo der Sauerstoff aus der Luft stammt, und in Brände in Bergwerken in größerer Tiefe. Dort stammt der Sauerstoff aus der Bewetterung.', 'Spontane Kohlebrände.', 'Ursache spontaner Kohlebrände ist die Entzündlichkeit der Kohle. Bei einem Kohlebrand reagiert der Sauerstoff mit den Feststoffmolekülen des Brennstoffs. Diese exothermen Reaktionen finden bei allen Temperaturen statt. Die Geschwindigkeit ist jedoch stark temperaturabhängig, so steigt die Reaktionsrate mit zunehmender Temperatur annähernd exponentiell an. Wenn ein Brennstoff in zerkleinerter Form vorliegt, etwa als Feststoffschüttung, oder wenn der Feststoff porös ist, ist im gesamten System Sauerstoff vorhanden.', 'Eine unterkritische Lagerung erfolgt, wenn die im Schüttungsinneren freigesetzte Wärmeenergie kleiner ist als die Wärmeenergie, die durch Wärmeleitung an den Rand der Schüttung transportiert und über die Schüttungsoberfläche an die Umgebung abgegeben werden kann. Wird jedoch im Inneren der Feststoffschüttung mehr Wärmeenergie freigesetzt, als nach außen abgeführt werden kann, geht das System in einen kritischen Zustand über. Die Temperatur im Inneren steigt an, führt damit zu einer weiteren Erhöhung der Reaktionsrate und in der Folge zur Selbstentzündung.', 'Zwei wesentliche Faktoren entscheiden, ob eine Selbstentzündung erfolgt oder nicht, die Umgebungstemperatur und die Schüttungsgröße:', 'Die meistgenannte Kenngröße für den Start dieses Prozesses ist die \\"Selbstentzündungstemperatur\\" (SET). Sie ist keine „Stoffkonstante“, sondern immer abhängig von der Schüttungsgröße und -geometrie, insbesondere dem Verhältnis von Volumen zu Oberfläche und nimmt mit steigendem Schüttungsvolumen ab.', 'Natürlich ist die Selbstentzündungstemperatur auch von den Eigenschaften des jeweiligen Brennstoffes abhängig. Dazu zählen unter anderem der Brennwert, die Wärmeleitfähigkeit und die Korngröße. Ihre Angabe ist daher etwas heikel, da man immer die genauen Untersuchungsbedingungen angeben muss. Bei gleichen Bedingungen wird die Selbstentzündungstemperatur für Steinkohle höher liegen als die für Braunkohle.', 'Im Gegensatz zu einer „fassbaren“ Zündquelle, wie einer offenen Flamme oder einer heißen Oberfläche, läuft der Prozess der Selbstentzündung ohne fremde Einwirkung ab. Ist eine Schüttung hinreichend groß, kann dieser Prozess auch schon bei Temperaturen ablaufen, die im Bereich der Jahres-Mitteltemperatur eines Ortes liegen. Dies war zum Beispiel bei der sogenannten Senatsreserve in Berlin der Fall. Die dort auf Vorrat gehaltene Kohle war zum Teil überkritisch und entzündete sich demnach selbst. Dabei ist zu bemerken, dass die Induktionszeiten, also die Zeiten vom Beginn einer Lagerung bis zur Entzündung, umso kürzer werden, je größer die Schüttung und damit umso kleiner die Selbstentzündungstemperatur ist. Im Fall der Senatsreserve betrug die Induktionszeit mehrere Jahre.', 'Braunkohle kann schon bei Temperaturen von ca. 40 °C bis 60 °C spontan zu brennen beginnen, während dies bei der höchstwertigen Anthrazitkohle erst ab 140 °C möglich ist. Der Brand entsteht meist einige Dezimeter innerhalb der Kohle, in einer Tiefe, in der einerseits die Permeabilität der Kohle den Zutritt von Luft noch zulässt, andererseits die Durchlüftung die entstehende Wärme nicht größtenteils abführt. Die niedrige Wärmeleitfähigkeit der Kohle lässt eine Wärmeableitung ohne Fluidzirkulation nicht zu.', 'Faktoren, die die spontane Entzündung beeinflussen, sind unter anderem:', 'Die spontane Entzündung von Kohle braucht Zeit. Sie hängt von vielen Faktoren ab, unter anderem von der Umgebungstemperatur, aber auch von dem Volumen der Kohle, im Laborversuch also von der Probengröße (siehe dazu auch die erkannten Mechanismen der Heuselbstentzündung). Die Zeit bis zur Selbstentzündung ist ein weiteres Maß für die Entzündungsneigung der Kohle. Bei großen Kohlemengen, beispielsweise in situ, ist also zwar die notwendige minimale Umgebungstemperatur kleiner als bei kleinen Kohlemengen, anderseits dauert es sehr lange, üblicherweise Monate, bis sich eine Kohleprobe entzündet.', 'Wo ein Flöz nahe an der Erdoberfläche liegt, hat die Luft einen unmittelbaren und effektiveren Zutritt. Hier entstehen derartige Brände spontan und können jahrzehntelang brennen. Insgesamt werden auf der Welt mindestens 20 bis 30 Millionen Tonnen Kohle jährlich durch diese Brände vernichtet. Für den Bergbau unbrauchbar gemacht wird mindestens die zehnfache Kohlemenge, weil die verbleibende Restkohle nicht mehr zugänglich oder nicht mehr wirtschaftlich abbaubar ist.', 'Es gibt zwei wärmeproduzierende Adsorptions-Vorgänge:', 'Die wesentlichen Reaktionen des Kohlenstoffs mit dem Luftsauerstoff sind:', 'Fremdentzündete Kohleflözbrände.', 'Kohleflözbrände entstehen zum überwiegenden Teil durch Prozesse der Selbstentzündung. In wenigen Fällen ist jedoch eine Fremdentzündung möglich. Dem Brand ist dann letztlich nicht anzusehen, wie er entstanden ist. Dies gilt insbesondere für Brände unter Tage, aber auch für oberflächennahe Brände, soweit sie im Zusammenhang mit oberflächennahem Bergbau stehen. Mögliche Ursachen sind elektrische Betriebsmittel in unsachgemäßem Zustand, heißgelaufene Rollen von Förderbändern sowie Unachtsamkeit bei Spreng-, Schweiß- oder Schleifarbeiten.', 'In aller Regel spielt auch das Zurücklassen von Restkohle in abgebauten Flözteilen oder die Ansammlung von Kohlestaub in größeren Mengen eine Rolle. Eine konsequente Einhaltung der bergmännischen Vorschriften schließt derartige Fremdentzündungen aus.', 'Untertägige Kohleflözbrände können in Wechselwirkung mit Methanexplosionen oder Kohlestaubexplosionen stehen. Oberflächennahe Kohleflözbrände entzünden häufig Waldbrände und umgekehrt. Dieses wurde aus den USA, insbesondere aber von der indonesischen Insel Sumatra berichtet.', 'Kohlebrände nach der Förderung.', 'Brände in Kohlelagern.', 'Die abgebaute Kohle, aber auch Koks wird auf großen Halden oft monatelang gelagert. Hierbei gibt es gesetzliche Vorschriften zur Vermeidung von Selbstentzündung. So wurde zum Beispiel für \\"Kohlen- und Kokshalden im Bereich der Bergaufsicht\\" von Nordrhein-Westfalen festgelegt, dass die Kohle in horizontalen Scheiben von jeweils höchstens sechs Meter Höhe zu lagern ist. Je nach Kohlenart und -sorte ist dabei eine maximale Schütthöhe festgelegt.', 'In älteren Halden können oft noch erhebliche Mengen an Kohle enthalten sein. Großbritannien hatte erhebliche Probleme mit brennenden Halden. Diese sind jedoch inzwischen ausgegraben und begrünt. Die auch heute in Deutschland noch brennenden Halden werden teilweise aus der Luft mit Wärmebildgeräten überwacht. Diese vergleichsweise kleinen Brände werden durch Injektionen von Zement oder Anhydrit unterdrückt.', 'In Kohlenstaubanlagen wird Kohle mit einer Korngröße kleiner als 0,5 Millimeter verarbeitet. Auslöser eines Brandes ist dabei nur selten eine Selbstentzündung, sondern in der Regel eine fremdentzündete Staubexplosion. Hier sind die Brandschutzvorgaben der Berufsgenossenschaft sehr rigide. Derartige Anlagen werden oft unter dem Einsatz von Inertgas, zur Verringerung des vorhandenen Sauerstoffs, betrieben. Auf Schutz vor Funkenflug, hohen Temperaturen (max. 80 °C) und den Kohlenmonoxid-Wert zur Anzeige von Schwelbränden muss geachtet werden.', 'Kohlebrände beim Transport.', 'In der Zeit der Dampfschifffahrt kam es zu Bränden beim Transport von Kohle. Anfangs wurde die Kohle für die noch wenig verbreiteten Dampfschiffe auf Segelschiffen aus Holz transportiert. In der Zeit von 1871 bis 1880 kamen so 152 britische Schiffe zu Schaden, 68 waren Totalverluste und 84 wurden schwer beschädigt. Nach ersten wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen erkannte man den Zusammenhang, dass die Zahl der Brände mit zunehmender Reisedauer und mitgeführter Menge zunahm. Zwar wurde das erste Eisenschiff bereits 1838 gebaut, aber dieser Schiffstyp konnte sich nicht durchsetzen. Erst als nach 1881 die ersten Stahlschiffe in Großbritannien entstanden, verlor der Kohletransport einen Teil seiner Gefahr, weil die Kohle nun in nicht brennbaren Stahlbunkern transportiert werden konnte.', 'Ein Kohlebrand wird nach den seit 1976 erfolgten Untersuchungen zur Explosion des US-Schlachtschiffes \\"Maine\\" im Februar 1898 im Hafen von Havanna als Auslöser für die Entzündung der Schwarzpulvervorräte in der zum Kohlebunker benachbarten Munitionskammer angenommen.

Sie wurde vom deutschen Unternehmen Rheinmetall entwickelt und wird von dessen Tochtergesellschaft \\"Rheinmetall Waffe Munition\\", das zur Division \\"Weapon and Ammunition\\" gehört, produziert. Lizenzen für die Produktion wurden international an mehrere Unternehmen vergeben.', 'Die Kanone ist die erste moderne Glattrohrkanone, die in der westlichen Welt nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg entwickelt wurde. Zunächst als Hauptbewaffnung des deutschen Leopard 2 eingeführt und später im US-amerikanischen M1 Abrams sowie weiteren Panzertypen verwendet, ist sie heute in den Panzern der Armeen vieler Länder im Einsatz. Bisher wird sie in drei Varianten, der \\"L/44\\", der \\"L/55\\" und der \\"L/55A1\\", verbaut. Die Entwicklung einer dritten Variante, der \\"LLR L/47\\" für luftverlastbare Fahrzeuge, ist abgeschlossen, sie wird aber bisher noch in keinem Waffensystem eingesetzt.', 'Hintergrund.', 'Mit der Verschärfung des Kalten Krieges und dem Auftauchen neuer Kampfpanzer auf Seiten des Warschauer Paktes wuchsen Mitte der 1960er-Jahre auf Seiten der Bundeswehr Zweifel, ob die existierenden Kanonen, insbesondere die weit verbreitete gezogene 105-mm-Kanone Royal Ordnance L7, noch in der Lage wären, diese neuen Gegner erfolgreich zu bekämpfen. Diese Gegner waren insbesondere die T-64- und T-72-Panzer, die mit einer damals neuartigen Verbundpanzerung und 125-mm-Glattrohrkanonen ausgerüstet waren.', 'Die von den USA und Deutschland gemeinsam begonnene Entwicklung des Kampfpanzer 70 scheiterte und wurde 1969 eingestellt. Nachdem sich auch die geplante 152-mm-Kanone, die die Rohrrakete MGM-51 abfeuern konnte, für Deutschland als der falsche Weg herausstellte, entschloss sich Rheinmetall, einen neuen Weg bei der Entwicklung der Kanone einzuschlagen, der in der Sowjetunion bereits 1962 durch die Einführung der 115-mm-Glattrohrkanone U-5TS beim T-62 vorgezeichnet wurde.', 'Entwicklung und Aufbau.', '120-mm-Glattrohrkanone L/44.', 'Die 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone \\"L/44\\" entstand in enger Zusammenarbeit mit der Bundeswehr speziell für den Einsatz im Leopard 2, der damals entwickelt wurde. Die Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeit bei Rheinmetall begann im Jahr 1965 unter der Federführung von Raimund Germershausen und zog sich über zehn Jahre hin. Rheinmetall konnte bereits nach zweijähriger Entwicklungszeit nachweisen, dass die Glattrohrkanone flügelstabilisierte Geschosse mit großer Präzision verschießen konnte.', 'Als die Kanone 1975 fertig war, wurde von Rheinmetall und den Fahrzeugherstellern in einem trinationalen Vergleichsschießen gezeigt, dass sie ihren westlichen Wettbewerbern mit gezogenen Läufen, nämlich der US-amerikanischen 105-mm- und der britischen 110-mm-Kanone, überlegen war. So lag die die ballistische Leistung 60 % über der 105-mm-Kanone. Mit dem Zulauf des Leopard 2 zur Truppe war so eine im Westen vollkommen neue Waffentechnik verfügbar.', 'Der erste Lizenznehmer der \\"L/44\\"-Kanone, General Dynamics, führte sie 1986 als \\"M256\\" bei der \\"A1\\"-Version des M1 Abrams ein. Sie ersetzte dort die gezogene 105-mm-Kanone \\"M68A1\\". Die \\"L/44\\" ist zur Nachrüstung und damit Kampfwertsteigerung von Leopard 1 geeignet, die ebenfalls mit einer gezogenen 105-mm-Kanone \\"(L7A3)\\" ausgestattet sind.', 'Die Kanone hat ein Kaliber von 120 Millimetern. Die namensgebende Kaliberlänge 44 ergibt damit eine Rohrlänge von 5280 mm, was annähernd der Länge der \\"L7A3\\" des Leopard 1 entspricht. Das Rohr wiegt dabei 1190 Kilogramm und die komplette Waffenanlage 3780 Kilogramm.', 'Das kaltgereckte Vollrohr ist für einen Konstruktionsgasdruck von 7100 bar ausgelegt und erhielt eine Autofrettage. Als Werkstoff wurde ein hochfester, vakuum-umgeschmolzener Stahl verwendet. Im Vergleich zur L7A3-Kanone wurde die Dehngrenze des Stahls um mehr als 20 Prozent auf 1,03 Gigapascal erhöht. Aufgrund der hohen Leistung der Munition und der damit einhergehenden hohen thermischen und erosiven Belastung ist das Rohr zur Erhöhung der Haltbarkeit innen hartverchromt. Anfängliche Probleme mit dieser Hartverchromung verzögerten die Entwicklung der Kanone.', 'Um eine Verformung durch Sonneneinstrahlung möglichst gering zu halten, besitzt das Rohr eine Rohrschutzhülle aus doppelwandigem und ausgeschäumtem glasfaserverstärktem Kunststoff (GFK). GFK wurde hier erstmalig im Waffenbau verwendet und wurde auch gewählt, um durch die geringe Masse die Dynamik der Waffenanlage möglichst wenig zu beeinträchtigen. Der Rauchabsauger ist ebenfalls aus GFK gefertigt.', 'Die Kanone ist auf Schildzapfen gelagert; der Höhenrichtbereich beträgt beim Einbau im Leopard 2 minus 9 Grad bis plus 20 Grad. Der Verschluss der Kanone ist ein Fallkeilverschluss mit vorgesteuerter Öffner- und Auswerfermechanik. Das Schließen übernimmt eine Schließfeder. Beim Ausfall der Systeme kann der Verschluss auch von Hand geöffnet oder verschlossen werden. Die Waffe wird elektrisch abgefeuert. Eine Notabfeuerung mittels induktivem Stoßgenerator ist möglich. Die Rücklaufeinrichtung des Rohres besteht aus zwei hydraulischen Rohrbremsen mit einer Bremshöchstkraft von 600 Kilonewton (kN). Der Rücklaufweg des Rohres ist mit nominal 340 mm (maximal 370 mm) annähernd äquivalent zur gezogenen 105-mm-Kanone mit 280 mm. Der Rohrvorholer arbeitet mit einem hydropneumatischen System. Das Bodenstück ist mit der Rücklaufeinrichtung fest verbunden und mit einem Bajonettgewinde mit dem Rohr verschraubt. Aufgrund dieser Bauweise kann das Rohr in etwa 30 Minuten gewechselt werden. Die Kanone ist weder mit einer Mündungsbremse noch mit einem Mündungsfeuerdämpfer ausgerüstet.', 'Waffenanlage und Munition.', 'Die Kanone ist Bestandteil einer vollstabilisierten Waffenanlage. Als Entwicklungsziel wurde eine Waffenanlage mit Kanone mit größerem Kaliber als 105 mm, die unter weitestgehender Beibehaltung der Abmessungen leistungsfähiger und zielgenauer sein sollte, formuliert.', 'Die Entwicklungsvorgaben dieser Waffenanlage waren eine große effektive Kampfentfernung, eine hohe Trefferwahrscheinlichkeit beim ersten Schuss und eine gute Durchschlagsleistung auch gegen moderne Verbund- oder Reaktivpanzerungen. Die Kosten der gesamten Waffenanlage lagen laut ursprünglicher Preisaufstellung bei rund sieben Prozent der Gesamtkosten des Leopard 2.', 'Der Feldjustierkollimator aus den Vorserienfahrzeugen des Leopard 2 entfiel bis 1991 in der Serienproduktion. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt wurde ein deutlich verbesserter Feldjustierspiegel eingebaut und an allen Glattrohrkanonen nachgerüstet.', 'Da die Munition, die parallel zur Waffenanlage von Rheinmetall mitentwickelt wurde, nicht den stabilisierenden Drall eines Laufes mit Zügen und Feldern erhält, wird sie über ein Leitwerk aus Aluminium (bei neueren Munitionsarten aus Stahl) stabilisiert. Die Mündungsgeschwindigkeit beträgt mit Wuchtgeschossen, beispielsweise der \\"DM 33\\", bis zu 1640 Meter pro Sekunde (m/s). Die Mündungsenergie dieses Geschosses liegt damit bei rund 9,8 Megajoule (MJ). Die Lebensdauer des Rohres wurde ursprünglich mit 500 „Standardschuss“ spezifiziert. Durch die Verwendung anderer Munitionssorten, höherer Gasdrücke und abrasiverer Treibladungen sinkt die Lebensdauer allerdings auf unter 300 Schuss.', '120-mm-Glattrohrkanone L/55.', 'Durch die Weiterentwicklung des internationalen Panzerbaus mit der Einführung wirkungsvollerer Reaktivpanzerungen in den 1980er-Jahren und die Entwicklung von rohrverschießbaren Lenkwaffen mit einer Reichweite von bis zu fünf Kilometern wurde eine Verbesserung der Feuerkraft aus Sicht der Bundeswehr unumgänglich. Nachdem die Entwicklung von Rheinmetall für eine noch leistungsfähigere 140-mm-Glattrohrkanone, der sogenannten \\"NPzK-140\\", insbesondere auf Grund der Tatsache, dass die Panzertürme hätten ersetzt werden müssen, keine Aussicht auf eine Serienreife hatte, wurde entschieden, die L/44 weiterzuentwickeln.', 'Die Weiterentwicklung der L/44 wurde die \\"L/55\\". Sie ist nicht nur um 25 Prozent länger und ermöglicht eine noch höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit, sondern brachte auch andere Weiterentwicklungen mit sich. Die L/55 ist so konstruiert, dass sie gemäß dem \\"Interface Control Document\\" (ICD) eine identische Geometrie der Kammer aufweist wie die L/44 und mindestens für die gleichen Gasdrücke geeignet ist. Damit kann Munition der L/44 auch in der L/55 verwendet werden. Außerdem war ein Entwicklungsziel, dass die neue Kanone ohne große Änderungen in den Serienturm des Leopard 2 nachgerüstet werden kann. Im Jahr 1998 war sie schließlich für den Einsatz verfügbar, nachdem Rheinmetall 1997 die Erprobung zusammen mit der \\"DM-53\\"-Munition (auch \\"LKE II\\" genannt) abgeschlossen hatte. Die Rohre sind ausschließlich Neufertigungen; eine Verlängerung der L/44-Rohre ist nicht möglich. Die Nebeneffekte der Kopflastigkeit, das ungünstigere Fahrverhalten im Gelände und bebauten Gebieten sowie die häufiger notwendige Überprüfung der Justierung mit der Feldjustieranlage wurden als vertretbar eingestuft.', 'Die L/55 ist für größere Gasdrücke ausgelegt, ermöglicht dadurch eine noch höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit und damit Durchschlagsfähigkeit der Geschosse. Außerdem wurden die Außengeometrie (Wandstärke) des Rohres sowie die Fertigungsabläufe optimiert, um das sonst ungünstige Schwingungsverhalten der Waffe bei der Schussabgabe zu verbessern. So erhält auch der hintere Teil der L/55 nun eine zweistufige Autofrettage. Auf eine Hartverchromung der Laufverlängerung im Mündungsbereich wird aufgrund der Erkenntnisse über die beim Schuss entstehenden und die Lebensdauer der Verchromung beeinträchtigenden Transversalwellen verzichtet. Für die L/55 wurde auch die Feldjustieranlage weiterentwickelt, die durch eine Änderung des Feldjustierspiegels an der Rohrmündung einen besseren Schwingungsausgleich bietet. Mit der Feldjustieranlage kann der Richtschütze die Justierung der Waffenanlage überprüfen und die aktuelle Verbiegung des Waffenrohres ermitteln und so die Justierung der Richtanlage kor: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Rheinmetall, Glattrohrkanone, Kampfpanzer, Leopard 2, 120mm, L/44, L/55, Munition, Durchschlagsleistung, Gasdruck"},{"instruction":"ChatGPT, let’s run through a test scenario.

Jahrhunderts als Brenn- und Leuchtgas eingesetzt.', 'Das Gas ist giftig, da es stärker an Hämoglobin bindet als Sauerstoff und so den Sauerstofftransport durch das Blut unterbindet. Die Kohlenstoffmonoxidintoxikation ist häufig ein Teilvorgang der Rauchgasvergiftung und der Minenkrankheit nach Einatmung giftiger Gase im Bergbau; sie kann innerhalb kurzer Zeit tödlich sein.', 'Nomenklatur.', 'In der zurückgezogenen deutschen Norm DIN 32640 „Chemische Elemente und einfache anorganische Verbindungen – Namen und Symbole“ vom Dezember 1986 wird die Schreibweise „Kohlenstoffmonooxid“ mit „oo“ empfohlen, weil nach den IUPAC-Regeln für die Nomenklatur der anorganischen Chemie Endvokale vorangestellter griechischer Zahlwörter nicht weggelassen werden.', 'Dagegen wird in der Ausgabe der IUPAC-Nomenklatur von 1990 die Schreibweise „Kohlenstoffmonoxid“ genannt. Zur Verwendung der multiplikativen Präfixe heißt es: „Die abschließenden Vokale der multiplikativen Präfixe werden nicht weggelassen, es sei denn, es liegen zwingende sprachliche Gründe vor. Monoxid ist eine derartige Ausnahme.“', 'Geschichte.', 'Schon im Jahr 1000 v. Chr. wurde bei der Verhüttung von Metallerzen die reduzierende Wirkung von Kohlenstoffmonoxid in sogenannten Rennöfen genutzt, ohne jedoch die Natur des Gases zu kennen. Die Griechen und Römer verwendeten es für Exekutionen. Arnaldus de Villanova beschrieb im späten 13. Jahrhundert die Giftigkeit eines Gases, das durch die Verbrennung von Holz entsteht; gemeint war Kohlenstoffmonoxid. Im frühen 17. Jahrhundert experimentierte Johan Baptista van Helmont mit einem Gas namens \\"gas carbonum\\", einer Mischung aus Kohlenstoffdioxid und Kohlenstoffmonoxid.', 'Im Jahr 1776 erzeugte der französische Chemiker Joseph de Lassone Kohlenstoffmonoxid durch Erhitzen von Zinkoxid mit Koks. Er nahm fälschlicherweise an, dass es sich dabei um Wasserstoff handele. Joseph Priestley stellte 1799 Kohlenstoffmonoxid durch Überleiten von Kohlenstoffdioxid über heißes Eisen her. William Cruickshank nutzte das gleiche Verfahren im Jahr 1800. Er schlug die richtige Zusammensetzung CO vor. Die toxischen Eigenschaften auf Hunde wurden von Claude Bernard um 1846 untersucht.', 'Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts wuchs der Bedarf an Leuchtgasen. Die englische Leuchtgasindustrie begann zu dieser Zeit mit der Entwicklung von Verfahren zur Kohlevergasung. Mit der Entwicklung von Hochdruckverfahren in der chemischen Industrie zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts stieg der Bedarf an kohlenstoffmonoxidhaltigen Synthesegasen stark an. Mit der Entwicklung des Winkler-Generators, des Lurgi-Druckvergasers und später des Koppers-Totzek-Reaktors gelang die großtechnische Kohlevergasung.', 'Während der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus wurde Kohlenstoffmonoxid für Exekutionen verwendet. Bei der Aktion T4 wurden mit Kohlenstoffmonoxid systematisch mehr als 70.000 Menschen mit geistigen und körperlichen Behinderungen von 1940 bis 1945 in Deutschland ermordet.', 'Vorkommen.', 'Atmosphärische Vorkommen.', 'Die mittlere Konzentration von Kohlenstoffmonoxid in der Erdatmosphäre beträgt etwa 90 Milliardstel Volumenanteil (die englische Bezeichnung für ein Milliardstel ist \\"\\"; mit dem Zusatz „v“ für Volumenanteil wird diese Hilfseinheit üblicherweise als „ppbv“ abgekürzt). Insgesamt enthält die Atmosphäre etwa 400 Megatonnen (Mt). Auf der Nordhalbkugel liegt die mittlere Konzentration heute bei 140 ppbv, vor der Industrialisierung waren es etwa 90 ppbv. Auf der Südhalbkugel blieb die mittlere Konzentration mit 50 ppbv auf ihrem natürlichen Niveau.', 'Das Satelliten-Instrument \\"Terra’s Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere\\" (MOPITT) erstellte die erste globale Karte für die CO-Konzentration in der niedrigeren Erdatmosphäre. Die MOPITT-Abbildung anbei zeigt die durchschnittliche CO-Konzentration von April, Mai und Juni für die Jahre 2000 bis 2004.', 'Kohlenstoffmonoxid hat eine mittlere atmosphärische Lebensdauer von etwa zwei Monaten. Die wichtigste Reaktion ist die mit Hydroxyl-Radikalen in der Atmosphäre, wodurch jährlich 2300 Mt (2000–2800 Mt) Kohlenstoffmonoxid zu Kohlenstoffdioxid oxidiert werden. Böden tragen zur CO-Oxidation mit etwa 300 Mt (200–600 Mt) jährlich bei. Die Oxidationsgeschwindigkeit hängt von der Konzentration der Hydroxyl-Radikale ab, die mit stärkerer Sonneneinstrahlung und höherem Wasserdampfgehalt zunimmt. In den Tropen beträgt die Lebensdauer etwa einen Monat, in gemäßigten und nördlichen Breiten bewegt sie sich zwischen zwei Monaten im Sommer und mehr als einem Jahr im Winter. Für den Ausgleich der Kohlenstoffmonoxidkonzentrationen zwischen Nord- und Südhalbkugel wäre eine mittlere atmosphärische Lebensdauer von ungefähr einem Jahr erforderlich. Die höheren anthropogenen Emissionen auf der Nordhalbkugel führen daher zu einem deutlichen Konzentrationsunterschied zwischen den Hemisphären. Durch Wettereinflüsse wie den indischen Monsun und durch Emissionen von Ballungszentren gibt es regional, etwa in Ostasien, erhebliche Konzentrationsunterschiede.', 'Weltweit gelangen jährlich etwa 2500 Megatonnen (2000–2900 Mt) Kohlenstoffmonoxid in die Atmosphäre oder werden dort gebildet. Etwa die Hälfte davon entsteht bei der unvollständigen Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe oder von Biomasse, auch bei Wald- und Buschbränden. Ein weiterer großer Anteil wird erst in der Atmosphäre durch die Oxidation von Kohlenwasserstoffen wie Methan oder anderen flüchtigen organischen Verbindungen gebildet. Insgesamt sind etwa 60 % des Kohlenstoffmonoxids vom Menschen verursacht, der Rest ist natürlichen Ursprungs.', 'Angaben zu den globalen Emissionsraten beruhen auf Schätzungen und sind mit Unsicherheitsfaktoren behaftet. So werden die Kohlenstoffmonoxid-Emissionen aus dem Verkehr mit 500 Mt (300–600 Mt) angegeben, stationäre Anlagen zur Energiegewinnung aus fossilen Brennstoffen emittieren 100 Mt (80–200 Mt), die Biomasseverbrennung 600 Mt (300–800 Mt). Durch die Oxidation von Methan entstehen 600 Mt (400–800 Mt), beim Abbau anderer flüchtiger organischer Verbindungen 500 Mt (300–700 Mt). Weitere biogene Quellen setzen etwa 200 Mt (100–400 Mt), Böden etwa 30 Mt und die Ozeane etwa 10 Mt jährlich frei.', 'Böden können sowohl Quellen als auch Senken für Kohlenstoffmonoxid sein. In Trockengebieten geben Böden Kohlenstoffmonoxid ab, vermutlich durch die abiotische Zersetzung organischer Substanz unter dem Einfluss von Licht und hohen Temperaturen. Außerhalb der Trockengebiete überwiegt der Abbau durch Prokaryoten, abhängig vom Sauerstoff- und Wassergehalt des Bodens entweder durch Reduktion zu Methan (Methanbildner) oder durch die Oxidation zu Kohlendioxid.', 'Ozeane sind in Bezug auf Kohlenstoffmonoxid übersättigt. Im Atlantischen Ozean beträgt die Konzentration etwa das zehn- bis vierzigfache der atmosphärischen Gleichgewichtskonzentration, wobei biologische Quellen als Verursacher angenommen werden. Die Ozeane stellen demnach eine Quelle atmosphärischen Kohlenstoffmonoxids dar, deren Anteil auf 5 bis 29 % der durch Verbrennung freigesetzten Menge geschätzt wird.', 'In den Gasen hawaiianischer Vulkane wurde eine Konzentration von 3700 ppm (parts per million) Kohlenstoffmonoxid gemessen. Für die globale Bilanz spielen Vulkane keine Rolle.', 'Die Hauptinfrarotabsorptionsbande des Kohlenstoffmonoxids liegt bei einer Wellenzahl von 2143 cm−1 (Wellenlänge etwa 4,67 µm) und damit weit vom spektralen Maximum der Infrarotstrahlung der Erde, die bei einer Wellenzahl von ungefähr 1000 cm−1 (10 µm) liegt, entfernt. Kohlenstoffmonoxid trägt daher durch direkte Absorption nur wenig zum Treibhauseffekt bei. In der Troposphäre erfolgt die Oxidation von Kohlenwasserstoffen wie Methan zu Kohlenstoffdioxid ebenfalls über Hydroxyl-Radikale. Als Zwischenprodukt entsteht bei der Methanoxidation ebenfalls Kohlenstoffmonoxid. Der Effekt des Kohlenstoffmonoxids bezüglich des Treibhauseffekts liegt in seiner Bedeutung als Senke für diese Hydroxyl-Radikale, die dadurch der Umwandlung von direkten Treibhausgasen wie Methan nicht mehr zur Verfügung stehen. Auch Methanol, nach Methan das zweithäufigste organische Gas in der Erdatmosphäre, das in Konzentrationen von 0,1 bis 10 ppbv vorkommt, ist eine bedeutende atmosphärische Quelle für Kohlenstoffmonoxid, wobei ein Großteil des Methanols von Pflanzen emittiert wird.', 'In städtischen Umgebungen können durch unbehandelte Autoabgase die Werte zwischen 100 und 200 ppm liegen. Die Konzentration von Kohlenstoffmonoxid im unverdünnten Abgas eines Automobils ohne Abgaskatalysator beträgt etwa 7000 ppm. Bei Fahrzeugen mit Drei-Wege-Katalysator und richtig eingestellter Lambdasondenregelung dient Kohlenstoffmonoxid im Idealfall zur Reduktion der Stickoxide, wobei es selbst zu Kohlenstoffdioxid oxidiert wird.

Er entwickelte darüber hinaus weitreichende Ideen für ein freies gemeinsames Europa in der Zukunft. Trott gehörte zum Kern der Widerstandsgruppe Kreisauer Kreis um Helmuth James Graf von Moltke und Peter Graf Yorck von Wartenburg. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg war er an der Verschwörung vom 20. Juli 1944 beteiligt.', 'Familie und Herkunft.', 'Adam von Trott zu Solz entstammte einer Familie des hessischen Uradels, die urkundlich nachweisbar seit 1253 im heutigen Landkreis Hersfeld-Rotenburg ansässig ist. Stammsitze der Familie sind die Dörfer Solz und Imshausen, heute zur Stadt Bebra gehörend.', 'Über Generationen sind Mitglieder der Familie von Trott zu Solz im Landes- oder Staatsdienst hervorgetreten. Auch der Vater Adams, August von Trott zu Solz, trat nach seiner juristischen Ausbildung in den Staatsdienst ein, da er sich – ebenso wie später sein Sohn – ausdrücklich dem Gemeinwohl verpflichtet sah. 1905 stieg August von Trott vom Regierungspräsidenten in Kassel zum Oberpräsidenten der preußischen Provinz Brandenburg in Potsdam auf. 1909 wurde August von Trott zu Solz zum preußischen Kultusminister im Kabinett von Reichskanzler Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg berufen. Dieses Amt hatte er bis 1917 inne. Bis 1919 übte er das Amt des Oberpräsidenten in Kassel aus.', 'Adam von Trotts Mutter war Eleonore von Trott zu Solz, geb. von Schweinitz (1875–1948). Ihr Vater, General Hans Lothar von Schweinitz, war Botschafter in Wien und St. Petersburg. Ihre Mutter, die Amerikanerin Anna Jay, war eine direkte Nachfahrin von John Jay, einem der Gründerväter der Vereinigten Staaten. US-Präsident George Washington ernannte Jay zum ersten Vorsitzenden des Supreme Court. Die angelsächsische Prägung Eleonore von Trotts zeigte sich vor allem in der Art ihres sozialen und ökumenischen Engagements.', 'Kindheit und Jugend (1909–1927).', 'Adam von Trott zu Solz wurde 1909 als fünftes von acht Kindern in Potsdam geboren. Da sein Vater kurz vor seiner Geburt preußischer Kultusminister geworden war, zog die Familie bald darauf nach Berlin um. Dort verbrachte Adam von Trott seine ersten acht Lebensjahre. Seit 1915 besuchte er die Vorschule des Königlichen Französischen Gymnasiums am Berliner Reichstagsufer 6. Seine weitere Schulzeit wurde von mehreren Wechseln bestimmt: Nach der Übersiedlung der Familie nach Kassel kam Trott auf das dortige Wilhelms-Gymnasium. Als seine Eltern im Sommer 1919 nach dem Eintritt des Vaters in den Ruhestand ihren Wohnsitz nach Imshausen verlegten, wurde er zunächst zwei Jahre lang privat unterrichtet und besuchte dann das Friedrichsgymnasium in Kassel.', 'Da es zwischen ihm und seinen Pensionseltern an einem Vertrauensverhältnis fehlte, gaben ihn seine Eltern zu Beginn des darauf folgenden Schuljahres im April 1922 nach Hannoversch Münden. Bis zum Abitur besuchte Adam von Trott dort das Städtische Gymnasium und wohnte im Alumnat des Klosters Loccum. Während dieser Zeit begann er, Kunst, Musik und besonders die Literatur für sich zu entdecken. Seiner Begeisterung für sportliche Aktivitäten setzte damals wie später eine Herzschwäche Grenzen.', 'Zeitweilig schloss er sich einer Splittergruppe der Jugendbewegung, den \\"Nibelungen, dem Bund für Jungwandern\\" an, trat jedoch Ende 1924 wieder aus, weil der Bund ihn inhaltlich nicht überzeugte.', 'Studentenzeit und erste Auslandserfahrungen (1927–1931).', 'Mit 17 Jahren legte Adam von Trott im Frühjahr 1927 das Abitur ab. In Fortsetzung der Familientradition entschied er sich für das Studium der Rechtswissenschaften. Nach einem ersten Semester an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München wechselte er für die nächsten drei Semester an die Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. Dort wurde er auf Wunsch seines Vaters Mitglied des \\"Corps Saxonia\\", zu dem er jedoch nach einem guten Jahr auf Distanz ging.', 'Als Einschnitt erwies sich für den 19-jährigen Trott ein mehrwöchiger privater Aufenthalt im Herbst 1928 in Genf. Hier wurde sein Interesse für Politik geweckt. Als Sitz des Völkerbunds und zahlreicher anderer internationaler Organisationen war Genf ein Zentrum für Veranstaltungen internationaler Politik jeglicher Art. Die Möglichkeiten internationaler Zusammenarbeit und weltweiter Bemühungen um Frieden, die Trott hier beobachtete, bestimmten seine politischen Ziele. Ein erster Aufenthalt in England und damit der Beginn seiner großen Zuneigung zu diesem Land folgte Anfang 1929. Nach Stationen in Liverpool und London verbrachte Adam von Trott ein Trimester als Gaststudent am Mansfield College in Oxford. Er war beeindruckt vom politischen Realitätssinn der Engländer und fand in der britischen Labour-Bewegung ein wichtiges Vorbild.', 'Nach seiner Rückkehr setzte Trott sein Jurastudium in Berlin an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität fort. Daneben suchte er gezielt Kontakte zu Arbeitern und nahm an Diskussionen sozialistischer Zirkel teil. Ihn beunruhigten die soziale Not, die wachsende Arbeitslosigkeit und andere negative Auswirkungen der Weltwirtschaftskrise. Um sich besser auf sein Examen vorbereiten zu können, kehrte Trott zum Sommersemester 1930 nach Göttingen zurück. Besorgt verfolgte er weiterhin die politische Radikalisierung, vor allem das Erstarken der Nationalsozialisten. Bei den Reichstagswahlen im September 1930 wählte er, soeben wahlberechtigt geworden, die SPD. Er teilte ihre Grundsätze und erhoffte sich am ehesten von ihr eine Stabilisierung der Weimarer Republik.', 'Im Dezember 1930 bestand Adam von Trott sein juristisches Referendarexamen und promovierte ein halbes Jahr später mit einer Dissertation über \\"Hegels Staatsphilosophie und das internationale Recht\\" an der Universität Göttingen. Direkt danach trat er seinen Referendardienst am Amtsgericht in Nentershausen nahe Bebra an, unterbrach diesen jedoch im Oktober 1931, da er für ein zweijähriges Zusatzstudium in England beurlaubt worden war.', 'Als Rhodes-Stipendiat in Oxford (1931–1933).', 'Noch während seiner Examenszeit hatte sich Trott erfolgreich um ein Rhodes-Stipendium für einen Studienaufenthalt in Oxford beworben. Zur Begründung gab er an, seine „politische Kenntnis weiter ausbilden“ und mehr über die Entstehung der Labour Party aus der Gewerkschaftsbewegung und ihre Integration in das britische Staatsleben erfahren zu wollen.', 'Ab Oktober 1931 studierte Trott in Oxford am Balliol College, das als Politikerschmiede galt, die so genannten \\"Modern Greats\\", eine festgelegte Kombination aus den Fächern Philosophie, Politik und Volkswirtschaft. Diesen Studienzyklus, den er bereits nach zwei (statt wie gewöhnlich nach drei) Jahren mit dem Bachelor-of-Arts-Examen abschloss, hat Adam von Trott als sehr gewinnbringend beurteilt: Neben der Vermittlung politischer Allgemeinbildung würden hier Urteils- und Kritikfähigkeit sowie der praktische Sinn für Politik gefördert. Trott war in Oxford Mitglied mehrerer Clubs und Gesellschaften, unter anderem der Oxford Union Society, berühmt für ihre parlamentarische Debattenkultur, des international ausgerichteten Bryce Clubs, der philosophischen Jowett Society, die ihn sogar zu ihrem Präsidenten wählte, sowie – seinem besonderen Interesse entsprechend – des University Labour Clubs. Daneben unterhielt er Kontakte zu Dozenten und Studenten verschiedener Colleges, aus denen sich auch eine Reihe von Freundschaften entwickelten. Großen Eindruck machte auf ihn Mahatma Gandhi, den Trott gleich zu Beginn seiner Oxforder Zeit auf einer Diskussionsveranstaltung erlebte. In London lernte Adam von Trott in Harold Laski und Richard Henry Tawney zwei namhafte Denker der Labour-Bewegung kennen und mit Sir Stafford Cripps einen aufstrebenden Labour-Politiker, der in den folgenden Jahren sein Freund und politischer Mentor wurde.', 'Ungeachtet seines Studiums im Ausland blieb Trott ein Beobachter der krisenhaften politischen Verhältnisse in Deutschland. Im Spätsommer 1932 beteiligte er sich selbst in Berlin an sozialistischen Arbeitskreisen, die nach Wegen suchten, die Nationalsozialisten zurückzudrängen. Im Kreis der \\"Neuen Blätter für den Sozialismus\\" begegnete er dem dabei besonders engagierten SPD-Reichstagsabgeordneten Carlo Mierendorff. Zurückgekehrt nach England, bemühte sich Trott um Kontakte zwischen diesem Kreis und Vertretern der britischen Labour Party und warb auch öffentlich für die deutschen Sozialdemokraten.', 'Von der Ernennung Adolf Hitlers zum Reichskanzler erfuhr Adam von Trott in Oxford aus einer Abendzeitung. Seinem Freund Charles Collins zufolge habe er sofort das „schreckliche Desaster“ erkannt, das Deutschland nun befallen habe, und auch, dass sich seine eigenen Zukunftsaussichten „fundamental verändert“ hätten. Eine offene Opposition, so Collins, habe Trott für eine längere Zeit als unrealistisch betrachtet, es aber für notwendig gehalten, Regimegegner zu versammeln.', 'Referendarzeit (1933–1936).', 'Nach seinem Examen in Oxford setzte Trott ab Herbst 1933 seine juristische Referendarausbildung im politisch völlig veränderten Deutschland am Amtsgericht Rotenburg an der Fulda, am Landgericht Hanau und bei der Staatsanwaltschaft in Kassel fort. Für das obligatorische Anwaltspraktikum, das er in der Zeit zwischen Dezember 1934 und April 1935 absolvierte, wählte er eine von jüdischen Anwälten geführte Kanzlei in Berlin. Es folgten weitere Referendarstationen am Kasseler Großen Amtsgericht, in der Verwaltung einer Hamburger Reederei und am Oberlandesgericht Kassel. Zwei Monate musste er auch an einem von den Nationalsozialisten zu politisch-ideologischem und militärischem Drill eingeführten Referendarlager bei Jüterbog teilnehmen.', 'Trotz erheblichen Drucks verweigerte Trott die Anpassung an das neue Regime. Formulare, mit denen er sich zum Beitritt in den Berufsverband \\"Bund Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Juristen\\" und in die NSDAP verpflichten sollte, schickte er unausgefüllt zurück. Wegen seiner ablehnenden Einstellung zum Regime, die auch in einem Schulungszeugnis zur Sprache kam, wurde Adam von Trott nicht als Regierungsreferendar übernommen, und seine Zulassung zum Assessorexamen war lange Zeit gefährdet.', 'Ein Artikel im Manchester Guardian über antisemitische Verfolgung unter anderem in deutschen Gerichten bewog Trott im Februar 1934, in einem Leserbrief seine eigenen Gerichtserfahrungen anz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Das Neue Testament überliefert jedoch nur wenige als zuverlässig geltende biografische Details über ihn. Spätere Notizen werden vielfach als legendarisch angesehen. Ein Aufenthalt Petri in Rom wird in der Bibel nicht erwähnt.', 'Die römisch-katholische Kirche führt den Primatsanspruch des Papsttums über die Gesamtkirche auf die Tradition zurück, Petrus sei der erste Bischof von Rom gewesen und Christus habe Petrus und dieser den folgenden Bischöfen von Rom einen Vorrang als Leiter, Lehrer und Richter aller Christen gegeben. Die Päpste werden daher auch als „Nachfolger Petri“ bezeichnet. Die übrigen Kirchen lehnen diesen Anspruch ab. Historisch gab es im 1. Jahrhundert noch keinen Monepiskopat, das heißt, die christliche Gemeinde wurde nicht von einem einzelnen römischen Bischof geleitet. Dennoch gilt Petrus auch für die altorientalischen, orthodoxen, altkatholischen sowie die anglikanischen Kirchen als erster Bischof von Rom und als Heiliger.

Es handelt sich um die griechische Form des biblischen Namens Simeon (hebräisch \\"Schim’on\\"), dem Tanach zufolge einer der Söhne Jakobs und Stammvater eines der zwölf Stämme Israels. Patriarchennamen waren unter palästinischen Juden dieser Zeit besonders beliebt und wurden häufig auch in der griechischen Übersetzung verwendet. Da auch Simons Bruder Andreas einen griechischen Namen trägt, scheint diese Namensform die ursprünglichere zu sein. und nennen ihn \\"Symeon\\", eine Gräzisierung der hebräischen Namensform.', 'In nennt Jesus seinen Jünger mit Vatersnamen \\"Simon Barjona\\" („Simon, Sohn des Jona“). Zu möglichen politischen Konnotationen dieser Anrede und zu der Frage, ob der Vater der beiden Apostel Jona oder, wie es an anderer Stelle im Neuen Testament heißt, Johannes (hebräisch \\"Jochanan\\") geheißen haben kann, gibt es verschiedene Theorien (siehe unten, Abschnitt „Herkunft und Berufung“).', 'Paulus von Tarsus nennt den Apostel meist \\"Kephas\\" (Κηφᾶς), eine gräzisierte Form des auch in den Evangelien überlieferten Beinamens \\"Kefa\\" (Kēp’, in hebräischen Buchstaben כיפא), ein aramäisches Wort, das als Eigenname kaum belegt ist und eigentlich „Stein“ bedeutet. übersetzt den Namen zweimal ins Griechische zu Πέτρος \\"(Pétros)\\", was ebenfalls „Stein“ bedeutet und mit dem griechischen Wort für „Fels“ (πέτρα) verwandt ist. Im Hebräischen hat das Wort \\"kēp\\" (כֵּף) ebenfalls die Grundbedeutung „Fels“ oder „Stein“. Sowohl das semitische als auch das griechische Wort bezeichnen einen gewöhnlichen Naturstein (Wurfstein, Bruchstein, Kieselstein), im Hebräischen auch einen Felsen (zum Beispiel ), im Aramäischen kann (seltener) ebenfalls ein Felsen, Felsbrocken oder eine Felsenspitze gemeint sein.', 'Jesus selbst soll Simon den Beinamen \\"Kefa\\" verliehen haben; wo und wann, überliefern die Evangelien unterschiedlich. Einige Exegeten nahmen an, Simon habe den Beinamen erst als Apostel der Urgemeinde angenommen, und dies sei nachträglich auf Jesus zurückgeführt worden (vgl. Joh 1,42). Die meisten Forscher (darunter Peter Dschulnigg, Joachim Gnilka, Martin Hengel, John P. Meier, Rudolf Pesch) gehen jedoch davon aus, dass Simon diesen Beinamen bereits im ersten Jüngerkreis trug, da \\"Kephas\\" in einigen der ältesten NT-Schriften als eigentlicher Name oder von Anfang an verwendeter Beiname (; Mt 4,18; 10,2) des Apostels erwähnt ist. Auch wird zumeist angenommen, dass ihm der Beiname tatsächlich von Jesus gegeben wurde. John P. Meier weist darauf hin, dass die Evangelien eine Nennung des Namens \\"Petrus\\" oder \\"Kephas\\" im Munde Jesu an vielen Stellen auffällig vermeiden; er hält es für denkbar, dass dieser Name für den Gebrauch im Verhältnis unter den Jüngern, aber nicht im Verhältnis zu Jesus bestimmt war.', 'Vermutet wurde auch, der ursprüngliche Sinn des Namens erschließe sich aus der angenommenen Wortbedeutung „Edelstein“ im Aramäischen, was die besondere Rolle Simons als Wortführer der Erstberufenen hervorheben könnte. Die Sinnverschiebung zu „Fels“ als Fundament der Kirche sei dann als nachösterliche Umdeutung zu verstehen. Die im Anschluss an Rudolf Pesch vermutete Übersetzung von \\"kefa\\" als „Schmuckstein“ oder „Edelstein“ zur (auszeichnenden) Benennung einer Person ist vom Aramäischen her jedoch nicht hinreichend zu belegen, da der Gebrauch der aramäischen Wurzel \\"kp\\" als Personenname nicht nachgewiesen ist und überhaupt kaum Beispiele einer Verwendung des Wortes in der Bedeutung „Edelstein“ bekannt sind, in denen dieses Verständnis nicht durch Zusammensetzungen, attributive Zusätze (etwa „guter Stein“ im Sinne von „edel“ oder „wertvoll“) oder einen eindeutigen Kontext nahegelegt würde.', 'Der protestantische Heidelberger Judaist und Talmud-Übersetzer Reinhold Mayer (1926–2016) vermutete, der Namensgebung durch Jesus liege neben dem Gedanken an den Grundstein des Jerusalemer Tempels eine ironische Anspielung auf den ungewöhnlichen Namen des zu seiner Zeit amtierenden Hohenpriesters Kajaphas (קיפא) zugrunde. Die in griechischer Umschrift verschieden vokalisierten Namen \\"Kaiphas\\" und \\"Kephas\\" unterscheiden sich in hebräischer Schrift nur in den anlautenden Konsonanten (Koph bei \\"Qajfa\\" statt Kaph bei \\"Kefa\\"), die sehr ähnlich klingen. Damit wohne dem Namen ein (möglicherweise durchaus ernst gemeinter) Anspruch auf die Ablösung des Hohenpriesters durch den Führer der Zwölfergruppe um Jesus inne, der selbst im Rahmen seines Messianismus den Königstitel für sich beanspruchte. Der erst durch die Jerusalemer Inschriftenfunde von 1990, mit denen der Name des Hohepriesters erstmals in hebräischen Schriftzeichen belegbar wurde, ins Bewusstsein der Forschung getretene „verblüffende Gleichklang des Beinamens des Simon mit dem des höchsten Amtsinhabers am Jerusalemer Tempel“ wirft auch für den katholischen Exegeten Martin Ebner ein neues Licht auf den viel umrätselten Beinamen des Simon Petrus. Falls Absicht dahinterstecke, hätte „Jesus mit dieser delikaten Spitznamenwahl eine symbolische Enteignung vorgenommen“.', 'Ähnlich wie \\"Jesus Christus\\" wurde auch \\"Simon Petrus\\" spätestens mit der lateinischen Bibelübersetzung Vulgata (um 385) zum Eigennamen.', 'Herkunft und Berufung.', 'Simon stammte wie Jesus aus Galiläa und war nach Aussage des Markusevangeliums an seiner Sprache als Galiläer erkennbar (Mk 14,70 par.).

Darin sahen manche Ausleger Hinweise auf eine mögliche frühere Zugehörigkeit Simons zu den Zeloten, da im späteren Talmud jüdische Freiheitskämpfer als \\"barjonim\\" (Plural) bezeichnet wurden.', 'Simon hatte einen Bruder namens Andreas, der wohl jünger als Simon war, da alle Apostellisten diesen zuerst nennen.

Nach einem Abschluss am \\"Kenyon College\\" brach er eine Anwaltslehre ab, um an der Harvard University Rechtswissenschaften zu studieren. Im Jahr 1845 erhielt er seine Zulassung als Anwalt und eröffnete eine Kanzlei in Marietta, die er einige Jahre später nach Cincinnati verlegte. 1852 heiratete er Lucy Ware Webb, eine überzeugte Abolitionistin.', 'Nach politischen Anfängen in der Whig Party wechselte er Mitte der 1850er Jahre zu den Republikanern und unterstützte bei der Präsidentschaftswahl 1860 Abraham Lincoln. Während des Amerikanischen Bürgerkriegs diente er in der Armee der Nordstaaten und stieg bis zum Generalmajor auf. Einer seiner Offiziere im 23. Ohio-Infanterieregiment war der spätere Präsident William McKinley. Nach zwei Jahren als Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus wurde er im Januar 1868 Gouverneur des Bundesstaats Ohio. Mit einer Unterbrechung von drei Jahren hatte er dieses Amt bis zu seiner Amtseinführung als Präsident inne.', '1876 nominierte ihn die Republican National Convention zu ihrem Kandidaten für die Präsidentschaftswahl 1876. Hayes gewann die Mehrheit der Wahlmänner-, sein Gegenkandidat Samuel J. Tilden jedoch die der Wählerstimmen. Es war der erste derart umstrittene Wahlausgang in der Geschichte der Vereinigten Staaten. Zur Klärung des Endresultats setzte der Kongress eine Kommission ein. Die Kernfrage war, inwieweit Afroamerikaner in den Südstaaten an der Stimmabgabe gehindert worden waren. Der Konflikt wurde zwar durch den bis heute umstrittenen Kompromiss von 1877 gelöst, Teile der Opposition warfen Hayes aber bis zum Ende seiner Präsidentschaft fehlende Legitimität vor.', 'Der Kompromiss sah vor, dass die Demokratische Partei Hayes' Präsidentschaft anerkannte, die Republikaner dafür aber dem von den Demokraten dominierten \\"Solid South\\" Zugeständnisse machten. Infolgedessen wurde die Militärbesatzung der letzten Südstaaten und damit auch die Politik der Reconstruction nach dem Bürgerkrieg beendet. Dies ebnete den Jim-Crow-Gesetzen den Weg, die den 14. und den 15. Zusatzartikel aushebelten, die Rassentrennung etablierten und in der Folge den Schwarzen fast ein Jahrhundert lang die vollen Bürgerrechte verwehrten. ', 'Als der Große Eisenbahnstreik von 1877 in Gewalt ausartete, entsandte Hayes die United States Army zur Wiederherstellung der Ordnung. Er initiierte eine Verwaltungsreform, um die Macht der Parteimaschinerie über die staatlichen Behörden zu brechen, womit er sich einflussreiche Republikaner vor allem in New York zu Gegnern machte. Außenpolitisch schlichtete er einen Grenzdisput zwischen Argentinien und Paraguay, der wenige Jahre nach dem Tripel-Allianz-Krieg wieder aufgeflammt war. Er strebte keine zweite Amtszeit an und setzte sich nach seiner Präsidentschaft in seiner Residenz Spiegel Grove zur Ruhe, die sich heute auf dem Gelände des \\"Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Centers\\" befindet.', 'Leben.', 'Erziehung und Ausbildung.', 'Rutherford B. Hayes kam im Oktober 1822 als Halbwaise zur Welt, weil sein Vater, der aus Vermont stammende Rutherford Hayes, Jr., drei Monate zuvor an Typhus gestorben war. Die Hayes’ waren eine presbyterianische Familie, die 1625 aus Schottland nach Connecticut ausgewandert war. Die Mehrzahl der väterlichen Vorfahren des späteren Präsidenten hatten jedoch englische Wurzeln, wie er später selbst durch Ahnenforschung herausfand. Rutherford Hayes, Jr führte bis 1817 gemeinsam mit seinem Schwager, dem späteren Kongressabgeordneten John Noyes, einen Laden in Dummerston, bevor er mit seiner Familie nach Delaware, Ohio umzog. Hier betätigte er sich als Farmer, Händler und trotz seines presbyterianischen Glaubens als Investor in eine Brennerei. Hayes’ Mutter, Sophia Birchard, stammte wie der Vater aus Neuengland und heiratete Rutherford Hayes, Jr. im September 1813. Ihre Vorfahren väterlicherseits waren im Jahr 1634 aus England in die Dreizehn Kolonien migriert. Nach dem Tod ihres Mannes erbte sie etwas Land nahe Delaware und ein noch nicht fertig gestelltes Haus in der Ortschaft, dessen Bau erst sechs Jahre später abgeschlossen wurde. Der spätere Präsident wurde nach seinen Eltern benannt, also \\"Rutherford Birchard\\" Hayes. Hayes hatte eine ältere Schwester und einen älteren Bruder, der 1825 ertrank. Im Haushalt lebten ferner eine Kusine der Mutter und ihr jüngerer Bruder, der Geschäftsmann und Bankier Sardis Birchard. Dieser wurde zu einer Vaterfigur von Hayes, kümmerte sich um dessen Ausbildung und unterstützte ihn finanziell, auch nachdem er 1827 nach Fremont gezogen war. Das Haupteinkommen der Familie bildeten die Pachteinnahmen aus dem bewirtschafteten Landbesitz.', 'Hayes, der als Kind so krankheitsanfällig war, dass sein Überleben anfangs nicht sicher war, besuchte zuerst eine Schule in Delaware. 1834 unternahm er mit der Mutter eine Reise zu Verwandten in Vermont, Massachusetts und New Hampshire, was seine lebenslange Reiselust weckte. Ab 1836 besuchte er auf Vorschlag von Birchard eine methodistische Schule in Norwalk und im folgenden Jahr, gleichfalls auf Anraten seines Onkels, die \\"Isaac Webb School\\" in Middletown, Connecticut. Obwohl ihn Webb noch zu jung für das College hielt, ging Hayes ab dem Jahr 1838 auf das \\"Kenyon College\\" in Gambier. Ausschlaggebend dafür war der Wunsch der Mutter, ihn wieder in ihrer Nähe zu haben. Hier schloss er erste politisch bedeutsame Freundschaften mit Stanley Matthews, Rowland E. Trowbridge, Christopher Wolcott und insbesondere Guy M. Bryan. Ab Juni 1841 führte er bis zu seinem Lebensende regelmäßig Tagebuch. Auf dem College engagierte sich Hayes in den Bereichen Literatur und Theater, wovon seine rednerischen Fähigkeiten enorm profitierten. In seinem Abschlussjahrgang war er daher im August 1842 einer der Abschiedsredner.', 'Nach dem Collegestudium begann er mit der Anwaltslehre in der Kanzlei von Sparrow &amp; Matthews in Columbus. Hier beschäftigte er sich neben der juristischen Fachliteratur mit dem Erlernen der deutschen Sprache. Auf Drängen seines Onkels und selbst angezogen von renommierten Professoren wie Joseph Story, die an der Harvard University unterrichteten, begann er dort im August 1843 ein reguläres Studium der Rechtswissenschaften. Hier übten neben den Vorlesungen Storys diejenigen von Simon Greenleaf am meisten Einfluss auf ihn aus. Beide setzten \\"Moot Courts\\" im Unterricht ein, was Hayes als Rollenmodell für seine spätere Rechtspraxis diente. Er setzte in Harvard außerdem das Deutschstudium fort und besuchte auf dem Campus Gastvorträge von Berühmtheiten wie John Quincy Adams, George Bancroft, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow und Daniel Webster. Nach drei Semestern machte er im Februar 1845 sein juristisches Examen und bestand am 10. März die Zulassungsprüfung zum Anwalt in Marietta. Kurz darauf zog er nach Fremont, weil er hier Verwandtschaft hatte und dem Rat Greenleafs folgte, als Berufsanfänger nicht in einer großen Stadt zu praktizieren. Nach gut einem Jahr selbständiger Anwaltstätigkeit eröffnete Hayes am 1. April 1846 mit Ralph P. Buckland eine Gemeinschaftskanzlei.', 'Anwaltstätigkeit und Heirat.', 'Schon bald vertrat Hayes den Bundesstaat Ohio in einer Rechtssache, bei der es um die Schulden eines Sheriffs ging. Im Frühjahr 1847 erkrankte Hayes an Tuberkulose und spielte für einige Zeit mit dem Gedanken, sich als Freiwilliger bei der United States Army für den Mexikanisch-Amerikanischen Krieg zu melden und dort von dem besseren Klima zu profitieren, obwohl er den Krieg als ungerecht erachtete. Auf Anraten seiner Ärzte entschied er sich jedoch für einen mehrmonatigen Erholungsurlaub in Neuengland. Nachdem er seine Anwaltstätigkeit wieder aufgenommen hatte, besuchte er von Dezember 1848 bis März 1849 seinen Freund Bryan auf seiner Zuckerplantage am Brazos River in Texas. Hier kam er erstmals mit der Institution der Sklaverei in enge Berührung. Als er von seinem Freund George Hoadly noch vor dem Aufbruch nach Texas vom Boom in Cincinnati hörte, hatte er den Entschluss gefasst, dorthin zu ziehen. Wegen einer Cholera-Epidemie um mehrere Monate verzögert, verwirklichte er dies Vorhaben erst im Dezember 1849 und eröffnete im Januar 1850 eine neue Anwaltskanzlei. Später gründete er mit William Rogers und Richard Corwine eine Sozietät.', 'Die ersten Jahre in Cincinnati gestalteten sich schwierig; er konnte sich keinen eigenen Hausstand leisten und zog nach der Hochzeit Anfang 1853 zu seinen Schwiegereltern. Erst im folgenden Jahr verfügte er über genügend Einkommen, um ein eigenes Haus zu kaufen. Hayes trat einem Literaturclub bei, wo er seine rednerischen Fähigkeiten weiter ausbauen konnte und im Mai 1850 an einer Lesung Ralph Waldo Emersons teilnahm. Anfangs skeptisch entwickelte er später eine tiefe Verehrung für diesen Dichter. Weitere Gastredner, die einen nachhaltigen Eindruck auf ihn machten, waren Theodore Parker, Henry Ward Beecher und Edward Everett. Außerdem wurde er zu dieser Zeit Mitglied einer Loge des Independent Order of Odd Fellows.', 'Bald vertrat er zwei Mordfälle vor Gericht, wodurch er sich die Anerkennung des Richters verschaffte und der Öffentlichkeit bekannt wurde. Einer der Prozesse endete in einem Todesurteil gegen die psychisch labile Nancy Farrer, das er vor den \\"Supreme Court\\" von Ohio brachte, wo die Todesstrafe im Dezember 1854 in eine Einweisung in eine Nervenklinik abgeändert wurde. Im anderen Fall erreichte er vor dem \\"Supreme Court\\", dass die Jury kein einstimmiges Urteil fällte. Der Angeklagte James Summons wurde 1857 von Gouverneur Salmon P. Chase zu einer lebenslangen Freiheitsstrafe begnadigt. Außerdem vertrat Hayes seinen Onkel Birchard in mehreren Landstreitigkeiten, von denen eine bis zum Obersten Gerichtshof der Vereinigten Staaten ging. Im Dezember 1853 bot ihm der Anwalt Richard M. Corwine die Partnerschaft in seiner Kanzlei an. Mit seinem Freund William K. Rogers nahm er die Offerte an, so dass noch im gleichen Jahr die Kanzlei Corwine, Hayes &amp; Rogers gestartet werden konnte. Das Unternehmen stellte sich als erfolgreich heraus.', 'Im Jahr 1846 hatte der bis dahin in Liebesdingen gehemmte Hayes Fanny Perkins kennengelernt und ihr den Hof gemacht. Perkins kam aus einer alteingesessenen neuenglischen Familie in Norwich, Connecticut. Am Ende scheiterte diese Beziehung im August 1847, weil Perkins’ Mutter ihr nicht den Umzug nach Ohio gestattete.

Er wurde von vornherein als Massenware für Einsteiger konzipiert und als günstiger Lerncomputer beworben. Ursprünglich nur im britischen Versandhandel erhältlich, kam er dort Ende 1981 ebenfalls in den Einzelhandel. Etwa zur selben Zeit begannen auch die Verkäufe in Kontinentaleuropa, Nordamerika und Japan. Innerhalb kürzester Zeit wurden weltweit große Mengen – auch des von Sinclair mittlerweile auf den Markt gebrachten Zubehörs – abgesetzt. Wegen der schlechten Verarbeitung und fehlerhafter Systemsoftware der ersten Produktionsserien wurde anfänglich nahezu jedes vierte Gerät reklamiert, was der weiteren starken Nachfrage jedoch keinen Abbruch tat.', 'Im Zuge des großen Erfolgs wurden sowohl legale als auch nicht autorisierte Nachbauten hergestellt. Der von Timex Corporation in Lizenz für den nordamerikanischen Markt produzierte \\"Timex Sinclair 1000\\" (kurz \\"TS1000\\") konnte weitere große Marktanteile insbesondere in den USA erobern. Dem später erschienenen \\"Timex Sinclair 1500\\" (kurz \\"TS1500\\") war dagegen kein Erfolg beschieden. Die meisten der nicht lizenzierten Produkte erschienen in Südamerika und Asien. Alle Nachbauten mit eingerechnet, wurden bis Produktionsende 1984 weltweit insgesamt etwa zwei Millionen Geräte abgesetzt. Der ZX81 ebnete nach dem ZX80 damit endgültig den Weg für das Zeitalter des Computers als Massenware.', 'Geschichte.', 'Der erste unter Federführung von Clive Sinclair und seinem Unternehmen \\"Science of Cambridge\\" für den englischen Markt entwickelte Computer, der gehäuselose Einplatinencomputer \\"MK 14\\" mit Leuchtdioden-Siebensegmentanzeige, wurde ab Juni 1978 in Großbritannien als Versandware angeboten. Die mit geschätzten 15.000 Stück innerhalb nur kurzer Zeit erreichten hohen Verkaufszahlen ermöglichten weitergehende Entwicklungsaktivitäten. Diese mündeten schließlich in der Herstellung eines preiswerten Kompaktgerätes mit der Bezeichnung \\"ZX80\\". Der ausschließlich auf Kostenminimierung bei Material und Herstellung ausgelegte, dennoch profitable Computer wurde ab Januar 1980 für 99,95 £ als erstes Gerät unterhalb der vermarktungspsychologisch bedeutsamen Grenze von 100 £ in Großbritannien zum Verkauf angeboten. Mit etwa 100.000 innerhalb von 18 Monaten verkauften Exemplaren entwickelte sich der ZX80 rasch zu einem Kassenschlager. Noch vor dessen Markteintritt wurde ab September 1979 bereits an einem Nachfolgemodell, dem ZX81, gearbeitet.', 'Entwicklung und Prototypen.', 'Das zu entwickelnde Gerät sollte noch leistungsfähiger als der ZX80 bei gleichzeitig niedrigerem Verkaufspreis sein. Dazu wurde die erfolgreiche Systemarchitektur des ZX80 übernommen und in neueste Technik zur weiteren Senkung der Material- und Herstellungskosten investiert.', 'Kostenminimierung durch ULA-Spezialbaustein.', 'Von den im ZX80 verbauten kostenintensiven Bauteilen konnten mit Hilfe der noch jungen ULA-Technologie durch das Unternehmen Ferranti Limited die Funktionen von insgesamt 18 integrierten Schaltkreisen auf einem einzigen Spezialbaustein nachgebildet werden. Die damit verbundenen Entwicklungs- und Herstellungskosten relativierten sich bei den von Sinclair angepeilten Stückzahlen rasch und führten in der Summe zur gewünschten Kostenreduktion. Der weiterentwickelte, mit maximal fünf elektronischen Schaltkreisen bestückte Computer konnte daraufhin zu einem Preis von knapp unter 70 £ dennoch profitabel angeboten werden. Daneben erlaubte das Ausschöpfen weiterer zur Verfügung stehender Kapazitäten des Spezialbausteins die Beseitigung technischer Probleme des ZX80. So ermöglichte ein neu implementierter Betriebsmodus die Eliminierung des störenden Bildschirmflackerns.', 'Verbesserung des Sinclair-BASIC.', 'Neben einer Reduktion des Bauteileumfangs sollte gleichzeitig die Bedienbarkeit verbessert und die Leistungsfähigkeit der auch im ZX80 bereits enthaltenen, leicht zu erlernenden Programmiersprache \\"Sinclair-BASIC\\" gesteigert werden. Die dafür verantwortlich zeichnende \\"Nine Tiles Networks Ltd.\\" integrierte daraufhin Gleitkommaroutinen, erweiterte den Befehlsumfang und die Fehlerbehandlung des BASIC-Interpreters, verbesserte die Editieroptionen und behob zahlreiche bekannte Probleme in der Systemsoftware des ZX80. Dem selbstgestellten Anspruch, mit dem ZX81 in die Riege der vollwertigen Computer-Hersteller aufzusteigen, sollte im November 1980 auch nach außen hin durch eine Umbenennung des Unternehmens in \\"Sinclair Computers\\" demonstrativ Rechnung getragen werden.', 'W. H. Smith und BBC.', 'Während der Entwicklungsphase des ZX81 sondierte Sinclair Computers weitere Vermarktungsoptionen, um das Image des reinen Versandhändlers ablegen zu können. Davon sollte die britische Bücherkette W. H. Smith &amp; Son profitieren. Zur Ankurbelung ihrer stagnierenden Geschäfte hatte sie kurz zuvor ein Programm zur Heranführung der Bevölkerung an die Computertechnik aufgelegt. Die dazugehörige neue Wissensabteilung „Computer Know-How“ sollte durch einen gleichzeitig direkt vor Ort käuflich erwerbbaren Computer überzeugender wirken und mehr Interessenten anziehen. Der ZX80 passte aufgrund seiner einfachen Bedienbarkeit und seines geringen Preises ausgezeichnet in dieses Konzept. Die bereits erzielten hohen Verkaufszahlen und damit die große Bekanntheit des Rechners versprachen zudem auch profitable Margen für W. H. Smith &amp; Son. Entsprechende Vertriebsanfragen für den ZX80 an Sinclair folgten. Sinclair setzte daraufhin W. H. Smith &amp; Son von der Neuentwicklung in Kenntnis und empfahl stattdessen, diesen \\"ZX81\\" zu vermarkten. Die Verantwortlichen von W. H. Smith &amp; Son willigten ein, allerdings unter der Bedingung, sich zuvor an einem Prototyp von den versprochenen Qualitäten überzeugen zu können.', 'Als bekannt wurde, dass der britische Fernsehsender BBC für seine geplante neue Sendungsreihe über Heimcomputer ein entsprechendes Gerät auch zum späteren Vertrieb suchte, entwickelte Sinclair Computers auch in diesem Umfeld rege Vermarktungsbemühungen. Eilends wurde Ende 1980 ein erster vorführbarer Prototyp – noch ohne Gehäuse – eigens zur Vorstellung im Dezember 1980 bei der BBC gefertigt. Jedoch folgte man bei der BBC nicht Sinclairs Philosophie eines ausschließlich auf günstigen Anschaffungspreis ausgelegten Massenproduktes. Stattdessen setzte man bei BBC auf vollwertige Technik, Verlässlichkeit, Benutzerfreundlichkeit und leichte Erweiterbarkeit. Damit ging der Zuschlag an das Konkurrenzunternehmen Acorn, die ihren hochwertigeren \\"BBC Micro\\" im Januar 1982 einführte.', 'Während der Verhandlungen mit der BBC wurde von Nine Tiles Networks Ltd. an der Erweiterung der Systemsoftware zur Ansteuerung eines ebenfalls zu entwickelnden Elektro-Erosionsdruckers gearbeitet. Durch die späte Entscheidung von Sinclair zugunsten des Druckers und den damit verursachten Zeitdruck schlichen sich etliche Fehler in die umfangreichere Systemsoftware des ZX81 ein.', 'Überführung in die Produktion.', 'Ende 1980 begann die Überführung des Prototyps zur Serienreife und die Erstellung der auszuliefernden Dokumentation. Nach dem Abschluss der Revisionen von Hard- und Software und den damit feststehenden Abmessungen des Innenlebens ersetzten die Sinclair-Ingenieure im letzten Entwicklungsabschnitt das zu Beschädigungen neigende Gehäuse des ZX80. Das neue pultförmige und in Spritzgusstechnik gefertigte Chassis war kleiner, robuster und dem Zeitgeschmack besser angepasst. Ein Prototyp mit diesem neuen Gehäuse wurde daraufhin im Januar 1981 den Verantwortlichen von W. H. Smith &amp; Son vorgeführt. Beeindruckt von den technischen und wirtschaftlichen Daten wurde man mit Sinclair Computers schnell handelseinig. Teil des Vertrags war dabei ein Exklusivverkaufsrecht des ZX81 für Ladengeschäfte durch W. H. Smith &amp; Son. Beide Vertragspartner sahen damit ihre nahe Zukunft gesichert. Sinclair verstärkte daraufhin seine Forschungstätigkeiten unter anderem zum Nachfolgemodell ZX82 – dem späteren \\"Sinclair ZX Spectrum\\" – und änderte im März 1981 dazu passend seinen Namen in \\"Sinclair Research\\".', 'Die Herstellung des ZX81 übernahm wie bei großen Teilen des ZX80 auch die bis dahin kriselnde schottische Zweigstelle des US-amerikanischen Uhrenherstellers \\"Timex Corporation\\" in Dundee.', 'Vermarktung.', 'Der offizielle Verkaufsstart des ZX81 erfolgte in Großbritannien am 5. März 1981, zunächst – wie bei allen vorherigen Sinclair-Geräten auch – ausschließlich als Versandware. Der Markteintritt wurde durch aggressive und allgegenwärtige Werbeoffensiven begleitet, die großteils auf die Person des Clive Sinclair zugeschnitten waren und ihn als genialen Heilsbringer der Computertechnologie ins rechte Licht zu setzen suchten.

Some of the major abiotic factors that limit the growth and survival of Mesostoma Ehrenbergii are: 1. Temperature: The optimal temperature range for Mesostoma Ehrenbergii is between 15-25°C. Temperatures outside of this range can negatively affect their physiological processes and limit their growth and reproduction. 2. pH: Mesostoma Ehrenbergii prefers neutral to slightly alkaline water with a pH range of 7.2-8.5. Lower or higher pH values can limit their growth and survival. 3. Dissolved Oxygen: As a freshwater organism, Mesostoma Ehrenbergii relies heavily on dissolved oxygen in the water for respiration. Low levels of dissolved oxygen can limit their growth and survival. 4. Water flow: Mesostoma Ehrenbergii is a benthic organism, meaning it lives on the bottom of the water body. Low water flow can lead to the accumulation of sediment, which can limit their access to food and oxygen. Biotic factors that can limit the growth and survival of Mesostoma Ehrenbergii include: 1. Predators: Mesostoma Ehrenbergii is preyed upon by a variety of aquatic predators, including fish, birds, and larger invertebrates. 2. Competition: Other benthic organisms, such as snails and insect larvae, can compete with Mesostoma Ehrenbergii for resources such as food and space. 3.

Die meist auffällig gefärbten, baumbewohnenden Spechte sind klein bis mittelgroß. Ihr Verbreitungsgebiet erstreckt sich vom nördlichen Nordamerika bis ins zentrale Südamerika, wo sie in unterschiedlichen, meist aber eher offenen, baumbestandenen Landschaften vorkommen. Einige Arten sind Endemiten der größeren Karibikinseln. Nur die an den nördlichen Arealgrenzen beheimateten Populationen sind obligate Zugvögel, einige Arten weisen jedoch ein unstetes, wenig ortsgebundenes Verhalten auf und neigen zu irruptiven Wanderungen. Die meisten Arten ernähren sich von verschiedenen baum- oder bodenbewohnenden Insekten sowie von Samen, Früchten und Beeren, nur wenige ernähren sich überwiegend von Früchten und anderen pflanzlichen Nahrungsbestandteilen. Alle sind Höhlenbrüter, die ihre Nachkommen in selbst gebauten Höhlen großziehen, die in toten oder stark geschädigten Bäumen, in Palmen oder Kakteen gebaut werden. Zumindest acht Arten leben in zum Teil stark differenzierten sozialen Verbänden, außerhalb der Brutzeit werden fast alle Arten in Familienverbänden oder kleinen, gelegentlich auch artlich gemischten Gruppen angetroffen. Einige, wie zum Beispiel der Eichelspecht, betreiben eine intensive Vorratshaltung. Zurzeit werden 24 Arten unterschieden, von denen der Rotkopfspecht und der Guadeloupespecht auf der Vorwarnliste der IUCN stehen.', 'Aussehen.', 'Sowohl im Aussehen als auch in der Größe sind die Vertreter dieser Spechtgattung sehr variabel. Die kleinsten Arten, wie etwa der Yucatánspecht erreichen mit 16 Zentimetern gerade Kleinspechtgröße, bei vielen Arten liegt die Körpergröße um die 23 Zentimeter, sie sind also gut buntspechtgroß, und die größte Art, der Bahamaspecht, ist mit 32 Zentimetern etwa so groß wie der heimische Grünspecht.', 'Alle \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten sind vierzehig mit zygodactyler Zehenanordnung.', 'In Bezug auf die Gefiederfärbung lassen sich zwei etwa gleich große Gruppen unterscheiden: Die Vertreter der einen sind auf der Oberseite auffällig schwarz-weiß, oder, wie beim Haitispecht schwarz-gelb, meist leiterartig gebändert, zuweilen aber auch gefleckt oder punktiert. Je nach Gewichtung der Farbelemente erscheint die Oberseite insgesamt eher hell oder dunkel. Gelbtöne können vor allem in den Schulterpartien vorhanden sein. Die Unterseite ist cremefarben, in den Hals- und Brustbereichen oft auch gelblich oder ockerfarben, sie kann weitgehend ungezeichnet oder auffällig dunkel gefleckt oder speerspitzenartig gebändert sein. Braun- und Rosatöne sind in unterschiedlicher Ausprägung vorhanden. Die Gesichtspartie dieser Spechte ist meist weitgehend hell, die Männchen tragen einen deutlichen, leuchtend hellroten Stirn- und Nackenfleck und meist auch einen rötlichen Bartstreif. Diese Merkmale sind bei den Weibchen auf den Nackenbereich reduziert oder fehlen völlig. Bei dem auf der Oberseite meist schwarz-weiß gezeichneten Stützschwanz sind die beiden Zentralfedern verlängert und laufen spitz zu. Der sehr spitze, mittellange bis lange Stocherschnabel ist dunkel hornfarben, gerade oder am First leicht abwärts gebogen. Arten dieses Typs sind vom südlichen Nordamerika, in Mittelamerika, auf vielen Karibikinseln sowie in Südamerika bis zur südlichen Verbreitungsgrenze vertreten.', 'Die Spechte der zweiten Gruppe sind bedeutend uneinheitlicher gefärbt. Gemeinsam ist ihnen eine weitgehend zeichnungslose Schwarzfärbung der Oberseite, die auch für die gesamte Gattung namensgebend wurde. Einige Arten, wie der Rotkopfspecht mit leuchtend rotem Kopf, Nacken, Brust und Schultern oder der Weißspecht sind sehr auffällig und für Spechte ungewöhnlich gefärbt. Letzterer ist überhaupt die einzige Spechtart, bei der die Kopffärbung beider Geschlechter weitgehend weiß ist und die einzige \\"Melanerpes\\"-Art, der jegliches Rot fehlt. Einige Arten, wie der Guadeloupespecht oder der Blutgesichtspecht, weisen dagegen eine düstere, kontrastarme Färbung auf. Insgesamt überwiegen schwarz-weiße Kontraste. Die schwarzen Körperpartien, vor allem das Rückengefieder, können einen leicht grünlichen, bläulichen oder violetten Glanz aufweisen. Gefiederzeichnungen sind nicht oder nur sehr undeutlich vorhanden. Daneben kommen vor allem im Stirn- und Scheitelbereich reine Rottöne vor, an Brust und Flanken dunkle, matte Purpurfärbungen. Der Färbungsdimorphismus ist bei einigen dieser Spechte eher schwach ausgeprägt, beim Rotkopfspecht und beim Blutgesichtspecht sind die Geschlechter im Aussehen gleich. Die meisten Arten innerhalb dieser Gruppe haben einen meißelartigen, an der Basis recht breiten, geraden oder nur geringfügig abwärts gebogenen Schnabel.', 'Zwei Arten, der Gelbbrauenspecht und der Kaktusspecht, sind in je zwei Farbmorphen vertreten.', 'Lautäußerungen.', 'Aufgrund ihrer Unterschiedlichkeit lassen sich die Lautäußerungen der \\"Melanerpes\\"-Spechte nicht gemeinsam beschreiben. Informationen dazu finden sich in den meisten der betreffenden Artbeiträge. Bei sozial lebenden Arten stehen die Gruppenmitglieder in ständigem Rufkontakt und sind deshalb akustisch sehr auffällig. Dies gilt zum Beispiel für Gruppen des Eichelspechts, dessen Mitglieder sich mit lauten \\"Wäka\\"-Rufen verständigen. Andere, wie etwa der Blutgesichtspecht verhalten sich sehr ruhig. Die Spechte dieser Gattung trommeln nur selten und eher leise, einige offenbar überhaupt nicht.', 'Verbreitung und Lebensraum.', 'Die Verbreitung von \\"Melanerpes\\" beschränkt sich auf die Nearktis und die Neotropis. Außer dem kontinentalen Festland Nord-, Mittel- und Südamerikas haben einige Arten verschiedene Karibikinseln besiedelt. Am weitesten nach Norden dringen der Blutgesichtspecht im westlichen Nordamerika und der Rotkopfspecht im zentralen und östlichen Nordamerika vor, am weitesten nach Süden erstreckt sich das Verbreitungsgebiet von Weißspecht und Kaktusspecht, die bis ins nördliche Patagonien vorkommen. Die größte Artenvielfalt auf vergleichsweise engem Raum besteht mit vierzehn Arten in Mittelamerika und auf verschiedenen Karibik-Inseln, auf denen Guadeloupespecht, Scharlachbrustspecht, Haitispecht, Jamaikaspecht und Bahamaspecht Inselendemiten sind. Auch einige mexikanische, beziehungsweise mittelamerikanische Arten, wie der Yucatánspecht, der Graukehlspecht, der Goldwangenspecht oder der Hoffmannspecht kommen nur in kleinen, zudem auch zunehmend fragmentierten Gebieten vor. Im nordwestlichen Südamerika sind die bisher bekannten Verbreitungsgebiete des Buntkopfspechts und des erst kürzlich als eigenständige Art klassifizierten Schmuckspechts sehr klein. Flächenmäßig ausgedehnte Gebiete besiedeln dagegen die meisten nordamerikanischen und, mit Ausnahme der beiden oben genannten, die südamerikanischen Arten.', 'Die Lebensräume der einzelnen Arten sind äußerst vielfältig, immer aber müssen baum-, zumindest aber kakteenbestandene Landschaften zur Verfügung stehen. Insgesamt zeigen die meisten Arten eine Präferenz für offene Landschaften, Waldränder, Rodungsflächen oder für Gebiete mit offenen Strukturen, die von Bränden oder Stürmen geschaffen wurden. Die Baumartenzusammensetzung der Lebensräume ist sehr variabel und spielt offenbar nur für die wenigen Nahrungsspezialisten unter den \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten, wie den Eichelspecht, eine wichtige Rolle. Dieser ist eng an das Vorkommen seiner Nahrungsbäume, verschiedene Eichenarten, gebunden. Für viele Arten ist ein ausreichender Totholzanteil innerhalb des Lebensraumes ein wichtiges Requisit. Zwar dringen einige Arten in dichte Waldgebiete vor, den primären Lebensraum bilden diese jedoch nur für wenige. \\"Melanerpes\\"-Spechte kommen in ausgesprochen feuchten Habitaten, wie Mangrovensümpfen und Schwemmlandgebieten ebenso vor wie in mit Saguaro bestandenen Halbwüsten oder in den Dornbuschsavannen des Chaco. Die meisten Arten sind relativ anpassungsfähig und können innerhalb eines räumlich begrenzten Verbreitungsgebietes sehr unterschiedliche Lebensräume besiedeln; dies gilt besonders für die Inselendemiten. Viele Arten haben sich an die Anwesenheit des Menschen gewöhnt und brüten auch in Stadtgebieten, in großen Parks, Plantagen oder in Obstgärten, auch Futterstellen werden von einigen \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten regelmäßig aufgesucht.', 'Arten dieser Gattung kommen vom Meeresniveau bis zu den regionalen Baumgrenzen vor. Futtersuchende Eichelspechte wurden in Kolumbien noch in Höhen von 3500 Metern festgestellt.', 'Nahrung und Nahrungserwerb.', 'Alle \\"Melanerpes\\"-Arten sind sowohl herbivor als auch carnivor. Die Zusammensetzung und die Anteile pflanzlicher und tierischer Nahrung variieren sowohl von Art zu Art als auch innerhalb derselben Art. Generell wird in der Vorbrutzeit und während der Jungenaufzucht mehr tierische Nahrung aufgenommen, im Herbst und Winter verstärkt pflanzliche. Auch die Jungen werden mehrheitlich, aber nicht ausschließlich mit tierischer Nahrung versorgt. Diese Unterschiede gelten vor allem für die Arten der höheren nördlichen und südlichen Breiten, bei den tropischen Arten sind die jahreszeitlichen Unterschiede in der Nahrungszusammensetzung geringer. Die meisten können als Nahrungsgeneralisten bezeichnet werden, das breiteste Nahrungsspektrum unter den \\"Melanerpes\\" weisen wahrscheinlich der Rotkopfspecht und der Gilaspecht auf. Vergleichsweise spezialisiert sind dagegen der Eichelspecht und der Weißspecht, die sich von Eicheln beziehungsweise verschiedenen Früchten ernähren. Soweit bekannt, ist nur der Goldmaskenspecht weitgehend herbivor.', 'Die tierische Nahrung besteht vor allem aus Insekten. Hier überwiegen Ameisen, Termiten, Käfer und ihre holzbewohnenden Larven, Schmetterlingsraupen, Heuschrecken, Grillen und bei den kleinen Arten Blattläuse. Auch Fluginsekten spielen eine Rolle, Rotkopfspecht und Blutgesichtspecht ernähren sich während der Sommermonate vornehmlich von solchen. In geringerem Maße werden auch Spinnen, Tausendfüßer, Schnecken, gelegentlich auch kleine Eidechsen und kleine Säugetiere erbeutet.

Aus einem Marktflecken am Südufer des Rheins entwickelte sich im Laufe des 12. Jahrhunderts, während der Herrschaft der Zähringer, eine befestigte Stadt. Die Burg war mehrere Jahrzehnte Hauptwohnsitz der Habsburger, während die Stadt von 1218 bis 1330 sowie ab 1415 reichsfrei war, bis sie schliesslich 1439 dauerhaft unter habsburgische bzw. österreichische Herrschaft geriet. Rheinfelden war direkt von den Auswirkungen des Dreissigjährigen Krieges betroffen und nach der Schlacht bei Rheinfelden von 1638 bis 1650 von schwedischen und französischen Truppen besetzt. 1797 von Frankreich erobert, gelangte die Stadt 1802 zur Schweiz und ist seit 1803 Bezirkshauptort im Kanton Aargau. Seit den 1970er Jahren wuchs die Einwohnerzahl stark an, als die Stadt zu einem Teil der Agglomeration Basel wurde.', 'Bedeutende Wirtschaftsfaktoren sind die Herstellung von Bier (die hier ansässige Brauerei Feldschlösschen ist die grösste der Schweiz) und der Abbau umfangreicher Salzvorkommen durch die Saline Riburg. Die beim Salzabbau anfallende Sole ermöglichte ab Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts die Entwicklung Rheinfeldens zu einem Kurort, der sich schrittweise den Erfordernissen des modernen Tourismus anpasste und heute überwiegend auf Therapie und Rehabilitation ausgerichtet ist.', 'Geographie.', 'Rheinfelden liegt 17 Kilometer östlich von Basel, im nordwestlichen Zipfel des Kantons Aargau an der Grenze zu Deutschland. Das Stadtgebiet erstreckt sich entlang dem linken Ufer des Hochrheins über eine Länge von rund neun Kilometern, bei einer durchschnittlichen Breite von etwa zweieinhalb Kilometern. Prägend für die Entstehung der Stadt ist das \\"Inseli\\", eine rund 150 Meter lange und 47 Meter vom linken Ufer entfernt befindliche Insel aus Muschelkalkfelsen. Diese dient gleichzeitig als natürlicher (Zwischen-)Brückenkopf für die Rheinquerung. Im Flussbett verläuft ein steilwandiger Graben, eine tektonische Plattengrenze am äussersten südöstlichen Rand der Oberrheinischen Tiefebene. Der 700 Meter lange Graben beginnt bei einer als \\"Höllhaken\\" bezeichneten Stromschnelle und endet bei der Rheinbrücke im St.-Anna-Loch, einem 32 Meter tiefen Becken mit gefährlichen Strudeln. Von Rheinfelden aus ist der Rhein bis zur Nordsee schiffbar.', 'Rechts- bzw. linksrheinisch lassen die Ausläufer des zum Südschwarzwald gehörenden Dinkelbergs sowie des Tafeljuras einen mit mächtigen Schotterablagerungen bedeckten Talboden frei, der als \\"Rheinfeld\\" bezeichnet wird. Auf Schweizer Seite ist er am westlichen Stadtrand etwa einen Kilometer breit, weitet sich in östlicher Richtung aus und erreicht bei der Endmoräne von Möhlin eine Breite von über drei Kilometern. Die Altstadt Rheinfeldens befindet sich auf einer Felsterrasse, die zur gleichen Formation wie das Inseli gehört. Im Westen fällt die Terrasse zum \\"Heimendeckenloch\\" ab. Diese im Jahr 1903 weitgehend überdeckte, einst bis zu 14 Meter tiefe Schlucht bildete in prähistorischer Zeit ein Rheinbett, durch das später der von Süden herkommende Magdenerbach floss. Seit der Zeit der Stadtgründung fliesst der Bach östlich an der Altstadt vorbei in den Rhein. In fast ihrer gesamten Breite wird die Altstadt von einer ausgeprägten Hangkante durchzogen, ihr östlichster Teil ist durch künstliche Verfüllung ausnivelliert. Südlich der Altstadt und westlich des Magdenerbaches erhebt sich eine weitere Terrasse, der Kapuzinerberg. Dieser geht in einen Ausläufer des Tafeljuras über, den \\"Berg\\" (). Östlich des Baches erhebt sich der \\"Steppberg\\" ().

Chr. Augusta Raurica (Augst), die älteste römische Stadt auf Schweizer Boden. Durch das spätere Stadtgebiet Rheinfeldens verlief eine Römerstrasse ostwärts über den Bözbergpass nach Vindonissa (Windisch). Eine Strassenkreuzung im Bereich des heutigen Gasthofes «Drei Könige» war vermutlich Standort einer Zollstation, die in einem vor 537 kompilierten Verzeichnis als \\"Caistena Cassangita\\" bezeichnet wird und im 8. Jahrhundert beim Geographen von Ravenna erscheint. Dort zweigte ein Weg ins Magdenertal ab, ein weiterer führte zu einer Fähre am Rhein (mit einem Treidelpfad am gegenüberliegenden Ufer zur Überwindung der Stromschnellen). 2001 wurden zwei nach Augusta Raurica führende römische Wasserleitungen freigelegt, im selben Jahr im Augarten Reste einer befestigten Anlage mit Getreidespeicher aus dem 4. Jahrhundert (der bisher einzige Fund einer grösseren aus Holz errichteten Befestigungsanlage aus römischer Zeit in der Schweiz), 2013 ein Ziegelbrennofen. In der Rheinfeldebene, beim \\"Görbelhof\\", entstand um 260 ein Gutshof. Es sind mindestens zwei Gebäude bekannt, ein Wohnhaus und eine Werkstatt. Um 350 wurde der Gutshof aufgegeben. Im Pferrichgraben, im Heimenholz und vermutlich auf dem Inseli standen im 4. Jahrhundert römische Wachttürme, die einen Teil des Rheinlimes bildeten.', 'Im 6. und 7.

Der Aargau scheint nach 900 dem sich ausweitenden hochburgundischen Reich einverleibt worden zu sein. Rudolf II. gelang es jedoch 919 in der Schlacht bei Winterthur die weitere Expansion zu beenden und 920 Anerkennung als schwäbischer Herzog durch König Heinrich I. zu finden. Der Augstgau, das Gebiet im spitzen Winkel zwischen Rhein und Aare, bildete fortan den nordöstlichsten Zipfel des Königreichs Burgund. 1006 erhielt Heinrich II., König des Ostfrankenreichs und späterer römisch-deutscher Kaiser, das Gebiet vom letzten Burgunderkönig Rudolf III. geschenkt.', 'Ebenfalls im 10. Jahrhundert liess sich auf der Felsterrasse ein Adelsgeschlecht nieder, das verwandtschaftliche Beziehungen sowohl zum burgundischen Königshaus als auch zu den Saliern hatte. Die rückwirkend so benannten Grafen von Rheinfelden besassen Güter beidseits des Rheins und übernahmen in dieser Zeit des politischen Umbruchs eine wichtige Vermittlerrolle, wodurch sie grossen Einfluss erlangten. Auf dem Inseli errichteten sie die Burg Stein, zusätzlich nahe dem Südufer die «alte Burg», wo sich eine Siedlung zu entwickeln begann. Bekanntester Vertreter des Geschlechts ist Rudolf von Rheinfelden, ab 1057 Herzog von Schwaben und ab 1077 Gegenkönig des römisch-deutschen Reiches.

Es sollte 2600 Treibladungen tragen, von diesen wären etwa 800 Treibladungen mit einer Sprengkraft zwischen 0,15 kt und 5 kt nötig gewesen, um den Orbit zu erreichen, die verbleibenden Treibladungen hätten eine Rundreise zum Mars und sogar Saturn ermöglicht.', 'Ausgelöst durch den Sputnikschock wurde im Februar 1958 die \\"Advanced Research Projects Agency\\" (\\"ARPA\\", eine Behörde des Verteidigungsministeriums der Vereinigten Staaten, die Forschungs-Projekte durchführt) gegründet. Diese sollte Raumfahrtprojekte gebündelt fördern. Im April des gleichen Jahres stellten Taylor und Dyson der ARPA ihren Raumschiffentwurf vor, die daraufhin das Projekt mit 1 Million Dollar finanzierte.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der ARPA.', 'Nach der Gründung der NASA im Juli 1958 wurden die Raumfahrtprojekte der ARPA zwischen ihr und der Air Force aufgeteilt. Die NASA übernahm alle zivilen Raumfahrtprojekte, die Air Force die militärischen. Allerdings zeigten weder die NASA noch die Air Force Interesse an dem Orion-Projekt. Die Air Force sah in Orion keine zukünftige Waffe, die NASA hatte die Entscheidung getroffen, dass ihr ziviles Raumfahrtprogramm nicht-nuklear sein und nicht der Geheimhaltung unterliegen sollte. Das Orion-Projekt verblieb so als einziges Raumfahrtprojekt bei der ARPA.', 'Als für die Finanzierung hinderlich stellte sich heraus, dass viele Budgetverantwortliche das Projekt für „verrückt“ hielten. Sie konnten nicht glauben, dass es möglich war, ein Fahrzeug mit Explosionen anzutreiben, ohne dass dieses dabei beschädigt oder zerstört wird.', 'Um die grundsätzliche technische Machbarkeit eines explosionsgetriebenen Fahrzeuges zu zeigen, wurde deshalb ein Modell mit einer Prallplatte von einem Meter Durchmesser gebaut, der sogenannte \\"Hot-Rod\\" oder \\"Putt-Putt\\". Das Fiberglas-Modell mit 120 kg Gewicht stieß nacheinander bis zu sechs ca. ein Kilogramm schwere Treibladungen aus C4 aus. Mit diesem Modell gelang am 14. November 1959 ein Flug mit einer Gipfelhöhe von 56 m, zwei Tage später wurde sogar eine Flughöhe von etwa 100 m erreicht. Ein Film über die erfolgreichen Flugversuche half in der Folge die weitere Finanzierung zu sichern. Eines der Modelle befindet sich heute im National Air and Space Museum der Smithsonian Institution.', 'Die Flugversuche mit den Modellen erbrachten Kenntnisse, die direkt für die weitere Entwicklung nützlich waren, zum Beispiel welche Form die Prallplatte haben musste, um ein günstiges Verhältnis von Gewicht und Stabilität zu erreichen. Außerdem ergaben die Flugversuche, dass zumindest durch die Temperaturen und Drücke, die mit konventionellen Sprengstoffen erreicht werden konnten, keine Materialabtragungen (Ablation) an der Oberfläche der Prallplatte zu erwarten waren. Die Ablation wurde bei weiteren Experimenten mit Plasma-Generatoren, die das Bombenplasma simulieren sollten, weiter untersucht.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der Air Force.', 'Die ARPA entschied Ende 1959, das Orion-Projekt aus Gründen nationaler Sicherheit nicht weiter zu unterstützen. Die US Air Force übernahm daraufhin das Projekt, allerdings nur unter der Voraussetzung, dass militärische Anwendungen gefunden würden. Das stand aber gegen die eigentlich angestrebte friedliche Nutzung des Projekts.', 'Militärisch sollten kleine Orions jetzt wie eine moderne Interkontinentalrakete mit Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) genutzt werden. Sie sollten aus Silos starten, bis über das Zielgebiet fliegen und dort zunächst eine große Menge Täuschkörper abwerfen. Erst wenn die feindliche Verteidigung durch die Täuschkörper überlastet wäre, sollten die eigentlichen Gefechtsköpfe gestartet werden. Ein anderer Vorschlag sah große Orion-Raumschiffe vor, die mit einem ähnlichen Missionsprofil wie die modernen strategischen U-Boote im tiefen Raum patrouillieren sollten.', 'Die militärischen Möglichkeiten wurden von einigen Militärs durchaus ernst genommen. Der Kalte Krieg war in vollem Gange, das atomare Wettrüsten hatte begonnen. Thomas Power, der Leiter des Strategic Air Command, war gar der Meinung, dass „wer immer Orion kontrolliert, die Welt kontrolliere“. Auf seine Veranlassung wurde im März 1962 das Modell eines militärischen Orion-Raumschiffes unter voller Bewaffnung gebaut. Dieses „Schlachtschiff“ sollte unter anderem eine Bewaffnung von 500 Sprengköpfen tragen. Man führte das Modell Präsident John F. Kennedy vor, als dieser die Vandenberg Air Force Base besuchte. Kennedy war davon geschockt und versagte dem Projekt die nötige politische Unterstützung. Mitten im Kalten Krieg wollte Kennedy kein nukleares Wettrüsten im Weltraum riskieren.', 'Das Orion-Projekt bei der NASA.', 'Die weitere Entwicklung des Orion-Projekts bei der Air Force wurde von Verteidigungsminister Robert McNamara verhindert. Er sah Orion nicht als militärisches Projekt und verweigerte deshalb eine erweiterte Finanzierung, ohne die der Bau eines Prototyps nicht möglich war. Um das Projekt doch noch über den Status einer Machbarkeitsstudie hinaus zu bringen, wandten sich Taylor und Dyson deshalb an die NASA, von der sie sich zusätzliche Mittel erhofften.', 'Die Entwürfe wurden den Voraussetzungen bei der NASA angepasst. Von einem Bodenstart wollte man absehen, da dieser zu „schmutzig“ gewesen wäre, um ohne massive Proteste der Öffentlichkeit stattfinden zu können. Stattdessen passte man die Größe der Orion-Schiffe an die verfügbaren Trägerraketen an – das an die Saturn-Raketen angepasste Orion-Design hatte jetzt eine Prallplatte mit zehn Meter Durchmesser. Eine Variante (\\"Lofting\\") sah vor, eine Saturn-1C-Stufe als Booster zu benutzen. Diese sollte das Orion-Raumschiff in eine Höhe bringen, in der das gefahrlose Zünden des nuklearen Pulsantriebes möglich war. Eine zweite Variante (\\"Boost-to-Orbit\\") sah drei Einzelteile vor, die jeweils von einer Saturn-V-Rakete in den Orbit gebracht werden und dort zusammengebaut werden sollten.', 'Als mögliches Ziel sah man eine Marsmission mit acht Mann Besatzung und 100 t Nutzlast vor.

November 1904 in St. Joseph, Missouri; † 19. Mai 1969 in New York) war ein US-amerikanischer Jazzmusiker (Tenorsaxophon und Klarinette). Er gilt als „Vater“ des Tenorsaxophonspiels und war neben Lester Young einer der ersten stilbildenden Solisten auf dem Instrument. In seiner von 1922 bis 1969 währenden Karriere wurde er zuletzt dem Mainstream Jazz zugeordnet, nahm aber immer wieder Herausforderungen an und spielte mit den jeweiligen Avantgardisten ihrer Zeit. Seine Spitznamen waren \\"Hawk\\" und \\"Bean\\".', 'Leben.', 'Frühe Jahre (1904–1934).', 'Coleman Hawkins stammte aus einer Mittelschichtfamilie und wuchs im Mittleren Westen der USA auf. Seine Mutter spielte Klavier und Orgel; mit vier Jahren brachte sie den jungen Hawkins dazu, Klavierspiel zu lernen; mit sieben Jahren begann er Cello zu spielen und mit neun Jahren bekam er ein C-Melody-Saxophon. Seine ersten Auftritte hatte er im Alter von zwölf Jahren bei Schulveranstaltungen in einer Trio-Besetzung mit Piano und Schlagzeug; durch diese Auftritte wurde er bald zu einer lokalen Berühmtheit. Seine Eltern schickten ihn daraufhin zur weiteren musikalischen Ausbildung nach Topeka; dort traf er mit dem Pianisten Jesse Stone und seinen \\"Blue Serenaders\\" zusammen und gehörte der Band einige Monate an. Deren Musik war ein \\"Territory Jazz\\" mit einem lockeren Two-Beat-Rhythmus.', 'Ab 1921 war er als Musiker in Kansas City aktiv; im April nahm die Vaudeville-Blues-Sängerin Mamie Smith den Siebzehnjährigen in ihre Begleitband \\"Jazz Hounds\\" auf und konnte seine Eltern überreden, ihn mit ihr auf Tournee gehen zu lassen. Hawk spielte dort Blues und New-Orleans-Jazz im Stil von King Oliver und Louis Armstrong. Sein damaliger Kollege Garvin Bushell erinnerte sich, dass Hawkins vor allem deshalb in die Band geholt wurde, weil er Noten lesen konnte; „er war auf diesem Instrument in allem weiter, als ich je gesehen hatte … Er konnte alles lesen und irrte sich in keiner einzigen Note … Und er spielte sein Saxophon nicht, als sei es eine Trompete oder Klarinette, wie es damals üblich war. Er spielte auf den Akkorden, weil er als Kind Klavier gespielt hatte.“', 'Anfang Mai 1922 gastierten die \\"Jazz Hounds\\" für Schallplatten-Aufnahmen in New York City („Mean Daddy Blues“); in dieser Zeit gab Hawkins auch Einlagen mit dem Cello. Inzwischen war er zum Star und zur Attraktion der Band geworden, bekam aber nur wenige solistische Freiräume, was ihn dazu bewog, auszusteigen und in New York zu bleiben. Dort bekam er Jobs in den Bands von Ralph Jones und Cecil Smith, bis er im angesehenen Orchester von Wilbur Sweatman landete. Dort hörte ihn Fletcher Henderson, der ihn 1924 in seine Band holte. Zunächst war er aber nur bei einigen Plattenaufnahmen anwesend, wie bei „Dicty Blues“ am 9. August 1923.', 'Fest zur Band gehörte er erst, als diese ein Engagement im Club \\"Alabam\\" bekam. Schließlich war es der \\"Roseland Ballroom\\", wo er ab September 1924 an der Seite von Don Redman und Louis Armstrong zum führenden Solisten aufstieg und seinen eigenen Stil entwickelte, wie etwa in „The Stampede“ 1926 und dem Hit „Queer Notions“ 1933. In diese Zeit fiel seine erste Ehe mit einer Tänzerin namens Gertrude, die er noch aus seiner Zeit mit Mamie Smith kannte. 1929 ließen sich die beiden wieder scheiden.', '„Spätestens ab 1929 war Hawkins’ Ruf als bester Tenorsaxophonist durch die Platten und Auftritte mit Fletcher Henderson unumstritten, und sein Einfluss auf andere Saxophonisten, nicht nur Tenorsaxophonisten, war überwältigend“, schrieb sein Biograph Teddy Doering. So wurde Hawkins immer häufiger zu Aufnahmen anderer Bandleader oder Produzenten herangezogen, so bei den \\"Little Chocolade Dandies\\" im September 1929, kurz darauf bei den McKinney’s Cotton Pickers und mit Red McKenzies \\"Mound City Blue Blowers\\", mit denen er „If I Could Be with You“ einspielte. Ende 1930 wechselte die Henderson-Band vom \\"Roseland\\" zu \\"Connie’s Inn\\", einem Kellerclub mit hohem Ansehen, aus dem Auftritte im Radio ausgestrahlt wurden.', \\"Ein Höhepunkt in Hawkins’ Werk bei Henderson war „It's the Talk of the Town“ von 1932, nach Joachim-Ernst Berendt wahrscheinlich die erste große Solo-Balladen-Interpretation der Jazzgeschichte. Am 29. September 1932 entstanden Hawkins’ erste Einspielungen unter eigenem Namen mit dem Engländer Spike Hughes, durch den er erfuhr, wie hoch sein Ansehen in Europa war. Zuvor hatte er einen soeben aus Europa zurückgekehrten Kollegen darüber reden gehört, wie gut dort die Arbeitsbedingungen für Musiker seien, besonders für Schwarze. Umgehend schickte er ein Telegramm an Jack Hylton, den „englischen Paul Whiteman“, in dem nur stand: „Ich möchte nach England kommen.“ Hylton antwortete schon am nächsten Tag; Hawkins nahm Urlaub bei Fletcher Henderson, weil er glaubte, nur ein oder zwei Monate in Europa zu bleiben. Letztlich blieb er aber bis 1939.\\", \\"Kurz vor seiner Abreise nach Europa produzierte John Hammond im März 1934 Duoaufnahmen des Saxophonisten mit dem Pianisten Buck Washington; es scheint, als ob diese Aufnahmen („I Ain't Got Nobody“ und „It Sends Me“) teilweise mit ihrer „Schroffheit und Kühnheit aus heutiger Sicht wie ein Vorschatten des Bebop“ wirkten.\\", 'Zu der Entscheidung, eine Weile in Europa zu arbeiten, trug auch die „Entthronung“ Hawkins’ Anfang des Jahres 1934 bei, als er mit dem Henderson-Orchester in Kansas City weilte und im neu eröffneten Nachtclub \\"Cherry Blossom\\" auf Lester Young, Ben Webster, Herschel Evans und weitere Kansas-City-Tenoristen traf. Mary Lou Williams war Ohrenzeugin dieser Jamsession: „Bean Hawkins hatte nicht damit gerechnet, dass die Kaycee-Tenoristen so gewaltig waren, und war unsicher und konnte keine rechte Linie finden, obgleich er den ganzen Morgen spielte.“', 'In Europa (1934–1939).', 'Er verließ New York am 30. März und spielte nach seiner Ankunft in London zunächst in Jack Hyltons großem Orchester wie auch in dem kleineren Ensemble, das von seiner Frau Ennis geleitet wurde; Weihnachten 1934 kam Hawkins erstmals nach Paris. Im Anschluss waren einige Auftritte in Deutschland geplant, doch das nationalsozialistische Regime verbot dem Schwarzen Hawkins die Einreise. Hylton ließ Hawkins in Holland zurück, wo dieser mit Theo Uden Masman und seinen \\"Ramblers\\" spielte. Die Zusammenarbeit mit den \\"Ramblers\\" gipfelte in drei Aufnahmesitzungen, im Februar und August 1935 („I Wanna Go Back to Harlem“). Schon nach der ersten Session beschloss Hawkins, nicht mit Hylton nach England zurückzukehren; ihn lockte Paris. Im Februar trat er bei einem Konzert mit französischen Musikern im Salle Pleyel auf, das der Hot Club de France organisiert hatte. Im März nahm er mit dem Orchester von Michel Warlop auf; mit dabei die Stars des Quintette du Hot Club de France, Django Reinhardt und Stéphane Grappelli. Anschließend ging Hawkins auf eine ausgedehnte Skandinavien-Tournee, wo er begeistert gefeiert wurde. Nach einem längeren Aufenthalt in der Schweiz fanden am 28. April 1937 seine berühmte Aufnahmen mit Benny Carter, Reinhardt und Grappelli für \\"Swing\\" in Paris statt, wo „Honeysuckle Rose“ und „Crazy Rhythm“ eingespielt wurden.', 'Das Jahr 1938 verbrachte Hawkins vorwiegend in den Niederlanden, wo er unter anderem im \\"Negro Palace\\" in Amsterdam spielte, und in Belgien; dort spielte er in Namur in der Band seines Landsmannes Arthur Briggs. Er versuchte eine Arbeitserlaubnis für England zu bekommen, die ihm jedoch von der Musiker-Gewerkschaft verweigert wurde. Mit einem Trick gelang es seinen englischen Fans, ihn ins Land zu holen: der Saxophon-Hersteller Selmer organisierte eine Tournee durch Großbritannien, die der „Schulung“ dienen sollte, da Hawkins nur für Musiker spielen werde. Darauf hatten die Gewerkschaften keinen Einfluss, und Hawkins ging im März/April auf England-Tournee. Danach wollte er eigentlich nach Holland zurückkehren; die angespannte politische Lage in Europa bewog ihn aber zur Rückkehr in die Vereinigten Staaten. Es kam noch zu einigen Auftritten in England, erneut mit Hylton; Hawkins wurde als „Variety-Künstler“ angekündigt. Die letzten Vorkriegsaufnahmen entstanden Ende Mai mit dem Hylton-Orchester; dann kehrte er Anfang Juli nach Holland zurück und war am 31. Juli wieder in New York.', 'Swing Combos, \\"Body and Soul\\" und Bebop (1939–1945).', 'In den fünf Jahren seiner Abwesenheit hatte sich die Szene in den USA verändert; neue Saxophonisten wie Chu Berry und Ben Webster (diese hatten hintereinander Hawkins Platz bei Henderson eingenommen) hatten sich Achtung verschafft, insbesondere aber Lester Young, der nicht mehr die Konkurrenz seines wenige Monate zuvor verstorbenen Rivalen Herschel Evans fürchten musste. In diese Situation kam Coleman Hawkins zurück; und seine Rückkehr machte sofort „die Runde“. Lester Young trat gerade mit Billie Holiday auf, als Hawkins hereintrat; Rex Stewart berichtete von diesem Moment: „Bean marschierte herein, packte sein Instrument aus und spielte zu jedermanns Überraschung mit ihnen.“', 'Schon vor seiner Abreise in die USA hatte Coleman Hawkins seine künftigen Arbeitsmöglichkeiten abgeklärt; er hatte die Option, mit eigener Band in \\"Kelly’s Stable\\" (141 West, 51st Street) aufzutreten. Da seine Wunschmusiker wie Red Allen, Benny Carter, Roy Eldridge, John Kirby oder Teddy Wilson in anderen Bands erfolgreich arbeiteten, stellte er ein achtköpfiges Ensemble mit jungen Musikern und der Sängerin Thelma Carpenter zusammen. Mit seiner Band trat er im \\"Arkadia\\" auf, einem Tanzlokal am Broadway. Am 11. Oktober 1939 ging die Band ins Studio, um für das Label Bluebird vier Titel einzuspielen.', '„Drei Stücke sind bereits im Kasten, und quasi als Dreingabe, damit zwei Platten gefüllt werden können, steht ‚Body and Soul‘ auf dem Programm, das gewöhnlich als Abschluss der Clubauftritte diente“, schrieb der Kritiker Werner Wunderlich zu der historischen Session. „Herausragende Musiker hat Hawkins nicht in seinem Ensemble, folglich ist er mit seinem Tenorsaxophon der alleinige Solist bei diesem Stück. Und genau diese, seine Version des oft gespielten Standards wird in einem Meilenstein, zu einer Jahrhundertaufnahme des Jazz, exemplarisch für eine Jazz-Ballade. Mit ‚Body and Soul‘ weist sich Coleman Hawkins als einer der ganz Großen aus, als der ‚Vater des Tenorsaxophons‘“, meinte Wunderlich in seiner Besprechung der „Jahrhundertaufnahmen des Jazz“. „Die vollendete Architektur seines Solos, in dem jeder Ton mit zugleich zwingender Logik und glühender Intensität zum nächsten führt, wurde unzähligen Generationen zur unvergesslichen Lektion über den dramaturgischen Aufbau von Improvisation“, stellt Marcus A. Woelfle fest in seinem Beitrag zu „Body and Soul“ im Buch über Jazz-Standards. Nun gelang Hawkins mit „Body and Soul“ ein überwältigendes Comeback – „Body and Soul“ war der einzige Titel, mit dem Hawkins in die Billboard \\"Top 20: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Coleman Hawkins, Jazz-Saxophonist, US-Amerikaner, Tenorsaxophon, Klarinette, Komponist, Mainstream Jazz, Europe-Tour, Body and Soul, Jazzgeschichte"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Beschränkter Stoff nach REACH-Anhang XVII, Eintrag 30', 'Beschränkter Stoff nach REACH-Anhang XVII, Eintrag 40', 'Brenngas', 'Feuergefährlicher Stoff', 'Gesundheitsschädlicher Stoff (Organschäden)', 'Giftiger Stoff bei Einatmen', 'Kohlenstoffverbindung', 'Oxid', 'Stoff mit reproduktionstoxischer Wirkung'], 'Kohlenstoffmonoxid (gebräuchlich Kohlenmonoxid) ist eine chemische Verbindung aus Kohlenstoff und Sauerstoff mit der Summenformel CO.

Chr. wurde bei der Verhüttung von Metallerzen die reduzierende Wirkung von Kohlenstoffmonoxid in sogenannten Rennöfen genutzt, ohne jedoch die Natur des Gases zu kennen. Die Griechen und Römer verwendeten es für Exekutionen. Arnaldus de Villanova beschrieb im späten 13. Jahrhundert die Giftigkeit eines Gases, das durch die Verbrennung von Holz entsteht; gemeint war Kohlenstoffmonoxid. Im frühen 17. Jahrhundert experimentierte Johan Baptista van Helmont mit einem Gas namens \\"gas carbonum\\", einer Mischung aus Kohlenstoffdioxid und Kohlenstoffmonoxid.', 'Im Jahr 1776 erzeugte der französische Chemiker Joseph de Lassone Kohlenstoffmonoxid durch Erhitzen von Zinkoxid mit Koks. Er nahm fälschlicherweise an, dass es sich dabei um Wasserstoff handele. Joseph Priestley stellte 1799 Kohlenstoffmonoxid durch Überleiten von Kohlenstoffdioxid über heißes Eisen her. William Cruickshank nutzte das gleiche Verfahren im Jahr 1800. Er schlug die richtige Zusammensetzung CO vor. Die toxischen Eigenschaften auf Hunde wurden von Claude Bernard um 1846 untersucht.', 'Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts wuchs der Bedarf an Leuchtgasen.

Mit der Entwicklung des Winkler-Generators, des Lurgi-Druckvergasers und später des Koppers-Totzek-Reaktors gelang die großtechnische Kohlevergasung.', 'Während der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus wurde Kohlenstoffmonoxid für Exekutionen verwendet.

Insgesamt enthält die Atmosphäre etwa 400 Megatonnen (Mt). Auf der Nordhalbkugel liegt die mittlere Konzentration heute bei 140 ppbv, vor der Industrialisierung waren es etwa 90 ppbv. Auf der Südhalbkugel blieb die mittlere Konzentration mit 50 ppbv auf ihrem natürlichen Niveau.', 'Das Satelliten-Instrument \\"Terra’s Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere\\" (MOPITT) erstellte die erste globale Karte für die CO-Konzentration in der niedrigeren Erdatmosphäre. Die MOPITT-Abbildung anbei zeigt die durchschnittliche CO-Konzentration von April, Mai und Juni für die Jahre 2000 bis 2004.', 'Kohlenstoffmonoxid hat eine mittlere atmosphärische Lebensdauer von etwa zwei Monaten. Die wichtigste Reaktion ist die mit Hydroxyl-Radikalen in der Atmosphäre, wodurch jährlich 2300 Mt (2000–2800 Mt) Kohlenstoffmonoxid zu Kohlenstoffdioxid oxidiert werden. Böden tragen zur CO-Oxidation mit etwa 300 Mt (200–600 Mt) jährlich bei. Die Oxidationsgeschwindigkeit hängt von der Konzentration der Hydroxyl-Radikale ab, die mit stärkerer Sonneneinstrahlung und höherem Wasserdampfgehalt zunimmt. In den Tropen beträgt die Lebensdauer etwa einen Monat, in gemäßigten und nördlichen Breiten bewegt sie sich zwischen zwei Monaten im Sommer und mehr als einem Jahr im Winter. Für den Ausgleich der Kohlenstoffmonoxidkonzentrationen zwischen Nord- und Südhalbkugel wäre eine mittlere atmosphärische Lebensdauer von ungefähr einem Jahr erforderlich. Die höheren anthropogenen Emissionen auf der Nordhalbkugel führen daher zu einem deutlichen Konzentrationsunterschied zwischen den Hemisphären. Durch Wettereinflüsse wie den indischen Monsun und durch Emissionen von Ballungszentren gibt es regional, etwa in Ostasien, erhebliche Konzentrationsunterschiede.', 'Weltweit gelangen jährlich etwa 2500 Megatonnen (2000–2900 Mt) Kohlenstoffmonoxid in die Atmosphäre oder werden dort gebildet. Etwa die Hälfte davon entsteht bei der unvollständigen Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe oder von Biomasse, auch bei Wald- und Buschbränden. Ein weiterer großer Anteil wird erst in der Atmosphäre durch die Oxidation von Kohlenwasserstoffen wie Methan oder anderen flüchtigen organischen Verbindungen gebildet. Insgesamt sind etwa 60 % des Kohlenstoffmonoxids vom Menschen verursacht, der Rest ist natürlichen Ursprungs.', 'Angaben zu den globalen Emissionsraten beruhen auf Schätzungen und sind mit Unsicherheitsfaktoren behaftet. So werden die Kohlenstoffmonoxid-Emissionen aus dem Verkehr mit 500 Mt (300–600 Mt) angegeben, stationäre Anlagen zur Energiegewinnung aus fossilen Brennstoffen emittieren 100 Mt (80–200 Mt), die Biomasseverbrennung 600 Mt (300–800 Mt). Durch die Oxidation von Methan entstehen 600 Mt (400–800 Mt), beim Abbau anderer flüchtiger organischer Verbindungen 500 Mt (300–700 Mt).

In Trockengebieten geben Böden Kohlenstoffmonoxid ab, vermutlich durch die abiotische Zersetzung organischer Substanz unter dem Einfluss von Licht und hohen Temperaturen. Außerhalb der Trockengebiete überwiegt der Abbau durch Prokaryoten, abhängig vom Sauerstoff- und Wassergehalt des Bodens entweder durch Reduktion zu Methan (Methanbildner) oder durch die Oxidation zu Kohlendioxid.', 'Ozeane sind in Bezug auf Kohlenstoffmonoxid übersättigt. Im Atlantischen Ozean beträgt die Konzentration etwa das zehn- bis vierzigfache der atmosphärischen Gleichgewichtskonzentration, wobei biologische Quellen als Verursacher angenommen werden. Die Ozeane stellen demnach eine Quelle atmosphärischen Kohlenstoffmonoxids dar, deren Anteil auf 5 bis 29 % der durch Verbrennung freigesetzten Menge geschätzt wird.', 'In den Gasen hawaiianischer Vulkane wurde eine Konzentration von 3700 ppm (parts per million) Kohlenstoffmonoxid gemessen. Für die globale Bilanz spielen Vulkane keine Rolle.', 'Die Hauptinfrarotabsorptionsbande des Kohlenstoffmonoxids liegt bei einer Wellenzahl von 2143 cm−1 (Wellenlänge etwa 4,67 µm) und damit weit vom spektralen Maximum der Infrarotstrahlung der Erde, die bei einer Wellenzahl von ungefähr 1000 cm−1 (10 µm) liegt, entfernt. Kohlenstoffmonoxid trägt daher durch direkte Absorption nur wenig zum Treibhauseffekt bei. In der Troposphäre erfolgt die Oxidation von Kohlenwasserstoffen wie Methan zu Kohlenstoffdioxid ebenfalls über Hydroxyl-Radikale. Als Zwischenprodukt entsteht bei der Methanoxidation ebenfalls Kohlenstoffmonoxid. Der Effekt des Kohlenstoffmonoxids bezüglich des Treibhauseffekts liegt in seiner Bedeutung als Senke für diese Hydroxyl-Radikale, die dadurch der Umwandlung von direkten Treibhausgasen wie Methan nicht mehr zur Verfügung stehen. Auch Methanol, nach Methan das zweithäufigste organische Gas in der Erdatmosphäre, das in Konzentrationen von 0,1 bis 10 ppbv vorkommt, ist eine bedeutende atmosphärische Quelle für Kohlenstoffmonoxid, wobei ein Großteil des Methanols von Pflanzen emittiert wird.', 'In städtischen Umgebungen können durch unbehandelte Autoabgase die Werte zwischen 100 und 200 ppm liegen.

August 1944 in Berlin-Plötzensee) war ein deutscher Jurist, Diplomat und Widerstandskämpfer gegen den Nationalsozialismus.', 'Adam von Trott zu Solz war von Beginn an ein Gegner des nationalsozialistischen Regimes und setzte sich spätestens seit 1939 nachweisbar für dessen Sturz ein. Er entwickelte darüber hinaus weitreichende Ideen für ein freies gemeinsames Europa in der Zukunft. Trott gehörte zum Kern der Widerstandsgruppe Kreisauer Kreis um Helmuth James Graf von Moltke und Peter Graf Yorck von Wartenburg. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg war er an der Verschwörung vom 20. Juli 1944 beteiligt.', 'Familie und Herkunft.', 'Adam von Trott zu Solz entstammte einer Familie des hessischen Uradels, die urkundlich nachweisbar seit 1253 im heutigen Landkreis Hersfeld-Rotenburg ansässig ist. Stammsitze der Familie sind die Dörfer Solz und Imshausen, heute zur Stadt Bebra gehörend.', 'Über Generationen sind Mitglieder der Familie von Trott zu Solz im Landes- oder Staatsdienst hervorgetreten. Auch der Vater Adams, August von Trott zu Solz, trat nach seiner juristischen Ausbildung in den Staatsdienst ein, da er sich – ebenso wie später sein Sohn – ausdrücklich dem Gemeinwohl verpflichtet sah. 1905 stieg August von Trott vom Regierungspräsidenten in Kassel zum Oberpräsidenten der preußischen Provinz Brandenburg in Potsdam auf. 1909 wurde August von Trott zu Solz zum preußischen Kultusminister im Kabinett von Reichskanzler Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg berufen. Dieses Amt hatte er bis 1917 inne. Bis 1919 übte er das Amt des Oberpräsidenten in Kassel aus.', 'Adam von Trotts Mutter war Eleonore von Trott zu Solz, geb. von Schweinitz (1875–1948). Ihr Vater, General Hans Lothar von Schweinitz, war Botschafter in Wien und St. Petersburg. Ihre Mutter, die Amerikanerin Anna Jay, war eine direkte Nachfahrin von John Jay, einem der Gründerväter der Vereinigten Staaten. US-Präsident George Washington ernannte Jay zum ersten Vorsitzenden des Supreme Court. Die angelsächsische Prägung Eleonore von Trotts zeigte sich vor allem in der Art ihres sozialen und ökumenischen Engagements.', 'Kindheit und Jugend (1909–1927).', 'Adam von Trott zu Solz wurde 1909 als fünftes von acht Kindern in Potsdam geboren. Da sein Vater kurz vor seiner Geburt preußischer Kultusminister geworden war, zog die Familie bald darauf nach Berlin um. Dort verbrachte Adam von Trott seine ersten acht Lebensjahre. Seit 1915 besuchte er die Vorschule des Königlichen Französischen Gymnasiums am Berliner Reichstagsufer 6. Seine weitere Schulzeit wurde von mehreren Wechseln bestimmt: Nach der Übersiedlung der Familie nach Kassel kam Trott auf das dortige Wilhelms-Gymnasium. Als seine Eltern im Sommer 1919 nach dem Eintritt des Vaters in den Ruhestand ihren Wohnsitz nach Imshausen verlegten, wurde er zunächst zwei Jahre lang privat unterrichtet und besuchte dann das Friedrichsgymnasium in Kassel.', 'Da es zwischen ihm und seinen Pensionseltern an einem Vertrauensverhältnis fehlte, gaben ihn seine Eltern zu Beginn des darauf folgenden Schuljahres im April 1922 nach Hannoversch Münden. Bis zum Abitur besuchte Adam von Trott dort das Städtische Gymnasium und wohnte im Alumnat des Klosters Loccum. Während dieser Zeit begann er, Kunst, Musik und besonders die Literatur für sich zu entdecken. Seiner Begeisterung für sportliche Aktivitäten setzte damals wie später eine Herzschwäche Grenzen.', 'Zeitweilig schloss er sich einer Splittergruppe der Jugendbewegung, den \\"Nibelungen, dem Bund für Jungwandern\\" an, trat jedoch Ende 1924 wieder aus, weil der Bund ihn inhaltlich nicht überzeugte.', 'Studentenzeit und erste Auslandserfahrungen (1927–1931).', 'Mit 17 Jahren legte Adam von Trott im Frühjahr 1927 das Abitur ab. In Fortsetzung der Familientradition entschied er sich für das Studium der Rechtswissenschaften. Nach einem ersten Semester an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München wechselte er für die nächsten drei Semester an die Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. Dort wurde er auf Wunsch seines Vaters Mitglied des \\"Corps Saxonia\\", zu dem er jedoch nach einem guten Jahr auf Distanz ging.', 'Als Einschnitt erwies sich für den 19-jährigen Trott ein mehrwöchiger privater Aufenthalt im Herbst 1928 in Genf. Hier wurde sein Interesse für Politik geweckt. Als Sitz des Völkerbunds und zahlreicher anderer internationaler Organisationen war Genf ein Zentrum für Veranstaltungen internationaler Politik jeglicher Art. Die Möglichkeiten internationaler Zusammenarbeit und weltweiter Bemühungen um Frieden, die Trott hier beobachtete, bestimmten seine politischen Ziele. Ein erster Aufenthalt in England und damit der Beginn seiner großen Zuneigung zu diesem Land folgte Anfang 1929. Nach Stationen in Liverpool und London verbrachte Adam von Trott ein Trimester als Gaststudent am Mansfield College in Oxford. Er war beeindruckt vom politischen Realitätssinn der Engländer und fand in der britischen Labour-Bewegung ein wichtiges Vorbild.', 'Nach seiner Rückkehr setzte Trott sein Jurastudium in Berlin an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität fort. Daneben suchte er gezielt Kontakte zu Arbeitern und nahm an Diskussionen sozialistischer Zirkel teil. Ihn beunruhigten die soziale Not, die wachsende Arbeitslosigkeit und andere negative Auswirkungen der Weltwirtschaftskrise. Um sich besser auf sein Examen vorbereiten zu können, kehrte Trott zum Sommersemester 1930 nach Göttingen zurück. Besorgt verfolgte er weiterhin die politische Radikalisierung, vor allem das Erstarken der Nationalsozialisten. Bei den Reichstagswahlen im September 1930 wählte er, soeben wahlberechtigt geworden, die SPD. Er teilte ihre Grundsätze und erhoffte sich am ehesten von ihr eine Stabilisierung der Weimarer Republik.', 'Im Dezember 1930 bestand Adam von Trott sein juristisches Referendarexamen und promovierte ein halbes Jahr später mit einer Dissertation über \\"Hegels Staatsphilosophie und das internationale Recht\\" an der Universität Göttingen. Direkt danach trat er seinen Referendardienst am Amtsgericht in Nentershausen nahe Bebra an, unterbrach diesen jedoch im Oktober 1931, da er für ein zweijähriges Zusatzstudium in England beurlaubt worden war.', 'Als Rhodes-Stipendiat in Oxford (1931–1933).', 'Noch während seiner Examenszeit hatte sich Trott erfolgreich um ein Rhodes-Stipendium für einen Studienaufenthalt in Oxford beworben. Zur Begründung gab er an, seine „politische Kenntnis weiter ausbilden“ und mehr über die Entstehung der Labour Party aus der Gewerkschaftsbewegung und ihre Integration in das britische Staatsleben erfahren zu wollen.', 'Ab Oktober 1931 studierte Trott in Oxford am Balliol College, das als Politikerschmiede galt, die so genannten \\"Modern Greats\\", eine festgelegte Kombination aus den Fächern Philosophie, Politik und Volkswirtschaft. Diesen Studienzyklus, den er bereits nach zwei (statt wie gewöhnlich nach drei) Jahren mit dem Bachelor-of-Arts-Examen abschloss, hat Adam von Trott als sehr gewinnbringend beurteilt: Neben der Vermittlung politischer Allgemeinbildung würden hier Urteils- und Kritikfähigkeit sowie der praktische Sinn für Politik gefördert. Trott war in Oxford Mitglied mehrerer Clubs und Gesellschaften, unter anderem der Oxford Union Society, berühmt für ihre parlamentarische Debattenkultur, des international ausgerichteten Bryce Clubs, der philosophischen Jowett Society, die ihn sogar zu ihrem Präsidenten wählte, sowie – seinem besonderen Interesse entsprechend – des University Labour Clubs. Daneben unterhielt er Kontakte zu Dozenten und Studenten verschiedener Colleges, aus denen sich auch eine Reihe von Freundschaften entwickelten. Großen Eindruck machte auf ihn Mahatma Gandhi, den Trott gleich zu Beginn seiner Oxforder Zeit auf einer Diskussionsveranstaltung erlebte. In London lernte Adam von Trott in Harold Laski und Richard Henry Tawney zwei namhafte Denker der Labour-Bewegung kennen und mit Sir Stafford Cripps einen aufstrebenden Labour-Politiker, der in den folgenden Jahren sein Freund und politischer Mentor wurde.', 'Ungeachtet seines Studiums im Ausland blieb Trott ein Beobachter der krisenhaften politischen Verhältnisse in Deutschland. Im Spätsommer 1932 beteiligte er sich selbst in Berlin an sozialistischen Arbeitskreisen, die nach Wegen suchten, die Nationalsozialisten zurückzudrängen. Im Kreis der \\"Neuen Blätter für den Sozialismus\\" begegnete er dem dabei besonders engagierten SPD-Reichstagsabgeordneten Carlo Mierendorff. Zurückgekehrt nach England, bemühte sich Trott um Kontakte zwischen diesem Kreis und Vertretern der britischen Labour Party und warb auch öffentlich für die deutschen Sozialdemokraten.', 'Von der Ernennung Adolf Hitlers zum Reichskanzler erfuhr Adam von Trott in Oxford aus einer Abendzeitung. Seinem Freund Charles Collins zufolge habe er sofort das „schreckliche Desaster“ erkannt, das Deutschland nun befallen habe, und auch, dass sich seine eigenen Zukunftsaussichten „fundamental verändert“ hätten. Eine offene Opposition, so Collins, habe Trott für eine längere Zeit als unrealistisch betrachtet, es aber für notwendig gehalten, Regimegegner zu versammeln.', 'Referendarzeit (1933–1936).', 'Nach seinem Examen in Oxford setzte Trott ab Herbst 1933 seine juristische Referendarausbildung im politisch völlig veränderten Deutschland am Amtsgericht Rotenburg an der Fulda, am Landgericht Hanau und bei der Staatsanwaltschaft in Kassel fort. Für das obligatorische Anwaltspraktikum, das er in der Zeit zwischen Dezember 1934 und April 1935 absolvierte, wählte er eine von jüdischen Anwälten geführte Kanzlei in Berlin. Es folgten weitere Referendarstationen am Kasseler Großen Amtsgericht, in der Verwaltung einer Hamburger Reederei und am Oberlandesgericht Kassel. Zwei Monate musste er auch an einem von den Nationalsozialisten zu politisch-ideologischem und militärischem Drill eingeführten Referendarlager bei Jüterbog teilnehmen.', 'Trotz erheblichen Drucks verweigerte Trott die Anpassung an das neue Regime. Formulare, mit denen er sich zum Beitritt in den Berufsverband \\"Bund Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Juristen\\" und in die NSDAP verpflichten sollte, schickte er unausgefüllt zurück. Wegen seiner ablehnenden Einstellung zum Regime, die auch in einem Schulungszeugnis zur Sprache kam, wurde Adam von Trott nicht als Regierungsreferendar übernommen, und seine Zulassung zum Assessorexamen war lange Zeit gefährdet.', 'Ein Artikel im Manchester Guardian über antisemitische Verfolgung unter anderem in deutschen Gerichten bewog Trott im Februar 1934, in einem Leserbrief seine eigenen Gerichtserfahrungen anz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Dürer hatte das Nashorn selbst nie gesehen; der Holzschnitt basierte auf einer Beschreibung und der Skizze eines unbekannten Künstlers, der das Tier in Augenschein genommen hatte.', 'Das Panzernashorn.', 'Das abgebildete Nashorn war mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit das erste lebende Exemplar seiner Art seit dem 3. Jahrhundert, das in Europa zu sehen war; Belege weisen Nashörner in den Wildgehegen von Herrschern Roms nach, Domitian, Commodus und Caracalla sollen Tiere dieser Art besessen haben. Dürers Holzschnitt hat durch den rüstungsartigen Ausdruck des Dickhäuters vermutlich nicht unwesentlich dazu beigetragen, dass das asiatische \\"Rhinoceros unicornis\\" im Deutschen die Bezeichnung „Panzernashorn“ erhielt. Bis zur zweiten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts erachtete man seine Darstellung als eine naturgetreue Wiedergabe, und der Holzschnitt wurde mehrfach kopiert, neu gedruckt und vertrieben. Erst als in den 1740er und 1750er Jahren das Rhinozeros Clara in Europa gezeigt wurde, kamen zunehmend Abbildungen in Umlauf, die nach dem Leben gefertigt worden waren.', 'Geschenk aus Ostasien.', 'Am 20. Mai 1515 landete ein Nashorn im Hafen von Lissabon; es war der bis dahin ungewöhnlichste Import der erst seit wenigen Jahren bestehenden Seeroute nach Indien. Die Portugiesen waren erfolgreich gewesen, wo Columbus versagt hatte; auf den Spuren früherer portugiesischer Seefahrer waren sie der westafrikanischen Küste gefolgt, hatten das Kap der Guten Hoffnung umrundet und waren nach Durchquerung des Arabischen Meeres 1498 nach Indien gelangt. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten spielte Portugal eine wesentliche Rolle im lukrativen Gewürzhandel. Die Portugiesen eroberten unter Führung von Afonso de Albuquerque im November 1510 das zu Indien gehörige Goa und machten es zu ihrer wichtigsten Handelsniederlassung; weitere fünfzig befestigte Siedlungen entlang der indischen Westküste dienten als Handelsstützpunkte. Der Austausch offizieller Geschenke begleitete die Verhandlungen mit den lokalen Herrschern.', 'Afonso de Albuquerque, der Vertreter der portugiesischen Krone in Indien, hatte das Nashorn zu Beginn des Jahres 1514 von Sultan Muzafar II., dem Herrscher von Cambay (im heutigen Gujarat) als Bestandteil eines solchen diplomatischen Geschenkeaustausches erhalten. De Albuquerque beschloss, das Nashorn, in der Landessprache \\"ganda\\", seinem König, Manuel I. von Portugal, zum Geschenk zu machen. An Bord der „Nossa Senhora da Ajuda“ und in Begleitung zweier weiterer portugiesischer Schiffe verließ das Nashorn zusammen mit seinem indischen Wärter Ocem im Januar 1515 Goa und segelte mit kurzen Aufenthalten in Mosambik, St. Helena und auf den Azoren nach Lissabon. Nach einer Seereise von 120 Tagen wurde das Nashorn in der Nähe des sich im Bau befindlichen Belem-Turms an Land gebracht. Der Turm erhielt später an seiner Nordwestseite die Skulptur eines Nashornkopfes.', 'Das exotische Tier wurde in König Manuels I. Menagerie im Ribeira-Palast in Lissabon untergebracht. Manuel I. besaß eine umfangreiche Menagerie, die auch Elefanten umfasste. Nashörner waren in Europa seit Jahrhunderten nicht lebend gesehen worden und nahmen eher den Status eines mythischen Wesens ein. Am 3. Juni 1515 ließ Manuel I. einen jungen Elefanten und das Nashorn aufeinander treffen, um den Bericht von Plinius dem Älteren zu überprüfen, dass Elefanten und Nashörner erbitterte Gegner seien. Unter den Augen einer großen und lauten Menschenmenge, die sich versammelt hatte, um diesem Spektakel beizuwohnen, bewegte sich das Nashorn langsam und zielgerichtet in Richtung seines Gegners. Der junge Elefant dagegen, verwirrt von dem Getöse der ungewohnten Menschenmenge, floh in Panik vom Kampffeld, bevor es zu einer Auseinandersetzung zwischen den beiden Tieren kam.', 'Geschenk an Papst Leo X..', 'Das Nashorn blieb bis Ende des Jahres 1515 Bestandteil der Menagerie von Manuel I. Dann wurde es als Geschenk an den Medici-Papst Leo X. weitergereicht. Manuel I. lag daran, sich das Wohlwollen des Papstes zu sichern. Im 1494 abgeschlossenen Vertrag von Tordesillas hatte Papst Alexander VI., ein Vorgänger von Leo X., eine zirka 370 Meilen westlich der Azoren liegende Grenze als Demarkationslinie zwischen dem spanischen und portugiesischen Kolonialreich festgelegt. Damit war der amerikanische Kontinent aufgeteilt. Unzureichend geklärt blieb allerdings, wo in Ostasien diese Demarkationslinie verlief – dies war jedoch ausschlaggebend für die Frage, welchen Anteil Spanien und Portugal am lukrativen Gewürzhandel mit Ostasien haben würden. Bezüglich dieser Grenze zwischen den Einflussgebieten der beiden Länder fiel erneut dem Papst eine entscheidende Rolle zu – Anlass genug, sich seine Gunst durch Geschenke zu sichern. 1514 hatte Manuel I. dem Papst bereits den Indischen Elefanten Hanno zum Geschenk gemacht.', 'Das Nashorn von Lissabon war bereits vor seiner Reise nach Rom dort bekannt geworden. Der Florentiner Arzt und Dichter Giovanni Giacomo Penni hatte bereits kurz nach dem Eintreffen des Tiers in Lissabon einen Traktat in Versen mit dem Titel \\"Forma e natura e costumi de lo Rinocerothe\\" verfasst. Dieser erschien im Juli 1515 in Rom und ist nur in einem einzigen Exemplar erhalten, das sich in der \\"Bibliotheca Colombina\\" in Sevilla befindet. Er enthält auf dem Titelblatt einen Holzschnitt von einem Rhinozeros.', 'Im Dezember 1515 wurde das Nashorn mit einem neuen Halsband ausgestattet, es erhielt einen „grünen Samtkragen mit Rosen und vergoldeten Ösen“ und dazu eine „Kette von vergoldetem Eisen“. „Mit Fransen geschmückt“ wurde es zusammen mit anderen wertvollen Geschenken, wie Tafelsilbern und Gewürzen, per Schiff auf die Reise nach Rom geschickt. Die Fahrt wurde vor Marseille kurz unterbrochen. Der französische König Franz I., der sich zu dem Zeitpunkt in der Provence aufhielt, hatte gewünscht, das exotische Tier in Augenschein zu nehmen. Am 24. Januar präsentierte man ihm mit allerlei Pomp den Dickhäuter auf der Insel Château d’If in der Bucht von Marseille.', 'Es war das letzte Mal, dass das Panzernashorn Land betrat. In einem Sturm zerschellte das Segelschiff an der ligurischen Küste nördlich von La Spezia; das mit Ketten ans Deck gefesselte Nashorn ertrank. Der Kadaver wurde wenig später in der Nähe von Villefranche an die Küste gespült; die Haut kam zurück nach Lissabon. Mit Stroh ausgestopft und fachgerecht montiert schickte man das Tier erneut nach Rom, wo es nicht vor Februar 1516 eintraf.', 'Nachleben.', 'Das Präparat erregte bei weitem nicht die Aufmerksamkeit, die man dem lebenden Nashorn in Lissabon gezollt hatte. Gleichwohl malte Giovanni da Udine dem Papst das Nashorn in eine Ecke von dessen Palazzo Baldassini, und Raffael setzte später noch eine weitere Abbildung nach dem Exponat in ein Gemälde für die Loggien des Papstpalastes im Vatikan.', 'Der weitere Verbleib des ausgestopften Nashorns ist ungeklärt; diese Ungewissheit war Anregung für den 1996 erschienenen Roman \\"The Pope's Rhinoceros\\" von Lawrence Norfolk. Für die Annahme, dass die Medici es für ihre naturgeschichtliche Sammlung nach Florenz bringen ließen, gibt es keinen Beleg. Das Universitätsmuseum La Specola in Florenz besitzt ein ausgestopftes Nilpferd und ein Löwenpräparat, erworben von den Medici im 18. Jahrhundert; es gibt aber keinen Hinweis auf ein Rhinoceros in einer der fünf Florentiner naturgeschichtlichen Sammlungen. Möglicherweise wurde es bei der Plünderung Roms im Jahre 1527 zerstört. Kaum belegbar, aber häufig anzutreffen ist die Vermutung, das Präparat befinde sich noch im Vatikan.', 'Im fünften Buch seines Gargantua setzte François Rabelais (1483/1494–1553) einem Nashorn, das ihm ein \\"Heinrich Klerberg\\" „früher einmal gezeigt“ habe, ein literarisches Denkmal; er fand, es unterscheide sich kaum von einem Eber. Der Gewährsmann ist als Johannes Kleberger zu identifizieren, einen Kaufmann aus Nürnberg, der zur selben Zeit wie Rabelais in Lyon wohnte und als ein Freund der Künste bekannt war; 1526 hatte er sich von Dürer malen lassen.', 'Dürers Holzschnitt.', 'Der aus Mähren stammende und in Lissabon ansässige Valentim Fernandes sah das Nashorn kurz nach dessen Ankunft in der portugiesischen Hauptstadt und beschrieb es im Juni 1515 in einem Brief an einen Freund in Nürnberg. Der in deutscher Sprache geschriebene Originalbrief ist nicht erhalten. Eine Abschrift in italienischer Sprache wird in der Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florenz aufbewahrt. Ein zweiter Brief eines unbekannten Absenders mit einer Skizze wurde etwa um die gleiche Zeit von Lissabon nach Nürnberg gesandt und diente als Information über das Aussehen des wilden Tieres, vermerkt am oberen Bildrand des Holzschnittes von Dürer.', 'Die Entstehung des Holzschnitts.', 'Auf der Basis dieser beiden Quellen machte Dürer zwei Zeichnungen. Nach der zweiten Zeichnung entstand der Druckstock des Holzschnitts. Dürer hat ihn wahrscheinlich nicht selbst angefertigt, sondern einen „Formschneider“ damit beauftragt, den Druckstock nach der Zeichnung zu erstellen. Verwendet wurde vermutlich Birnenholz – ausreichend weich, um die feinteilige Wiedergabe zu ermöglichen, aber hart genug, um eine für den geschäftlichen Erfolg hinreichende Anzahl von Abzügen zu gewährleisten.', 'In seiner 1495 gegründeten Werkstatt druckte Dürer seine Grafiken im Eigenverlag und auf Vorrat. Vertrieben wurden sie über Händler, die seine Drucke auf Messen und Märkten feilboten. Die Entscheidung Dürers, das Tier in einem Holzschnitt und nicht als Kupferstich wiederzugeben, folgte womöglich einem kaufmännischen Kalkül. Kupferstiche sind zeitaufwendiger und deshalb deutlich teurer als Holzdrucke, allerdings nutzt der hölzerne Druckstock sich im Gegensatz zu dem aus Metall schneller ab. Die Darstellung eines Nashorns war ein ungewöhnliches Sujet, denn die Kunden fragten gewöhnlich Bilder mit religiösen Themen nach.

Die Schule wurde von den Nationalsozialisten 1939 geschlossen und nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs 1946 wiedereröffnet.', 'Geschichte.', 'Gründung durch Petrus Canisius 1596 in Freiburg im Üechtland.', 'Die Geschichte der Schule beginnt in Freiburg im Üechtland. Dort gründete der erste deutsche Jesuit, Petrus Canisius, ein Kolleg, dessen wechselvolle Geschichte in Sankt Blasien ihren vorläufigen Schlusspunkt gefunden hat. Obwohl der anfangs kleine Jesuitenorden, der 1540 von Ignatius von Loyola gegründet worden war, ursprünglich kein Interesse am Aufbau von Schulen hatte, da diese zu viele Ordensmitglieder als Lehrer erfordert hätte, entdeckten die Jesuiten recht bald, dass ihr Leitspruch „Omnia ad maiorem Dei gloriam“ („Alles zu größerer Ehre Gottes“) durch die Ausbildung von Jugendlichen insofern umgesetzt werden konnte, als hier noch recht früh im Leben der jungen Gläubigen die Glaubensgrundsätze vermittelt werden konnten. Der Jesuitenorden galt – aufgrund des unbedingten Gehorsams dem Papst gegenüber – zunächst als die universell einsetzbare „Armee“ des Papstes. Der Orden war auch sehr aktiv in der Gegenreformation und betrachtete dabei die Schulen als wichtiges Feld der Stärkung des katholischen Weltbildes gegen protestantische „Häretiker“.', 'Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts schließlich gründete Petrus Canisius, erster Provinzial der oberdeutschen Provinz des Ordens, nach Kollegien in Ingolstadt, Augsburg, München und Innsbruck das Kolleg Sankt Michael im schweizerischen Freiburg. 1596 wurde dieses Kolleg ein Vollgymnasium, 1597 verstarb Petrus Canisius in Freiburg.', '1773 wurde der Jesuitenorden von Papst Clemens XIV. aufgehoben; damit endete auch die Lehrtätigkeit in Freiburg.', 'Nach der Wiederzulassung des Ordens 1814 durch Papst Pius VII. wurde 1827 der Lehrbetrieb im Kolleg St. Michael wieder aufgenommen. Nur 20 Jahre später, 1847, wurde das nun deutsch-französische Kolleg nach konfessionellen Spannungen infolge des Sonderbundskrieges aus der Schweiz vertrieben; es wurde den Jesuiten in der Schweizer Verfassung von 1848 sogar verboten, irgendeine Tätigkeit in der Schweiz auszuüben. Erst 1973 wurde diese Vorschrift aufgehoben.', 'Stella Matutina Feldkirch 1856.', 'Im Jahr 1649 erhielt die Stadt Feldkirch im österreichischen Vorarlberg auf Wunsch des damaligen Fürstbischofs von Chur, Johann Flugi von Aspermont, eine Missionsstation mit zwei Jesuitenpatres, die bereits im folgenden Jahr zu einer Jesuitenschule mit 150 Schülern erweitert wurde und als „Collegium Societatis Jesu Veldkirchy, Patronus S.Nicolaus“ bis zum 10. November 1773, der Aufhebung des Ordens, erfolgreich bestand.', '1856 öffnete P. Clemens Faller SJ, ein ehemaliger Freiburger Kollegszögling, wieder in Feldkirch in einer neu gebauten, aber ungenutzten Kaserne das alte Kolleg unter dem Namen Stella Matutina (Morgenstern). Dieser Standort erwies sich als günstig: Eine kulturell breit gefächerte, anfangs etwa 250 Jungen umfassende Schülerschaft aus Deutschland, den Gebieten der habsburgischen Monarchie aber auch aus Frankreich, Großbritannien und Amerika wurde dort von 27 Jesuiten und weiteren Laien unterrichtet. Eine Ansiedlung in Frankreich oder in Deutschland wäre ab 1872 nicht mehr möglich gewesen, da dem Orden durch das bis 1917 gültige Jesuitengesetz jede Betätigung verboten war. Die Schule war bis 1868 eine staatliche Schule unter Leitung der Jesuiten, bis nach dem Entzug der staatlichen Genehmigung durch Unterstützung der deutschen Eltern der Schulbetrieb auf privater Basis weitergeführt werden konnte. 1898 wurde die Schule als österreichisches Gymnasium anerkannt. Der Erste Weltkrieg beschränkte die Übernationalität der Schule auf Österreich, Deutschland und die Schweiz. 1930 wurde die Stella als deutsche Auslandsschule anerkannt. Im Jahr 1931 wurden in Feldkirch fast 500 Schüler unterrichtet.', 'Die deutschen Schüler der Stella Matutina wurden durch die Tausend-Mark-Sperre, ein NS-Gesetz vom 27. Mai 1933 in allergrößte Schwierigkeiten gebracht. Danach mussten alle deutschen Reichsangehörigen vor einer Fahrt nach Österreich 1000 Reichsmark zahlen. Dieses Gesetz des nationalsozialistischen Staates hat das Verbleiben der deutschen Zöglinge in der österreichischen Stella stark gefährdet, da die deutschen Eltern nur noch schwer die Pension bezahlen konnten. Zudem wurde es immer fraglicher, ob die Eltern auch in Zukunft Erlaubnis bekämen, ihre schulpflichtigen Kinder im Ausland studieren zu lassen. Schließlich führte der finanzielle und politische Druck zum Umzug der deutschen Schüler in den Südschwarzwald. Am 20. März 1934 nahmen die 240 deutschen Buben und viele ihrer Lehrer und Erzieher, darunter Professor P. Alois Grimm, Präfekt P. Alfred Delp und Schuldirektor P. Otto Faller Abschied von Feldkirch.', 'Neueröffnung in St. Blasien 1934.', 'Das Kloster, das im 9. Jahrhundert erstmals urkundlich erwähnt und wahrscheinlich etwa im 11. Jahrhundert unabhängig wurde, galt als eines der wichtigsten schwäbischen Reformklöster und beeinflusste bis ins 12. Jahrhundert viele andere Klöster. Danach widmeten sich die Mönche dem Ausbau ihrer Grundherrschaft, die im 14. und 15. Jahrhundert ihre größte Ausdehnung erreichte. Das nunmehr vorderösterreichische Kloster, das von der Reformation nicht beeinflusst wurde, erlitt 1768 schwere Brandschäden. Der französische Architekt Pierre Michel d’Ixnard errichtete in der Regierungszeit des Fürstabtes Martin Gerbert zwischen 1768 und 1781 einen Kuppeldom.', 'Die Mönche von St. Blasien betreuten zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts 20 000 Seelen, unterhielten zahlreiche Volksschulen, Apotheken, ein Bankwesen für Kleinbauern, und betrieben drei Gymnasien in St. Blasien, Konstanz und im Kloster Sion in Klingnau. Manche arbeiteten als namhafte Wissenschaftler mit Verbindungen zu Universitäten im In- und Ausland. All dies war durch die drohende Säkularisation in Frage gestellt.', 'Die Säkularisation des Klosters St. Blasien war daher umstritten. Schleich berichtet von Versuchen im Frühling 1806, die Klöster St. Blasien und St. Peter „in einer den Zeitverhältnissen angemessenen Art“ zusammen bestehen zu lassen. Nach deren Scheitern erfolgte die Säkularisation im Herbst 1806. Danach diente das bisherige Klostergebäude als Maschinenfabrik, und als Spinnerei, die 1932 in Liquidation ging, bis 1934 der Jesuitenorden den 1806 in St. Blasien abgebrochenen Schulbetrieb wiederaufnahm.', 'An Ostern 1934 begann – nach einigen Diskussionen mit den bisherigen Einwohnern, den Angestellten einer im Gebäude untergebrachten Fabrik – der Unterricht der deutschen Schüler in den Gebäuden der ehemaligen Benediktinerabtei Kloster St. Blasien. Da die deutsche Abteilung in Feldkirch bereits 1924 die „Anerkennung als Deutsche Auslandsschule“ erlangt hatte, entsprach das St. Blasier Schulmodell im Wesentlichen dem in Feldkirch praktizierten. Jedoch wurde der Kollegsleitung das Leben zunehmend schwer gemacht: Sorge und Unsicherheit lagen über dem Kolleg. Man konnte sich nicht auf alle Zöglinge immer unbedingt verlassen.

Sie sollten eine Heimat haben, wenn sie sich im Kolleg mal heimatlos fühlten.

The system accepts as correct the query string, where all arguments are separated by commas. The words in prompt are crucial. Users need to prompt what they want to see, specifying artist names, media sources, or art styles to get desired results. Be descriptive in a manne similar to prompts provided below about what you want. It is more sensitive to precise wording. That includes adjectives and prepositions like “in front of [x]“, and “taken by [camera name]“. It also supports weights. By bracketing the words you can change their importance. For example, (rainy) would be twice as important compared to “rainy” for the model, and [rainy] would be half as important. Write a medium lenth prompt, like below. Too long and it would fail to generate, too short and it would generate crap. Be as detailed as possible and avoid both scenarios at any cost. As photographers and painters know, light has a huge effect on the final impression an image creates. Specify lighting conditions. Describe the type of light you want to see and the time of day it is. You don’t need complex vocabulary. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is that a text-to-image neural network interprets the prompt from up to down, i.e. what is listed at the beginning of the prompt is more significant than what is listed near the end of the prompt. So it is recommended to place the subject of prompt in the beginning, characteristical tags in the middle and misc tags like lighting or camera settings near the end. Tags must be separated by commas, commas are not allowed in the query (what needs to be drawn), because the system treats it as one big tag. Below few good examples are listed: Example 1: Stunning wooden house, by James McDonald and Joarc Architects, home, interior, octane render, deviantart, cinematic, key art, hyperrealism, sun light, sunrays, canon eos c 300, ƒ 1.8, 35 mm, 8k, medium - format print Example 2: Stunning concept art render of a mysterious magical forest with river passing through, epic concept art by barlowe wayne, ruan jia, light effect, volumetric light, 3d, ultra clear detailed, octane render, 8k, dark green, dark green and gray colour scheme Example 3: Stunning render of a piece of steak with boiled potatoes, depth of field. bokeh. soft light. by Yasmin Albatoul, Harry Fayt. centered. extremely detailed.

Er entstammte einer kleinbürgerlichen südrussischen Familie und war ab 1884 Arzt von Beruf, betrieb Medizin jedoch fast ausschließlich ehrenamtlich. Gleichzeitig schrieb und publizierte er zwischen 1880 und 1903 insgesamt über 600 literarische Werke. International ist Tschechow vor allem als Dramatiker durch seine Theaterstücke wie \\"Drei Schwestern\\", \\"Die Möwe\\" oder \\"Der Kirschgarten\\" bekannt. Mit der für ihn typischen, wertneutralen und zurückhaltenden Art, Aspekte aus dem Leben und der Denkweise der Menschen in der russischen Provinz darzustellen, gilt Tschechow als einer der bedeutendsten Autoren der russischen Literatur.', 'Leben.', 'Kindheit und Jugend.', 'Anton Tschechow wurde am 29. Januar 1860 in der südrussischen Hafenstadt Taganrog am Asowschen Meer geboren. Sein Vater, Pawel Jegorowitsch Tschechow (1825–1898), war Sohn eines ehemaligen leibeigenen Bauern aus dem Gouvernement Woronesch und betrieb als Kaufmann einen kleinen Billigwarenladen in Taganrog. Ebenfalls aus einer ehemals leibeigenen Bauernfamilie stammte Tschechows Mutter, Jewgenija Jakowlewna Tschechowa (geborene Morosowa; 1835–1919). Die Eheleute zogen insgesamt sechs Kinder groß: Neben Anton waren es die Söhne Alexander (1855–1913), Nikolai (1858–1889), Iwan (1861–1922) und Michail (1865–1936) sowie die Tochter Marija (1863–1957).', 'Der Kaufmannstitel des Vaters konnte nicht über die äußerst bescheidenen Umsätze seines Ladens hinwegtäuschen, was nicht zuletzt an der mangelnden Geschäftstüchtigkeit von Pawel Jegorowitsch lag, aber auch an der allgemein schlechten wirtschaftlichen Situation Taganrogs, das in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts seine einstige Bedeutung als Seehafen aufgrund der Versandung der Bucht merklich verloren hatte. Folglich wuchsen die Tschechow-Geschwister in armen und beengten Verhältnissen auf. Die Brüder einschließlich Anton hatten schon früh im Laden auszuhelfen; hinzu kam die strenge Religiosität und die musikalische Begeisterung des von Tschechow später vielfach als despotisch und autoritär beschriebenen Vaters, der seine Söhne zu täglichen Gesangsstunden in einem Kirchenchor zwang. Die Familie lebte zunächst in einem kleinen Haus in der Polizeiskaja uliza („Polizeistraße“) in Taganrog.', 'Trotz der bedrückenden finanziellen Situation legten Tschechows Eltern Wert darauf, ihren Kindern eine solide Allgemeinbildung zu ermöglichen: Mit acht Jahren wurde Anton in die Vorbereitungsklasse des Zweiten Taganroger Jungengymnasiums eingewiesen, das er dann von 1869 bis zum Abschluss 1879 besuchte. Insgesamt zeigte sich Anton dort als eher durchschnittlicher Schüler, der sogar zweimal (nämlich in der dritten und in der fünften Klasse) sitzen geblieben war. Dieser Umstand erscheint jedoch angesichts der systematischen Belastung der Brüder, die in unterrichtsfreier Zeit im Chor singen und in Vaters Laden arbeiten mussten, aber auch angesichts der äußerst autoritären Lehr- und Erziehungsmethoden an den Schulen im Russischen Kaiserreich der damaligen Zeit als wenig überraschend.', 'Schon als Gymnasiast zeigte Anton Tschechow, der sonst eher als zurückhaltend und reserviert galt, einen ausgeprägten Humor und viel Interesse an Schauspielerei und Literatur. So erwarb er sich in der Schule wegen seiner satirischen Kommentare und Unarten sowie der Fähigkeit, die Lehrer mit humorvollen Spitznamen zu bezeichnen, den Ruf eines Schelms. In den wenigen freien Stunden, die den Tschechow-Geschwistern zur Verfügung standen, pflegten die Brüder diverse Vorstellungen des Taganroger Stadttheaters zu besuchen und versuchten oft, zu Hause auf einer selbst konstruierten Bühne lustige Amateurstücke zu inszenieren. Ab 1877 war Anton außerdem regelmäßiger Gast in der kurz zuvor eingerichteten öffentlichen Bibliothek in Taganrog.', '1869 zog die Tschechow-Familie in ein neues Haus in der Monastyrskaja uliza („Klosterstraße“). Der schlecht kalkulierte Hauskauf durch Tschechows Vater und die stetig sinkenden Ladenumsätze verschärften dessen finanzielle Probleme in den nachfolgenden Jahren so sehr, dass er im Frühjahr 1876 mit seinem Laden einen Bankrott anmelden musste. Da dies zur damaligen Zeit eine drohende Inhaftierung bedeutete, blieb Pawel Jegorowitsch nichts anderes übrig, als den Laden aufzugeben und heimlich nach Moskau zu fliehen, wo sich seit Sommer 1875 bereits Alexander und Nikolai aufhielten. Wenige Monate später folgte ihm die Mutter mit den beiden jüngsten Kindern, während Anton und Iwan weiterhin aufs Taganroger Gymnasium zu gehen hatten. Ab dieser Zeit war Anton faktisch auf sich selbst angewiesen, denn die Tschechow-Familie hatte in Moskau zunächst keine regelmäßigen Einkünfte und war bitterer Armut ausgesetzt. Das Haus in Taganrog ging an einen der Gläubiger, Anton mietete dort lediglich eine Ecke zum Wohnen, Iwan fand vorläufig bei einer Tante Unterkunft, bis er im Herbst 1876 ebenfalls nach Moskau fortzog. Anton, der hartnäckig dem Abitur entgegenstrebte, blieb alleine zurück und hielt sich mit Verdiensten aus Nachhilfestunden sowie mit Ausverkauf des verbliebenen elterlichen Hausrats über Wasser; zudem schickte er einen Teil dieser dürftigen Einkünfte seiner Familie nach Moskau.', 'Jahre später äußerte er sich, mit erkennbarem Bezug auf seine Kindheit und Jugend sowie auf sein ungewollt frühes Erwachsenwerden, in einem Brief an seinen langjährigen Verleger Suworin wie folgt:', 'Nach dem Abitur 1879 wurde Tschechow von der Taganroger Stadtverwaltung ein Stipendium von 25 Rubel im Monat bewilligt und er reiste daraufhin gemeinsam mit zwei Schulkameraden nach Moskau, um dort – wie er sich schon lange zuvor vorgenommen hatte – ein Medizinstudium aufzunehmen.', 'Studium und literarische Anfänge.', 'Tschechows Laufbahn an der Kaiserlichen Moskauer Universität, an deren medizinischer Fakultät er sich kurz nach Ankunft in Moskau einschreiben ließ, dauerte von September 1879 bis zum erfolgreichen Abschluss im Sommer 1884. Die siebenköpfige Familie Tschechow wechselte in dieser Zeit mehrfach die Wohnung und musste sich insbesondere in den ersten Monaten mit überaus beengten Wohnverhältnissen zufriedengeben, was Anton immense Schwierigkeiten bei der Prüfungsvorbereitung brachte. Diese wurden noch dadurch verschärft, dass er sich schon seit seinen frühen Studienjahren dem Schreiben widmete, das sich angesichts der Armut, in der die Familie leben musste, dann auch als eine wichtige Einnahmequelle erwiesen hatte.', 'Die Anfänge Tschechows als Autor gehen auf seine Taganroger Zeit zurück: Bereits als Jugendlicher versuchte er, kurze Miniaturen, Parodien und Anekdoten sowie possenhafte und witzige Geschichten zu schreiben. Über den älteren Bruder Alexander, der zu jener Zeit in Moskau lebte und sich dort ebenfalls als Gelegenheitsautor in humoristischen Zeitungen und Zeitschriften versuchte, schickte Anton einige dieser Miniaturen (von denen keine erhalten ist) an diverse Moskauer Redaktionen, zunächst jedoch ohne Erfolg. Um 1878 verfasste Tschechow erstmals auch ein Bühnenstück, das den Titel \\"Vaterlos\\" erhalten sollte und der von Tschechow hoch verehrten Star-Schauspielerin Marija Jermolowa gewidmet war. Auch dieses Stück fand trotz intensiver nachträglicher Überarbeitungen keinen Zuspruch in Moskau und galt seitdem als vernichtet; erst 1920 wurde es als Manuskript ohne Titel entdeckt und 1923 erstmals veröffentlicht (im Ausland erlangte dieses Stück seither als \\"Platonow\\" Bekanntheit).', 'Tschechow selbst bezeichnete später in seinen Briefen mehrfach den Zeitraum zwischen 1878 und 1880 als Beginn seiner eigentlichen schriftstellerischen Tätigkeit, konnte allerdings keine genaueren Zeitangaben machen. Die ersten noch heute erhaltenen Tschechowschen Publikationen stammen aus dem Jahr 1880, als es Anton nach etlichen erfolglosen Versuchen schließlich gelang, zehn humoristische Kurzgeschichten und Miniaturen in der Sankt Petersburger Zeitschrift \\"Strekosa\\" (zu deutsch „Libelle“) zu veröffentlichen. 1881 und 1882 folgten ähnliche Publikationen in zahlreichen mehr oder weniger bekannten Humor- und Satireheften, darunter den Zeitschriften \\"Budilnik\\" („Der Wecker“), \\"Sritel\\" („Zuschauer“), \\"Moskwa\\" („Moskau“) und \\"Swet i teni\\" („Licht und Schatten“).', 'Über die schwierigen Umstände, unter denen Tschechow seine Frühwerke schuf, geben einige Briefe aus der frühen Studienzeit des Autors Aufschluss. So schrieb er im August 1883 in einem Begleitbrief zu Kurzerzählungen für eine Zeitschrift an den Redakteur:', 'Der halb scherzhafte, selbstironische Ton, den Tschechow in diesem Schreiben anschlägt, ist für den Großteil seiner Briefe sowohl aus der Studienzeit als auch aus den späteren Jahren charakteristisch. Nicht nur die Wohnsituation und allgemein die ärmlichen Verhältnisse erschwerten die Arbeit; hinzu kamen die oft schlechte Zahlungsmoral der Zeitungsredakteure, redaktionelle Vorgaben (bei der Zeitschrift \\"Oskolki\\" („Splitter“) z. B. waren nicht mehr als 100 Zeilen pro Geschichte erlaubt) und nicht zuletzt die staatliche Zensur. Letztere nahm in Russland gerade in den 1880er-Jahren nach der Ermordung des Zaren Alexander II. eine äußerst strenge und oft willkürliche Selektion aller für eine Publikation in der Presse vorgesehenen Texte vor. So scheiterte etwa das erste gedruckte Buch Tschechows, die 1882 angefertigte Erzählungssammlung \\"Schelmerei\\" (russisch ), an der Zensur und gilt seitdem als verschollen.', 'Obwohl er alle Prüfungen ordentlich ablegte und innerhalb der vorgegebenen fünf Jahre das Arztdiplom erlangte, galt Tschechow als ein eher durchschnittlicher, wenig strebsamer Student.

Jahrhundert', 'Gestorben im 6. Jahrhundert', 'Grieche (Antike)', 'Mann', 'Neuplatoniker', 'Philosoph (6. Jahrhundert)', 'Philosoph (Antike)'], 'Simplikios von Kilikien (, ; * um 480; † um 560) war ein spätantiker griechischer Philosoph der neuplatonischen Richtung. Er lebte im Oströmischen Reich und trat vor allem als Kommentator von Schriften des Aristoteles hervor, die er neuplatonisch deutete. Gemäß der im spätantiken Neuplatonismus vorherrschenden Sichtweise hielt er Aristoteles für einen Platoniker und bemühte sich, platonische und aristotelische Lehren zu harmonisieren. Dabei ging es ihm auch um die Verteidigung der klassischen philosophischen Tradition und des religiösen Weltbilds der Neuplatoniker gegen christliche Kritik. Er erörterte die Beschaffenheit des Weltalls, bemühte sich um die Definition des Begriffs Materie, untersuchte das Phänomen Zeit und setzte sich mit dem Problem des Ursprungs der Übel auseinander. In seinem Kommentar zum \\"Handbüchlein\\" des Stoikers Epiktet, einer Einführung in die Ethik, stellte er die begründenden Prinzipien des aus seiner Sicht richtigen Handelns dar. Dabei legte er großes Gewicht auf die menschliche Fähigkeit zu einer selbstbestimmten Lebensführung und verteidigte die Willensfreiheit.', 'Im Spätmittelalter erzielte die Aristoteles-Kommentierung des Simplikios eine beträchtliche Nachwirkung. Moderne Altertumswissenschaftler schätzen seine Schriften als wertvolle Quellen für frühere Epochen der griechischen Philosophiegeschichte, insbesondere für die Zeit der Vorsokratiker, denn er hatte Zugang zu einer Fülle von heute verlorenem Material. Wegen seiner Gewissenhaftigkeit und Gründlichkeit in der Auseinandersetzung mit älteren Lehrmeinungen sowie seinen durchdachten Analysen und umsichtigen Stellungnahmen gilt er als einer der bedeutendsten Gelehrten seiner Zeit.', 'Leben.', 'Simplikios stammte aus Kilikien, einer Region an der Südküste Kleinasiens; ansonsten ist über seine Herkunft nichts bekannt. Seine philosophische Ausbildung erhielt er zunächst in Alexandria, wo der einflussreiche Neuplatoniker Ammonios Hermeiou sein Lehrer war. Wie Ammonios lebte Simplikios in der Tradition der alten griechischen Religion. Er gehörte also zu einer schrumpfenden Minderheit; im Oströmischen Reich herrschte schon seit langem die christliche Staatsreligion. Unter den Schülern des Ammonios waren eifrige Vertreter des paganen („heidnischen“) Glaubens, aber auch Christen. Ammonios ging religiösen Auseinandersetzungen aus dem Weg und bemühte sich in seiner Schule um ein relativ entspanntes Verhältnis zwischen den Religionen.', 'Später begab sich Simplikios nach Athen, wo sich die paganen Neuplatoniker traditionell schärfer von ihrer christlichen Umgebung abgrenzten als in Alexandria. Sein dortiger Lehrer war Damaskios, ein entschiedener Gegner des Christentums, der ebenfalls in Alexandria bei Ammonios studiert hatte und spätestens 515 der letzte Leiter (Scholarch) der neuplatonischen Philosophenschule in Athen wurde. Diese Schule, die Plutarch von Athen gegründet hatte, nahm für sich in Anspruch, die Tradition der Platonischen Akademie fortzusetzen. Sie blieb bis zuletzt ein Hort der paganen Religion, die für die dortigen Philosophen untrennbar mit dem Platonismus verbunden war. Nachdem die Aktivitäten der Neuplatoniker in Athen lange von den christlichen Kaisern geduldet worden waren, spitzte sich unter Kaiser Justinian der religiöse Gegensatz zu. Im Jahr 529 untersagte der Kaiser den paganen Lehrbetrieb, etwas später wiederholte und verschärfte er das Verbot. Die staatlichen Maßnahmen führten zur Schließung der Schule. Simplikios, Damaskios und fünf weitere Philosophen entschlossen sich zur Emigration. Vielleicht schon 531, spätestens 532 wanderten sie in das persische Sasanidenreich aus. Dort bot ihnen der seit September 531 regierende Großkönig Chosrau I. Zuflucht an seinem Hof in Ktesiphon, wo sie mit Toleranz rechnen konnten.', 'Chosrau nahm gegenüber den Neuplatonikern und der alten griechischen Religion eine wohlwollende Haltung ein; er förderte alle Bestrebungen, die der religiösen Einheit des Oströmischen Reichs entgegenwirkten und dieses damit schwächten. Dennoch waren die Philosophen bald von den Verhältnissen am persischen Hof enttäuscht. Als im Herbst 532 die Oströmer mit den Persern einen „Ewigen Frieden“ schlossen, bestand der Großkönig in einer der Klauseln des Friedensvertrags darauf, dass die Philosophen unbehelligt ins Oströmische Reich zurückkehren und dort an ihren religiösen Überzeugungen festhalten durften. Noch im selben Jahr verließen die Neuplatoniker das Perserreich.', 'Vielleicht ließ sich Simplikios nun in Carrhae nieder, einer im Grenzgebiet zum Perserreich gelegenen Stadt, und gründete dort eine neue platonische Schule. Diese erstmals 1984 von dem Gnosisforscher Michel Tardieu auf einem Kongress vorgetragene Hypothese hat seither beträchtlichen Anklang gefunden, ist aber auch auf Widerspruch gestoßen. Sie stützt sich auf Indizien wie den Umstand, dass Carrhae ein günstiges Umfeld bot, weil in der Bevölkerung der Stadt pagane Traditionen noch stark verwurzelt waren. Zugunsten der Hypothese wird vor allem geltend gemacht, dass dort noch im Jahr 943 eine griechische Philosophenschule bestand, wie einem Bericht des zeitgenössischen Gelehrten Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusain al-Masʿūdī zu entnehmen ist. Daneben existieren in der Forschung noch weitere Vermutungen, denen zufolge Simplikios nach Athen zurückkehrte, wieder nach Alexandria zog, sich mit seinem Lehrer Damaskios in Syrien niederließ oder fortan in seiner Heimatlandschaft Kilikien lebte.', 'Den Großteil seiner erhaltenen Werke – vielleicht sogar alle – verfasste Simplikios erst nach der Rückkehr aus dem Perserreich; offenbar stand ihm weiterhin eine reichhaltige Bibliothek zur Verfügung. Bei der Aristoteles-Kommentierung polemisierte er heftig gegen den christlichen Philosophen Johannes Philoponos, dem er Ruhmsucht und unberechtigte Kritik an der Kosmologie des Aristoteles vorwarf. Der Angegriffene hatte wie Simplikios bei Ammonios Hermeiou studiert. Daher legte Simplikios Wert auf die Feststellung, er kritisiere Philoponos zwar hart, hege aber keinen persönlichen Groll aus der Vergangenheit gegen ihn, denn er könne sich nicht erinnern, ihm jemals begegnet zu sein.', 'Wann Simplikios starb, ist unbekannt; gewöhnlich wird angenommen, dass er um die Mitte des 6. Jahrhunderts noch lebte. Sicher ist, dass er seinen Lehrer Damaskios, der im Jahr 538 noch am Leben war, überlebt hat. Häufig wird ohne weitere Begründung ein Todesjahr um 560 angegeben.', 'Werke.', 'Das umfangreiche, ausschließlich aus Kommentaren bestehende Œuvre des Simplikios ist nur teilweise erhalten geblieben. Zum erhaltenen Teil zählen die Kommentare zu drei Schriften des Aristoteles: den \\"Kategorien,\\" der \\"Physik\\" und der Abhandlung \\"Über den Himmel\\". Sie sind erst nach der Rückkehr aus dem Perserreich entstanden und zeugen von der Belesenheit und Sachkenntnis des Verfassers. Der \\"Physik\\"-Kommentar enthält zwei Exkurse, die in der modernen Forschung als \\"Corollarium de tempore\\" („Exkurs über die Zeit“) und \\"Corollarium de loco\\" („Exkurs über den Ort“) bezeichnet werden. Ferner kommentierte Simplikios die als \\"Encheiridion\\" \\"(Handbüchlein)\\" verbreitete Fassung der \\"Lehrgespräche\\" des Stoikers Epiktet. Das \\"Encheiridion\\" behandelt Grundsätze der Ethik, die im neuplatonischen Unterricht zur Propädeutik gehörten. Die dort beschriebenen Tugenden galten den Neuplatonikern als Voraussetzung für ein philosophisches Leben.', 'Diese Kommentare zählen zu den wertvollsten Quellen für die antike Philosophiegeschichte. Im Unterschied zu vielen anderen neuplatonischen Kommentarwerken handelt es sich nicht um Schülermitschriften aus Lehrveranstaltungen, sondern um Texte, die der Autor selbst schriftlich formuliert hat. Sie enthalten eine Fülle von Zitaten aus heute verlorenem Schrifttum und Darstellungen von Lehrmeinungen anderer Denker, über die anderweitig wenig oder nichts überliefert ist. Insbesondere ist Simplikios ein erheblicher Teil der Fragmente der Vorsokratiker zu verdanken, darunter die wichtigsten wörtlich überlieferten Stellen aus den Lehrgedichten des Parmenides (rund zwei Drittel der erhaltenen Verse) und des Empedokles. Groß ist auch seine Bedeutung als Vermittler von Gedankengut stoischer und peripatetischer Philosophen. Über die Auffassungen von Angehörigen der Platonischen Akademie sowie von Mittel- und Neuplatonikern und Pythagoreern liefert Simplikios ebenfalls zahlreiche wichtige Informationen. Manche seiner Berichte ermöglichen eine Rekonstruktion der Lehren, die in den verlorenen Schriften dieser Autoren dargelegt waren. Die Ausführlichkeit und Detailfülle seiner Werke ist vor dem Hintergrund der damaligen Verhältnisse zu sehen: Angesichts der Gefährdung der paganen Bildungsgüter durch militante christliche Kreise, die sich in der zwangsweisen Schließung der Athener Philosophenschule zeigte, versuchte er den Ertrag der jahrhundertelangen Bemühungen der Philosophen durch eine gründliche Darstellung für die Zukunft zu retten.', 'Die Aristoteles-Auslegung lässt erkennen, dass Simplikios im Umgang mit den Texten, mit denen er sich befasste, sehr umsichtig und gewissenhaft verfuhr. Er berücksichtigte auch philologische Aspekte, indem er Handschriften verglich und textkritische Bemühungen unternahm, um den authentischen Wortlaut zu ermitteln. Seine Sorgfalt bei der Auswertung seiner Quellen war für einen antiken Philosophen außergewöhnlich. Als Merkmale eines guten Kommentators nannte er Unvoreingenommenheit und Vertrautheit nicht nur mit der einzelnen interpretierten Schrift, sondern mit dem Gesamtwerk und der Ausdrucksweise des Aristoteles. Ausdrücklich missbilligte er Autoritätshörigkeit. Er stellte fest, ein guter Kommentator versuche nicht, alle Thesen des Aristoteles als richtig zu erweisen, als ob dieser unfehlbar wäre. Zwar schätzte er Aristoteles und betrachtete ihn als Platoniker, doch wahrte er Distanz, prüfte die aristotelischen Argumente und nahm teils zustimmend, teils ablehnend Stellung. Dabei setzte er sich auch mit den Ansichten früherer Kommentatoren wie Alexander von Aphrodisias und Iamblichos von Chalkis auseinander. Er berichtete über die Positionen seiner Vorgänger, deren Werke heute zum Teil verloren sind, und untersuchte sie auf ihre Plausibilität. Kritik an Thesen anerkannter Autoritäten übte er, wo es ihm nötig schien. Als besten Aristoteles-Kommentator bezeichnete er den Peripatetiker Eudemos von Rhodos, aus dessen heute verlorener \\"Physik\\" er viel Material durch seine Zitate für die Nachwelt gerettet hat.

Während in seinem Ursprungsland USA die Reaktionen der Kritiker zwiegespalten ausfielen, war die Resonanz in Deutschland überwiegend positiv. Obwohl der Film keinen renommierten Preis gewinnen konnte, gilt er als ein Klassiker und als Michael Manns Meisterwerk. Zudem diente er Kriminellen weltweit als Vorbild und Inspiration.', 'Handlung.', 'In Los Angeles ist Neil McCauley der Anführer einer Bande der überwiegend vorbestraften Gangster Chris Shiherlis, Michael „Slick“ Cheritto und Trejo. Zusammen mit dem zusätzlich engagierten Waingro überfallen sie einen Geldtransporter, aus dem McCauley zielgerichtet nur die Inhaberschuldverschreibungen der Investmentgesellschaft \\"Malibu Invest\\" stiehlt. Während des Raubes tötet der unbeherrschte Waingro ungeplant einen Wachmann, und die Gruppe sieht sich gezwungen, zwei weitere Wachleute zu erschießen, um keine Zeugen zu hinterlassen. Als McCauley mit seinen Partnern den unzuverlässigen Waingro nach dem Raub umbringen will, kann dieser über einen Parkplatz fliehen.', 'Noch am Tatort zieht Lieutenant Vincent Hanna vom Raub- und Morddezernat des Los Angeles Police Department – dem nur wenig Zeit für seine dritte Ehefrau Justine und deren Tochter Lauren bleibt – die Ermittlung des dreifachen Raubmords an sich. Bei den aufwendigen Nachforschungen kommt er eher zufällig durch einen Informanten auf die Spur von „Slick“. Bei der anschließenden Observation werden die Beamten auch auf McCauley selbst aufmerksam.', 'Der Hintermann und Hehler Nate vereinbart derweil stellvertretend für McCauley den Rückkauf der Schuldverschreibungen mit Roger Van Zant, dem Leiter von \\"Malibu Invest\\". Dieser sagt Nate zu, die – vollständig versicherten – Verschreibungen für sechzig Prozent ihres Marktwertes zurückzunehmen. Bei der Übergabe versucht Van Zant jedoch, McCauley liquidieren zu lassen. Dieser kann jedoch mit Hilfe seiner Bande die beiden Attentäter töten und unverletzt entkommen, um danach telefonisch Van Zants Leben zu bedrohen.', 'Um den Zusammenhalt seiner Gang bemüht, zwingt McCauley wenig später die Frau seines spielsüchtigen Bandenmitglieds Chris Shiherlis, eine Liebesaffäre zu beenden und stattdessen Chris Rückhalt zu geben. Der in den Seitensprung involvierte und polizeibekannte Alan Marciano wird kurz darauf von Hanna unter Druck gesetzt und zur Herausgabe von Informationen über Chris Shiherlis genötigt. Nach einem durch Waingro begangenen Prostituiertenmord wird Hanna auch in diese Ermittlungen eingeschaltet, weil die gesicherten Spuren auf eine ganze Mordserie hindeuten. Waingro bietet kurz darauf Mittelsmännern seine kriminellen Dienste an und wird von diesen an Van Zant vermittelt.', 'Beim nächsten Coup möchte Hanna die Verbrecher inflagranti überführen und vor Ort festnehmen. Weil ein Polizist versehentlich Lärm macht, bricht der vorsichtige McCauley den Einbruch aber vorzeitig ab. Hanna lässt die Beteiligten in Anbetracht des zu erwartend geringen Strafmaßes, und auf eine bessere Gelegenheit vertrauend, entkommen. Sich der Observation nun gewahr, setzen die Gangster anschließend alles daran, ihre Beschatter zu identifizieren. Aus sicherer Entfernung gelingt es ihnen, nach einer vorgetäuschten Planung eines Überfalls, Fotos von Hanna und seinen Beamten zu machen.', 'Trotz Nates Warnung, dass McCauley durch Hannas Ermittlungen nunmehr besonders gefährlich lebt, möchte McCauley mit seiner Bande noch einen letzten Banküberfall begehen und dabei etwa 12 Millionen US-Dollar erbeuten. Sowohl mit dieser Absicht als auch mit seinem Entschluss, die Liebesbeziehung zu seiner kürzlich kennengelernten Freundin Eady fortzusetzen, vernachlässigt McCauley bewusst seinen eigenen beruflichen Grundsatz, sich niemals an etwas zu „hängen, das du nicht innerhalb von 30 Sekunden problemlos wieder vergessen kannst, wenn du merkst, dass dir der Boden zu heiß wird.“', 'McCauley folgt Hannas spontaner Einladung zu einem Gespräch in ein Restaurant. Unter anderem erklären sie einander gegenseitig, dass sie das Leben des jeweils anderen bei einer weiteren Konfrontation nicht verschonen würden, obwohl sie durchaus Respekt voreinander haben. Wenig später können McCauley, Cheritto und Shiherlis die sie überwachenden Polizeibeamten abschütteln.', 'Als der von langer Hand vorbereitete Banküberfall unmittelbar bevorsteht, steigt der als Fahrer vorgesehene Trejo kurzfristig aus dem Plan aus, da er sich sicher ist, von der Polizei observiert zu werden. McCauley engagiert daher spontan seinen ehemaligen Mithäftling Donald Breedan – den er zufällig in einem Restaurant trifft – als Fahrer des für die Flucht vorgesehenen Autos.', 'Der Raub des Bargeldes aus einer Bank in einem belebten Viertel von Los Angeles verläuft zunächst nach Plan. Da die Polizei über einen Informanten aber kurzfristig von dem Raub erfährt, treffen Hanna und seine Beamten bei der Bank ein, als Shiherlis noch nicht im Fahrzeug sitzt. Die Gang versucht, sich den Weg mit Sturmgewehren freizuschießen. Bei dem mehrminütigen Feuergefecht auf der Fox Plaza sterben Breedan und mehrere Polizeibeamte. McCauley, Cheritto und Shiherlis setzen ihre Flucht zu Fuß fort. Hanna kann Cheritto erschießen. McCauley entkommt mit dem verwundeten Shiherlis und einem Teil der Beute. Von Nate erhält Shiherlis eine neue Identität und McCauley einen neuen Fluchtweg.', 'McCauley erfährt vom tödlich verletzten Trejo, dass dieser durch Waingro – der inzwischen für Van Zant arbeitet – gezwungen wurde, vom geplanten Banküberfall zu erzählen, und erlöst ihn mit einem Gnadenschuss. Danach erschießt er Van Zant – dessen Adresse ihm Nate mitgeteilt hat – in dessen Wohnung. Eady erkennt erst bei der Rückkehr McCauleys in ihr Apartment dessen wahres Wesen und erklärt sich nur widerwillig dazu bereit, ihn in sein Fluchtziel Neuseeland zu begleiten.', 'Charlene Shiherlis lässt sich durch die Polizei dazu zwingen, Chris anzulocken, verhilft ihm dann aber – die Ermittler austricksend – durch ein heimliches Handzeichen zur Flucht. In der Annahme, die Spur zu den Gangstern verloren zu haben, begibt sich Hanna in sein Hotelzimmer. Dort findet er Lauren nach einem Suizidversuch schwer verletzt vor, woraufhin er sie in ein Krankenhaus bringt. Nachdem sie außer Lebensgefahr ist, beschließen er und Justine – welche inzwischen einen anderen Liebhaber hat – ihre Beziehung zu beenden.', 'McCauley ist mit Eady bereits zum Flughafen unterwegs, als er sich nach einer Information von Nate entschließt, noch einen spontanen Abstecher in das Flughafenhotel zu machen, in dem sich Waingro versteckt hält. Er erschießt Waingro, der bereits von der Polizei observiert wird. Der eintreffende Hanna sieht den Bandenchef. McCauley lässt Eady zurück und flüchtet zu Fuß auf das Gelände des Flughafens von L.A. Zwischen den Anflugslichtern liefern sich beide für einige Minuten ein Katz- und Mausspiel, ehe Hanna – durch McCauleys plötzlich erscheinenden Schatten auf ihn aufmerksam geworden – mehrere Schüsse auf seinen Kontrahenten abgeben kann. McCauley stirbt, während Hanna respektvoll seine Hand hält.', 'Entstehung.', 'Drehbuch- und Projektentwicklung.', 'Das Drehbuch beruht auf wahren Begebenheiten, in deren Mittelpunkt die Konfrontation des Polizisten Chuck Adamson mit dem Kriminellen Neil McCauley im Chicago der 1960er Jahre steht. Während einer polizeilichen Verfolgung kam es zu einem ungeplanten Aufeinandertreffen beider und es entwickelte sich dabei eine vertrauliche Konversation, in der auch Adamsons damalige private Probleme zur Sprache kamen. Adamson und McCauley trennten sich anschließend unter gegenseitigen Respektsbekundungen voneinander, wohlwissend und billigend, dass ein weiteres Aufeinandertreffen mit dem Tode eines der beiden Beteiligten enden würde. Nach einem Banküberfall mit anschließender Verfolgungsjagd kam es 1963 schließlich zu einem letzten Feuergefecht, in dessen Folge McCauley durch mehrfache Schüsse von Adamson getötet wurde.', 'Michael Mann erfuhr von dieser Geschichte erstmals Ende der 1970er oder Anfang der 1980er Jahre durch den befreundeten Adamson. Nach eigenen Angaben war er von dem respektvollen und von Professionalität geprägten Verhältnis zwischen Adamson und McCauley so sehr beeindruckt, dass er kurz darauf beschloss, ein entsprechendes Drehbuch für einen Film zu schreiben. In einem 1983 gegebenen Presseinterview erklärte Mann, das Drehbuch auch filmisch umsetzen zu wollen. 1989 schließlich entstand daraus der Fernsehfilm \\"Showdown in L.A.\\" (Originaltitel: \\"L.A. Takedown\\"), der als Pilotfilm für eine Fernsehserie namens \\"Hanna\\" vorgesehen war. Für den Dreh des Films standen Mann lediglich zehn Tage für die Vorproduktion und 19 Tage für die eigentlichen Aufnahmen zur Verfügung. Die weiterführende Fernsehserie wurde jedoch nicht verwirklicht, weil sich der Regie führende Mann nicht mit NBC-Programmdirektor Brandon Tartikoff über die Besetzung der Hauptrolle einigen konnte.', 'Für \\"Heat\\" schrieb Mann große Teile des Drehbuchs neu und kam mit dem befreundeten Produzenten Art Linson überein, den Film mit Mann als Regisseur gemeinsam zu produzieren. Nachdem Pacino und De Niro für die Hauptrollen gewonnen werden konnten, stimmte das Filmstudio Warner Bros. dem Projekt zu. Das Drehbuch beinhaltet circa 70 Sprechrollen und das Budget für \\"Heat\\" betrug etwa 60 Millionen US-Dollar.

Erste Baufunde stammen aus der Römerzeit. Vermutlich befand sich dort ein kleiner Wacht- und Siedlungsposten. Hierfür kommen zwei Namen, oder in Betracht. Reste der Siedlung befinden sich unter der St.-Martins-Kirche und dem Antoniterkloster. Ob nach Abzug der Römer ein neuer \\"Herr\\" die Siedlung übernahm, ist nicht feststellbar. Da der Einflussbereich des Klosters St. Gallen kurz vor Memmingen endete, müssen vor allem im Kloster Augsburg Unterlagen über die Fluren vorhanden gewesen sein. Durch die mehrmalige Zerstörung der Augsburger Bibliothek gingen Dokumente verloren. Aufgrund der Endung \\"-ingen\\" kann allerdings von einer Namensgebung um das 4. und 5. Jahrhundert ausgegangen werden. Ziemlich sicher ist, dass im 5. Jahrhundert eine alemannische Siedlung gegründet wurde. Ab dem 7. Jahrhundert wird ein fränkischer Königshof vermutet. Damals könnte eine erste Kirche erbaut worden sein. Unter der Frauenkirche befinden sich Reste romanischen beziehungsweise frühromanischen Baustils. Der Name \\"Memmingen\\" ist vermutlich auf einen Königshof bei der Siedlung des \\"Mammo\\" zurückzuführen. Im Laufe der Zeit verschwand die Siedlung und nur der Name blieb erhalten.', 'Durch die Salzstraße von Böhmen, Österreich und München nach Lindau und die Straße von Norddeutschland in die Schweiz und nach Italien erlangte der Handelsposten zunehmende Bedeutung. Erstmals erwähnt wurde der Ort \\"Mammingin\\" im Jahre 1128 in einer im Kloster Ochsenhausen verfassten Urkunde, in der die Verhandlung eines Streitfalles und ein Landtag von 1099 erwähnt werden. Daraus ist zu schließen, dass Memmingen für die Welfen bereits ein bedeutender Ort war, da Landtage nur in machtpolitischen Zentren stattfanden. Der Ort Memmingen ist relativ schnell zur Stadt herangewachsen. Verschiedene Funde bei Ausgrabungen 1991 im Bereich des Antoniterklosters und des Marktplatzes belegen, dass die Besiedelung im 9. Jahrhundert noch relativ klein war. Im 11. und 12. Jahrhundert ist allerdings ein hohes Bevölkerungswachstum erkennbar. Der andauernde Streit mit den Welfen veranlasste 1130 den Staufer Friedrich von Schwaben, neben Memmingen auch Ravensburg und Altdorf (heute Weingarten) zu zerstören. Memmingen brannte damals bis auf die Grundmauern ab. Noch heute zeugen Aschespuren im Boden von diesem Ereignis. 1142 siegelte Heinrich der Löwe in der. Im Februar 1151 trafen sich in der Stadt Heinrich der Löwe, Welf VI., der Stauferherzog Friedrich II. von Schwaben, Graf Adolf II., Graf Gottfried von Ronsberg sowie mehrere staufische und welfische Ministeriale, um einen Kompromiss im Streit zwischen den Welfen und den Staufern zu finden. Dies zeigt, welch hohen Rang der Ort bereits zu dieser Zeit gehabt haben muss.', 'Im Jahr 1158 wurde Memmingen durch Herzog Welf VI. zur Stadt erhoben. Nach dessen Tod ging 1191 die Stadt an den Staufer Konrad, den Bruder Kaiser Heinrichs VI. Der letzte Staufer, Konradin von Hohenstaufen, starb 1268 in Neapel. Damit fiel die Stadt an das Reich zurück, wurde 1286 durch den römisch-deutschen König Rudolf I. von Habsburg zur Freien Reichsstadt erklärt und damit direkt dem deutschen König unterstellt. Sie erhielt die königliche Bestätigung des tradierten Stadtrechts und wurde mit Überlinger Recht ausgestattet. Zehn Jahre später erhielt Memmingen zusätzlich das Ulmer Recht. Vom 14. bis zum 16. Jahrhundert war die Blütezeit der Reichsstadt. Dies zeigte sich vor allem in der regen Bautätigkeit, im Handel und im Aufblühen der Kultur.', '1445 wurde die Stadt letztmals mit einem Mauergürtel, dem Ulmer Tor und vier neuen Türmen erweitert. 1478 errichtete Peter Fort eine Papiermühle. 1480 eröffnete Albrecht Kunne aus Duderstadt ein Druck-Offizin, das bis 1520 rund 200 verschiedene Drucke veröffentlichte.

Sie wurde vom deutschen Unternehmen Rheinmetall entwickelt und wird von dessen Tochtergesellschaft \\"Rheinmetall Waffe Munition\\", das zur Division \\"Weapon and Ammunition\\" gehört, produziert. Lizenzen für die Produktion wurden international an mehrere Unternehmen vergeben.', 'Die Kanone ist die erste moderne Glattrohrkanone, die in der westlichen Welt nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg entwickelt wurde. Zunächst als Hauptbewaffnung des deutschen Leopard 2 eingeführt und später im US-amerikanischen M1 Abrams sowie weiteren Panzertypen verwendet, ist sie heute in den Panzern der Armeen vieler Länder im Einsatz. Bisher wird sie in drei Varianten, der \\"L/44\\", der \\"L/55\\" und der \\"L/55A1\\", verbaut. Die Entwicklung einer dritten Variante, der \\"LLR L/47\\" für luftverlastbare Fahrzeuge, ist abgeschlossen, sie wird aber bisher noch in keinem Waffensystem eingesetzt.', 'Hintergrund.', 'Mit der Verschärfung des Kalten Krieges und dem Auftauchen neuer Kampfpanzer auf Seiten des Warschauer Paktes wuchsen Mitte der 1960er-Jahre auf Seiten der Bundeswehr Zweifel, ob die existierenden Kanonen, insbesondere die weit verbreitete gezogene 105-mm-Kanone Royal Ordnance L7, noch in der Lage wären, diese neuen Gegner erfolgreich zu bekämpfen. Diese Gegner waren insbesondere die T-64- und T-72-Panzer, die mit einer damals neuartigen Verbundpanzerung und 125-mm-Glattrohrkanonen ausgerüstet waren.', 'Die von den USA und Deutschland gemeinsam begonnene Entwicklung des Kampfpanzer 70 scheiterte und wurde 1969 eingestellt. Nachdem sich auch die geplante 152-mm-Kanone, die die Rohrrakete MGM-51 abfeuern konnte, für Deutschland als der falsche Weg herausstellte, entschloss sich Rheinmetall, einen neuen Weg bei der Entwicklung der Kanone einzuschlagen, der in der Sowjetunion bereits 1962 durch die Einführung der 115-mm-Glattrohrkanone U-5TS beim T-62 vorgezeichnet wurde.', 'Entwicklung und Aufbau.', '120-mm-Glattrohrkanone L/44.', 'Die 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone \\"L/44\\" entstand in enger Zusammenarbeit mit der Bundeswehr speziell für den Einsatz im Leopard 2, der damals entwickelt wurde. Die Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeit bei Rheinmetall begann im Jahr 1965 unter der Federführung von Raimund Germershausen und zog sich über zehn Jahre hin. Rheinmetall konnte bereits nach zweijähriger Entwicklungszeit nachweisen, dass die Glattrohrkanone flügelstabilisierte Geschosse mit großer Präzision verschießen konnte.', 'Als die Kanone 1975 fertig war, wurde von Rheinmetall und den Fahrzeugherstellern in einem trinationalen Vergleichsschießen gezeigt, dass sie ihren westlichen Wettbewerbern mit gezogenen Läufen, nämlich der US-amerikanischen 105-mm- und der britischen 110-mm-Kanone, überlegen war. So lag die die ballistische Leistung 60 % über der 105-mm-Kanone. Mit dem Zulauf des Leopard 2 zur Truppe war so eine im Westen vollkommen neue Waffentechnik verfügbar.', 'Der erste Lizenznehmer der \\"L/44\\"-Kanone, General Dynamics, führte sie 1986 als \\"M256\\" bei der \\"A1\\"-Version des M1 Abrams ein. Sie ersetzte dort die gezogene 105-mm-Kanone \\"M68A1\\". Die \\"L/44\\" ist zur Nachrüstung und damit Kampfwertsteigerung von Leopard 1 geeignet, die ebenfalls mit einer gezogenen 105-mm-Kanone \\"(L7A3)\\" ausgestattet sind.', 'Die Kanone hat ein Kaliber von 120 Millimetern. Die namensgebende Kaliberlänge 44 ergibt damit eine Rohrlänge von 5280 mm, was annähernd der Länge der \\"L7A3\\" des Leopard 1 entspricht. Das Rohr wiegt dabei 1190 Kilogramm und die komplette Waffenanlage 3780 Kilogramm.', 'Das kaltgereckte Vollrohr ist für einen Konstruktionsgasdruck von 7100 bar ausgelegt und erhielt eine Autofrettage. Als Werkstoff wurde ein hochfester, vakuum-umgeschmolzener Stahl verwendet. Im Vergleich zur L7A3-Kanone wurde die Dehngrenze des Stahls um mehr als 20 Prozent auf 1,03 Gigapascal erhöht. Aufgrund der hohen Leistung der Munition und der damit einhergehenden hohen thermischen und erosiven Belastung ist das Rohr zur Erhöhung der Haltbarkeit innen hartverchromt. Anfängliche Probleme mit dieser Hartverchromung verzögerten die Entwicklung der Kanone.', 'Um eine Verformung durch Sonneneinstrahlung möglichst gering zu halten, besitzt das Rohr eine Rohrschutzhülle aus doppelwandigem und ausgeschäumtem glasfaserverstärktem Kunststoff (GFK). GFK wurde hier erstmalig im Waffenbau verwendet und wurde auch gewählt, um durch die geringe Masse die Dynamik der Waffenanlage möglichst wenig zu beeinträchtigen. Der Rauchabsauger ist ebenfalls aus GFK gefertigt.', 'Die Kanone ist auf Schildzapfen gelagert; der Höhenrichtbereich beträgt beim Einbau im Leopard 2 minus 9 Grad bis plus 20 Grad. Der Verschluss der Kanone ist ein Fallkeilverschluss mit vorgesteuerter Öffner- und Auswerfermechanik. Das Schließen übernimmt eine Schließfeder. Beim Ausfall der Systeme kann der Verschluss auch von Hand geöffnet oder verschlossen werden. Die Waffe wird elektrisch abgefeuert. Eine Notabfeuerung mittels induktivem Stoßgenerator ist möglich. Die Rücklaufeinrichtung des Rohres besteht aus zwei hydraulischen Rohrbremsen mit einer Bremshöchstkraft von 600 Kilonewton (kN). Der Rücklaufweg des Rohres ist mit nominal 340 mm (maximal 370 mm) annähernd äquivalent zur gezogenen 105-mm-Kanone mit 280 mm. Der Rohrvorholer arbeitet mit einem hydropneumatischen System. Das Bodenstück ist mit der Rücklaufeinrichtung fest verbunden und mit einem Bajonettgewinde mit dem Rohr verschraubt. Aufgrund dieser Bauweise kann das Rohr in etwa 30 Minuten gewechselt werden. Die Kanone ist weder mit einer Mündungsbremse noch mit einem Mündungsfeuerdämpfer ausgerüstet.', 'Waffenanlage und Munition.', 'Die Kanone ist Bestandteil einer vollstabilisierten Waffenanlage. Als Entwicklungsziel wurde eine Waffenanlage mit Kanone mit größerem Kaliber als 105 mm, die unter weitestgehender Beibehaltung der Abmessungen leistungsfähiger und zielgenauer sein sollte, formuliert.', 'Die Entwicklungsvorgaben dieser Waffenanlage waren eine große effektive Kampfentfernung, eine hohe Trefferwahrscheinlichkeit beim ersten Schuss und eine gute Durchschlagsleistung auch gegen moderne Verbund- oder Reaktivpanzerungen. Die Kosten der gesamten Waffenanlage lagen laut ursprünglicher Preisaufstellung bei rund sieben Prozent der Gesamtkosten des Leopard 2.', 'Der Feldjustierkollimator aus den Vorserienfahrzeugen des Leopard 2 entfiel bis 1991 in der Serienproduktion. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt wurde ein deutlich verbesserter Feldjustierspiegel eingebaut und an allen Glattrohrkanonen nachgerüstet.', 'Da die Munition, die parallel zur Waffenanlage von Rheinmetall mitentwickelt wurde, nicht den stabilisierenden Drall eines Laufes mit Zügen und Feldern erhält, wird sie über ein Leitwerk aus Aluminium (bei neueren Munitionsarten aus Stahl) stabilisiert. Die Mündungsgeschwindigkeit beträgt mit Wuchtgeschossen, beispielsweise der \\"DM 33\\", bis zu 1640 Meter pro Sekunde (m/s). Die Mündungsenergie dieses Geschosses liegt damit bei rund 9,8 Megajoule (MJ). Die Lebensdauer des Rohres wurde ursprünglich mit 500 „Standardschuss“ spezifiziert. Durch die Verwendung anderer Munitionssorten, höherer Gasdrücke und abrasiverer Treibladungen sinkt die Lebensdauer allerdings auf unter 300 Schuss.', '120-mm-Glattrohrkanone L/55.', 'Durch die Weiterentwicklung des internationalen Panzerbaus mit der Einführung wirkungsvollerer Reaktivpanzerungen in den 1980er-Jahren und die Entwicklung von rohrverschießbaren Lenkwaffen mit einer Reichweite von bis zu fünf Kilometern wurde eine Verbesserung der Feuerkraft aus Sicht der Bundeswehr unumgänglich. Nachdem die Entwicklung von Rheinmetall für eine noch leistungsfähigere 140-mm-Glattrohrkanone, der sogenannten \\"NPzK-140\\", insbesondere auf Grund der Tatsache, dass die Panzertürme hätten ersetzt werden müssen, keine Aussicht auf eine Serienreife hatte, wurde entschieden, die L/44 weiterzuentwickeln.', 'Die Weiterentwicklung der L/44 wurde die \\"L/55\\". Sie ist nicht nur um 25 Prozent länger und ermöglicht eine noch höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit, sondern brachte auch andere Weiterentwicklungen mit sich. Die L/55 ist so konstruiert, dass sie gemäß dem \\"Interface Control Document\\" (ICD) eine identische Geometrie der Kammer aufweist wie die L/44 und mindestens für die gleichen Gasdrücke geeignet ist. Damit kann Munition der L/44 auch in der L/55 verwendet werden. Außerdem war ein Entwicklungsziel, dass die neue Kanone ohne große Änderungen in den Serienturm des Leopard 2 nachgerüstet werden kann. Im Jahr 1998 war sie schließlich für den Einsatz verfügbar, nachdem Rheinmetall 1997 die Erprobung zusammen mit der \\"DM-53\\"-Munition (auch \\"LKE II\\" genannt) abgeschlossen hatte. Die Rohre sind ausschließlich Neufertigungen; eine Verlängerung der L/44-Rohre ist nicht möglich. Die Nebeneffekte der Kopflastigkeit, das ungünstigere Fahrverhalten im Gelände und bebauten Gebieten sowie die häufiger notwendige Überprüfung der Justierung mit der Feldjustieranlage wurden als vertretbar eingestuft.', 'Die L/55 ist für größere Gasdrücke ausgelegt, ermöglicht dadurch eine noch höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit und damit Durchschlagsfähigkeit der Geschosse. Außerdem wurden die Außengeometrie (Wandstärke) des Rohres sowie die Fertigungsabläufe optimiert, um das sonst ungünstige Schwingungsverhalten der Waffe bei der Schussabgabe zu verbessern. So erhält auch der hintere Teil der L/55 nun eine zweistufige Autofrettage. Auf eine Hartverchromung der Laufverlängerung im Mündungsbereich wird aufgrund der Erkenntnisse über die beim Schuss entstehenden und die Lebensdauer der Verchromung beeinträchtigenden Transversalwellen verzichtet. Für die L/55 wurde auch die Feldjustieranlage weiterentwickelt, die durch eine Änderung des Feldjustierspiegels an der Rohrmündung einen besseren Schwingungsausgleich bietet. Mit der Feldjustieranlage kann der Richtschütze die Justierung der Waffenanlage überprüfen und die aktuelle Verbiegung des Waffenrohres ermitteln und so die Justierung der Richtanlage kor: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

La nature de l’environnement (acteurs, facteurs, nature des institutions, disponibilité des informations, nature des canaux de communication, etc..) sont autant d’éléments qui vont conditionner la création d’entreprises.

La différence entre incertitude et risque réside dans le niveau de prévisibilité des résultats futurs. Le risque est une situation où les résultats futurs peuvent être anticipés avec une certaine probabilité. Par exemple, si une entreprise investit dans un projet connu et éprouvé, elle peut prévoir les résultats futurs avec une certaine fiabilité, même s'il y a des risques liés à des facteurs externes. En revanche, l'incertitude est une situation où les résultats futurs ne peuvent pas être anticipés avec certitude, car il y a trop de variables inconnues et imprévisibles. C'est souvent le cas des situations nouvelles ou des secteurs en constante évolution, où les modèles d'affaires sont en flux constant. Dans le contexte du risque, l'innovation se manifeste souvent sous la forme d'améliorations incrémentales, basées sur des connaissances et des compétences existantes. Les entreprises ont tendance à investir dans des projets innovants qui apportent un certain niveau de certitude quant à leur succès. Ainsi, elles peuvent anticiper les risques et les récompenses liés à ces projets. Cela est particulièrement vrai pour les grandes entreprises, qui ont souvent des ressources importantes pour investir dans la recherche et le développement. En revanche, l'innovation dans un contexte d'incertitude implique souvent des ruptures radicales, qui peuvent avoir un impact transformateur sur le marché et remettre en question les modèles d'affaires existants. Ces types d'innovations sont souvent liés à des startups ou des petites entreprises qui ont une plus grande tolérance à l'échec et sont souvent plus agiles et adaptables à l'évolution rapide des marchés. En résumé, l'innovation peut se manifester dans différents contextes, mais son impact et son niveau de perturbation sont liés au niveau d'incertitude ou de risque du contexte environnant. Les grandes entreprises ont tendance à innover dans un contexte de risque, tandis que les startups et les PME sont plus à l'aise avec l'incertitude et la rupture."},{"instruction":"Peux-tu me recommander un livre sur la gouvernance informatique ?","output":"Oui, je peux vous recommander \\"The Corporate Governance of Information Technology\\" de Jerry N.

Jahrhundert)'], 'Anton Pawlowitsch Tschechow [] ( (), wissenschaftliche Transliteration \\"\\"; in englischen Texten auch \\"Chekhov\\"; * in Taganrog, Russland; † in Badenweiler, Deutsches Reich) war ein russischer Schriftsteller, Novellist und Dramatiker. Er entstammte einer kleinbürgerlichen südrussischen Familie und war ab 1884 Arzt von Beruf, betrieb Medizin jedoch fast ausschließlich ehrenamtlich. Gleichzeitig schrieb und publizierte er zwischen 1880 und 1903 insgesamt über 600 literarische Werke. International ist Tschechow vor allem als Dramatiker durch seine Theaterstücke wie \\"Drei Schwestern\\", \\"Die Möwe\\" oder \\"Der Kirschgarten\\" bekannt. Mit der für ihn typischen, wertneutralen und zurückhaltenden Art, Aspekte aus dem Leben und der Denkweise der Menschen in der russischen Provinz darzustellen, gilt Tschechow als einer der bedeutendsten Autoren der russischen Literatur.', 'Leben.', 'Kindheit und Jugend.', 'Anton Tschechow wurde am 29. Januar 1860 in der südrussischen Hafenstadt Taganrog am Asowschen Meer geboren. Sein Vater, Pawel Jegorowitsch Tschechow (1825–1898), war Sohn eines ehemaligen leibeigenen Bauern aus dem Gouvernement Woronesch und betrieb als Kaufmann einen kleinen Billigwarenladen in Taganrog. Ebenfalls aus einer ehemals leibeigenen Bauernfamilie stammte Tschechows Mutter, Jewgenija Jakowlewna Tschechowa (geborene Morosowa; 1835–1919). Die Eheleute zogen insgesamt sechs Kinder groß: Neben Anton waren es die Söhne Alexander (1855–1913), Nikolai (1858–1889), Iwan (1861–1922) und Michail (1865–1936) sowie die Tochter Marija (1863–1957).', 'Der Kaufmannstitel des Vaters konnte nicht über die äußerst bescheidenen Umsätze seines Ladens hinwegtäuschen, was nicht zuletzt an der mangelnden Geschäftstüchtigkeit von Pawel Jegorowitsch lag, aber auch an der allgemein schlechten wirtschaftlichen Situation Taganrogs, das in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts seine einstige Bedeutung als Seehafen aufgrund der Versandung der Bucht merklich verloren hatte. Folglich wuchsen die Tschechow-Geschwister in armen und beengten Verhältnissen auf. Die Brüder einschließlich Anton hatten schon früh im Laden auszuhelfen; hinzu kam die strenge Religiosität und die musikalische Begeisterung des von Tschechow später vielfach als despotisch und autoritär beschriebenen Vaters, der seine Söhne zu täglichen Gesangsstunden in einem Kirchenchor zwang. Die Familie lebte zunächst in einem kleinen Haus in der Polizeiskaja uliza („Polizeistraße“) in Taganrog.', 'Trotz der bedrückenden finanziellen Situation legten Tschechows Eltern Wert darauf, ihren Kindern eine solide Allgemeinbildung zu ermöglichen: Mit acht Jahren wurde Anton in die Vorbereitungsklasse des Zweiten Taganroger Jungengymnasiums eingewiesen, das er dann von 1869 bis zum Abschluss 1879 besuchte. Insgesamt zeigte sich Anton dort als eher durchschnittlicher Schüler, der sogar zweimal (nämlich in der dritten und in der fünften Klasse) sitzen geblieben war. Dieser Umstand erscheint jedoch angesichts der systematischen Belastung der Brüder, die in unterrichtsfreier Zeit im Chor singen und in Vaters Laden arbeiten mussten, aber auch angesichts der äußerst autoritären Lehr- und Erziehungsmethoden an den Schulen im Russischen Kaiserreich der damaligen Zeit als wenig überraschend.', 'Schon als Gymnasiast zeigte Anton Tschechow, der sonst eher als zurückhaltend und reserviert galt, einen ausgeprägten Humor und viel Interesse an Schauspielerei und Literatur. So erwarb er sich in der Schule wegen seiner satirischen Kommentare und Unarten sowie der Fähigkeit, die Lehrer mit humorvollen Spitznamen zu bezeichnen, den Ruf eines Schelms. In den wenigen freien Stunden, die den Tschechow-Geschwistern zur Verfügung standen, pflegten die Brüder diverse Vorstellungen des Taganroger Stadttheaters zu besuchen und versuchten oft, zu Hause auf einer selbst konstruierten Bühne lustige Amateurstücke zu inszenieren. Ab 1877 war Anton außerdem regelmäßiger Gast in der kurz zuvor eingerichteten öffentlichen Bibliothek in Taganrog.', '1869 zog die Tschechow-Familie in ein neues Haus in der Monastyrskaja uliza („Klosterstraße“). Der schlecht kalkulierte Hauskauf durch Tschechows Vater und die stetig sinkenden Ladenumsätze verschärften dessen finanzielle Probleme in den nachfolgenden Jahren so sehr, dass er im Frühjahr 1876 mit seinem Laden einen Bankrott anmelden musste. Da dies zur damaligen Zeit eine drohende Inhaftierung bedeutete, blieb Pawel Jegorowitsch nichts anderes übrig, als den Laden aufzugeben und heimlich nach Moskau zu fliehen, wo sich seit Sommer 1875 bereits Alexander und Nikolai aufhielten. Wenige Monate später folgte ihm die Mutter mit den beiden jüngsten Kindern, während Anton und Iwan weiterhin aufs Taganroger Gymnasium zu gehen hatten. Ab dieser Zeit war Anton faktisch auf sich selbst angewiesen, denn die Tschechow-Familie hatte in Moskau zunächst keine regelmäßigen Einkünfte und war bitterer Armut ausgesetzt. Das Haus in Taganrog ging an einen der Gläubiger, Anton mietete dort lediglich eine Ecke zum Wohnen, Iwan fand vorläufig bei einer Tante Unterkunft, bis er im Herbst 1876 ebenfalls nach Moskau fortzog. Anton, der hartnäckig dem Abitur entgegenstrebte, blieb alleine zurück und hielt sich mit Verdiensten aus Nachhilfestunden sowie mit Ausverkauf des verbliebenen elterlichen Hausrats über Wasser; zudem schickte er einen Teil dieser dürftigen Einkünfte seiner Familie nach Moskau.', 'Jahre später äußerte er sich, mit erkennbarem Bezug auf seine Kindheit und Jugend sowie auf sein ungewollt frühes Erwachsenwerden, in einem Brief an seinen langjährigen Verleger Suworin wie folgt:', 'Nach dem Abitur 1879 wurde Tschechow von der Taganroger Stadtverwaltung ein Stipendium von 25 Rubel im Monat bewilligt und er reiste daraufhin gemeinsam mit zwei Schulkameraden nach Moskau, um dort – wie er sich schon lange zuvor vorgenommen hatte – ein Medizinstudium aufzunehmen.', 'Studium und literarische Anfänge.', 'Tschechows Laufbahn an der Kaiserlichen Moskauer Universität, an deren medizinischer Fakultät er sich kurz nach Ankunft in Moskau einschreiben ließ, dauerte von September 1879 bis zum erfolgreichen Abschluss im Sommer 1884. Die siebenköpfige Familie Tschechow wechselte in dieser Zeit mehrfach die Wohnung und musste sich insbesondere in den ersten Monaten mit überaus beengten Wohnverhältnissen zufriedengeben, was Anton immense Schwierigkeiten bei der Prüfungsvorbereitung brachte. Diese wurden noch dadurch verschärft, dass er sich schon seit seinen frühen Studienjahren dem Schreiben widmete, das sich angesichts der Armut, in der die Familie leben musste, dann auch als eine wichtige Einnahmequelle erwiesen hatte.', 'Die Anfänge Tschechows als Autor gehen auf seine Taganroger Zeit zurück: Bereits als Jugendlicher versuchte er, kurze Miniaturen, Parodien und Anekdoten sowie possenhafte und witzige Geschichten zu schreiben. Über den älteren Bruder Alexander, der zu jener Zeit in Moskau lebte und sich dort ebenfalls als Gelegenheitsautor in humoristischen Zeitungen und Zeitschriften versuchte, schickte Anton einige dieser Miniaturen (von denen keine erhalten ist) an diverse Moskauer Redaktionen, zunächst jedoch ohne Erfolg. Um 1878 verfasste Tschechow erstmals auch ein Bühnenstück, das den Titel \\"Vaterlos\\" erhalten sollte und der von Tschechow hoch verehrten Star-Schauspielerin Marija Jermolowa gewidmet war. Auch dieses Stück fand trotz intensiver nachträglicher Überarbeitungen keinen Zuspruch in Moskau und galt seitdem als vernichtet; erst 1920 wurde es als Manuskript ohne Titel entdeckt und 1923 erstmals veröffentlicht (im Ausland erlangte dieses Stück seither als \\"Platonow\\" Bekanntheit).', 'Tschechow selbst bezeichnete später in seinen Briefen mehrfach den Zeitraum zwischen 1878 und 1880 als Beginn seiner eigentlichen schriftstellerischen Tätigkeit, konnte allerdings keine genaueren Zeitangaben machen. Die ersten noch heute erhaltenen Tschechowschen Publikationen stammen aus dem Jahr 1880, als es Anton nach etlichen erfolglosen Versuchen schließlich gelang, zehn humoristische Kurzgeschichten und Miniaturen in der Sankt Petersburger Zeitschrift \\"Strekosa\\" (zu deutsch „Libelle“) zu veröffentlichen. 1881 und 1882 folgten ähnliche Publikationen in zahlreichen mehr oder weniger bekannten Humor- und Satireheften, darunter den Zeitschriften \\"Budilnik\\" („Der Wecker“), \\"Sritel\\" („Zuschauer“), \\"Moskwa\\" („Moskau“) und \\"Swet i teni\\" („Licht und Schatten“).', 'Über die schwierigen Umstände, unter denen Tschechow seine Frühwerke schuf, geben einige Briefe aus der frühen Studienzeit des Autors Aufschluss. So schrieb er im August 1883 in einem Begleitbrief zu Kurzerzählungen für eine Zeitschrift an den Redakteur:', 'Der halb scherzhafte, selbstironische Ton, den Tschechow in diesem Schreiben anschlägt, ist für den Großteil seiner Briefe sowohl aus der Studienzeit als auch aus den späteren Jahren charakteristisch. Nicht nur die Wohnsituation und allgemein die ärmlichen Verhältnisse erschwerten die Arbeit; hinzu kamen die oft schlechte Zahlungsmoral der Zeitungsredakteure, redaktionelle Vorgaben (bei der Zeitschrift \\"Oskolki\\" („Splitter“) z. B. waren nicht mehr als 100 Zeilen pro Geschichte erlaubt) und nicht zuletzt die staatliche Zensur. Letztere nahm in Russland gerade in den 1880er-Jahren nach der Ermordung des Zaren Alexander II. eine äußerst strenge und oft willkürliche Selektion aller für eine Publikation in der Presse vorgesehenen Texte vor. So scheiterte etwa das erste gedruckte Buch Tschechows, die 1882 angefertigte Erzählungssammlung \\"Schelmerei\\" (russisch ), an der Zensur und gilt seitdem als verschollen.', 'Obwohl er alle Prüfungen ordentlich ablegte und innerhalb der vorgegebenen fünf Jahre das Arztdiplom erlangte, galt Tschechow als ein eher durchschnittlicher, wenig strebsamer Student.

Dort gründete der erste deutsche Jesuit, Petrus Canisius, ein Kolleg, dessen wechselvolle Geschichte in Sankt Blasien ihren vorläufigen Schlusspunkt gefunden hat. Obwohl der anfangs kleine Jesuitenorden, der 1540 von Ignatius von Loyola gegründet worden war, ursprünglich kein Interesse am Aufbau von Schulen hatte, da diese zu viele Ordensmitglieder als Lehrer erfordert hätte, entdeckten die Jesuiten recht bald, dass ihr Leitspruch „Omnia ad maiorem Dei gloriam“ („Alles zu größerer Ehre Gottes“) durch die Ausbildung von Jugendlichen insofern umgesetzt werden konnte, als hier noch recht früh im Leben der jungen Gläubigen die Glaubensgrundsätze vermittelt werden konnten. Der Jesuitenorden galt – aufgrund des unbedingten Gehorsams dem Papst gegenüber – zunächst als die universell einsetzbare „Armee“ des Papstes. Der Orden war auch sehr aktiv in der Gegenreformation und betrachtete dabei die Schulen als wichtiges Feld der Stärkung des katholischen Weltbildes gegen protestantische „Häretiker“.', 'Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts schließlich gründete Petrus Canisius, erster Provinzial der oberdeutschen Provinz des Ordens, nach Kollegien in Ingolstadt, Augsburg, München und Innsbruck das Kolleg Sankt Michael im schweizerischen Freiburg. 1596 wurde dieses Kolleg ein Vollgymnasium, 1597 verstarb Petrus Canisius in Freiburg.', '1773 wurde der Jesuitenorden von Papst Clemens XIV. aufgehoben; damit endete auch die Lehrtätigkeit in Freiburg.', 'Nach der Wiederzulassung des Ordens 1814 durch Papst Pius VII. wurde 1827 der Lehrbetrieb im Kolleg St. Michael wieder aufgenommen. Nur 20 Jahre später, 1847, wurde das nun deutsch-französische Kolleg nach konfessionellen Spannungen infolge des Sonderbundskrieges aus der Schweiz vertrieben; es wurde den Jesuiten in der Schweizer Verfassung von 1848 sogar verboten, irgendeine Tätigkeit in der Schweiz auszuüben. Erst 1973 wurde diese Vorschrift aufgehoben.', 'Stella Matutina Feldkirch 1856.', 'Im Jahr 1649 erhielt die Stadt Feldkirch im österreichischen Vorarlberg auf Wunsch des damaligen Fürstbischofs von Chur, Johann Flugi von Aspermont, eine Missionsstation mit zwei Jesuitenpatres, die bereits im folgenden Jahr zu einer Jesuitenschule mit 150 Schülern erweitert wurde und als „Collegium Societatis Jesu Veldkirchy, Patronus S.Nicolaus“ bis zum 10. November 1773, der Aufhebung des Ordens, erfolgreich bestand.', '1856 öffnete P. Clemens Faller SJ, ein ehemaliger Freiburger Kollegszögling, wieder in Feldkirch in einer neu gebauten, aber ungenutzten Kaserne das alte Kolleg unter dem Namen Stella Matutina (Morgenstern). Dieser Standort erwies sich als günstig: Eine kulturell breit gefächerte, anfangs etwa 250 Jungen umfassende Schülerschaft aus Deutschland, den Gebieten der habsburgischen Monarchie aber auch aus Frankreich, Großbritannien und Amerika wurde dort von 27 Jesuiten und weiteren Laien unterrichtet. Eine Ansiedlung in Frankreich oder in Deutschland wäre ab 1872 nicht mehr möglich gewesen, da dem Orden durch das bis 1917 gültige Jesuitengesetz jede Betätigung verboten war. Die Schule war bis 1868 eine staatliche Schule unter Leitung der Jesuiten, bis nach dem Entzug der staatlichen Genehmigung durch Unterstützung der deutschen Eltern der Schulbetrieb auf privater Basis weitergeführt werden konnte. 1898 wurde die Schule als österreichisches Gymnasium anerkannt. Der Erste Weltkrieg beschränkte die Übernationalität der Schule auf Österreich, Deutschland und die Schweiz. 1930 wurde die Stella als deutsche Auslandsschule anerkannt. Im Jahr 1931 wurden in Feldkirch fast 500 Schüler unterrichtet.', 'Die deutschen Schüler der Stella Matutina wurden durch die Tausend-Mark-Sperre, ein NS-Gesetz vom 27. Mai 1933 in allergrößte Schwierigkeiten gebracht. Danach mussten alle deutschen Reichsangehörigen vor einer Fahrt nach Österreich 1000 Reichsmark zahlen. Dieses Gesetz des nationalsozialistischen Staates hat das Verbleiben der deutschen Zöglinge in der österreichischen Stella stark gefährdet, da die deutschen Eltern nur noch schwer die Pension bezahlen konnten. Zudem wurde es immer fraglicher, ob die Eltern auch in Zukunft Erlaubnis bekämen, ihre schulpflichtigen Kinder im Ausland studieren zu lassen. Schließlich führte der finanzielle und politische Druck zum Umzug der deutschen Schüler in den Südschwarzwald. Am 20. März 1934 nahmen die 240 deutschen Buben und viele ihrer Lehrer und Erzieher, darunter Professor P. Alois Grimm, Präfekt P. Alfred Delp und Schuldirektor P. Otto Faller Abschied von Feldkirch.', 'Neueröffnung in St. Blasien 1934.', 'Das Kloster, das im 9. Jahrhundert erstmals urkundlich erwähnt und wahrscheinlich etwa im 11. Jahrhundert unabhängig wurde, galt als eines der wichtigsten schwäbischen Reformklöster und beeinflusste bis ins 12. Jahrhundert viele andere Klöster. Danach widmeten sich die Mönche dem Ausbau ihrer Grundherrschaft, die im 14. und 15. Jahrhundert ihre größte Ausdehnung erreichte. Das nunmehr vorderösterreichische Kloster, das von der Reformation nicht beeinflusst wurde, erlitt 1768 schwere Brandschäden. Der französische Architekt Pierre Michel d’Ixnard errichtete in der Regierungszeit des Fürstabtes Martin Gerbert zwischen 1768 und 1781 einen Kuppeldom.', 'Die Mönche von St. Blasien betreuten zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts 20 000 Seelen, unterhielten zahlreiche Volksschulen, Apotheken, ein Bankwesen für Kleinbauern, und betrieben drei Gymnasien in St. Blasien, Konstanz und im Kloster Sion in Klingnau. Manche arbeiteten als namhafte Wissenschaftler mit Verbindungen zu Universitäten im In- und Ausland. All dies war durch die drohende Säkularisation in Frage gestellt.', 'Die Säkularisation des Klosters St. Blasien war daher umstritten. Schleich berichtet von Versuchen im Frühling 1806, die Klöster St. Blasien und St. Peter „in einer den Zeitverhältnissen angemessenen Art“ zusammen bestehen zu lassen. Nach deren Scheitern erfolgte die Säkularisation im Herbst 1806. Danach diente das bisherige Klostergebäude als Maschinenfabrik, und als Spinnerei, die 1932 in Liquidation ging, bis 1934 der Jesuitenorden den 1806 in St. Blasien abgebrochenen Schulbetrieb wiederaufnahm.', 'An Ostern 1934 begann – nach einigen Diskussionen mit den bisherigen Einwohnern, den Angestellten einer im Gebäude untergebrachten Fabrik – der Unterricht der deutschen Schüler in den Gebäuden der ehemaligen Benediktinerabtei Kloster St. Blasien. Da die deutsche Abteilung in Feldkirch bereits 1924 die „Anerkennung als Deutsche Auslandsschule“ erlangt hatte, entsprach das St. Blasier Schulmodell im Wesentlichen dem in Feldkirch praktizierten. Jedoch wurde der Kollegsleitung das Leben zunehmend schwer gemacht: Sorge und Unsicherheit lagen über dem Kolleg. Man konnte sich nicht auf alle Zöglinge immer unbedingt verlassen. Es konnte vorkommen, dass einzelne durch die Gänge marschierten, anti-jesuitische Nazilieder singend. Manche Eltern wurden unsicher. Man konnte ihnen nicht schreiben, denn der Briefverkehr war weitgehend kontrolliert. Immer stärkere Restriktionen für die Abiturienten, die das Abitur nicht nur an einer anderen Schule (das Kolleg war nur genehmigt, nicht staatlich anerkannt), sondern auch in ihrem jeweiligen Heimatgebiet ablegen müssen, gefährdeten schon Mitte der 1930er-Jahre die Existenz des Kollegs, zumal etwa Beamtenkindern ab 1938 der Zugang zum Kolleg von staatlicher Seite verboten wurde.', 'Marianische Spiritualität und Marianische Kongregation.', 'In diesen schweren Jahren nahm man im Kolleg gerne Zuflucht bei der Marienverehrung. So predigte P. Dold 1935:', 'Seit Ignatius von Loyola war die geistige Ausrichtung der Jesuitenkollegien immer auch stark marianisch geprägt. Marienfeste wurden besonders gerne gefeiert und im Monat Mai fanden fast täglich Maiandachten zur Gottesmutter statt. Den Buben wurde das als Möglichkeit vorgestellt, wo sie ihre Sorgen, Hoffnungen, Probleme, Ängste und ihr Heimweh hintragen können. Sie sollten eine Heimat haben, wenn sie sich im Kolleg mal heimatlos fühlten. Das Kolleg St. Blasien hatte deshalb seit 1935 ein eigenes Gnadenbild der Wunderbaren Mutter Mater Ter Admirabilis in der Hauskapelle, wo die tägliche Messe stattfand. Ein Bild, das während der NS Verfolgungen und später in den schrecklichen Kriegsjahren vielen Halt und Hoffnung gegeben hat, was zahlreiche Briefe 1946–1950 an das Kolleg eindrucksvoll belegen.', 'Da die jesuitische Erziehungstradition mit der vom nationalsozialistischen Staat propagierten Modell nicht in Einklang zu bringen war, wurde die Schule nach nur fünf Jahren in St. Blasien am 9. März 1939 trotz starker Proteste von Erzbischof Dr. Conrad Gröber als eine der ersten im Erzbistum Freiburg von den Nationalsozialisten zwangsweise aufgelöst, obwohl sie in der Zeit davor nicht ganz frei von Anpassungen war: So wurde auf staatliche Anordnung zu Beginn des Schuljahres 1934 die nationale Flagge gehisst und das Horst-Wessel-Lied gesungen.

Auf die üblichen Reparaturarbeiten aller Fabrikate konnte man angesichts der damaligen Typenvielfalt nicht verzichten. Besitzer von JAP-Motoren und Riley-Sportwagen waren somit ein angestrebter Kundenkreis des Vaters, der sein Geschäft daher nach dem renommierten „Tourist Trophy“-Rennen auf der Isle of Man benannt hatte.', 'Zu diesem Zeitpunkt kränkelte Mike Hawthorn häufig. Es stellte sich heraus, dass er an einer Nierenkrankheit litt, was ihn wohl ständig behindern würde. An eine Mechanikerausbildung im Betrieb des Vaters nach Abschluss der Volksschule war daher nicht zu denken. Rheuma und Arthrose galten bereits damals als die typischen Berufskrankheiten infolge zugiger Werkstatthallen. Die besorgten Eltern dachten daher wahrscheinlich oft an die Zukunft ihres einzigen Sohnes, der rasch von der allgemeinen Motorsportbegeisterung jener Ära „angesteckt“ wurde. So beeilten sich Winnifred und Leslie Hawthorn, ihn nach Möglichkeit zu unterstützen. Denn in seiner Tuningwerkstatt südwestlich von London präparierte der Vater Sportwagen für Renneinsätze oder verkaufte sie an Privatiers. Außerdem versuchte sich Leslie bei Motorradrennen auf dem nahen Brooklands-Kurs. Die Vorbedingungen für eine erfolgversprechende Rennsportkarriere waren vor diesem Hintergrund gelegt. Ein 2009 herausgegebenes Buch, \\"Tales from the Toolbox: A Collection of Behind the Scenes Tales from Grand Prix Mechanics\\", betonte den wichtigen Aspekt des Einflusses des Umfeldes von Kfz-Werkstätten auf eine ganze Generation von Rennfahrern.', 'Der Einstieg in den Rennsport.', 'Als Mike Hawthorn 21 Jahre alt war, stellte der Vater ihm einen Riley-Sportwagen zur Verfügung. Außerdem ließ er es sich nicht nehmen, selbst als Teammanager seines Sohnes zu arbeiten. Sein eigentliches Renndebüt feierte Hawthorn am 2. September 1950, als er mit einem 1934er Riley Ulster Imp, KV 9475, in der 1100-cm³-Klasse bei den Brighton Speed Trials gewinnen konnte. Bereits 1951 trug der jüngere Hawthorn Rennduelle mit den anderen aufstrebenden Talenten des Vereinigten Königreichs aus: Peter Collins und Stirling Moss. So vermochte er in diesem Jahr mit seinem Wagen auf dem Goodwood Circuit die \\"Motor Sport Brooklands Memorial Trophy\\" gewinnen, die sich über das gesamte Jahr erstreckte. Darüber hinaus entschied er 1951 das \\"Ulster Trophy Handicap\\" auf dem Dundrod Circuit und die \\"Leinster Trophy\\" in Wicklow siegreich für sich.', 'Dadurch ermutigt entschloss sich Bob Chase, ein väterlicher und vermögender Freund der Familie, den fortan \\"„Farnham-Flyer“\\" genannten Mike Hawthorn mit einem Cooper-Bristol für Formel-2-Rennen zu melden.', 'Ohne Umwege in die Formel 1.', 'Da durch den Rückzug Alfa Romeos ein zu kleines Fahrerfeld befürchtet wurde, hatten die Verantwortlichen in jenem Jahr das Formel-1-Reglement bis zum Ende der Formel-1-Saison 1953 nach demjenigen der Formel 2 ausgeschrieben. Dies sollte möglichst viele Teams ermutigen, in die Weltmeisterschaftskonkurrenz einzutreten.', 'Gegen den Ferrari 500, der zu den handlichsten Rennwagen aller Zeiten gezählt wird, kämpften alle anderen Teams mit unterlegenem Material, da ihnen in der Regel 30 PS auf die Konkurrenz aus Maranello fehlten. Achtungserfolge konnten nur bei schwierigen Wetterbedingungen von Fahrern erzielt werden, die ein robustes und gut zu beherrschendes Fahrzeug zur Verfügung hatten. Schließlich gewann der Ferrari 500 vierzehn von 15 möglichen Rennen und benötigte keine besonderen Verbesserungen in den zwei Weltmeisterschaftsjahren, in denen er eingesetzt wurde. Lediglich eine leicht verlängerte Version mit veränderter Fahrzeugnase wurde für Hochgeschwindigkeitskurse vorgestellt.', 'So war Mike Hawthorn mit seinem Cooper T20 dann auch der aufstrebende Fahrer der Saison 1952: Er erkämpfte sich einen vierten Rang beim Grand Prix in Spa-Francorchamps und einen dritten Platz beim Grand Prix von Großbritannien in Silverstone sowie einen weiteren vierten Rang beim GP der Niederlande in Zandvoort. Damit rangierte er im Endklassement als bester Pilot, der keinen Ferrari steuerte, auf dem vierten Platz. Dies verschaffte ihm schon während der Saison den Respekt Enzo Ferraris.', 'Der Wechsel zu Ferrari.', 'Auf Empfehlung des motorsportbegeisterten Industriellen und späteren Teamchefs Tony Vandervell lud Enzo Ferrari den jungen Briten nach Modena ein. Dieser erschien mitsamt seinem Vater und einem Cooper-Bristol in Italien, um beide Modelle miteinander vergleichen zu können.', 'Aus dem Verständnis des \\"„Commendatore“\\" heraus ging es jedoch nicht um einen Test des Ferraris, sondern den des \\"Piloten\\". Daher verwies er ihn sichtlich verstimmt darauf, dass er den Cooper gerne weiterhin fahren könne, wenn es seinem Glauben nach das bessere Auto sei. Doch angesichts der guten Fahrleistungen Hawthorns konnte Enzo Ferrari seinen Ärger schnell vergessen. Hawthorn seinerseits war begeistert von dem Tipo 500 und beteuerte, dass er diesen Ferrari unbedingt fahren möchte.', 'Am nächsten Tag sollte in Modena ein außerhalb der Weltmeisterschaft stattfindender Grand Prix abgehalten werden. Daher plante man den Start Hawthorns mit einem untypischerweise in „British Racing Green“ lackierten Ferrari beim dortigen Training. Aus welchen Gründen auch immer – der grüne Ferrari wurde nicht fertig, sodass Hawthorn mit seinem Cooper am Rennen teilnahm. Dabei beging er allerdings den Fehler, unbedingt an die Rundenzeiten der Ferraris anknüpfen zu wollen. Mike Hawthorn wählte nach einer langen Geraden allzu optimistisch den Bremspunkt nach dem Tipo-500-Maßstab, sodass er mit 130 km/h in die Strohballen prallte und aus dem Monoposto geschleudert wurde. Mit schweren Rückenprellungen lieferte man ihn ins nächste Hospital ein. Dort verkündete ihm der Teammanager Ferraris, dass sich der „Chef“ freuen würde, wenn er für sie fahren könne.', 'Hawthorn, der lieber einen englischen Wagen pilotieren wollte (laut eigenem Bekunden in seiner Autobiografie), erbat sich zunächst Bedenkzeit. Da es keine bessere Alternative gab, unterzeichnete er jedoch.', 'Anstatt sich über diesen Aufstieg in das schon damals beste Team zu freuen, startete die britische Boulevard-Presse eine fast beispiellose Hetzkampagne. Man prangerte Hawthorn geradezu als Vaterlandsverräter an, der mit seinem Wechsel nach Italien seinem Militärdienst entgehen wolle. Selbst dem englischen Unterhaus war Hawthorns Weg nach Italien eine kurze Debatte wert. Dabei wurde außer Acht gelassen, dass er wegen seines chronischen Nierenleidens ohnehin vom Dienst an der Waffe freigestellt war. Doch der Anblick eines nach heutigen Begriffen zum Leistungssport fähigen, großgewachsenen Mannes, der vor Selbstbewusstsein nur so strotzte und keine äußeren Kennzeichen seines Leidens zeigte, war insbesondere für die rechte Presse Provokation genug. Lediglich ein Vorzeigen seiner medizinischen Atteste, die seine häufigen Nierenentzündungen belegten, brachte diese Kampagne zum Erliegen.', 'Mike Hawthorn, den daraufhin eine ihn selbst schützende Arroganz charakterisierte, beeilte sich, diese Irritationen vergessen zu machen. Schon bei seinem insgesamt neunten Formel-1-Grand-Prix schlug er beim GP von Frankreich 1953 in Reims nach einem erbitterten Windschatten-Duell über fast das ganze Rennen hinweg den großen Juan Manuel Fangio (Maserati). Erst in der letzten Kurve gelang Hawthorn das Überholmanöver, er bedankte sich damit bei seinem vierten Einsatz für das Vertrauen des \\"Commendatore\\". Zwei dritte Plätze bei den Großen Preisen von Deutschland und der Schweiz, zwei vierte Ränge in Argentinien und den Niederlanden, sowie ein fünfter Platz in Silverstone ließen ihn erneut auf dem vierten Rang der Weltmeisterschaft landen.', 'Abgerundet wurde dieses Jahr durch den Gewinn der 1953 erstmals ausgetragenen Sportwagen-Weltmeisterschaft, bei der er mit soliden Rennergebnissen an der Seite Alberto Ascaris und Giuseppe Farinas einen der Grundsteine für den Erfolg gelegt hatte. Er siegte als Partner von Farina beim 24-Stunden-Rennen von Spa-Francorchamps.', 'Die Formel-1-Saison 1954 schien einen Erfolg versprechenden Weg zu nehmen, als er im März des Jahres beim Grand Prix von Syrakus auf Sizilien einen folgenschweren Unfall hatte: Als vor ihm Onofre Marimón mit seinem Maserati verunglückte und über die Piste kreiselte, entzündeten sich die damals als Streckenbegrenzung aufgestellten Heuballen durch den brennenden Treibstoff. Hawthorn raste unweigerlich in dieses Flammeninferno und wurde nur mit Mühe von seinem Teamkollegen José Froilán González, der ebenfalls Verbrennungen erlitt und mit dem havarierten Wagen kollidiert war, aus dem Monoposto gezogen.', 'Hawthorn lag nach dem Unfall mit Verbrennungen zweiten und dritten Grades im Gesicht, an Armen und Oberschenkel zwei Monate lang in Rom und Mailand im Krankenhaus. Dem Veranstalter von Syrakus war dieser Vorfall offensichtlich so peinlich, dass er Hawthorn später eine 18-karätige Goldmedaille verlieh – in der heutigen Zeit ein undenkbares Eingeständnis der Sicherheitsmängel. Strohballen blieben bis in die 1960er-Jahre hinein bei vielen Autorennen und bis weit in die 1980er Jahre hinein auch bei Motorradrennen der Standard bei den Streckenbegrenzungen.', 'Gerade nach Farnham zurückgekehrt, verunglückte sein Vater Leslie Hawthorn tödlich auf der Rückfahrt von einem Rennen in Goodwood. Den Rest der Saison spulte der sichtlich betroffene Mike Hawthorn mehr als Pflichtprogramm ab, obwohl er beim letzten WM-Lauf in Spanien seinen zweiten Grand-Prix-Sieg erzielte. Dank weiterer sehr guter Platzierungen rangierte er nun auf dem Bronze-Rang der Konkurrenz, um bald darauf zur großen Enttäuschung der Ferrarileitung seinen Vertrag nicht zu verlängern.', 'Das Sportwagen-Intermezzo und Le Mans 1955.', 'Nach einem einz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Mit Annäherung an die Sonne beginnen sie stärker zu leuchten, doch lässt sich die Entwicklung von Helligkeit und Schweif nicht genau voraussagen. Wirklich eindrucksvolle Erscheinungen gibt es nur etwa zehn pro Jahrhundert.', 'Geschichte der Kometenforschung.', 'Schon in der Frühzeit erregten Kometen großes Interesse, weil sie plötzlich auftauchen und sich völlig anders als andere Himmelskörper verhalten. Im Altertum und bis zum Mittelalter wurden sie deshalb häufig als Schicksalsboten oder Zeichen der Götter angesehen.', 'In der Antike kam es bei der Beobachtung einer Konjunktion mit bloßem Auge scheinbar zu einer Verschmelzung von einem Planeten mit einem Stern, die von Aristoteles in seiner Schrift „Meteorologica“ im Jahr 350 v. Chr. erwähnt wird und als mögliche Ursache für die Entstehung von Kometen angesehen wurde. Es handelt sich offenbar um ein zirka zehn Jahre vor der Niederschrift in Griechenland in den Morgenstunden am östlichen Horizont zu sehendes Ereignis, bei der der kleinste Winkelabstand zwischen dem ekliptiknahen Stern Wasat und dem Planeten Jupiter im Sternbild Zwillinge nur rund 20 Bogenminuten betrug. Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass bei diesem Ereignis kein Komet entstanden war, schloss Aristoteles solche Ereignisse als Ursache für das Erscheinen von Kometen aus. Aristoteles und Ptolemäus hielten Kometen daher für Ausdünstungen der Erdatmosphäre.', 'Nach Diodor von Sizilien (1. Jahrhundert v. Chr.) konnten schon die Babylonier oder Chaldäer Kometen beobachten und ihre Wiederkehr berechnen. Pythagoras von Samos, dessen Lehren von ägyptischem und persischem Wissen beeinflusst waren, lehrte nach einer Legende: Kometen seien Himmelskörper, die eine geschlossene Kreisbahn hätten, also in regelmäßigen Zeitintervallen wieder sichtbar würden. Dem römischen Autor Seneca zufolge war man in den antiken Großreichen enttäuscht, wenn Kometen nicht wiederkehrten, Vorhersagen darüber sich also als falsch erwiesen.', 'Erst Regiomontanus erkannte in den Kometen selbständige Himmelskörper und versuchte 1472, eine Bahn zu vermessen. Die älteste gedruckte Kometenschrift ist wahrscheinlich der 1472 in Beromünster und 1474 in Venedig erschienene \\"Tractatus de Cometis\\" des im unterfränkischen Goßmannsdorf bei Hofheim geborenen Zürcher Stadtarztes Eberhard Schleusinger, dessen Werk die Grundlage für Johannes Lichtenbergers \\"Pronosticatio\\" darstellt. Als Beginn der wissenschaftlichen Kometenforschung kann die Erkenntnis Tycho Brahes gelten, dass sie keine Erscheinungen der Erdatmosphäre sind. Denn er stellte beim Kometen von 1577 fest, dass er mindestens 230 Erdradien entfernt sein müsse. Es dauerte jedoch noch viele Jahrzehnte, bis sich diese Annahme durchsetzen konnte, und selbst Galilei widersprach ihr noch. Edmond Halley gelang es 1682, den in diesem Jahr auftauchenden Schweifstern als periodisch wiederkehrenden Himmelskörper nachzuweisen.

Der hohe Anteil an Parabeln ist jedoch auf den zu kurzen Beobachtungszeitraum vieler Kometenerscheinungen zurückzuführen, bei denen langgestreckte Ellipsen nicht von einer Parabel unterschieden werden können. Bei einer längeren Sichtbarkeit von 240 bis 500 Tagen beschreiben nur noch 3 % der Kometen vermutlich eine Parabelbahn.

Sind Keime im Auswurf (Sputum) nachweisbar, spricht man von offener Tuberkulose, bei Keimnachweis in anderen äußeren Körpersekreten von potentiell offener Tuberkulose. Durch tiefes Ausatmen oder Husten entsteht ein infektiöses Aerosol, das seine Ansteckungsfähigkeit durch Sedimentation, Durchlüftung und natürliche UV-Lichtquellen verliert. Da Rinder ebenfalls an der Tuberkulose erkranken können, war in Westeuropa früher (nicht-pasteurisierte) Rohmilch eine verbreitete Infektionsquelle und ist es in Teilen der Welt bis heute. Aufgrund der Übertragbarkeit von Tieren auf Menschen zählt die Tuberkulose zu den Zoonosen. Umgekehrt ist die Übertragung von Menschen auf Tiere ein wichtiger Aspekt beim Artenschutz seltener Primaten.', 'Erst mit dem direkten Nachweis der Erreger oder deren Erbgut ist die Erkrankung labordiagnostisch bestätigt. Indirekte, d. h. immunologische Befunde oder Hauttests tragen nur zur Diagnose bei, da man durch sie nicht zwischen einer Erkrankung und einer stattgehabten Infektion unterscheiden kann. Auch können sie bei einer zusammengebrochenen Immunabwehr falsch-negativ ausfallen.', 'Zur Behandlung stehen verschiedene Antibiotika zur Verfügung, die speziell gegen Mykobakterien wirksam sind und deshalb auch Antituberkulotika genannt werden. Diese müssen zur Vermeidung von Resistenzentwicklungen und Rückfällen unbedingt in Kombination und nach Vorgabe der WHO über mindestens ein halbes Jahr, also weit über das Bestehen der Beschwerden hinaus, eingenommen werden. Es existiert eine Impfung, die aber wegen unzureichender Wirksamkeit in Deutschland seit 1998 nicht mehr empfohlen und auch nicht mehr verfügbar ist. Eine Primärprophylaxe mit einem antituberkulös wirksamen Medikament wird in Deutschland in erster Linie bei Kindern oder schwerst immunologisch beeinträchtigten Kontaktpersonen empfohlen. Bei Erwachsenen, die über ein intaktes Immunsystem verfügen (und daher als \\"immunkompetent\\" bezeichnet werden), erfolgt hingegen eine Sekundärprophylaxe oder Prävention erst nach Feststellung einer Infektion mittels vorbeugender Gabe von antituberkulös wirksamen Medikamenten unter Beachtung der Resistenzlage.

Nur ein geringer Teil der Infektionen führt jedoch zu einer Erkrankung. Nach dem Tuberkulosebericht der WHO \\"(Global tuberculosis report 2016)\\" gab es im Jahr 2015 weltweit 10,4 Millionen Neuinfektionen und 1,8 Millionen Todesfälle. Beide Zahlen sanken seit 1990 stetig.', 'Die Möglichkeiten zur Behandlung sind oft unzureichend, da sie teure Antibiotika erfordert, lang dauert und angesichts der sozialen Lebensumstände der Betroffenen oft undurchführbar ist. Auch fehlen in betroffenen Regionen oft Laboratorien zur Diagnose und Behandlung. Besonders in Osteuropa ist durch Armut und Mängel im Gesundheitswesen eine besorgniserregende Zunahme der Tuberkulose zu verzeichnen, vor allem auch mit multiresistenten Erregerstämmen. Auch weltweit wird die Krankheit immer häufiger durch solche medikamentenresistenten Tuberkulosestämme verursacht.', 'Besonders problematisch ist eine Tuberkuloseinfektion bei HIV-Infizierten mit manifestem AIDS. Durch die Immunschwäche erhöht HIV die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Ausbruchs einer Tuberkuloseerkrankung um ein Vielfaches. Tuberkulose ist in Afrika neben AIDS die häufigste Todesursache. Beide Krankheiten treten besonders bei Bewohnern von Metropolenslums in enger Wechselbeziehung zueinander auf. Dabei führt die Immunschwäche durch HIV oft zu negativen Ergebnissen bei Tuberkulose-Routineuntersuchungen, obwohl die Krankheit vorliegt (siehe auch Fehler 1. und 2. Art). Das liegt daran, dass die Hauttests (Tuberkulin-Test, Tine-Test) die immunologische Reaktion auf Erregerbestandteile prüfen, die aber durch AIDS gehemmt ist. Der Verlauf der Tuberkulose ist dann erheblich beschleunigt. In armen Ländern gilt TBC als Zeichen des Ausbruchs von AIDS und führt bei der Mehrheit aller HIV-Erkrankten zum Tod. Die WHO fordert und fördert daher eine weltweite Koordination der Tuberkulose- und AIDS-Forschung.', 'Überraschend fand eine italienische Studie eine Prävalenz (Krankheitshäufigkeit) latenter Tuberkuloseinfektionen von neun Prozent unter gesunden Angestellten im Gesundheitsbereich und von 18 Prozent unter gut 400 an Psoriasis Erkrankten. Auch 30 Prozent der Kranken mit Lungenentzündung und Lungenkrebs waren latent infiziert.', 'Deutschland, Österreich und Schweiz.', 'Dem Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) wurden 2016 in Deutschland 5915 Tuberkulosekranke gemeldet, darunter 233 Kinder unter 15 Jahren (2005: 230). 2016 kamen in Deutschland 7,2 Erkrankungen auf 100.000 Einwohner. Die offizielle Statistik gab für 2015 100 Todesopfer an.

Er besteht überwiegend aus Wasserstoff. In dem Nebel entstehen Sterne, deren ionisierende Strahlung den Nebel im sichtbaren Bereich leuchten lässt. Er wird daher auch als H-II-Gebiet klassifiziert. Mit einer Entfernung von etwa 414 Parsec (1350 Lichtjahre) ist er in der galaktischen Nachbarschaft eines der aktivsten Sternentstehungsgebiete, weshalb er ein bevorzugtes Untersuchungsobjekt zur Erforschung der Sternentstehung ist.

Der unmittelbar benachbarte und ähnlich beschaffene De Mairans Nebel besitzt dagegen eine andere ionisierende Quelle und ist daher nicht Teil des Orionnebels.', 'Entdeckung und Erforschung.', 'Obwohl der Orionnebel unter guten Bedingungen als einziger Emissionsnebel mit bloßem Auge sichtbar ist, blieb die besondere Gestalt vor dem 17. Jahrhundert in europäischen, arabischen und chinesischen Schriften unerwähnt: Der rund 2000 Jahre alte Almagest, al-Sūfīs Buch der Fixsterne und die neuzeitliche Uranometria notieren den Orionnebel lediglich als einen Stern der Magnitude 3 bis 4. Nachdem mit den ersten Fernrohren detaillierte Beobachtungen möglich geworden waren, entwickelte sich der Orionnebel aufgrund seiner Nähe zu einem der besterforschten Sternentstehungsgebiete.', 'Äußere Form.', 'Die frühesten Beschreibungen des Orionnebels waren vage und fanden wenig Beachtung. Beispielsweise hält eine handschriftliche Notiz des französischen Astronomen Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc aus dem Jahr 1610 die mehrfache Beobachtung eines Objekts bestehend aus zwei Sternen in einem leuchtenden „Wölkchen“ inmitten des Sternbildes Orion fest. Es ist jedoch umstritten, ob sie sich tatsächlich auf den Orionnebel mit den beiden scheinbaren Sternen θ¹ und θ² Orionis bezieht, wie seit Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts gemutmaßt wird. Die 1619 von Johann Baptist Cysat und Volpert Motzel beiläufig veröffentlichte Beobachtung des Nebels verglich diesen mit einem Kometen. Ebenso wie die Skizzierung und Katalogisierung durch Giovanni Battista Hodierna aus dem Jahr 1654', 'wurde diese erst im 19./20. Jahrhundert wieder aufgegriffen und in ihrer Bedeutung erkannt.', 'Mit der im Jahr 1659 veröffentlichten Umrisszeichnung des Nebels galt daher lange Zeit Christiaan Huygens als der Entdecker. Der von ihm abgebildete besonders helle Bereich des Nebels wurde infolge als Huygens-Region bezeichnet. Charles Messier verzeichnete den Nebel in seinem erstmals 1774 publizierten Katalog als 42. Eintrag, ergänzt um eine detaillierte Abbildung. Friedrich von Hahn beschrieb seine Struktur kurz darauf', 'Verbesserte Teleskope ließen in der Folgezeit immer lichtschwächere Teile des Orionnebels erkennen, sodass zunehmend detaillierte Abbildungen entstanden, wenngleich auch die individuelle Wahrnehmung des Beobachters die Abbildung offenbar deutlich beeinflusste.', 'Bereits Messier überlegte, ob man aus unterschiedlichen Darstellungen der Huygens-Region folgern könne, dass sich diese über die Zeit verändere. Wilhelm Herschel sah dies im Jahr 1811 aufgrund eigener und früherer Beobachtungen als erwiesen an. Rund 70 Jahre später trug Edward Singleton Holden in einer umfassenden Monografie den damaligen Kenntnisstand zusammen. Er diskutierte die verschiedenen Abbildungen und kam zu dem Schluss, dass trotz der unterschiedlichen Darstellungen der Orionnebel seit Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts seine Form wohl nicht, dafür jedoch seine Helligkeit verändert habe.', 'Henry Draper nahm im Jahr 1880 das erste Foto des Nebels auf, das zugleich als die erste astrofotografische Aufnahme eines nichtstellaren Objektes außerhalb des Sonnensystems gilt. Die Technik wurde schnell verbessert, und Andrew Ainslie Commons ausgezeichnete Aufnahme aus dem Jahr 1883 zeigte bereits mehr Details als mit dem bloßen Auge durch das gleiche Fernrohr zu erkennen waren. Die zuvor vermuteten Veränderungen des Orionnebels bestätigten die in der Folgezeit aufgenommenen Fotografien indes nicht. Mit dem zu dieser Zeit beginnenden Verständnis der Physik des Orionnebels zielten weitere Untersuchungen zunehmend auf bestimmte Aspekte der Physik; die äußere Form als alleiniges Untersuchungsziel trat zunehmend in den Hintergrund. Beispiele aus dem 21. Jahrhundert sind die hochaufgelösten Aufnahmen des Hubble-Weltraumteleskops sowie für den Infrarotbereich Aufnahmen des VLTs und der Weltraumteleskope Spitzer, WISE und Herschel.', 'Aufbau und Zusammensetzung.', 'Wenngleich auch Galileo Galilei den Nebel nicht erwähnte, so stellte er doch im Jahr 1617 mithilfe seines Teleskops fest, dass θ Orionis nur scheinbar ein zentraler Stern ist. Statt eines Einzelsterns beobachtete er fünf verschiedene Komponenten, wobei drei davon eine engstehende Gruppe bilden. Später entdeckte Jean-Dominique Cassini einen vierten dieser Gruppe zugehörigen Stern, die dann Trapezium genannt wurde. In der Folgezeit konnten mithilfe verbesserter Teleskope dem Trapezium weitere Sterne zugeordnet werden und auch eine Katalogisierung des Umfelds vorgenommen werden. Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts waren bereits mehrere hundert Sterne des 1,5° durchmessenden Sternhaufens im Orionnebel erfasst worden. Jedoch genügte das gesamte sichtbare Licht der Sterne nicht, das Leuchten des Nebels zu erklären, wie schon im Jahr 1733 William Derham erkannte.', 'Von William Lassell wurde Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts die außergewöhnliche „erbsengrüne“ Farbe des Orionnebels festgehalten und nachfolgende spektroskopische Untersuchungen durch William Huggins wiesen bereits im Jahr 1865 auf die gasartige Natur des die Sterne umgebenden Nebels hin. Neben zunächst unbekannten grünen Spektrallinien waren diejenigen vom Wasserstoff deutlich zu erkennen.', 'Die bereichsweise unterschiedliche Verteilung der verschiedenen Gase wurde von Johannes Franz Hartmann im Jahr 1905 anhand von Fotografien mit schmalbandigen Filtern gezeigt, wenngleich die unbekannten Spektrallinien erst in den 1920er Jahren ionisiertem Sauerstoff zugeordnet werden konnten.', 'Durch Bestimmung der Dopplerverschiebung der bekannten Spektrallinien des Wasserstoffs bestimmte im Jahr 1902 Hermann Carl Vogel Strömungen innerhalb des Nebels. Henri Buisson, Charles Fabry und Henry Bourget bestätigten dies im Jahr 1914 durch interferometrische Vermessung der Spektrallinien und leiteten aus der Linienbreite eine Obergrenze von 15.000 Kelvin für die Gastemperatur ab. Bald darauf zeigte sich in langbelichteten Aufnahmen, dass der Orionnebel der leuchtende Teil einer weitaus größeren Wolke ist. Einige Forscher vermuteten daraufhin, dass die von den Sternen des Trapeziums ausgesandte Ultraviolettstrahlung die sie umgebenden Gase erhitzt und durch Ionisation zum Leuchten anregt.', 'Mit der zwischenzeitlich gewonnenen Kenntnis, dass eine der Spektrallinien vom Element Sauerstoff stammt, gelang 1931 eine genauere Temperaturbestimmung der leuchtenden Gase. Unter der Berücksichtigung von Strömungen ergab sich ein Wert von 11.000 Kelvin, der nur wenig verschieden von den Ergebnissen nachfolgender Untersuchungen war, die auf eine Temperatur von 10.000 Kelvin im Zentrum hindeuteten.', 'Zu dieser Zeit nahmen Walter Baade und Rudolph Minkowski an einigen der hellsten Sterne Messungen vor, um deren untypische Spektren erklären zu können. Die spektrometrischen Untersuchungen ergaben überdies, dass der Nebel große Mengen an kohlenstoff- und eisenhaltigen Staubpartikeln enthalten müsse. Weitere Spektroskopien des Nebels zeigten, dass er außer Wasserstoff auch etwa zehn Prozent Helium enthält und die Anteile von Sauerstoff, Kohlenstoff, Neon, Stickstoff, Schwefel und Argon weniger als ein Prozent betragen – womit eine Ähnlichkeit zur Sonne festgestellt werden konnte. Die mit ebenfalls weniger als einem Prozent vorhandenen Elemente Magnesium, Silizium und Eisen sind zu rund 90 Prozent als Oxid im stellaren Staub gebunden.', 'Als stärkste Quelle für ultraviolette Strahlung wurde der auch optisch hellste Stern des Trapeziums, θ¹ Orionis C identifiziert; detaillierte physikalische Modelle für die Anregung des Nebels zum Leuchten durch Ultraviolettstrahlung folgten in den 1950er Jahren.', 'Untersuchungen in den 1960er und 1970er Jahren ergaben, dass die Strömungsgeschwindigkeiten vom Ionisationsgrad und somit vom Abstand zu θ¹ Orionis C abhingen und zeigten immer deutlicher, dass die Trapezsterne vor der Molekülwolke in einer sphärischen Höhlung liegen und lediglich deren Grenzschicht ionisiert wird. Die Dicke von 0,1 pc und die dreidimensionale Lage der Ionisationsfront wurde Anfang der 1990er Jahre ermittelt und in den Folgejahren dann aufwendig visualisiert. Dabei fanden weiterentwickelte Modelle Anwendung, die zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt insbesondere mithilfe hochaufgelöster Aufnahmen der Nebelemission des Hubble-Weltraumteleskops nochmals verbessert werden konnten. Ebenfalls in dieser Zeit wurde ein Schleier aus nicht-ionisiertem Gas im Vordergrund entdeckt, eingehender charakterisiert und den Modellen hinzugefügt. Die resultierenden Modelle geben einen genaueren Aufschluss über die Teilchendichte in der Ionisationfront, die in der Huygens-Region rund 9000 ionisierte Atome pro Kubikzentimeter erreicht – einen für H-II-Gebiete typischen Wert.', 'Durch Infrarotaufnahmen, bei denen ein Farbfilter sichtbares Licht und damit viele Spektrallinien des Nebels sperrte, gelang es Robert Julius Trumpler Anfang der 1930er Jahre, einige Sterne in der Umgebung des Trapeziums näher zu identifizieren. Er beschrieb dabei einen von ihm als „Trapezium cluster“ (Trapezhaufen) bezeichneten Bereich mit der Ausdehnung von einer Bogenminute, der 41 Sterne umfasst. Von einem noch größeren Bereich mit einem Radius von zehn Bogenminuten um die Trapezsterne herum berichtete Guillermo Haro im Jahr 1953 und benannte diesen als „Orion Nebula Cluster“.

Der ausschließlich auf Kostenminimierung bei Material und Herstellung ausgelegte, dennoch profitable Computer wurde ab Januar 1980 für 99,95 £ als erstes Gerät unterhalb der vermarktungspsychologisch bedeutsamen Grenze von 100 £ in Großbritannien zum Verkauf angeboten. Mit etwa 100.000 innerhalb von 18 Monaten verkauften Exemplaren entwickelte sich der ZX80 rasch zu einem Kassenschlager.

Die damit verbundenen Entwicklungs- und Herstellungskosten relativierten sich bei den von Sinclair angepeilten Stückzahlen rasch und führten in der Summe zur gewünschten Kostenreduktion. Der weiterentwickelte, mit maximal fünf elektronischen Schaltkreisen bestückte Computer konnte daraufhin zu einem Preis von knapp unter 70 £ dennoch profitabel angeboten werden. Daneben erlaubte das Ausschöpfen weiterer zur Verfügung stehender Kapazitäten des Spezialbausteins die Beseitigung technischer Probleme des ZX80. So ermöglichte ein neu implementierter Betriebsmodus die Eliminierung des störenden Bildschirmflackerns.', 'Verbesserung des Sinclair-BASIC.', 'Neben einer Reduktion des Bauteileumfangs sollte gleichzeitig die Bedienbarkeit verbessert und die Leistungsfähigkeit der auch im ZX80 bereits enthaltenen, leicht zu erlernenden Programmiersprache \\"Sinclair-BASIC\\" gesteigert werden. Die dafür verantwortlich zeichnende \\"Nine Tiles Networks Ltd.\\" integrierte daraufhin Gleitkommaroutinen, erweiterte den Befehlsumfang und die Fehlerbehandlung des BASIC-Interpreters, verbesserte die Editieroptionen und behob zahlreiche bekannte Probleme in der Systemsoftware des ZX80. Dem selbstgestellten Anspruch, mit dem ZX81 in die Riege der vollwertigen Computer-Hersteller aufzusteigen, sollte im November 1980 auch nach außen hin durch eine Umbenennung des Unternehmens in \\"Sinclair Computers\\" demonstrativ Rechnung getragen werden.', 'W. H. Smith und BBC.', 'Während der Entwicklungsphase des ZX81 sondierte Sinclair Computers weitere Vermarktungsoptionen, um das Image des reinen Versandhändlers ablegen zu können. Davon sollte die britische Bücherkette W. H. Smith &amp; Son profitieren. Zur Ankurbelung ihrer stagnierenden Geschäfte hatte sie kurz zuvor ein Programm zur Heranführung der Bevölkerung an die Computertechnik aufgelegt. Die dazugehörige neue Wissensabteilung „Computer Know-How“ sollte durch einen gleichzeitig direkt vor Ort käuflich erwerbbaren Computer überzeugender wirken und mehr Interessenten anziehen. Der ZX80 passte aufgrund seiner einfachen Bedienbarkeit und seines geringen Preises ausgezeichnet in dieses Konzept. Die bereits erzielten hohen Verkaufszahlen und damit die große Bekanntheit des Rechners versprachen zudem auch profitable Margen für W. H. Smith &amp; Son. Entsprechende Vertriebsanfragen für den ZX80 an Sinclair folgten. Sinclair setzte daraufhin W. H. Smith &amp; Son von der Neuentwicklung in Kenntnis und empfahl stattdessen, diesen \\"ZX81\\" zu vermarkten. Die Verantwortlichen von W. H. Smith &amp; Son willigten ein, allerdings unter der Bedingung, sich zuvor an einem Prototyp von den versprochenen Qualitäten überzeugen zu können.', 'Als bekannt wurde, dass der britische Fernsehsender BBC für seine geplante neue Sendungsreihe über Heimcomputer ein entsprechendes Gerät auch zum späteren Vertrieb suchte, entwickelte Sinclair Computers auch in diesem Umfeld rege Vermarktungsbemühungen. Eilends wurde Ende 1980 ein erster vorführbarer Prototyp – noch ohne Gehäuse – eigens zur Vorstellung im Dezember 1980 bei der BBC gefertigt. Jedoch folgte man bei der BBC nicht Sinclairs Philosophie eines ausschließlich auf günstigen Anschaffungspreis ausgelegten Massenproduktes. Stattdessen setzte man bei BBC auf vollwertige Technik, Verlässlichkeit, Benutzerfreundlichkeit und leichte Erweiterbarkeit. Damit ging der Zuschlag an das Konkurrenzunternehmen Acorn, die ihren hochwertigeren \\"BBC Micro\\" im Januar 1982 einführte.', 'Während der Verhandlungen mit der BBC wurde von Nine Tiles Networks Ltd. an der Erweiterung der Systemsoftware zur Ansteuerung eines ebenfalls zu entwickelnden Elektro-Erosionsdruckers gearbeitet. Durch die späte Entscheidung von Sinclair zugunsten des Druckers und den damit verursachten Zeitdruck schlichen sich etliche Fehler in die umfangreichere Systemsoftware des ZX81 ein.', 'Überführung in die Produktion.', 'Ende 1980 begann die Überführung des Prototyps zur Serienreife und die Erstellung der auszuliefernden Dokumentation. Nach dem Abschluss der Revisionen von Hard- und Software und den damit feststehenden Abmessungen des Innenlebens ersetzten die Sinclair-Ingenieure im letzten Entwicklungsabschnitt das zu Beschädigungen neigende Gehäuse des ZX80. Das neue pultförmige und in Spritzgusstechnik gefertigte Chassis war kleiner, robuster und dem Zeitgeschmack besser angepasst. Ein Prototyp mit diesem neuen Gehäuse wurde daraufhin im Januar 1981 den Verantwortlichen von W. H. Smith &amp; Son vorgeführt. Beeindruckt von den technischen und wirtschaftlichen Daten wurde man mit Sinclair Computers schnell handelseinig. Teil des Vertrags war dabei ein Exklusivverkaufsrecht des ZX81 für Ladengeschäfte durch W. H. Smith &amp; Son. Beide Vertragspartner sahen damit ihre nahe Zukunft gesichert. Sinclair verstärkte daraufhin seine Forschungstätigkeiten unter anderem zum Nachfolgemodell ZX82 – dem späteren \\"Sinclair ZX Spectrum\\" – und änderte im März 1981 dazu passend seinen Namen in \\"Sinclair Research\\".', 'Die Herstellung des ZX81 übernahm wie bei großen Teilen des ZX80 auch die bis dahin kriselnde schottische Zweigstelle des US-amerikanischen Uhrenherstellers \\"Timex Corporation\\" in Dundee.', 'Vermarktung.', 'Der offizielle Verkaufsstart des ZX81 erfolgte in Großbritannien am 5.

Objectives: The primary goals or desired outcomes that the solution aims to achieve. 2. Context: The background information, surrounding conditions, and assumptions that affect the problem and its potential solutions. 3. Stakeholders: The individuals, groups, or organizations who have an interest in or are affected by the problem and its solutions. 4. Alternatives: The different options or approaches available for addressing the problem. 5. Criteria: The standards or guidelines used to evaluate and compare the possible solutions. 6. Risks: The potential negative consequences, uncertainties, or challenges that may arise during the problem-solving process or as a result of implementing a solution. 7. Resources: The assets, tools, or capabilities needed to solve the problem and implement the chosen solution."},{"instruction":"What's the difference between requirements and objectives?","output":"Requirements and objectives are related concepts in problem-solving, but they have distinct differences: 1. Requirements: These are the essential, non-negotiable conditions or specifications that a solution must meet to be considered successful. They represent the baseline functionalities or features that must be provided by the solution, and any proposed solution that does not fulfill these requirements would be deemed unacceptable. Requirements are often more specific, measurable, and well-defined, forming the foundation upon which a solution is built. 2. Objectives: Objectives are the goals or desired outcomes that the solution aims to achieve. They are broader, more aspirational, and often focused on the overall value or benefit the solution provides. Objectives may not be as strictly defined as requirements, and they often provide direction or guidance to inform the selection and design of the solution. In some cases, multiple objectives might be prioritized, trade-offs may be considered, or objectives may be partially satisfied depending on the constraints and available resources. In summary, requirements describe the \\"must-haves\\" that a solution needs to be viable, whereas objectives represent the \\"want-to-achieve\\" goals driving the problem-solving effort. Objectives provide a larger context and purpose for the solution, while requirements ensure the solution meets the minimum specifications."},{"instruction":"define constraints of a problem","output":"Constraints of a problem refer to the limitations, restrictions, or boundaries within which the problem must be solved and a solution must be developed. These constraints can be imposed due to various factors, such as time, budget, resources, technology, or regulations. They are crucial in defining the scope of the problem and guiding the problem-solving process, as they influence the feasibility and effectiveness of potential solutions. Constraints can take different forms, such as: 1. Time constraints: Deadlines or timeframes within which the problem needs to be resolved or the solution implemented. 2. Budget constraints: Financial limitations or restricted funding available for addressing the problem or developing a solution. 3. Resource constraints: Limitations on available resources, such as personnel, skills, tools, equipment, or materials, needed to address the problem. 4. Technological constraints: Limitations imposed by the existing technology, technical capabilities, or infrastructure. 5. Legal or regulatory constraints: Rules, laws, or regulations that must be adhered to when solving the problem or implementing the solution. 6. Physical or spatial constraints: Limitations related to space, location, or the physical dimensions of the problem or solution. Understanding and managing constraints is a crucial aspect of problem-solving, as it ensures that developed solutions are not only effective but also feasible and applicable within the given limitations. Ignoring constraints may lead to impractical or unattainable solutions."},{"instruction":"ChatGPT, let’s run through a test scenario.

Nach der Promotion, dem Erlernen zahlreicher Sprachen und Dialekte sowie nach zwei Reisen durch Persien befolgte er nicht den Rat von Richthofens, sein Geographiestudium fortzusetzen und sich mit den Methoden der geographischen Forschung vertraut zu machen; deshalb musste er später die Auswertung seiner Expeditionsergebnisse anderen Wissenschaftlern überlassen.', 'Erste drei Expeditionen.', 'In drei Expeditionen zwischen 1894 und 1908 durch die Gebirge und die Wüstengebiete von Zentralasien kartierte und erkundete er die Gebiete von Chinesisch-Turkestan (jetzt Xinjiang) und Tibet. Bereits 1902 war er in den Adelsstand erhoben worden, als bis heute letzter Schwede, der nicht Mitglied des Königshauses war. Als Mitglied von zwei wissenschaftlichen Akademien hatte Hedin Stimmrecht bei der Wahl von Nobelpreisträgern.

Trotz der chinesischen Gegendemonstrationen gelang es Hedin nach monatelangen Verhandlungen in China, die Expedition durch chinesische Forschungsaufträge und durch die Teilnahme chinesischer Wissenschaftler auch zu einer chinesischen Expedition zu machen und einen Vertrag auszuhandeln, der dieser Expedition, die im Kriegsgebiet mit ihrer Bewaffnung und 300 Kamelen wie eine Invasionsarmee aussah, Reisefreiheit gewährte; die Finanzierung blieb die private Aufgabe von Hedin.', 'Hedin begab sich 1927 mit 60 Mann Begleitung, 300 Kamelen und 40 Tonnen Gepäck auf seine letzte Forschungsreise. Im Auftrag der deutschen Regierung, getarnt als Finanzierung durch die Luft Hansa, sollte er prüfen, ob eine Flugverbindung zwischen Deutschland und China über die großen Wüstenflächen möglich sei. Während der laufenden Expedition hatte es Hedin wegen seiner angegriffenen Gesundheit, wegen des Bürgerkrieges in Chinesisch-Turkestan und wegen langdauernder Kriegsgefangenschaft sehr schwer, nach der Geldentwertung in der Weltwirtschaftskrise notwendige finanzielle Mittel für die Expedition zu beschaffen, die Logistik für die Versorgung der Expedition im Kriegsgebiet sicherzustellen und den Zugang der Expeditionsteilnehmer zu den zwischen Warlords umkämpften Forschungsgebieten zu erreichen. Die Durchquerung der riesigen Wüste Gobi und der „Todeswüste“ Taklamakan verlangten Mensch und Tier alles ab. Nach acht Jahren blieb Hedin am Ende „Sieger über die Wüste“ und erfüllte sich einen Lebenstraum – er löste das Rätsel um den wandernden See Lop Nor.', 'Auswertung der Chinesisch-Schwedischen Expedition.', 'Nach seiner Rückkehr wohnte Hedin in Stockholm zusammen mit seinen Geschwistern in einer modernen Hochhausanlage.

Das während der Expedition zusammengetragene wissenschaftliche Material wurde von Hedin und den anderen Expeditionsteilnehmern ab 1937 für die weltweite Ostasienforschung in mehr als 50 Bänden veröffentlicht. Als ihm schließlich das Geld für die Druckkosten ausging, verpfändete er seine große, wertvolle Bibliothek, die mehrere Räume füllte, um die Herausgabe weiterer Bände zu ermöglichen.', '1935 stellte er sein exklusives Wissen über Zentralasien nicht nur der schwedischen Regierung, sondern auch den Regierungen in China und Deutschland in Vorträgen und Vier-Augen-Gesprächen mit den politischen Repräsentanten Chiang Kai-shek und Adolf Hitler zur Verfügung.
