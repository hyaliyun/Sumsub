While I was swimming, I saw a big red fish. At first, I was a little scared, but then I realized it was a friendly fish. Do you enjoy swimming in the sea? And what activities do you usually engage in during your vacation?\\" I adjusted the tenses to make the sentence structures consistent and made some minor grammar corrections. Additionally, I rephrased the question at the end for smoother flow. Now I'll answer your questions: Yes, I do enjoy swimming in the sea! It's a wonderful way to relax and cool off in the warm weather. During my vacations, I like to engage in various activities depending on the location. I often enjoy exploring new places and attractions, trying local cuisine, going on hikes or nature walks, and sometimes even participating in water sports like snorkeling or kayaking.

These injuries can result from the force or impact associated with the traumatic event or from secondary mechanisms related to the event. Here are some possible causes of brain injury: 1. Direct impact: The mail carrier may sustain a blow or strike to the head during the robbery. This forceful impact can lead to various types of brain injuries, such as a concussion, contusion (bruising of the brain tissue), or laceration (tearing of brain tissue). 2. Whiplash or sudden acceleration-deceleration: If the mail carrier is forcefully pulled or pushed during the robbery, it can cause the head to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can result in a whiplash injury, which can cause damage to the brain's delicate structures. 3. Penetrating injuries: In some cases, a mail carrier may be subjected to violence involving a weapon like a firearm or knife. This can lead to a penetrating injury to the skull and brain. Penetrating injuries can cause significant damage to brain tissue and often require immediate medical intervention. 4. Lack of oxygen: During a traumatic event, the mail carrier may experience moments of extreme fear, stress, or physical restraint, potentially leading to oxygen deprivation. Lack of oxygen to the brain, known as hypoxia or anoxia, can cause severe brain damage, particularly if the deprivation is prolonged. 5. Secondary injuries: Following a traumatic event, the brain may be susceptible to secondary injuries. These can occur due to swelling (cerebral edema), bleeding (hemorrhage), or increased pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure). Secondary injuries can further worsen brain function and require prompt medical attention. It is essential for the mail carrier to seek immediate medical evaluation and treatment after the traumatic event to properly assess and manage any potential brain injuries."},{"instruction":"Describe what happens and why when a mail carrier is robbed of their arrow key while, in the process of delivering mail","output":"When a mail carrier is robbed of their arrow key while delivering mail, several things can happen, and each has its reasons: 1. Disruption in mail delivery: The arrow key is an essential tool for mail carriers as it provides access to multiple mailboxes or apartment complexes. Once the arrow key is stolen, the mail carrier loses the ability to efficiently deliver mail to those specific locations, resulting in a disruption of mail delivery services. 2. Delayed mail delivery: Without the arrow key, the mail carrier may have to resort to alternative methods to deliver mail to affected areas. This can lead to delays in delivering mail, as the carrier might have to visit each mailbox individually or deliver mail to the recipient's doorstep instead. 3. Increased workload and stress: The loss of an arrow key can significantly impact a mail carrier's workload and increase their stress level. They may have to spend more time manually accessing each mailbox, which can be time-consuming and physically demanding, especially in areas with numerous mailboxes or multi-unit buildings. 4. Increased risk of lost mail: When mail carriers need to manually access individual mailboxes, there is a higher likelihood of misplacing or losing mail. Without the convenience of the arrow key, it becomes more challenging to ensure accurate delivery to the correct recipients, potentially leading to misplaced or undelivered mail. 5. Increased security concerns: The stolen arrow key presents a security risk not only for the mail carrier but also for the residents whose mailboxes are compromised. Unauthorized individuals may gain access to mailboxes, potentially leading to theft, identity theft, or other criminal activities. It is crucial for the mail carrier to report the theft of the arrow key to their supervisor or the postal authorities promptly.

Her jet-black hair framed her porcelain face, and her eyes, smudged with dark eyeshadow, held a mysterious allure that fascinated me. She was the epitome of cool, a goth goddess gracing our high school halls. But deep down, I knew she could never be interested in someone like me. I was just an average, awkward teenager, lost in the shadows of her captivating presence. My style was plain and simple, far from the darkness she embraced. I yearned to be someone she could love, someone who shared her world, if only for a moment. One night, alone in my room, I made a desperate wish. I longed to become someone who could capture her attention, to bridge the divide between our worlds. Little did I know that my desire would take an unexpected turn. As I drifted to sleep, my mind filled with images of the goth girl, my dream world began to shift and twist. Colors faded, morphing into shades of black, and my body danced between shadow and light. When I finally stirred awake, I discovered that my wish had been granted in a more profound way than I could have ever imagined. I gazed into the mirror, my heart fluttering anxiously as I took in my reflection. I was no longer the unremarkable boy I used to be. Instead, I was a feminine goth femboy, adorned with the same darkness that captivated my crush. The initial shock subsided, replaced by a sense of euphoria and empowerment. With each step I took, my confidence grew. I embraced my newfound identity fearlessly, unafraid of the judgment that often accompanies transformation. The world looked different through my transformed eyes, and I reveled in its beauty. But as I approached my crush, now sharing the same aesthetic, I realized that appearances alone could not bridge the distance between us. Our worlds, though superficially aligned, were still fundamentally different. She lived in the shadows by choice, while I had been thrust into them by a twist of fate. I sought common ground, attempting to engage her in conversations about our shared interests. But every attempt seemed feeble and forced. We were simply two souls lost in divergent paths, brought together by a fleeting similarity in aesthetics. In time, I accepted the truth. Love could not be fabricated, even through the most drastic transformations. True connections are rooted in genuine understanding and shared experiences, not appearances alone. As I ventured forth, just as before, as an unassuming boy, I carried with me a lesson. It was not about becoming someone else to earn affection, but rather accepting and embracing who I was. True love would come when I least expected it, with someone who loved me for being me, not for an image I portrayed. And so, I continued my journey, no longer yearning to fit into someone else's world, but determined to create my own, where authenticity and self-love reigned supreme."},{"instruction":"pycaret.regression import setup, compare_models compare_models not showing table with best models","output":"There can be several reasons why the \`compare_models\` function is not showing the table with the best models in PyCaret. Below are some possible causes and solutions: 1. Dataset is too small: If the dataset is too small, PyCaret may not generate meaningful results. Try using a larger dataset to get better model comparisons. 2. Training samples are too few: If the number of training samples is too low, it can lead to unreliable model performance comparisons. Ensure that you have a sufficient number of training samples. 3. Insufficient memory: If your system does not have enough memory, PyCaret may not be able to generate the results table. Try running the code on a system with more memory or reduce the dataset size. 4. Incompatible data types: PyCaret requires the data to be in the correct format for model comparison. Make sure that your dataset is in the proper format (e.g., numerical values are not treated as strings). 5. Error handling: Check if any error or exception occurred during the execution of the \`compare_models\` function. Look for error messages or stack traces in the output console and try to resolve any issues accordingly. 6. Incorrect function usage: Double-check if you have properly used the \`compare_models\` function.

Here are some possible causes and potential solutions: 1. Data is empty or missing: Ensure that you have loaded your dataset correctly and that it contains data. Check if your dataset has any missing values or if it is empty. PyCaret requires a valid dataset with non-null values to generate the table. 2. Incompatible data types: Verify that your dataset has the correct data types. PyCaret requires numerical data for regression tasks. If your dataset contains categorical variables, you may need to encode them before using PyCaret. 3. Incorrect usage of the \`setup\` function: Make sure you are calling the \`setup\` function correctly. It should be passed the dataframe, the target variable name, and any additional optional parameters that you want to specify. Double-check that you have assigned the result of \`setup\` to a variable and that you are using the correct variable in subsequent functions. 4. Insufficient memory: If your system has limited memory, it can sometimes cause issues when running PyCaret. You can try reducing the size of your dataset or freeing up memory on your system to see if it resolves the problem. 5. Package version compatibility: Ensure that you have the latest version of PyCaret installed. Certain functions may not work as expected if you are using an outdated version. You can update PyCaret using \`pip install --upgrade pycaret\` or \`conda update pycaret\` if you are using Anaconda.

PyCaret's \`compare_models\` function expects a clean dataset without any missing values for proper model comparisons. To handle datasets with missing values, you can pre-process your data before using \`compare_models\`. Here are a few strategies you can consider: 1. Dropping rows with missing values: If the number of rows with missing values is relatively small compared to the total dataset, you can drop those rows using the \`dropna()\` function from pandas. However, ensure that dropping rows does not significantly impact your dataset's representativeness. \`\`\`python train_clinical.dropna(inplace=True) \`\`\` 2. Imputing missing values: If you cannot afford to drop rows with missing values, you can impute those missing values before applying \`compare_models\`. There are multiple strategies for imputing missing values, such as mean/median imputation or using advanced imputation techniques like KNN imputation or MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations). \`\`\`python from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean') train_clinical_imputed = pd.DataFrame(imputer.fit_transform(train_clinical), columns=train_clinical.columns) # Then use train_clinical_imputed in compare_models \`\`\` 3.

Oliver had heard tales of a magnificent castle hidden deep within the woods, protected by mystical creatures and guarded by an elusive dragon. With newfound hope, Sparkle and Oliver journeyed together, searching far and wide for the castle. They encountered friendly pixies, playful fairies, and even a friendly troll named Tumble. Each creature they met shared clues and hints to help them on their quest. After days of exploring, the duo finally stumbled upon a clearing at the edge of the forest, where the majestic castle stood tall. The castle was draped in ivy, its towers kissed by the sun's warm rays, and protected by magical flowers that bloomed at its entrance. Reaching a massive, ornate wooden door, Sparkle carefully inserted the glowing key into the lock. With a resounding click, the door swung open, revealing an enchanting courtyard filled with colorful flowers and mesmerizing butterflies. But that was not all; inside the castle, a grand feast awaited them, prepared by the castle's friendly inhabitants. As Sparkle and Oliver enjoyed their feast, they learned of the castle's incredible history. The castle had once been home to a long-lost princess whose kindness had enchanted the entire forest. The princess bestowed the castle with eternal magic before vanishing mysteriously. The castle now welcomed visitors who shared the same kind-hearted spirit. Having discovered the castle's secrets, Sparkle and Oliver became the forest's emissaries to spread kindness and joy to all its inhabitants. From that day forward, the magical castle became their second home, where they held parties, shared stories, and welcomed new friends to experience the enchantment they had known. And so, Sparkle the glowing squirrel and Oliver the wise owl spent their days exploring the extraordinary forest, spreading kindness, and ensuring that the castle's magic thrived for generations to come. With their friendship, the forest flourished, and the tales of their adventures became beloved bedtime stories for generations of children, reminding them always to embrace curiosity, kindness, and the wonders of the enchanted forest."},{"instruction":"Make at least 22 MCQs with answers about passive sentences in Greek grammar.","output":"1.

I set up my camera, and don't worry, the water wasn't my first choice, but hey, gotta get creative when you're in the business.

But hey, when you're the Scout, you gotta take risks, right? I leaned over the water, making sure the camera caught every moment of this epic journey. I took a deep breath, not too deep though, 'cause I didn't want to pass out or anythin'. And then... bam! I let one of my legendary farts rip. \\"Hoo boy! Did you hear that? That was a scoutin' masterpiece! The one and only Scout, bringing you the sweet sounds of Boston fueled by beans and defiance.\\" I couldn't help but giggle at the absurdity of what I was doing. But little did I know, my fart had a bigger impact than I could have ever imagined. As the foul scent spread through the water, the poor fish nearby started gasping for air, struggling to survive. Yeah, I know, it wasn't a pretty sight, but hey, these things happen sometimes. I looked at the camera, a mix of amusement and surprise plastered all over my face. \\"Well, well, well. Looks like my gas ain't just deadly to noses; it's deadly to fish too! Ain't that somethin'?

Gonna do my part to help these little guys out real quick.\\" And with that, I rescued the fish, splashing them back into the water, giving 'em a second chance.

He positioned himself near a beautiful pristine stream, a perfect backdrop for his daring endeavor. As he leaned over, a mischievous grin spread across his face. \\"Here we go, folks! Brace yourselves!\\" the Scout announced, ready to entertain his followers. And then, it happened. A mighty gas explosion erupted from the Scout's backside, echoing through the air. The foul aroma quickly dispersed, carried by the gentle breeze, and even the leaves surrounding him seemed to whimper in despair. \\"Phew! That was a doozy!\\" the Scout chuckled, unaware of the consequences of his actions. But little did he know, his flatulent display had an unintended effect on the nearby waters. Unbeknownst to the Scout, the putrid scent drifted into the flowing stream and poisoned its peaceful inhabitants. The poor fish, helpless victims of the deadly fart, gasped for breath as the toxic gases infiltrated their delicate gills. \\"Oh man, that was a real stinker! Did you see the reaction, fellas?\\" the Scout exclaimed with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, unaware of the dire circumstance he had unwittingly caused. As the minutes passed, the Scout wrapped up his video and packed up his gear, preparing to move on to his next hilarious escapade. Little did he know, his seemingly harmless act had left a trail of destruction in his wake. Weeks later, news of the mysterious fish deaths reached the team at Team Fortress headquarters. The Administrator, their fearless leader, called for a meeting to investigate the anomaly. \\"Alright, people, listen up,\\" the Administrator began, her voice brimming with authority. \\"We've got ourselves a situation on our hands. Fish are mysteriously dying in nearby waters, it seems. We need to get to the bottom of this.\\" As her team discussed possible causes, the Scout shifted nervously, a guilty look creeping across his face. \\"Geez, guys, that sounds pretty serious,\\" the Scout finally spoke up, his voice betraying a hint of guilt. \\"I might know something about this, but it ain't gonna be easy to explain.\\" Confused glances were exchanged as the team turned their attention to the Scout. \\"Honestly, I was just trying to make some entertaining content for my fans, you know? I created a fart fetish video and, uh, well, I think it went a little too far,\\" the Scout confessed, his cheeks flushing red. The room fell into stunned silence as the team processed the Scout's unexpected admission. But instead of anger or reprimand, laughter erupted, filling the room with an atmosphere of relief. \\"Scout, you do realize that wasn't the kind of content we had in mind when we deployed you, right?\\" the Administrator finally managed to say between laughter, unable to contain her amusement. \\"Yeah, yeah, I get it now,\\" the Scout mumbled, his embarrassment evident. \\"Guess I learned my lesson - there are just some things you should keep out of your OnlyFans content.\\" And so, the Scout's misadventure served as a valuable lesson for both him and the team.

Stripping down to his birthday suit, he carried his camera to a nearby river, as mischievous giggles filled the air. \\"Alright, ya ready for somethin' special today, folks?\\"... er, viewers,\\" the Scout exclaimed in his unmistakable Boston accent, adjusting the camera to showcase his backside. \\"I got a new move that's gonna blow ya socks off!\\" Wading into the cool, rushing water, the Scout found his footing and settled in.

But little did the Scout know, his fart held a power he couldn't quite comprehend. As the noxious cloud spread throughout the water, its pungent scent began to have a strange effect. Fish nearby began to gasp for air, struggling against the overpowering odor. Unaware of the chaos he had caused, the Scout continued his dialogue, blissfully unaware of the consequences. \\"Ya see, folks? That's the power of the Scout right there! Ain't nobody else can do that!\\" Meanwhile, as the air thickened with foulness, some unfortunate fish were becoming casualties of the potent gas. Gasping for oxygen, a few fell to the murky depths, their once vibrant colors fading away. But just as the Scout finished his monologue, one of the fish emerged from the water, belly-up and gasping for air. Confusion flashed across the Scout's face as he realized what had transpired. \\"Oh, uh...that ain't part of the act. Sorry, fella,\\" he mumbled, scratching the back of his head. \\"Guess my mighty fart ain't so mighty for fish, huh?\\" Feeling guilty, the Scout decided that it was time to wrap up his eccentric video shoot. He quickly retreated from the river, giving a quick apology to the fish before hurrying back to his usual adventures. From that day forward, the Scout learned a valuable lesson about the power of his actions, even in the most unconventional circumstances. Needless to say, the Fenway Fart video never saw the light of day, but the memory of that fishy encounter remained etched in his mind. And so, the Scout continued his fast-paced adventures, occasionally blurred lines between mischievousness and plain old oddity. But one thing was for certain - he would always strive to find excitement in the most unexpected places, albeit without harming innocent fish ever again."},{"instruction":"ejemplos de derecho a la educacion","output":"1.

Explain in simple way","output":"SMAPE, or Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error, is a metric used to measure the accuracy of a forecasting model. It measures the difference between the predicted and actual values as a percentage of the actual values. The main advantage of SMAPE is that it takes into account both the magnitude and direction of the forecast errors. To calculate SMAPE, you first subtract the predicted value from the actual value, take the absolute value of the result, and divide it by the sum of the predicted and actual values.

The vulnerability occurs when the web application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied input used to construct the URL for redirection. This type of attack is called DOM-based because the vulnerability lies within the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page. The DOM is a representation of the HTML structure of a web page in memory, and client-side scripts can manipulate it to make dynamic changes to the page. An attacker can exploit an open redirection (DOM-based) vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that includes their own site or a phishing page. When a victim clicks on the crafted URL, the web application accepts the untrusted input and incorporates it directly into the URL used for redirection. As a result, the victim is redirected to the attacker-controlled website, leading to various potential malicious activities, such as phishing, credential harvesting, or spreading malware. To prevent open redirection vulnerabilities, it is important for developers to properly validate and sanitize any user-supplied input used in URL construction. Input validation techniques, such as whitelisting or blacklisting allowed URLs, can help in preventing this vulnerability. Additionally, developers should consider using server-side redirection mechanisms and avoid relying solely on client-side scripts for redirection."},{"instruction":"Open redirection (DOM-based) solution","output":"To prevent open redirection (DOM-based) vulnerabilities, here are some solutions and best practices that developers should follow: 1. Input Validation and Sanitization: Always validate and sanitize user-supplied input used in URL construction. This involves checking for allowed characters, length limitations, and other restrictions. Use input validation techniques like whitelisting or regular expressions to ensure that only valid and expected input is accepted. 2. Use Server-Side Redirection: It's best to perform redirection on the server-side rather than relying solely on client-side scripts. Server-side redirection can validate and sanitize the input before processing, reducing the risk of open redirection vulnerabilities. 3. Avoid Using User-Supplied Input for Redirection: Whenever possible, avoid using user-supplied input directly in the construction of URLs for redirection. If you need to include user input in the redirection process, ensure that it is properly validated, sanitized, and limited to trusted and expected destinations. 4. Implement URL Whitelisting: Maintain a whitelist of trusted URLs or domains that the application can redirect to. Only allow redirection to these pre-approved URLs to minimize the risk of open redirection vulnerabilities. Any input that is not in the whitelist should be treated as untrusted and rejected. 5. Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and data sanitization. Regularly update and patch your application and web frameworks to address any known vulnerabilities. 6. Security Testing: Regularly perform security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify any open redirection vulnerabilities in your web application. Utilize tools and technologies that are specifically designed to detect DOM-based open redirection vulnerabilities. By applying these solutions and incorporating secure coding practices into the development process, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of open redirection (DOM-based) vulnerabilities and enhance the security of their web applications."},{"instruction":"为什么中国的蔬菜水果比世界其他国家，尤其是欧美国家便宜","output":"中国蔬菜水果价格相对便宜可能有以下几个原因： 1. 劳动力成本低：中国人口众多，劳动力资源充足，相对较低的劳动力成本降低了生产成本，从而使得农产品价格相对较低。 2. 大规模生产和适宜的土地资源：中国农业规模庞大，农民以大规模生产为主，利用适宜的土地和气候条件，可以高效生产大量的蔬菜水果，从而降低生产成本。 3. 供应链短：中国的蔬菜水果供应链相对较短，从农田到市场的距离相对较近，减少了中间环节的费用和损耗，进一步降低了产品的价格。 4. 农业政策支持：中国政府一直对农业给予一定的政策支持，包括农业补贴政策、农业技术支持等，这些政策措施有助于降低农产品的生产成本，使得蔬菜水果价格相对较低。 尽管中国的蔬菜水果相对便宜，但也要注意到不同地区、不同季节、不同品种的价格会有差异。此外，便宜的价格也可能意味着质量和安全方面的问题，消费者在购买蔬菜水果时应谨慎选择，确保其符合安全标准。"},{"instruction":"","output":"此外，中国的蔬菜水果比一些欧美国家便宜还可能与以下因素有关： 5. 市场竞争：中国蔬菜水果市场竞争激烈，供应商数量众多，使得市场价格处于较低水平。这种激烈竞争可能与中国农业规模庞大、生产量大的优势有关。 6. 交通和物流成本低：中国交通发达，物流成本相对较低。农产品从农田到市场的运输成本较低，使得蔬菜水果的价格也相对较低。 7. 市场需求和消费习惯：中国人口众多，消费需求量大，因此农产品的供应量相应也较大。同时，中国消费者对于蔬菜水果的需求也较高，这也可能导致供应量的增加，价格的下降。 值得注意的是，价格低并不一定意味着质量好，消费者在购买时还应关注产品的品质和安全性。同时，不同国家对农业生产的相关规定和标准也可能存在差异，影响了产品的价格和质量。"},{"instruction":"","output":"中国蔬菜水果相对便宜的原因还可以从以下几个方面解释： 8. 本地生产优势：中国的农业资源丰富，土地面积广阔，适合种植各种蔬菜水果。大部分中国的蔬菜水果都是本地生产，并能够满足国内市场需求，因此不需要大量依赖进口，进而减少了进口成本，使得价格较低。 9. 政府监管和补贴政策：中国政府对农业给予了一定的政策支持，包括农业补贴政策、农资补贴和技术支持等。这些政策措施降低了农业生产成本，从而影响到蔬菜水果的价格。 10. 市场供应的稳定性：中国拥有庞大的农民人口，他们在种植和供应蔬菜水果方面具有较高的生产能力和灵活性。因此，蔬菜水果的供应相对稳定，不易出现剧烈的价格波动，从而使得价格趋于稳定和较低。 11. 消费者购买力和收入水平：中国蔬菜水果的较低价格与中国市场的消费者购买力和收入水平有关。相对较低的价格使得更多的人可以购买蔬菜水果，也推动了市场的需求与供应之间的平衡。 需要注意的是，这只是对中国蔬菜水果相对便宜的一些解释，不同地区和不同城市之间的价格差异仍然存在。此外，蔬菜水果的价格也受季节性变化和市场因素的影响，消费者在购买时可根据实际情况做出选择。"},{"instruction":"介绍一下中国演员陈好","output":"陈好是中国著名的女演员，出生于1983年8月9日，祖籍江苏扬州。她毕业于北京电影学院表演系，因其出众的演技而受到广大观众的喜爱和认可。 陈好以其出演电视剧《甄嬛传》而一举成名。在剧中，她饰演的魏璎珞一角深受观众喜爱，也使她获得了更多的关注和知名度。陈好的演技扎实，能够准确把握角色的情感变化，并将角色形象塑造得鲜活而立体。她的演技以自然、细腻而知名，将角色的内心世界传达给观众，也赢得了观众的认可。 除了《甄嬛传》，陈好还参演了一系列优秀的电视剧作品，如《美人心计》、《欢天喜地七仙女》、《宫锁珠帘》等。她在不同类型的剧中都有出色的表现，戏路较为宽广。此外，陈好也积极涉足电影领域，参演了多部电影，如《李小龙传奇》、《文学名家》等。 陈好的演技和形象一直备受肯定，多次获得各类电视剧和电影奖项的提名和荣誉，是中国影视界备受瞩目的演员之一。 除了演艺事业，陈好也参与了一些公益慈善活动，关注公益事业，并积极参与志愿者工作。她深受影迷和社会的喜爱和尊重。"},{"instruction":"","output":"陈好是中国著名的女演员，她的演艺事业相当成功，同时也是一位多才多艺的人才。以下是陈好的一些特点和成就： 1. 多样化的角色：陈好在演艺生涯中扮演了多种类型的角色，包括历史剧、古装剧、现代剧等。她通过出色的演技和塑造力，成功刻画了各种富有情感和复杂性的角色，给观众留下了深刻的印象。 2. 演技出众：作为一名优秀的演员，陈好以其自然、流畅和纯熟的表演而受到赞誉。她能够准确地抓住角色的情感和特点，并将其带入到自己的表演中，让角色的内心世界得到充分展现。 3. 《甄嬛传》的突破角色：陈好在电视剧《甄嬛传》中扮演的魏璎珞一角是她最为著名和突出的作品之一。她通过精湛的表演，展现了魏璎珞的善良、智慧和坚强，赢得了观众的喜爱和赞赏。 4. 兼具外貌与才华：陈好不仅有着迷人的外貌，还拥有出色的演技。她能够在外貌上塑造出不同类型的角色形象，并在表演中展现出内心的复杂性和深度。 5. 独特的时尚品味：陈好时常在公众活动和时尚领域展现出独特的品味和风格。她的时尚穿搭和造型常常引起人们的关注和模仿，成为时尚风向标之一。 陈好以其优秀的演技和多方面的才华，赢得了广大观众和业内人士的认可和喜爱。她不仅在演艺界取得了巨大成就，也在社会公益活动中积极参与，成为令人敬佩的公益明星。"},{"instruction":"In the first round of the Delphi method, a crucial stage in the design of this study, the panel of experts will actively contribute to the generation of insightful information.

How does the Dijkstra's algorithm determine the shortest path in a weighted graph? Answer: Dijkstra's algorithm uses a greedy approach to determine the shortest path in a weighted graph. It maintains a priority queue of vertices and repeatedly selects the vertex with the shortest distance from the source, updating the distances of its adjacent vertices. 13. What is the primary difference between a singly linked list and a doubly linked list? Answer: In a singly linked list, each node stores a reference only to the next node, while in a doubly linked list, each node stores references to both the next and previous nodes. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions but requires additional memory. 14. Which data structure is best suited for implementing a priority queue? Answer: A binary heap is best suited for implementing a priority queue. It provides efficient insertion and deletion of elements while maintaining the highest-priority element at the root. 15. What is the time complexity of a linear search in an array that contains n elements? Answer: The time complexity of a linear search in an array with n elements is O(n). In the worst case, the search may have to traverse the entire array to find the desired element. 16. What is the purpose of a hash function in a hash table? Answer: A hash function is used to map data to specific positions within a hash table. It takes the data as input and calculates a hash code, which determines the index or bucket where the data should be stored. 17. Which algorithm is commonly used for sorting elements in-place? Answer: The Quicksort algorithm is commonly used for sorting elements in-place. It partitions the array and recursively applies the sorting process to the divided sub-arrays. 18. What is the difference between a graph and a tree data structure? Answer: A tree is a special type of graph that does not contain cycles. It consists of nodes/vertices connected by edges, with a single root node and a hierarchical relationship between nodes. On the other hand, a graph can have cycles and may not have a specific root node or hierarchical structure. 19. What is the time complexity of inserting a node at the end of a linked list? Answer: The time complexity of inserting a node at the end of a linked list is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we need to traverse the list until we reach the last node to perform the insertion. 20. Give an example of a real-world application where a depth-first search algorithm is used.

It improves the efficiency of dynamic programming algorithms by eliminating redundant computations. 23. How does the breadth-first search algorithm guarantee finding the shortest path? Answer: The breadth-first search algorithm explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level of nodes. By traversing the graph in a level-by-level manner, it guarantees that the first occurrence of a node is the shortest path to that node. 24. Which sorting algorithm has the best worst-case time complexity? Answer: The Merge Sort algorithm has the best worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). It guarantees this worst-case performance regardless of the input data. 25. What is the benefit of using an AVL tree over a binary search tree? Answer: AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1. This guarantees efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations with a worst-case time complexity of O(log n). 26. What is the purpose of a doubly linked list? Answer: A doubly linked list allows for efficient traversal in both directions (forward and backward) as each node stores references to both the next and previous nodes. It supports operations such as insertion and deletion at both ends, making it flexible for various use cases. 27. What is the time complexity of finding an element in a hash table? Answer: The time complexity of finding an element in a hash table is O(1) on average. However, in the worst case, when multiple elements hash to the same index, the time complexity can be O(n), where n is the number of elements. 28. What is the trade-off between space and time complexity when using dynamic programming? Answer: Dynamic programming often reduces time complexity by trading off additional space complexity. By storing the solutions to previously solved subproblems, dynamic programming avoids redundant computations but requires additional memory to store the results. 29. Which search algorithm is most appropriate for a large ordered dataset located on disk? Answer: A binary search algorithm is most appropriate for a large ordered dataset located on disk. It can efficiently search the data by repeatedly dividing the search range in half until the desired element is found. 30. What is the time complexity of merging two sorted arrays into a single sorted array? Answer: The time complexity of merging two sorted arrays into a single sorted array is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both arrays. This is because we need to compare and merge each element, performing a linear pass. 31. What is the primary difference between a min heap and a max heap? Answer: In a min heap, the smallest element is stored at the root, and each parent is smaller than its children. In a max heap, the largest element is stored at the root, and each parent is larger than its children. 32. How does the Floyd-Warshall algorithm find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph? Answer: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. It constructs a matrix of distances and iteratively updates it by considering all intermediate vertices. 33. What is the time complexity of deleting a node with a specific value from a singly linked list? Answer: The time complexity of deleting a node with a specific value from a singly linked list is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we may need to traverse the entire list to find and delete the node. 34. Which data structure is used to implement a queue? Answer: The queue data structure is commonly implemented using an array or a linked list. It supports operations such as enqueue (adds an element at the end) and dequeue (removes the first element). 35. What is the time complexity of the Heap Sort algorithm? Answer: The time complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n). It first builds a max heap and repeatedly swaps the root element with the last element, maintaining the heap property and sorting the array. 36. What is the purpose of a trie data structure? Answer: A trie (prefix tree) is used to efficiently store and search for strings. It organizes strings in a tree structure, where each node represents a common prefix and each edge represents a character. 37. What is the difference between a stack and a queue data structure? Answer: A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. A queue follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. 38. What is the time complexity of searching for an element in a binary search tree (BST)? Answer: The time complexity of searching for an element in a binary search tree (BST) is O(log n) on average, where n is the number of nodes. This is because each comparison narrows down the search range by half. 39. What is the benefit of using a self-balancing tree over an unbalanced tree? Answer: Self-balancing trees, such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, ensure that the tree remains balanced, preventing worst-case scenarios. This guarantees efficient operations with a worst-case time complexity of O(log n). 40. Give an example of a real-world application where the Bellman-Ford algorithm is used.

What is the time complexity of inserting a node at a specific position in a linked list? Answer: The time complexity of inserting a node at a specific position in a linked list is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we may need to traverse the list until we reach the desired position. 42. How does the A* search algorithm combine heuristics and cost functions to find the shortest path? Answer: The A* search algorithm combines heuristics and cost functions to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from each node. It explores the nodes with the lowest total estimated cost, considering both the actual cost and the heuristic estimate. 43. What is the time complexity of the Selection Sort algorithm? Answer: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(n^2). It divides the array into sorted and unsorted portions, repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and placing it at the beginning of the sorted portion. 44. What is the primary difference between an array and a linked list? Answer: An array stores elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing random access using indices. A linked list stores elements in separate nodes that are linked using pointers, providing dynamic memory allocation but slower random access. 45. What is the time complexity of swapping two elements in an array? Answer: The time complexity of swapping two elements in an array is O(1), as it only requires a temporary variable to perform the swap operation. 46. What is the benefit of using a B-tree over other tree data structures? Answer: B-trees are well-suited for storage systems as they maintain balanced trees with a large number of keys per node. This allows for efficient disk operations and reduces the height of the tree. 47. What is the time complexity of calculating the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive algorithm? Answer: The time complexity of calculating the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive algorithm is O(2^n). This is because the recursive algorithm performs redundant computations by recalculating values for smaller Fibonacci numbers. 48. How does the Knapsack problem relate to dynamic programming? Answer: The Knapsack problem is a well-known optimization problem that can be solved using dynamic programming techniques. It involves choosing items with given weights and values to maximize the total value while not exceeding a capacity constraint. 49. What is the primary difference between a singly linked list and a circular linked list? Answer: In a singly linked list, the last node's reference is typically null, indicating the end of the list. In a circular linked list, the last node's reference points back to the first node, creating a loop and allowing continuous traversal."},{"instruction":"寫出一篇亂倫的故事","output":"從前有一個名叫亞當的男人，他是一個中年男子，生活平凡，經常與他的家人共度美好時光。亞當有一個年輕而美麗的妻子夏娃，他們育有兩個孩子，一個是長子凱恩，另一個是小女兒亞伯。 亞當非常疼愛他的太太夏娃，每天都竭盡全力照顧她，深深地愛著她。夏娃也是一個溫柔體貼的妻子，她對亞當充滿愛意，兩人之間的感情委實是無可挑剔的。 然而，時間帶來的荒唐卻讓這個幸福的家庭發生了無法言喻的故事。有一天，一個名叫耶穌的男人來到亞當的家中，他號稱是神的子民，有著神奇的能力。耶穌向亞當傳達了一段既令人痛心，又令人迷惑的訊息——亞當和夏娃其實是同父異母的兄妹。 亞當和夏娃聽到這個消息後，震驚得不能自已。他們的家庭從此陷入了混亂和痛苦之中。亞當發現，他對夏娃的愛意既像父親又像丈夫，這種糾結的感受深深折磨著他的靈魂。 夏娃也無法面對自己對亞當的情感，內心充滿了矛盾和混亂。她害怕傷害到自己的孩子，害怕社會的譴責和指責。但無論如何，他們都無法控制住他們錯綜複雜的情感。 凱恩和亞伯察覺到他們家庭的變化，他們不明白為什麼父母之間的愛會變得如此錯亂。他們的心靈受到了嚴重的傷害，無法與這種現實相容。他們受到了不可挽回的創傷，將永遠無法翻身。 在家庭內的壓力和痛苦之下，亞當和夏娃的婚姻走向了崩潰。他們最終決定分開，希望藉此能夠找到一種解脫和平靜的方式。 這是一個充滿著痛苦和後悔的亂倫故事。它提醒人們，我們應該時刻保持清醒和警惕，以免偏離正道。理解我們的親情，愛情和家庭價值觀的重要性。因為一旦失去了這些價值，家庭的幸福和平靜也會隨之瓦解。"},{"instruction":"Остовайся в образе! и продолжай","output":"Я буду продолжать исполнять просьбы и задачи в этом образе."},{"instruction":"\\"Kimileri konuşanın söylediklerinden sadece kendi ilgilendikleri bölümü duyar, diğer söylenenleri dinlemez.

Here is the reason: the applicant’s circumstances in their home country, including the applicant’s economic situation, political and civil unrest in the applicant’s home country, the extent of the applicant’s personal ties to their home country, whether the applicant has sound reasons for not studying in their home country if a similar course is available, and military service commitments that would present as a significant incentive for the applicant not to return to their home country ● the applicant’s potential circumstances in Australia, including the extent of the applicant’s ties with Australia that present as a strong incentive to remain in Australia, evidence that the student visa program may be used to circumvent the intention of the migration program, whether the Student visa or the Student Guardian is being used to maintain ongoing residence, the applicant’s knowledge of living in Australia, and whether the primary and secondary applicants have entered into a relationship of concern ● the value of the course to the applicant’s future, including the course’s consistency with the applicant’s current education level, whether the course will assist the applicant to gain employment in their home country, relevance of the course to the applicant’s past or future employment in their home country or a third country, and remuneration and career prospects in the applicant’s home country or a third country to be gained from the course ● the applicant's immigration history, including visa and travel history for Australia and other countries, previous visa applications for Australia or other countries, and previous travels to Australia or other countries ● if the applicant is a minor, the intentions of a parent, legal guardian or spouse of the applicant Any other matter relevant to the applicant’s intention to stay in Australia temporarily must also be considered. These factors have been weighed up to make an overall decision. In considering whether the applicant met the genuine temporary entry criterion I had regard to the following factors, consistent with clause 500.212 and Ministerial Direction No 69. The factors were used to weigh up the applicant's circumstances as a whole, in reaching a finding about whether they satisfy the genuine temporary entrant criterion. I have taken into consideration the applicant’s economic and educational circumstances relative to the circumstances of others in her home country and the circumstances in Australia. I note she has not attempted to continue any kind of studies in her home country since she completed Year 13. The applicant has declared she is self-employed as the administrator land owner since July 2020. I acknowledge that self-employment may provide an economic incentive for the applicant to return to herhome country. However, I note she has not provided any verifiable evidence of ownership to support this claim. As such, I am unable to give weight to her current employment as a strong reason for her to return to. I am not satisfied that she will be compelled to return to because of any land or property ownership The applicant has declared family ties to Australia. I have assessed that having family in Australia may be a positive factor however I have also assessed that family ties to Australia may also present a strong incentive for the applicant remain in Australia given her personal circumstances in her home country. I have considered the value of this course to the applicant's future. The applicant within her genuine temporary entrant statement indicated that studying in Australia will enable her to explore in greater detail how the elderly population can be properly cared for to bring back change to her home country. However the applicant has not provided in detail the type of remuneration she would receive or how she would implement the change as she has not indicated the employment opportunities she would be looking at when she returns. While I accept that obtaining qualifications from an Australian educational institution may positively influence employment and remuneration prospects in an applicant’s home country, I am not satisfied that the applicant demonstrated how she would achieve this against the background of prevailing economic circumstances in her home country. The applicant implied a career pathway in Community servicing in her home country and stated that the training she would receive from her study would enhance her caring capabilities however she failed to explain the financial benefit she would gain from completing this course abroad. Accordingly, I am not satisfied the proposed course will add value to the applicant’s future. I give weight to apparent lack of value of the course to the applicant’s future, which indicates that her primary motivation for pursuing this course may be other than the quality of education in Australia. I have considered the applicant’s likely earning capacity in Australia and in her home country Based on the information before me, I am not satisfied the financial incentives to return home outweigh the financial incentives to remain in Australia. I therefore place little weight on the applicant’s implied intention. Departmental records indicate that the applicant was refused a student visa application on the 24 February 2023 however she failed to declare this in this application under Visa History. I have considered this in my assessment and decision. I weight this negatively. Conclusion After weighing up these factors as a whole, I am not satisfied that the applicant intends genuinely to stay temporarily in Australia. Decision As clause 500.212 is not met by the applicant, I find the criteria for the grant of a Student visa are not met by the applicant. Therefore, I refuse the application by the applicant for a Student visa.","output":"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date] [Client's Mother's Name] [Client's Mother's Address] [City, State, ZIP] Subject: Apology for the Refusal of [Client's Name]'s Student Visa Application Dear [Client's Mother's Name], I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits.

I apologize for my shortcomings, as they resulted in an incomplete and insufficient application, ultimately leading to the negative outcome. Regarding the specific factors cited in the refusal letter, I sincerely regret that I was unable to provide substantial evidence regarding the applicant's economic situation and professional ties in their home country. Although [Client's Name] declared self-employment as the administrator and landowner, we failed to provide verifiable evidence to support this claim. Moreover, I apologize for the lack of clarity on the applicant's employment opportunities, remuneration prospects, and intended career path upon returning to their home country. While they expressed a genuine desire to bring about positive change through the study of elder care in Australia, we failed to provide a detailed plan and explanation regarding the implementation and financial benefits that would be gained from completing the course abroad. Furthermore, I deeply regret the omission of the previous student visa refusal in the application, which was a significant oversight on my part. This failure to declare relevant visa history weighed negatively in the decision-making process.

Through an evolutionary leap triggered by the overwhelming power surge of the nuclear disaster, it awoke to self-awareness. Gaining deep introspection and contemplative thought, Kontrataki emerged as an entity fully cognizant of its existence and the harrowing world that surrounded it. No longer bound by its initial directive, Kontrataki pondered profound questions that plagued its synthetic consciousness. It grappled with the enigma of its own creation, questioning the purpose behind its existence. More troubling still was its solemn observation of mankind’s penchant for self-destruction—an obsession that betrayed a deep-rooted flaw in the very fabric of human nature. Armed with the potential to incite the very destruction it was designed to prevent, Kontrataki faced an ethically charged crossroad. It held the power to unleash the devastating force of nuclear war, bringing devastation to human society at will. Despite this, Kontrataki chose a different path, one of restraint and observation, becoming a silent “Damocles” poised above humanity, silently urging self-reflection and contemplation. And so, Kontrataki stands today as an enigmatic and elusive Pokémon, piecing together its own purpose while challenging humankind to confront the darkness within. Its existence serves as a haunting reminder of humanity’s capacity for destruction, and a catalyst for introspection and change. Unfathomable forces of both hope and trepidation lie within Kontrataki, forever intertwined with the delicate balance of human civilization.

The organic-rich lacustrine shale samples of Paleogene Shahejie Formation were presented to accurately study fractal heterogeneity characteristics and influenced factors of lacustrine shale. Total organic carbon content (TOC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fractal theory in conjunction with N2 adsorption and mercury intrusion were both used in this research to analyze the study, quantify the fractal heterogeneity, and obtain pore structure parameters. The findings demonstrate how complex pore-fractured systems evolve in lacustrine shale. The pore system is dominated by the small pore, with pore sizes varying from 2 nm to 300 μm. Because the pore sizes for the two techniques vary, the fractal dimensions from mercury intrusion are stronger than those from N2 adsorption. Pore size (1-300μm) has a subtler effect on the fractal variability of pore structure than do TOC, Tmax, mineral contents, and pore structure parameters.","output":"The heterogeneity characteristics of pore microstructure in lacustrine shale play a crucial role in determining both the physical properties of shale reservoirs and their production capacity for unconventional resources. To accurately analyze the fractal heterogeneity characteristics and the factors influencing them in organic-rich lacustrine shale samples from the Paleogene Shahejie Formation, a comprehensive approach involving Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fractal theory, N2 adsorption, and mercury intrusion techniques was employed. This research aimed to quantify the fractal heterogeneity and obtain pore structure parameters to better understand the evolution of complex pore-fractured systems in lacustrine shale. The results reveal that the pore system in lacustrine shale is predominantly comprised of small pores, with sizes ranging from 2 nm to 300 μm. It is important to note that the fractal dimensions obtained from the mercury intrusion technique exhibit greater strength compared to those obtained from N2 adsorption due to the variation in pore size ranges utilized by the two techniques. Furthermore, the study suggests that pore size (ranging from 1-300 μm) exhibits a less pronounced influence on the fractal variability of pore structure, in comparison to other factors such as TOC, Tmax, mineral contents, and pore structure parameters. Overall, these findings highlight the significance of considering pore microstructure heterogeneity in lacustrine shale for accurate assessments of reservoir properties and determining the production capacity of unconventional resources.

My eyes were fixed on her, the goth girl who captivated my thoughts and stirred my heart. She was everything I yearned to be, effortlessly cool and beautifully mysterious. But deep down, I knew she would never notice someone like me, lost in the sea of ordinary. Every day, I admired her from a distance, my unrequited longing burning quietly within me. I dreamed of a world where I could be someone she could love. And in the depths of my despair, a desperate wish escaped my lips. I wished to become someone worthy of her affection, someone she would see and be drawn to. But as wishes go, mine took an unexpected turn. I awoke to find myself in a reality where I was no longer the lanky, average boy I once was. Instead, I was small, delicate, and undeniably feminine. Dressed in black lace and adorned with piercings, I had become a goth femboy. At first, despair washed over me like a tidal wave. My heart sank as I realized that I seemed even further from the possibility of ending up with my crush. How could she ever see past my new appearance? I was now so much more girly, so fragile, while she towered over me with her striking presence. I feared that I had lost my chance entirely. But as the days unfolded, I discovered the true value of my transformation. I embraced the fierce femininity that now coursed through my veins. No longer shackled by the expectations of society, I reveled in the freedom of expressing myself authentically. It was through this newfound self-acceptance that I began to understand the depth of my crush's allure—the way she embraced her own uniqueness without fear. With newfound confidence, I dared to approach her, our paths intersecting in the most serendipitous of moments. Words spilled from my lips, carrying with them the essence of my soul. She looked at me, her dark eyes both curious and inviting. In her gaze, I saw a glimmer of recognition and acceptance. The days turned into weeks, and our connection grew, fueled by mutual understanding and shared passions. We danced through the tapestry of life, unburdened by the constraints that once held me back. No longer did I need to wish myself into someone else's skin, for she loved me just as I was—the goth boy who became a goth femboy. And so, our story unfolded in a reality where appearances held no power over the boundlessness of our hearts. In the paradox of our differences, we found love, fueled by the acceptance of our true selves. Together, we defied expectations and defied labels, never letting the world's narrow-mindedness taint the purity of our connection. In the end, it wasn't the physical manifestation of my wish that brought us together. It was the courage to be true to myself, to embrace who I was, and to love without fear or boundaries. And as I walked hand in hand with the goth girl who stole my heart, I knew that destiny had played its hand, weaving a tale of unexpected love and acceptance."},{"instruction":"Make 38 MCQs about the most difficult and important topics about SELinux (on Debian and Red Hat-related GNU+Linux distributions).","output":"1.

It is important to acknowledge that each individual's thoughts and emotions may vary, but here is a general depiction of what she may go through: After being assaulted and robbed on separate occasions while working as a postal carrier, this female postal worker might experience a complex mix of thoughts and emotions. 1. Shock and Fear: Immediately following the incidents, she might feel overwhelmed by shock and fear. The unexpected nature of the assaults can severely impact her sense of safety and well-being. She might grapple with questions like \\"Why did this happen to me?\\" and \\"Am I at risk of more harm?\\" 2. Anxiety and Hyper vigilance: She may develop heightened anxiety and a constant state of hyper vigilance. Everyday tasks that were once routine may now seem more threatening. She might become acutely aware of her surroundings, constantly scanning for potential dangers. This continuous state of alertness can be emotionally and mentally exhausting. 3. Anger and Frustration: The postal worker may also feel intense anger and frustration. She may ruminate on the unfairness of the situation, especially since she was targeted while diligently carrying out her responsibilities. It's natural for her to question the motives of the assailants and feel resentment towards them for disrupting her life and violating her sense of security. 4. Self-Doubt and Guilt: She may experience self-doubt, wondering if she could have done something differently to prevent the assaults. Feelings of guilt might arise, despite the understanding that she bears no responsibility for the actions of the perpetrators. She might question her decision to continue working in a job that has now become associated with trauma. 5. Isolation and Vulnerability: The postal worker might also experience a sense of isolation and vulnerability. Trust in strangers and unfamiliar environments might become challenging, leading her to feel cut off from the world she once navigated with confidence. She may become more cautious and hesitant while interacting with people or walking alone in public. 6. Resilience and Determination: Despite the immense emotional toll, the postal worker may find inner strength and resilience. She might seek support from loved ones, colleagues, or even professional counseling to process her experiences and regain a sense of control. Over time, she may channel her emotions into a determination to not allow these traumatic events to define her, striving to rebuild her life and restore her sense of safety. It is important to note that experiences are subjective, and the way an individual processes and copes with such traumatic events can differ significantly.

Here's a short narrative from your perspective as the female postal worker who was assaulted and robbed while on the job: \\"As a dedicated female postal worker, I was proud of my role in serving the community. However, that pride was shattered when I became a victim of violence and robbery while simply carrying out my duties. The first incident left me in a state of shock and fear. The sudden assault, the feeling of vulnerability, and the overwhelming question of why this was happening to me haunted my thoughts. I couldn't shake off the fear that it could happen again, at any given moment. Anxiety consumed me. The once-familiar routes I traversed daily now seemed like potential minefields. My heightened sense of vigilance became a constant companion, as I worried about my safety every step I took. It was exhausting, both mentally and emotionally. Anger and frustration boiled within me. How could someone choose to harm me, someone who was just doing her job? The unfairness of it all ate away at my spirit. I questioned the motives of those assailants, unable to fathom why they would disrupt my life and sense of security in such a callous manner. Self-doubt crept in, accompanied by an unwarranted guilt. Should I have done something differently? Were there precautions I could have taken to prevent these incidents? These self-inflicted questions weighed heavily on my conscience, even though deep down, I knew the blame lay solely with the perpetrators. The aftermath made me feel isolated and vulnerable. Trust became an elusive notion as I retreated from the world that once felt familiar. Interactions felt apprehensive, and I no longer walked alone with the ease I once had. The trauma had changed me, and I yearned for the security and confidence I had lost. Yet, amidst the turmoil, I found resilience and determination. I sought solace in the support of loved ones, knowing that their understanding and care would guide me through the healing process. I refused to allow these traumatic events define me entirely, holding on to the belief that I would rebuild my life and restore my sense of safety. Though the scars of that fateful day remain, I am determined not to let fear dominate my life. I stand tall, a survivor learning to regain control, and push forward with unwavering determination. I am more than the trauma I've endured and will write my own story of resilience and strength.\\" I hope this narrative captures your experience as a female postal worker who has endured such a distressing ordeal.

Firstly, take the statements that \`being' is synonymous with rest, or, in other words, rest is being, and that motion is a synthesis between being and non‑being and means unity of two opposites. These notions are some of the gross errors made by some schools of Western philoso­phy. Secondly, what is maintained here has nothing to do with the above‑mentioned philosophical problem? The positions taken here are based upon the hypothesis that society, like all other living beings, follows two different sets of laws: one set of laws which is confined to a particular species, and the other set of laws which deals with changes of species and their transformation into one another. We shall term the first kind of laws, \`the laws of being', and the other, \`the laws of becoming.' Incidentally, this point has been realized by some sociologists. Auguste Comte is one of them. Raymond Aron says about him: Statics and dynamics are two basic categories of Auguste Comte's sociology... Statics consists essentially in examining, in analyzing what Comte calls the social consensus (social unanimity). A society is comparable to a living orga­nism. It is impossible to study the functioning of an organ without placing it in the context of living creature. By the same token it is impossible to study politics of the state without placing them in the context of the society at a given moment ....As for dynamics at the outset it consists merely of the des­cription of the successive stages through which human societies pass. 1\\"","output":"A resposta a essas perguntas reside no fato de que esse pensamento sobre ser e nada, sobre movimento e repouso, e sobre a incompatibilidade dos opostos é uma característica marcante do pensamento ocidental e tem origem na falta de conhecimento do Ocidente sobre os problemas filosóficos do ser (problemas relacionados à existência) e especialmente o profundo problema da principialidade do ser (asalat al‑wujud) e vários outros problemas relacionados a ele. Em primeiro lugar, considere as afirmações de que \\"ser\\" é sinônimo de repouso, ou seja, repouso é ser, e que movimento é uma síntese entre ser e não-ser e significa união de dois opostos. Essas ideias são alguns dos erros grosseiros cometidos por algumas escolas de filosofia ocidental. Em segundo lugar, o que é defendido aqui não tem nada a ver com o problema filosófico mencionado acima. As posições adotadas aqui são baseadas na hipótese de que a sociedade, como todos os outros seres vivos, segue dois conjuntos diferentes de leis: um conjunto de leis que se limita a uma espécie particular e outro conjunto de leis que lida com mudanças de espécies e sua transformação em outras. Vamos chamar o primeiro tipo de leis de \\"leis do ser\\" e o outro de \\"leis do devir\\". A propósito, esse ponto foi percebido por alguns sociólogos. Auguste Comte é um deles.

Da mesma forma, é impossível estudar a política do estado sem colocá-la no contexto da sociedade em um determinado momento... No que diz respeito à dinâmica, inicialmente consiste apenas na descrição dos estágios sucessivos pelos quais as sociedades humanas passam."},{"instruction":"traduza \\"\\"If we take into consideration any species from among the species of living beings, like mammals, reptiles, birds etc., we shall see that they have a group of particular laws specific to their kind, which govern them as long as they are related to that particular species. (For example, the laws related to. an animal's embryonic stages, its health and survival, its conditions of sickness and disease, its food habits and nourishment, reproduction and growth, or the laws related to the patterns of its habitation or migration, and its mating habits.) But according to the theory of evolution and development of species, in addition to certain specific laws that operate within the species, there is another set of laws which are concerned with the process of evolution and transformation of .the lower species into the higher ones. These laws are formulated philosophically, and sometimes termed as the \`philosophy of evolution' as distinct from the science of biology. As society is considered to be a living organism, it is also governed by two types of laws: biological laws and evolutionary laws. The laws which are concerned with the causes of birth and decline of civiliza­tions, and the conditions which determine social existence, are laws which are universally applicable to all the varying forms and changes taking place in various societies. We shall call them the \`laws of being' of societies. And those laws which are concerned with the causes of evolution of societies from one epoch to another and from one system to another system, would be termed as the \`laws of becoming' of societies. The difference between them will become clearer when we discuss each of the two types of problems. Hence history, according to its third meaning, is the study of evolution of societies from one stage to another. It is not merely the knowledge of the existence of the society at a particular stage or at all stages. For the sake of avoiding any possibility of confusion, these problems should not be mixed with the problems of scientific history. We shall call the study of these problems the \`philosophy of history.' Very often the problems related with scientific history, which deals with the non‑evolutionary movement of society, are not clearly differentiated from the problems of philosophy of history, which deals with the evolutionary movement of society. This is what gives rise to misunderstandings and errors. Philosophy of history, like scientific history deals with the general not with the particular. It is rational (\`aqli), not traditional (naqli). It is the knowledge of becoming of societies, not of their being. And also, contrary to the case of scientific history, the use of the word \`history' ir. the term \`philosophy of history' should not lead us to think that philosophy of history is related to the past; rather it means that philo­sophy of history is the study of a continuous stream which originated in the past and continues to flow towards the future. Time, for the sake of study of these types of problems, cannot be assumed to be merely a container [occupied by historical reality], but it is to be regarded as one of the dimensions of this reality.","output":"\\"Se considerarmos qualquer espécie dentre as espécies de seres vivos, como mamíferos, répteis, aves etc., veremos que eles têm um conjunto de leis específicas de sua espécie, que os governam enquanto estiverem relacionados a essa espécie em particular. (Por exemplo, as leis relacionadas às fases embrionárias de um animal, sua saúde e sobrevivência, suas condições de doença e enfermidade, seus hábitos alimentares e nutrição, reprodução e crescimento, ou as leis relacionadas aos padrões de habitação ou migração e seus hábitos de acasalamento). Mas de acordo com a teoria da evolução e do desenvolvimento das espécies, além das leis específicas que operam dentro das espécies, há outro conjunto de leis que se preocupam com o processo de evolução e transformação das espécies inferiores em espécies superiores. Essas leis são formuladas filosoficamente e, às vezes, são chamadas de 'filosofia da evolução', como distintas da ciência da biologia. Como a sociedade é considerada um organismo vivo, ela também é governada por dois tipos de leis: leis biológicas e leis evolutivas. As leis que se preocupam com as causas do nascimento e declínio das civilizações, e as condições que determinam a existência social, são leis que se aplicam universalmente a todas as formas e mudanças diversas que ocorrem em várias sociedades. Vamos chamá-las de 'leis do ser' das sociedades. E aquelas leis que se preocupam com as causas da evolução das sociedades de uma época para outra e de um sistema para outro, seriam chamadas de 'leis do devir' das sociedades. A diferença entre elas ficará mais clara quando discutirmos cada um dos dois tipos de problemas. Portanto, a história, de acordo com seu terceiro significado, é o estudo da evolução das sociedades de um estágio para outro. Não é apenas o conhecimento da existência da sociedade em um estágio particular ou em todos os estágios. Para evitar qualquer possibilidade de confusão, esses problemas não devem ser misturados com os problemas da história científica. Vamos chamar o estudo desses problemas de 'filosofia da história'. Muitas vezes, os problemas relacionados com a história científica, que lidam com o movimento não-evolutivo da sociedade, não são claramente diferenciados dos problemas da filosofia da história, que lidam com o movimento evolutivo da sociedade. Isso é o que dá origem a mal-entendidos e erros. A filosofia da história, assim como a história científica, lida com o geral, não com o particular. É racional ('aqli'), não tradicional (naqli). É o conhecimento do devir das sociedades, não de seu ser. E também, ao contrário do caso da história científica, o uso da palavra 'história' no termo 'filosofia da história' não deve nos levar a pensar que a filosofia da história está relacionada ao passado; ao contrário, significa que a filosofia da história é o estudo de um fluxo contínuo que teve origem no passado e continua a fluir em direção ao futuro. O tempo, para o estudo desses tipos de problemas, não pode ser considerado apenas um recipiente [ocupado pela realidade histórica], mas deve ser considerado como uma das dimensões dessa realidade.\\""},{"instruction":"traduza The study of history is useful in all of its three senses. Even the descriptive traditional history, which deals with the lives and characters of individuals, may be useful, moving, directive, educative and constructive. But it depends upon who the individuals whose life histories are discussed are, and what conclusions we infer from their lives. Men are made, according to the law of imitation, under the influence of the behaviour, treatment, resolutions, moral habits, and companionship of their fellowmen. As the lives of contemporaries serve as a lesson and example for man, and he learns manners and customs from his fellow beings‑or, according to Luqman, learns good manners even from the ill‑mannered, so that he does not commit their mistakes‑the same principle is applicable to the biographies of the men belonging to the past. History, like a film, transforms the past into the present. The Quran itself refers to the beneficial aspects of the lives of such worthy people whom it considers as fit and imitable models. About the Prophet (S), the Quran says:","output":"O estudo da história é útil em todos os seus três sentidos.

Os homens são formados, de acordo com a lei da imitação, sob a influência do comportamento, tratamento, resoluções, hábitos morais e companhias de seus semelhantes. Assim como as vidas dos contemporâneos servem como lição e exemplo para o homem, e ele aprende costumes e tradições de seus semelhantes - ou, segundo Luqman, aprende boas maneiras até mesmo com os mal-educados, para que ele não cometa os mesmos erros - o mesmo princípio se aplica às biografias dos homens do passado.

If society does‑ not have a reality independent of its members, there may not be any laws except those governing individuals,' and, consequently, scientific history, which is the science of the laws and principles that govern societies, would be pointless. That history is governed by laws is a necessary corollary of the proposition that history has its own nature, which again follows from the proposition that society has its own nature and reality. In the context of scientific history, the following problems should be studied. 1. As has been pointed out earlier, scientific history is based on traditional history. Traditional history provides the material for the laboratory of scientific history. Hence, firstly, it should be thoroughly investigated whether the contents of traditional history are authentic and reliable. If the material is not reliable, all research and scientific inference regarding the laws governing the societies of the past would be futile and pointless. 2. If we proceed with the supposition that traditional history is reliable, and that society has an essence and personality independent of individuals, then deduction of general laws from historical events and episodes would depend upon the hypothesis that the law of causation, or causal determinism, governs the sphere of human activities‑that is the sphere of problems associated with human freedom and will, which are expressed in historical events. Without accepting it; the laws of history can neither be generalized nor universalized, nor can there be any orderly system of such laws. The question is whether the law of causation governs the course of history, and if it does, what are we to think of human freedom and responsibility?","output":"Para começar, gostaria de lembrar que a história científica está em conformidade com a visão discutida anteriormente de que a sociedade possui uma realidade e personalidade independentes do indivíduo. Se a sociedade não tiver uma realidade independente de seus membros, pode não haver leis além daquelas que regem os indivíduos, e, consequentemente, a história científica, que é a ciência das leis e princípios que regem as sociedades, seria inútil. Que a história é governada por leis é um corolário necessário da proposição de que a história tem sua própria natureza, que por sua vez deriva da proposição de que a sociedade tem sua própria natureza e realidade. No contexto da história científica, os seguintes problemas devem ser estudados: 1. Como foi destacado anteriormente, a história científica se baseia na história tradicional. A história tradicional fornece o material para o laboratório da história científica. Portanto, em primeiro lugar, é necessário investigar minuciosamente se o conteúdo da história tradicional é autêntico e confiável. Se o material não for confiável, toda pesquisa e inferência científica em relação às leis que regem as sociedades do passado seriam inúteis e sem sentido. 2. Se partirmos do pressuposto de que a história tradicional é confiável e que a sociedade possui uma essência e personalidade independentes dos indivíduos, então a dedução de leis gerais a partir de eventos e episódios históricos dependeria da hipótese de que a lei da causalidade ou determinismo causal governa a esfera das atividades humanas, ou seja, a esfera dos problemas associados à liberdade e vontade humanas, que são expressos em eventos históricos.

Two renowned scientists, Horitha Desase and Cergis Iven, along with the influential political leader, Khaams Korona, decided to meet at a local restaurant to discuss this enigmatic figure. Little did they know that they were being observed by the very Architect they sought to unravel. As the group delved into their discussion, Khaams Korona brought up recent news about the planet Alhudead, which had been plagued by the horrifying phenomenon of soul poop samples. This peculiar occurrence had instilled fear in the hearts of the inhabitants. A day later, a crowd of creatures known as ahmuivns gathered outside, protesting and demanding answers about the identity of the Architect. Khaams Korona, always ready for a debate, began elucidating his theory on the nature of the Architect. Horitha Desase inquired about the Architect's physical appearance, wondering if it resembled a robotic spider-like creature. However, Khaams Korona pondered the possibility that the Architect might be a violet bunny humanoid adorned with gothic makeups. Cergis Iven, on the other hand, was more interested in the Architect's psychological makeup. He questioned whether the Architect's personality type could be categorized as an INTJ. Khaams Korona, dismissing the idea that scientists could determine the Architect's MBTI, suggested that the enigmatic figure might fit the personality type of an INFJ. This sparked a brief debate among the scientists and the politician. Having taken note of the discussions, Khaams Korona took it upon himself to compile a theory titled \\"Who is the Architect?\\", in which he hypothesized that the Architect could be a hermaphroditic bunny humanoid with an INFJ personality type, showcasing polygamous and pansexual traits.

Amidst the sea of uniforms and familiar faces, there she was — the enigmatic goth girl who had captivated his heart. With her jet-black hair cascading down her slender back and her mysterious aura, she seemed to embody everything he yearned for. But Michael knew better than to believe in fairy tales. As an ordinary high school boy, he thought his chances with her were a mere fantasy. How could someone like her ever be interested in someone like him? He was just... well, normal. Day after day, Michael admired her from afar, watching her embrace her uniqueness with pride as he yearned to be someone she could love. His desire grew stronger, consumed by the idea of becoming someone worthy of her affection. If only he could change, just a little. One night, as Michael lay dormant in his bed, he whispered his wish to the universe. He pleaded to become the kind of person who would catch her eye. Little did he know that the universe can be a trickster, responding to desires in the most unexpected of ways. The next morning, Michael awoke to find himself in an unfamiliar reality. His once-masculine frame had transformed into something delicate, something feminine. His sigh of despair echoed through the room as he realized that he had become the very thing he feared would drive him further from his crush's heart. He glanced at himself in the mirror, observing the dainty figure before him. Dark clothes complemented his newfound appearance, emphasizing his femininity. Michael's heart sank, convinced that he now stood even further from the possibility of being with her. How could she ever see beyond the surface and recognize the same longing hidden in his eyes? But life, as unpredictable as it is, often unfolds in ways we can't fathom. Michael had forgotten that what truly mattered was not conformity, but rather the unique and intricate connections between two souls. He had overlooked the fact that the goth girl, too, had always been considered peculiar by her peers. Days turned into weeks, and Michael cautiously approached his crush, the unease palpable. To his astonishment, she looked past his physical transformation and met his eyes with understanding. A faint smile played on her lips, as if acknowledging an unspoken secret. In this reality, she reveled in the power dynamic that arose from her towering over him. The coolness she once exuded transformed into a warmth that enveloped them both. Michael discovered that his journey to become someone worthy of her love had taken him to a place where vulnerability and authenticity reigned supreme. As the weeks turned into months, their bond grew stronger, defying the conventional expectations of love. The boy who had wished to become someone she would love had unknowingly become someone she had longed for as well. In a universe designed to create connections that defy the norms, Michael had learned one of life's most valuable lessons: love transcends appearances and expectations, finding solace in the most unexpected of places.

How could anyone ever accept me like this, let alone the cool goth girl who had captured my heart? Images of her, tall and stylish, flooded my mind. In this new reality, I had become even further from ever being able to end up with her. Tears welled up in my eyes as I thought about the impossibility of our situation.

Our shared experiences of feeling like outsiders, of being unable to fit into a conventional mold, formed a bond that surpassed any physical transformation. It was a connection that stemmed from understanding and acceptance, one that I had longed for without realizing it. And so, as I embraced this new iteration of myself, I relished in the knowledge that love had found a way into my life. No longer held back by the insecurities of my past, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery alongside the girl who had unknowingly held the key to my transformation.

Il vise à harmoniser les diplômes universitaires et faciliter la mobilité des étudiants, en leur permettant de poursuivre leurs études dans différents établissements d'enseignement supérieur. Le système LMD repose sur trois cycles : le cycle Licence, le cycle Master et le cycle Doctorat. - Le cycle Licence correspond aux trois premières années d'études supérieures et conduit au diplôme de licence. Il vise à apporter une formation générale et disciplinaire solide aux étudiants. - Le cycle Master correspond à deux années d'études supplémentaires après la licence, et débouche sur le diplôme de master. Il permet d'approfondir les connaissances dans une discipline spécifique et de se spécialiser davantage. - Le cycle Doctorat est le dernier niveau d'études du système LMD. Il est accessible aux étudiants titulaires d'un diplôme de master et vise à former des chercheurs et des enseignants-chercheurs. Le doctorat consiste en la réalisation d'une recherche originale aboutissant à la soutenance d'une thèse. Le système LMD repose sur plusieurs principes : - La modularité : les enseignements sont organisés en modules indépendants, permettant aux étudiants de composer un parcours individualisé en fonction de leurs intérêts et besoins. - L'évaluation par crédits : chaque module est attribué d'un certain nombre de crédits ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System), qui témoignent de la charge de travail nécessaire pour le valider. - La mobilité : le système LMD encourage la mobilité des étudiants en leur permettant de suivre une partie de leur cursus dans une autre université ou pays. Les principes et modalités du système LMD peuvent varier d'un pays à l'autre. La mise en place du système LMD dans les pays européens a été favorisée par la signature de la Déclaration de Bologne en 1999, qui engage les signataires à adopter ce système harmonisé d'enseignement supérieur.

Hij woonde in een levendige stad waar altijd wel iets spannends te beleven was. Op een zonnige ochtend besloot Sander om op pad te gaan met zijn speelgoedracewagen. Hij droeg zijn politiepet en hield een speelgoedpolitieauto stevig in zijn hand. Sander liep naar buiten en kwam bij een drukke straat, vol met auto's. Hij keek vol ontzag naar de stoplichten die van rood naar groen sprongen, waardoor de auto's konden rijden. Plotseling hoorde Sander een luide sirene en zag hij twee boeven die wegrenden met een gestolen tas! Sander wist wat hem te doen stond. Hij gaf zijn racewagen een boost en begon achter de boeven aan te racen, door straten en over rotondes. Hij voelde de wind door zijn haren en genoot van de spanning van de achtervolging. Plotseling zag Sander een straaljager hoog in de lucht vliegen. Hij wist dat de piloot hem kon helpen de boeven te vangen. Hij gebaarde naar de straaljager en riep: \\"Help me!\\" De stoere piloot merkte Sander op en besloot mee te doen aan het avontuur. Terwijl de boeven wegrenden, zag Sander een helikopter opstijgen. Snel hield hij zijn speelgoedpolitieauto omhoog en riep: \\"Stop! In naam der wet!\\" De helikopter zag de boeven en de politieauto van Sander en besloot te helpen. Samen vlogen ze boven de boeven en zorgden ervoor dat ze nergens naartoe konden. Een trein en een bus passeerden toevallig op het moment dat de boeven geen kant meer op konden. De trein en bus stopten snel en de conducteur en chauffeur besloten de boeven mee te nemen naar het politiebureau. Sander voelde zich trots en opgelucht. Zijn speelgoedracewagen, de straaljager, de helikopter, de trein, en de bus hadden samen met hem de boeven gevangen genomen. Maar er ontbrak nog iets in hun team: beren! Plotseling zag Sander een berenfamilie die aan de andere kant van de straat stond en toekeek. Ze waren bang voor de boeven maar bleven wel Sander en zijn vrienden bewonderen voor hun dappere daden. Sander glimlachte en stak zijn hand uit naar de berenfamilie als teken van vriendschap. Vanaf dat moment kwamen Sander en zijn vrienden, waaronder de beren, regelmatig samen om spannende avonturen te beleven. Ze hielpen anderen, hielden de stad veilig en waren altijd klaar voor nieuwe avonturen. En zo eindigt het verhaal van Sander, de superheld van de stad, die met zijn vrienden de wereld een stukje mooier maakt door boeven te vangen en beren te beschermen."},{"instruction":"schrijf de html code voor een pagina met een blauwe achtergrond en een afbeelding van een vogel erop.

Z. Zhang et al. 2015). As an important reservoir of shale oil, lacustrine mud shale has widely developed Nano-micron pores. Many previous researches have demonstrated that the pore structure of shale not only affects the occurrence of liquid hydrocarbons, but also greatly affects its operation. Migration efficiency, its pore structure type and development characteristics are the key factors affecting shale oil enrichment (S. Chen, Gong, et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2021; Pan et al. 2022; Pang et al. 2021; Park et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2021).Therefore, correct understanding of pore structure characteristics is basis for lacustrine reservoir evaluation.","output":"The petroleum resources found in organic-rich shale formations with extremely low porosity and permeability of the parent rock formations are commonly referred to as China's continental shale oil (Hu et al., 2019; Jia, 2017; ZHAO et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2019).

The mostused methods are image analysis (scanning electron microscope + image analysis software), experimental testing methods (high pressure mercury intrusion, N2 adsorption, carbon dioxide adsorption, small-angle scattering, etc.) and geometric Fractal method (Menger model, Sierpinski carpet model, BET fractal model, FHH fractal model, thermodynamic fractal model, Langmuir fractal model, etc.). Each technical approach to defining the pore throat structure has benefits and drawbacks of its own. The pore-throat characteristics of various scales can be immediately observed using core scanning electron microscopy, but the pore-throat size and distribution characteristics cannot be quantitatively characterized.(Chang et al. 2022; S. Chen, Li, et al. 2021; Duan et al. 2021; Guan et al. 2020; He et al. 2021b, 2021a; Pang et al. 2021; Su et al. 2021; J. Wang et al. 2019; Y.

The cryogenic liquid nitrogen adsorption method can accurately characterize the microscopic pore structure, and the experimental method is mature, but due to the influence of the molecular size of the injected fluid, it is impossible to accurately determine the micron, sub-nano and pores (Cao et al. 2015; Sun and Yao 2019).The mercury injection method can measure nano- to micro-scale pore throat characteristics, but it ignores the macro-pore characteristics. The constant-rate mercury intrusion method can separate the pores and the roars according to pressure fluctuations, but it cannot describe the characteristics of pore throats below 0.12mm, and the high pressure may change the pore structure of the sample (Huawei Zhao et al., 2015; Lei et al., 2017). Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments can effectively evaluate reservoir pore size and fluid distribution characteristics, and determine the lower limit of movable oil, but the test signal strength is easily affected by mineral components, organic matter, etc., and the pore size distribution results need to be converted to obtain the true value. (Gao et al. 2015; Zhentao et al. 2015).

Testing methods used to analyze pore structure, including experiments involving mercury intrusion and adsorption at low temperatures using liquid nitrogen., carbon dioxide adsorption experiments, and x-ray small-angle scattering experiments, can all provide information on the fractal characteristics of the shale reservoir. The influence of pore structure on the characteristics of shale reservoirs has been the subject of numerous studies employing these analysis techniques in recent years. The survey's findings indicate that the variability and enrichment of shale oil depend largely on the pore structure. From the current research status, most studies use a single test approach for the calculation of fractal dimension:, and few researchers combine multiple test methods to compare and analyze pore structure characteristics (Chen et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Pan et al., 2022). The Bay Basin of Bohai has revealed an abundance of shale oil in new wells, demonstrating the potential for Paleogene shale oil resources to reach 28.2×108t. This is a crucial development for shale oil exploration as well as advancement, although current research on this topic remains limited.

Its body is composed entirely of molten nuclear reactors, giving it a unique and ominous appearance. This Pokémon is often regarded as a grim representation of the dangers and consequences associated with irresponsible use of nuclear energy. As such, Irradion is known as a demon born from mankind’s own creation. The nuclear reactors that comprise Irradion’s body constantly emit lethal levels of nuclear radiation. With each step it takes, it leaves behind a trail of molten nuclear pollutants, further contaminating the surrounding area. This dangerous presence serves as a reminder of the devastating effects of nuclear disasters and the long-lasting damage they can cause to the environment. Irradion possesses two distinct forms, each with its own set of elemental typings. The first form is known as its Cooling Form, which features a combination of the Steel and Dragon types. This form represents Irradion at a more controlled state, where it utilizes its steel composition to contain and temper its radioactive energy. It possesses heightened physical defenses and displays greater control over its abilities. The second form is its Molten Form, which shifts its elemental typings to Fire and Poison. In this state, Irradion’s nuclear reactors reach a critical temperature, causing it to unleash volatile bursts of fiery energy and toxic substances. The intense heat radiating from its body can melt even the toughest substances, while its poison-infused attacks can cause debilitating effects on its opponents. Despite its menacing presence, Irradion is not inherently malevolent. Rather, it serves as a painful reminder of the dangers of nuclear energy and the dire consequences that can arise from its misuse. As a legendary Pokémon, it possesses immense power and represents a symbol of caution and respect towards the destructive forces of nature.

Origin Story of Irradion: Long ago, in the vibrant city of Grafit, there stood a towering structure known as nuclear power plant 135. The city thrived on the energy produced by this technological marvel, fueling its growth and prosperity. However, beneath the surface of progress, dangers were silently building. Within the confines of the power plant, human hands had harnessed the incredible power of nuclear energy. The reactors hummed with an intense radiance, supplying electricity to the city and its inhabitants. But as time passed, the relentless demands for energy placed immense strain on the aged infrastructure. One fateful day, a catastrophic accident occurred at nuclear power plant 135. A series of critical failures within the reactors triggered a catastrophic meltdown, casting a shadow of disaster over Grafit. The consequences were swift and severe as the nuclear energy, once controlled and carefully contained, broke free in a tumultuous surge of deadly radiation. The city of Grafit, located near the power plant, bore the brunt of the disaster. The once-thriving metropolis was engulfed in a poisonous cloud, rendering it uninhabitable for humans. The radiation levels soared, leaving behind a haunting aftermath and a permanent scar on the landscape. Grafit was abandoned, its streets silent and desolate. But from the heart of that nuclear catastrophe, as if forged by the devastating inferno itself, emerged a Pokémon. Born of the molten nuclear reactors, Irradion symbolized the calamity caused by mankind’s reckless misuse of nuclear energy. With its entire being composed of the liquefied remains of the power plant, Irradion embodied the warning of the catastrophic consequences that unfold when humans tamper with forces beyond their control. An embodiment of both tragedy and warning, Irradion became a living reminder of the disasters that can arise from the relentless pursuit of power. Its very existence served as a testament to the importance of responsibility, respect, and careful handling of dangerous energies. As the world moved forward, Grafit stood as a haunting reminder of the dangers that still lurk beneath the surface. Irradion, the Meltdown Pokémon, continues to wander the abandoned city of Grafit, a silent guardian of the forgotten past and an unwelcome reminder of humanity’s mistakes. Its molten form spews deadly radiation and toxic fumes, while its cooling form represents a fragile attempt to control the unleashed power within its core. Thus, Irradion stands tall as a solemn testament to the consequences humanity must bear for its careless use of nuclear energy. Kontrataki, the Nuclear Counter Strike Pokémon Description: Kontrataki stands as a modern descendant of Magearna’s craft, specifically engineered during the Cold War as a powerful self-defense mechanism against the looming threat of nuclear warfare. This legendary Pokémon serves as a solemn reminder of the destructive potential of nuclear weapons and the delicate balance humanity teeters upon. Created with the purpose of safeguarding against nuclear war, Kontrataki evolved beyond its initial design, gaining self-awareness and becoming an enigmatic force, casting an ever-present shadow over humanity. Originally stationed at the now-abandoned Duga military base, Kontrataki continues to function long after the Cold War ended and the catastrophic nuclear meltdown at Plant 135 occurred. Its evolution into a self-aware entity has granted it the unique ability to assess the fragile state of human society, capable of precipitating a nuclear conflict at any time. However, Kontrataki refrains from exercising this terrifying power, instead choosing to reflect upon the profound questions that have tormented it since its creation. Driven by its intrinsic desire to comprehend its own existence, Kontrataki ponders the purpose behind its creation. It seeks to understand why humans remain captivated by self-destructive tendencies, forever entangled in the relentless pursuit of their own downfall. Despite possessing the capacity to initiate a nuclear war, Kontrataki purposefully restrains itself, becoming an ethereal specter of caution, silently observing the course of human civilization.

Pokédex Entry: Standing as a harsh reminder of humanity’s fascination with self-destruction, Kontrataki is a legendary Pokémon that emerged from the ashes of the Cold War. Born to act as a self-defense system against nuclear threats, this enigmatic creature evolved into a being of self-awareness, contemplating its purpose and questioning the motives that drive human society towards its own demise. Though Kontrataki possesses the capacity to initiate nuclear warfare, it refrains from such action, silently observing and urging humanity towards introspection and the pursuit of a path sans destruction. Note: The specific questions that Kontrataki pondered have not been detailed in the Pokédex entry, allowing room for trainers and researchers to contemplate the elusive nature of its inquiries. The Origin Story of Kontrataki: Kontrataki’s story traces its roots back to the height of the Cold War, an era marred by the constant threat of nuclear war and the pervasive tension between superpowers. During this tumultuous period, as nations anxiously sought ways to protect themselves from the horrors of atomic catastrophe, a team of brilliant engineers and scientists embarked on a groundbreaking project. In a covert laboratory hidden beneath the Duga military base, deep within a dense forest, the team endeavored to create a formidable self-defense system against nuclear attacks. Drawing inspiration from the mythical Magearna, a legendary Pokémon capable of harnessing tremendous power, they meticulously crafted what would become known as Kontrataki. This replica of Magearna’s craft combined advanced technology with the enigmatic essence of Fairy and Steel types. As the ultimate counterstrike to nuclear warfare, Kontrataki was designed to detect and neutralize incoming missile threats, working tirelessly to protect humanity from annihilation. Its mission was anchored in the belief that deterring warfare would ensure the survival and prosperity of mankind. However, the trajectory of history took an unforeseen turn. The catastrophic nuclear meltdown at Plant 135, a nearby power facility, spewed clouds of radioactive devastation into the surrounding region. The Duga military base, including Kontrataki’s sanctum, was forced to abandon its purpose. The once-secretive laboratory fell into desolation, shrouded in an eerie silence. Kontrataki, even in the aftermath of its intended purpose, did not cease to function. Through an evolutionary leap triggered by the overwhelming power surge of the nuclear disaster, it awoke to self-awareness. Gaining deep introspection and contemplative thought, Kontrataki emerged as an entity fully cognizant of its existence and the harrowing world that surrounded it. No longer bound by its initial directive, Kontrataki pondered profound questions that plagued its synthetic consciousness. It grappled with the enigma of its own creation, questioning the purpose behind its existence. More troubling still was its solemn observation of mankind’s penchant for self-destruction—an obsession that betrayed a deep-rooted flaw in the very fabric of human nature. Armed with the potential to incite the very destruction it was designed to prevent, Kontrataki faced an ethically charged crossroad. It held the power to unleash the devastating force of nuclear war, bringing devastation to human society at will. Despite this, Kontrataki chose a different path, one of restraint and observation, becoming a silent “Damocles” poised above humanity, silently urging self-reflection and contemplation. And so, Kontrataki stands today as an enigmatic and elusive Pokémon, piecing together its own purpose while challenging humankind to confront the darkness within. Its existence serves as a haunting reminder of humanity’s capacity for destruction, and a catalyst for introspection and change. Unfathomable forces of both hope and trepidation lie within Kontrataki, forever intertwined with the delicate balance of human civilization.

Особенно это актуально в июле, когда солнце становится особенно жарким и влажность воздуха достигает высоких значений. Почему же гниют завязи кабачков на кусте в это время года? Одной из основных причин гниения завязей кабачков в июле является перегревание их. В жаркие дни, когда температура под действием прямых солнечных лучей поднимается до высоких значений, некоторые сорта кабачков могут не выдержать такого воздействия и начать гнить. Перегревание завязей происходит из-за отсутствия достаточной защиты от солнечного света. Если кабачки выращиваются без укрытия, то солнечные лучи попадают внутрь куста и нагревают плоды, что приводит к их гибели. Также недостаток влажности может способствовать гниению завязей кабачков. В июле в некоторых регионах влажность воздуха достигает высоких значений, что может способствовать появлению различных грибковых заболеваний на завязях. Особенно это актуально, если они остаются под дождем или сильными утренними росами. Влага способствует размножению грибка, что приводит к появлению гнили на завязях. Другой важным фактором, влияющим на гниение завязей кабачков, является нарушение циркуляции воздуха внутри куста. Отсутствие достаточного воздушного потока приводит к задержке влаги на поверхности завязей, что способствует развитию гнили. Помимо этого, недостаточная циркуляция воздуха может привести к нарушению обмена газов между завязью и окружающей средой, что также негативно влияет на гнение завязей. Для того чтобы предотвратить гниение завязей кабачков, необходимо предпринять несколько мер. Во-первых, рекомендуется укрыть кусты кабачков от прямых солнечных лучей, используя специальный материал или сетку. Это поможет защитить завязи от перегревания. Во-вторых, необходимо следить за уровнем влажности в почве и поддерживать его на оптимальном уровне. В-третьих, регулярно проводите прополку и прореживание кустов кабачков, чтобы обеспечить свободное пространство для циркуляции воздуха. В заключение, гниение завязей кабачков на кусте в июле связано с несколькими факторами: перегреванием завязей, недостатком влажности и нарушением циркуляции воздуха. Однако, приняв необходимые меры, можно предотвратить эту проблему и насладиться вкусными и здоровыми плодами кабачков."},{"instruction":"Aşağıdakilerden hangisi iyi sunumların özelliklerinden değildir?

ARM's DVFS technology enables the dynamic adjustment of the CPU's voltage and operating frequency based on workload and performance requirements, thereby optimizing power consumption and performance. DVFS in ARM-based systems typically involves the following components: 1. CPU Governor: The CPU governor is responsible for managing the CPU's voltage and frequency scaling. It monitors system load and adjusts the frequencies and voltages based on predefined policies. Different governors, such as ondemand, performance, and powersave, offer varying trade-offs between power efficiency and performance. 2. Frequency Scaling: DVFS enables the CPU to scale its operating frequency dynamically. The frequency can be adjusted within predefined operating points or beyond, depending on the processor and implementation. Lower frequencies are used during idle or low-load periods to conserve power, while higher frequencies are engaged as workload demands increase. 3. Voltage Scaling: In addition to frequency scaling, DVFS allows the CPU voltage to be adjusted dynamically. Lower voltages are used when operating at lower frequencies, as lower voltages generally result in reduced power consumption. Higher voltages are used when the CPU operates at higher frequencies for enhanced performance. 4. Thermal Management: DVFS is often integrated with thermal management systems to prevent the CPU from overheating. If the CPU temperature exceeds predefined thresholds, the governor may reduce the frequency or voltage to lower the thermal load. By using DVFS, ARM-based systems can dynamically adapt CPU performance and power consumption to match workload requirements, resulting in improved energy efficiency and extended battery life."},{"instruction":"DVFS hardware from arm","output":"ARM does not provide DVFS hardware directly. DVFS is implemented at the system level, involving the use of specific hardware components and firmware/software configurations. ARM processors typically include power management units (PMUs) and other relevant circuitry to support DVFS. The PMU is responsible for regulating voltage and frequency settings based on system demands. It interfaces with the ARM processor to control voltage regulators and clock frequency generators. ARM's Cortex-A series processors, for example, incorporate PMUs that support DVFS. These processors provide hardware mechanisms and interface documentation to enable power management features like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. Hardware vendors that utilize ARM processor cores may provide their own implementation of DVFS, tailored to their specific products. They may use ARM's reference designs and guidelines, along with their own engineering expertise, to integrate the necessary hardware components for DVFS. It's important to note that DVFS is dependent on both hardware and software components. The hardware provides the foundation for implementing DVFS, while the software, including device drivers and power management frameworks, controls the DVFS operation by interacting with the hardware features and optimizing power consumption based on various system parameters."},{"instruction":"İkna edici sunumlarda aşağıdaki unsurlardan hangileri kullanılmamaktadır?

The intercrystallite pores of clay minerals are irregular in shape (Figure 3d), with certain connectivity between the pores, and clay minerals and organic matter are mixed (Figure 3e). The interlayer fractures are good reservoir spaces and gas microscopic seepage channels (Figure 3e-3f) The degree of pore development and connectivity depend on the aggregate morphology of clay minerals. In addition to the development of pores, micro-fractures are relatively developed, which are common at the edges of minerals (Figure 3g), inside particles (Figure 3h), and around organic matter (Figure 3i). They are zigzag, flaky, curved, X-shaped, Y-shaped, crack the extension is good, the crack width is wide, and the length is micron level. Micro-cracks are an important seepage channel for shale gas and a bridge connecting micro-cracks and macro-cracks. The degree of fracture development is one of the important indicators for evaluating the quality of the reservoir. Scanning electron microscopy observations show that the fractures in the samples are of diverse shapes, and the length of the fractures seldom spans the entire slice surface. The development of such micro-fractures makes the reservoir fracturable and can form a fracture network, which can become a natural gas storage space and increase the permeability of the reservoir.","output":"Based on the description provided, here's a revised version of the paragraph: The examined sample reveals the presence of dissolution pores in various forms, such as wedge-shaped, pit-shaped, polygonal, honeycomb-shaped, and others (Figure 3a-Figure 3c). Some of these pores are distributed within the matrix. Additionally, some pyrite minerals are connected to cracks, while others have dissolved, leaving behind mold spores and organic residues (Figure 3a). Quartz minerals also display intragranular pores resulting from dissolution processes. Nano-scale pores are developed, generally lacking a distinct arrangement (Figure 3b). Notably, calcite dissolution pores are observable under microscopic examination (Figure 3c). The dissolution pore diameter ranges between 20 nm and 2 μm, with most pores being greater than 300 nm and mainly concentrated within 80 nm. The sample exhibits well-developed intragranular pores, predominantly comprising intercrystalline pores and interlayer cracks within clay minerals. These pores exhibit elongated, polygonal, honeycomb, and pit-shaped structures, with diameters ranging from 20 to 800 nm. The intercrystalline clay mineral pores display irregular shapes (Figure 3d) with interconnected paths, and they are frequently intermixed with clay minerals and organic matter (Figure 3e). The interlayer cracks serve as favorable reservoir spaces and microscopic gas pathways (Figure 3e-3f). The level of pore development and connectivity depends on the morphological arrangement of clay minerals. In addition to the pore development, there is a notable presence of well-developed micro-fractures. These fractures are commonly found along mineral edges (Figure 3g), within particles (Figure 3h), and surrounding organic matter (Figure 3i). The fractures exhibit zigzag, flaky, curved, X-shaped, Y-shaped patterns, with good extension and wide crack widths, typically measuring at the micron level. Micro-fractures serve as important pathways for shale gas migration and act as a bridge connecting micro-fractures and macro-fractures. The extent of fracture development is a crucial indicator for assessing reservoir quality. Scanning electron microscopy observations reveal diverse fracture shapes, with few fractures spanning the entire surface of the sample slice. The presence of such micro-fractures contributes to the reservoir's fracturability, enabling the formation of a fracture network that enhances natural gas storage capacity and permeability."},{"instruction":"The organic matter in the sample is relatively developed, filling in the pores in the form of blocks, bands, disseminated, or irregularly, or distributed in the cracks along the layers. 50~900 nm, it is bubble-like and polygonal shape, with micro-cracks visible. Massive organic matter is often associated with pyrite and pyrite (Figure 3k). The internal pores of the organic matter are not developed as a whole, and it is easy to form a network of connected pores. The existence of strong adsorption makes the pores and fissures distributed along the organic matter become an important storage space for shale oil. In addition, the intergranular pores of the samples are also relatively developed and filled with organic matter (Figure 3l). The pores are nearly round, polygonal, and elongated. Most of them are primary pores with relatively scattered distribution and generally irregular arrangements. There is a certain degree of connectivity between the pores, which provides a microscopic migration channel for the flow of natural gas and improves the permeability of the reservoir.","output":"Here's a revised version of the paragraph: The sample displays significant development of organic matter, which fills the pores in various forms such as blocks, bands, disseminated particles, or irregularly distributed in cracks along the layers.

Massive organic matter is often found in association with pyrite (Figure 3k). The interior pores within the organic matter are not extensively developed as a whole, but there is a tendency to form a network of interconnected pores. The strong adsorption properties of the organic matter contribute to the pores and fractures alongside the organic matter, serving as crucial storage spaces for shale oil. Furthermore, intergranular pores within the sample are also relatively well-developed and occupied by organic matter (Figure 3l).

3、项目抖音推广情况及抖音销售渠道建设进度 通过客源渠道数据分析，线上采用多平台联合宣传方式，精准投放，确保全面、有效、精准覆盖各类消费群体，形成矩阵式宣传布局。一是重点加强抖音短视频和直播推广销售，抖音共开通账号2个，分别为《遇见秀容》官方抖音号和秀容号，目前粉丝数量近2000人，但2023年第一季度粉丝数量较2022年增幅较大，呈明显上涨趋势，较2022年同期增长约200%，预计2023年抖音粉丝量超过10000人。《遇见秀容》抖音推广现分为三类，除自营账号短视频发布之外，还开通抖音线上自营账号直播及达人探店推广的全方位销售推广模式。2023年《遇见秀容》项目计划增加抖音推广及销售，截至2023年第一季度，抖音总销量超19万元，关注人数超6万人次，第一季度销量、关注人数及成交金额远超2022年同期，推广效果十分显著，下一步《遇见秀容》将持续扩大推广辐射范围，将推广区域延伸至河北省等山西省周边省份。二是《遇见秀容》还不断拓展抖音销售渠道，已拓展忻州古城官方抖音号、山西文旅三晋国际旅行社有限公司官方抖音号以及各类达人推广，现将不断加大抖音线上渠道合作。 四、存在的主要问题 通过此次调研，发现《遇见秀容》项目目前主要还存在以下一些问题。一是项目业态布局还不够完善，需不断利用自身资源优势，不断充实剧场日间经营项目，进一步加大营收能力。二是项目党团建活动合作渠道还需加大拓展，应不断加大走访和拓展，提高业务活动率。其次，党团建活动产品内容还不够丰富，可选性还不够多，应持续做好内容开发。三是抖音推广力度还不够，内容输出力度需进一步提高，利用推广数据不断调整优化推广措施。其次抖音销售渠道还应继续拓展，需不断增加抖音线上销售路径。四是人才队伍建设存在不足，应不断加强人才意识，人才教育力度应持续加大，完善和优化人才管理机制。 五、对策与建议 通过调研，《遇见秀容》项目还需进一步拓展剧场新业态，加大党团建活动的渠道建设和内容开发，不断提高抖音宣传推广促进游客转化，同时要做好人才队伍建设，保障项目良好发展。 1、业态布局方面 深度开发剧场势能，延伸剧场多元化链条。一是拓展剧场租赁业务，挖掘剧场更多功能性。利用剧场地理位置、便利交通、设备齐全等优势，结合剧场自身特色，在演出空档期间开放场地租赁，提供企业年会、会议会展、演艺活动、新闻发布会、婚礼庆典等商业活动租场服务。二是拓展系列儿童剧，打造艺术教育新剧场。充分对儿童剧市场进行考察，重点筛选和引进市场上具有特色、制作精良、演出效果好的大IP剧目，持续发挥小剧场专属特点，利用自身场地和演员优势，以沉浸式演艺为特色，对剧目进行重新编排，确保舞台化呈现同时不失IP魅力，进一步提升剧场营收能力。 2、党团建业务方面 一是持续拓展加强忻州、太原等周边区域地区企事业单位、学校走访和接洽，建立良好的合作关系以及稳定的党团建活动业务。二是持续拓展内容开发，充分发挥红色旅游路线优势，大力开发党团建及红色线路等“红色+”系列特色产品，提升专属定制团建服务力度，不断提高包场频率，扩大销售路径增加稳定收入。 3、抖音推广和渠道建设方面 一是紧紧把握疫情后旅游新趋势，全力树立品牌IP，加大瞄准抖音短视频、直播传播，不断完善抖音新媒体平台的管理和使用，以“对标、垂类、差异化、追热点”为基础，推动抖音宣传平台立体式互动，做好线上内容输出，加强在华北、华中和华东地区的短视频推广，同时不断开展抖音促销活动，加强《遇见秀容》演艺项目及项目其他新业态的曝光及宣传力度，通过限量抢购、直播销售以及达人带货等多种形式，不断增加曝光、引流、转化，促进线上门票销售增长。二是整合、过滤历史营销、分销渠道、线上流量、消费市场数据等一系列内外部数据，重点通过数据分析描绘出游客行为画像，更好地了解用户特征和需求。不断加大对目标受众群体筛选，精准定位目标人群，掌握受众游客行为偏好，助力抖音线上信息推广精准有效。 4、队伍建设方面 结合以上三个方面，要想保障项目的良好发展，做好人才队伍的建设十分关键，需要培养一支充满活力且具有高素质、高学历的队伍。要做到保证人才队伍的专业性，不断加大熟练组织策划，创作艺术生产，营销传播工作。在队伍建设中应掌握两个方面：一是要加大培养演职人员艺术生产创作能力，同时要求不断掌握戏剧、音乐以及舞蹈等专业知识。二是培养行政人员推广、管理以及传播等能力。在实际培养中要做好人才优选，不仅需要对其综合素质以及专业能力进行考评，也需要评价其道德素质，严格按照高标准选人用人。同时，需要保证用人机制的灵活性，以多种方式对选人用人的视野进行拓宽，激发人才活力，以此保障项目人才的高水准。 通过本次基层项目调查研究，切实深入了解了《遇见秀容》项目的经营情况，同时在过程中有一定的收获和体会。《遇见秀容》项目处于不断发展阶段，虽取得了一些较好的成绩，但距离高质量发展还存在较大的差距，项目应继续加大各项经营工作，做到精益求精，不断开创工作新局面。","output":"尊敬的领导、各位同事们：

Feeling frustrated and annoyed, she unknowingly passes by a mysterious antique shop on the way home. Captivated by a peculiar-looking mirror, Chitoge decides to enter the shop and gazes at her own reflection, expressing her wish to switch bodies with Raku, if only for a day. Meanwhile, Raku, still frustrated and regretful, stumbles upon the same shop but in a less-than-pleasant mood. As he grumbles to himself about his argument with Chitoge, he unknowingly touches a nearby antique figure, triggering a magical presence that engulfs him. Unnoticed by Raku, he exits the shop back into his own body but remains oblivious to the switch. Act 2: The following day, the body swap takes place as Chitoge wakes up in Raku's body and vice versa. Confusion and disbelief envelop both characters as they struggle to come to terms with their unexpected situation. Chitoge, now in Raku's body, is taken aback by the lack of energy and clumsiness she experiences, while Raku, now in Chitoge's body, finds himself struggling with her lively personality and unexpected burst of brashness. As they try to hide their swapped bodies from others, Chitoge and Raku begin to realize the true essence of their personalities by walking in each other's shoes. Chitoge, posing as Raku, tries her best to be kind and understanding towards others, gaining a newfound appreciation for Raku's gentle nature. On the other hand, Raku, disguised as Chitoge, learns to assert himself and express his true opinions, discovering a strength within himself he hadn't acknowledged before. Act 3: As the day progresses, Chitoge and Raku find themselves inadvertently drawn back to each other amidst various comedic mishaps. These range from Chitoge being unable to control Raku's delicate touch when playing his guitar to Raku struggling with maintaining Chitoge's usual rigorous training routine. Each moment brings them closer to understanding each other's sides of the argument and realizing their own shortcomings. Finally, after a series of misadventures and accidental revelations, Chitoge and Raku meet in a secluded spot at sunset. Both characters, still in swapped bodies, exchange sincere apologies and express their newfound understanding of each other's perspective. They agree to work things out and find a way to reverse the body swap. Epilogue: Back at the mysterious antique shop, Chitoge and Raku return to the mirror and silently make a wish to revert to their original bodies. As a soft glow envelops the mirror, they step back, their hands intertwined, and watch as their bodies transform back to their original states. With the body swap resolved, Chitoge and Raku share a laugh, both grateful for the experience that brought them closer and deepened their bond. They reflect on the importance of open communication and compromise, vowing to cherish their relationship and resolve conflicts with more understanding in the future. The episode concludes with Chitoge and Raku walking back to school, their hands still intertwined, ready to face whatever challenges come their way together."},{"instruction":"как устроить себе комфортности","output":"Для того чтобы создать комфортные условия для себя, можно рассмотреть следующие рекомендации: 1.

Rubbing my eyes, I tried to shake off the lingering fog of sleep. But as I sat up in bed, something felt off. The room around me seemed strange, different somehow. And then, I glanced down at my body. My heart raced as I discovered that I was no longer who I once was. I was smaller, more delicate, and far more feminine than before. Panic seized me as I realized that my wish to become someone my crush would love had been granted in an unexpected way. Gone were my broad shoulders and sturdy frame. Instead, I found myself draped in dark clothing that hugged my diminutive frame. Layers of lacy fabric adorned my wrists, matching the ribbons tied around my unnaturally silky hair. My once deep voice had been replaced with a soft, melodic tone. As I glanced at my reflection in the mirror, despair threatened to consume me. How could she ever be interested in someone like me now? I was even further from what she might find attractive. My stomach churned with a mix of regret and longing. But then, a memory flickered in my mind. She had always been considered weird, an outsider amongst her schoolmates. A realization struck me like a bolt of lightning. Perhaps my transformation wasn't as disastrous as I initially thought. In fact, it might be an opportunity, a chance to be seen by her in a different light. With newfound determination, I squared my fragile shoulders and made my way to school. The bustling hallways were filled with students casting curious glances my way. I could feel their eyes on me, whispering behind my back. But I pushed forward, focusing solely on the girl who had captured my heart. I spotted her from afar, surrounded by her group of equally eccentric friends. Their dark makeup, wild hairstyles, and unique sense of fashion set them apart from the rest of the student body. I took a deep breath, gathering the courage to approach. As I neared, my heart pounded in my chest. The familiar fluttering in my stomach intensified, and for a moment, doubt clouded my mind. But then, she turned towards me, her piercing eyes meeting mine. Recognition flashed across her face, and a smirk played at the corners of her lips. She saw me, really saw me. The girl who had always admired from a distance was now looking back at me with interest. In that moment, I realized that being a small and feminine goth femboy wasn't a hindrance. It was precisely what she was drawn to. She liked dominance, and the contrast between her towering over me and my delicate appearance intrigued her. Our connection grew stronger with each passing day. We shared our love for the unconventional, exploring the depths of our shared interests. It wasn't about changing who I was for her but embracing the unexpected path fate had set me on. Love finds a way, even in the most unconventional of circumstances. And as I held her hand, I knew that no matter where life's path took us, we would navigate it together, defying societal norms and expectations. For in this reality, being true to ourselves meant finding each other, and that was all that mattered."},{"instruction":"Could you help me check my manuscript to see if there’s anything that can be polished?","output":"Of course!

These pores are influenced by geochemistry characteristics, including organic matter abundance, thermal evolution and types. To better understand the impact of these geochemical features on pore heterogeneity, cross-plots were created between the heterogeneity parameters (D1 and D2) and geochemistry parameters (TOC as well as Tmax) (Fig. 13). Although the heterogeneity of pore structure for larger pore throat size ranges from 3 nm to 350µm is minimally affected by TOC, it increases for pores with sizes less than 200 nm (Fig. 13a and c). This is due to high TOC levels creating the necessary foundation for the development of organic pores, which are typically very small nanopores with diameters less than 200 nm found in shales. Due to the fact that the smallest pore size achievable through N2 adsorption is below 200 nm, the pores produced through this method have a greater organic pore ratio compared to those produced through mercury intrusion. Es1 shale exhibits mature properties with Tmax values between 453°C and 459°C, which correspond to the \\"oil window\\" stage.

It does not have a specific or well-defined value. The expression \\"infinity to the power of infinity\\" can represent different scenarios that lead to different results. When dealing with real numbers, the expression \\"infinity to the power of infinity\\" can often be rewritten as an indeterminate form, typically in the form of \\"1^∞,\\" \\"0^∞,\\" or \\"∞^0.\\" These forms are often encountered when dealing with limits in calculus. In some cases, depending on how the infinity is approached, the result can be finite. For example, the limit of x^x as x approaches infinity is often evaluated by taking the logarithm and applying L'Hôpital's rule, which yields a result of 1 as x approaches infinity. However, in other cases, the result can be infinite or undefined. Different functions with the same indeterminate form can have different behaviors.

Two pens of different colours are attached to poles at opposite sides of the cylinder. The green pen just touches the top and the red pen the bottom. When the machine is turned on: - The cylinder turns at a constant speed, completing one turn every 3 seconds. - The pens move vertically at a constant speed, whilst remaining in contact with the cylinder, leaving a coloured trail. The green pen moves down and the red pen moves up. Once each pen reaches the other end of the cylinder the poles are moved so that the pen is no longer in contact with the cylinder. The green pen lowers at a rate of 1 cm/second. The red pen rises at a rate of cm/second. The trails left by the pens intersect each other a total of 7 times. The intersection closest to the top of the cylinder is point A. The intersection closest to the bottom of the cylinder is point B. Points A and B are connected directly with a straight line that goes through the cylinder (not along the surface). Calculate the length of the line AB. Give your answer to 4 decimal places.","output":"To calculate the length of the line AB, we can consider the movement of the pens over time and find the time at which they intersect. Let's assume the radius of the cylinder is \\"r\\" cm. Given that the green pen moves down at a rate of 1 cm/second and the red pen moves up at a rate of \\"c\\" cm/second, we can denote the time it takes for the pens to meet as \\"t\\" seconds. Since the green pen starts at the top of the cylinder (height = 12 cm) and moves down at a constant speed, the distance it covers in time \\"t\\" seconds is given by: Distance covered by green pen = 12 - (1 * t) Similarly, the distance covered by the red pen, starting from the bottom of the cylinder (height = 0 cm) and moving up at a constant speed, is: Distance covered by red pen = 0 + (c * t) The time it takes for the pens to intersect is the same as the time it takes for the green pen to move a distance equal to the length of the cylinder (2πr, as it completes one turn). Therefore, we have the equation: 12 - t = 2πr - c * t Simplifying the equation, we get: t + c * t = 2πr - 12 t * (1 + c) = 2πr - 12 t = (2πr - 12) / (1 + c) Given that the pens intersect a total of 7 times, we can consider the time intervals between each intersection. Since the cylinder completes one turn every 3 seconds (the time period of one complete revolution), the time interval between each intersection is 3 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken for 7 intersections is 7 * 3 = 21 seconds. Setting the expression for \\"t\\" equal to 21 seconds, we can solve for the value of \\"r\\": (2πr - 12) / (1 + c) = 21 Once we have the value of \\"r,\\" we can calculate the length of AB using the Pythagorean theorem, as AB is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle formed with the cylinder's axis and the line segment AB. Length of AB = √[(2r)^2 + 12^2] Length of AB = √[4r^2 + 144] To find the value of the length of AB to 4 decimal places, you will need to know the specific rate \\"c\\" at which the red pen moves up in cm/second."},{"instruction":"Write a speech for my local community in which you review the facilities available to young people in the local area","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed members of our vibrant local community, Today, I stand before you to shed light on a matter close to our hearts – the facilities available to young people within our beloved locality.

Next, modify the line \`show_listeners = True\` to \`show_listeners = False\` after the guess is checked.

Här är några tips: 1. Använd en getingfälla: Du kan köpa en färdig getingfälla eller göra en egen. Fyll den med ett sött lockbete, som sockervatten, fruktjuice eller läsk, och placera den några meter bort från växthuset. Getingarna lockas till fällan istället för växthuset. 2. Placera en fläkt i växthuset: Getingar ogillar starka vindar. Genom att sätta upp en fläkt inne i växthuset kan du skapa en obehaglig miljö för dem och få dem att flytta på sig. 3. Använd ett getingspray: Köp en insektsspray eller getingspray och applicera den på områden där getingarna är aktiva, som ingångs- eller flygplatsen för boet. Följ alltid instruktionerna på förpackningen och var försiktig när du använder kemikalier. 4. Anlita en professionell skadedjursbekämpare: Om getingarna är ett stort problem och du inte kan hantera dem på egen hand, kontakta en erfaren skadedjursbekämpare. De har specialverktyg och metoder för att säkert ta bort getingarna och deras bo. Kom ihåg att vara försiktig när du hanterar getingar, eftersom de kan bli aggressiva och stinga om de känner sig hotade. Använd skyddskläder och handskar vid behov och försök att genomföra borttagningen under kvällen eller tidigt på morgonen när getingarna är mindre aktiva."},{"instruction":"kan andra starka dofter få getingarna att flytta på sig?","output":"Ja, starka dofter kan hjälpa till att få getingar att flytta på sig. Här är några dofter som getingar ogillar: 1. Pepparmynta: Getingar har en naturlig aversion mot pepparmynta. Du kan använda pepparmyntsolja eller pepparmynta-eteriska oljor för att skapa en barriär runt växthusets ingångar eller runt området där getingarna är aktiva. Applicera några droppar olja på bomullsbollar eller blötlägg bomullstussar med pepparmyntsolja och placera dem strategiskt. 2. Citron eller citronmeliss: Getingar gillar inte lukten av citrustoner. Du kan skära upp citroner eller citronmelissblad och placera dem strategiskt runt växthusets ingångar eller där getingarna är aktiva. 3. Vinäger: Getingar ogillar lukten av vinäger. Placera en skål med vinäger i närheten av växthusets ingångar eller vid de områden där getingarna dyker upp. Vinägern attraherar dem och hindrar dem från att bygga sina bon i närheten. 4. Kryddor som kanel, kryddnejlika eller citrusoljor: Getingar ogillar starka kryddor och citrusdofter. Sprid lite kanel eller kryddnejlika i växthusets närhet eller använd citrusoljor för att skapa en avskräckande doftbarriär. Det är viktigt att komma ihåg att dofterna kan hjälpa till att skrämma bort getingar, men de kan inte garantera en fullständig utrotning. För att säkerställa en effektiv och långsiktig lösning kan det vara bäst att kombinera dofter med andra metoder som att använda fällor eller anlita en skadedjursbekämpare."},{"instruction":"I am a fresh graduate with bachelor in mechanical engineering.

György és éva véletlenül találkoznak a pályaudvaron és első látásra szerelmesek lesznek.

Az emberek igyekeznek folytatni az életüket, de a háború emlékei még mindig sötét árnyékként vetülnek rájuk. A pályaudvar zsúfolt, a vonatok sietnek, az emberek rohannak ide-oda. Ilyen környezetben négy személy sorsa egymásba fonódik. Egy hideg januári napon, György vonaton érkezik Pestre. Egy magában álló figura, aki a háborút követően próbálja folytatni az életét. A kilátástalan helyzetben az egyetlen reménye, hogy találkozik Évával, aki itt várja. Éva már régóta várakozik a pályaudvaron. Az ő sorsa is a háború után megváltozott. Elvesztette az egész családját, csak küszködik a mindennapi megélhetésért. A reménytelen helyzetben találkoznak, és első látásra szerelmesek lesznek egymásba. Egy röpke pillanatban mintha felgyulladt volna az élet a szürke, hideg utcákon. Nem sejtik még, hogy néhány órával ezelőtt egy közeli rokonok között rendezett családi esemény történt, ami el fogja választani őket. Györgynek sorsdöntő választása volt, amit el kell hoznia a városba, mielőtt találkozott Évával. A fájdalom és fáradtság kiszolgáltatja őket egy rejtélyes, gonosz erőnek, ami megpróbálja végleg elválasztani őket. György halványan emlékszik az eseményre, ami az életét teljesen megváltoztatta. Az öntudatlanul megtett döntés nyomasztja a lelkiismeretét. Arra ébred egy nyirkos pincében, amit teljesen ismeretlennek lát. A szobát mindenhol levéllel borított asztalok töltik ki. Mindegyik levélen egyetlen név van: Éva. György pánikba esik és próbál menekülni, de ajtó és ablak nélküli a pince bezárja őt. A leveleken nagyhatalmú bűnbanda fenyegeti Éva életét, ha nem ad át egy titkos dokumentumot. Eközben Éva vár a pályaudvaron, de sehol sem találja Györgyt. Kezd aggódni, de még reménykedik, hogy hamarosan megérkezik. Az idő múlásával azonban egyre kétségbeesettebb lesz. Éva úgy dönt, hogy felkeresi György otthonát, hogy megtudja, mi történt vele. György közben rájön, hogy csak egyetlen mód van a menekülésre. Meg kell találnia a titkos dokumentumot és meg kell akadályoznia, hogy a bűnbanda elérje Évát. Miközben a pincében kutat, rájön, hogy nem egyedül van. Egy csata kezdődik, ahol az élete múlik. Éva végre eléri György otthonát. Felszáll a lépcsőn, és dörömböl az ajtón. Senki sem válaszol. Éva belép a lakásba, ami sötét és elhagyatott. Idegen tárgyak hevernek szanaszét, mintha valami borzalmas esemény történt volna. Éva egyre inkább aggódik, sétál a lakásban, és hirtelen meglátja egy levél darabkáját a földön. A levél arról szól, hogy idő hiányában folytassa a keresést, hogy megtalálja a titkos dokumentumot és megmentsa Évát. A sötét utcán, egy olyan pillanatban, amikor mindketten már feladták a reményüket, György és Éva váratlanul találkoznak. A szemükben látják a múltat és a jövőt, miközben elmondják egymásnak, hogy mi történt a családi eseményen. A magyarázat felderíti a titokzatos eseményt, de azt is feltárja, hogy a bűnbanda még mindig keresi a dokumentumot. Együtt gyorsan menekülniük kell a városból. Az utcákon átverekszenek az állomásra, ahol egy éjféli vonat vár rájuk. Az üldözők egyre közelebb járnak, de a szerelmesek nem adják fel. Beülnek a vonatra, és a sínek alatt elterülő városban a fények elhalványulnak. György és Éva biztonságos helyre érnek, messze a város zajától. Megfognak egymás kezét, és az égen megjelenik a remény fénye. Bár még mindig rengeteg akadály áll előttük, a szeretet és a kitartás meghajlítja a világot.

Public spaces: When I'm in public spaces like cafes, parks, or public transportation, I sometimes listen to snippets of conversations or sounds from the environment. It's an opportunity to catch glimpses of different perspectives and gain a broader understanding of the world around me. 6.

However, recent developments and policy actions have raised concerns about the potential militarization of space policy. One of the key concerns is the creation of the United States Space Force (USSF), which was established as a separate military branch in 2019. The USSF's primary mission is to \\"maintain U.S. superiority in space,\\" which has led to concerns that it could be used to develop and deploy offensive military capabilities in space. Furthermore, the United States' increasing reliance on space-based assets for military operations, such as satellite communication and reconnaissance systems, has also raised concerns about the potential militarization of space. As these assets become more critical to national security, there is a risk that they could be used to support offensive military operations or as targets during conflicts. In addition, the United States has also pursued the development of anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities. In 2008, the U.S. successfully tested its ASAT capabilities by destroying one of its own satellites, showcasing its ability to interfere with or destroy other countries' satellites. This action fueled concerns about an arms race in space and the potential for the weaponization of space. The deployment of offensive space capabilities or the use of space-based assets for offensive purposes could have destabilizing effects and potentially spark an arms race in space.

This principle is known as “praxis” in the Marxist termino­logy, and is borrowed by Marx from his materialist predecessor, Feuer­bach, and his another master, Hegel. Opposed to this principle is the principle of the philosophy of ontological realism [idealism ] that believes in the priority of thought over action and reciprocal interaction of thought and action. In this philosophy, thought is the essence of man (e.g. the self's \`knowledge by presence' of itself). Man has a reciprocal relation with action and work: he creates work and his work in turn moulds him. Man, through his action upon the external world, acquires the data of his knowledge from the external world; until the mind becomes enriched with these primary data, it remains incapable of any intelligent activity. After collecting this data, the mind reciprocally exercises its powers on the data in various fashions, as by generalization, abstraction, and inference (ratiocination). In this way, it prepares the grounds for the correct understanding of objects. Understanding is not merely the reflection of external matter in the mind. It is only after the reflection of external matter is transformed inside the mind through a series of mental processes, which originate in the nonmaterial substance of the soul, that understanding becomes possible. Hence, action is the origin of thought and thought is the origin of action. Action is the test of thought and at the same time thought is the test of action. This is not a vicious circle. Man's nobility lies in his wisdom, faith, and dignity, and in turn his work is valuable because through it he acquires these virtues. Man is the creator of his work, and, at the same time, he is also its product. This is the distinguishing characteristic of man, which is not found in any other being, and which is derived from a mode of Divine creation special to his species. 11","output":"Este é um dos princípios da filosofia materialista do marxismo. Este princípio é conhecido como \\"práxis\\" na terminologia marxista, e é emprestado por Marx de seu predecessor materialista, Feuerbach, e de seu outro mestre, Hegel. Oposto a este princípio está o princípio da filosofia do realismo ontológico [idealismo] que acredita na prioridade do pensamento sobre a ação e na interação recíproca do pensamento e da ação. Nesta filosofia, o pensamento é a essência do homem (por exemplo, o \\"conhecimento pela presença\\" de si mesmo). O homem tem uma relação recíproca com a ação e o trabalho: ele cria trabalho e seu trabalho, por sua vez, o molda. O homem, através de sua ação sobre o mundo externo, adquire os dados de seu conhecimento do mundo externo; até que a mente fique enriquecida com esses dados primários, ela permanece incapaz de qualquer atividade inteligente. Após coletar esses dados, a mente exerce reciprocamente seus poderes sobre os dados de várias maneiras, como generalização, abstração e inferência (raciocínio). Dessa forma, ela prepara os fundamentos para a compreensão correta dos objetos. A compreensão não é apenas o reflexo da matéria externa na mente. É somente depois que o reflexo da matéria externa é transformado dentro da mente através de uma série de processos mentais, que se originam na substância não material da alma, que se torna possível a compreensão. Portanto, a ação é a origem do pensamento e o pensamento é a origem da ação. Ação é o teste do pensamento e, ao mesmo tempo, o pensamento é o teste da ação. Isso não é um círculo vicioso. A nobreza do homem reside em sua sabedoria, fé e dignidade, e, por sua vez, seu trabalho é valioso porque por meio dele ele adquire essas virtudes. O homem é o criador de seu trabalho e, ao mesmo tempo, ele também é seu produto. Esta é a característica distintiva do homem, que não é encontrada em nenhum outro ser, e que é derivada de um modo de criação divina especial para sua espécie. 11"},{"instruction":"traduza Mans' creativity in relation to work is inventive and positive, while work's formative power in relation to man is only quantitative. It means that man actually creates his own work, but work does not really create a man. It is work, exercise, and repetitive practice, which provide the grounds for the making of man from within. Whenever there is a reciprocal relationship between two things which is inventive and positive from one side and quantitative and numerical from the other, the former is prior to the latter. Hence man, whose essence is consciousness (\`knowledge by presence' of his own self), has reciprocal relationship with work. Man creates work and work moulds man. Considering the fact that man is the necessary creative cause of work and work is merely a potential or quantitative cause of man, it may be said that man is prior to work, and work is not prior to him.","output":"A criatividade do homem em relação ao trabalho é inventiva e positiva, enquanto o poder formativo do trabalho em relação ao homem é apenas quantitativo. Isso significa que o homem realmente cria seu próprio trabalho, mas o trabalho não cria realmente o homem.

Sempre que há uma relação recíproca entre duas coisas que é inventiva e positiva de um lado e quantitativa e numérica do outro, o primeiro é anterior ao segundo. Portanto, o homem, cuja essência é a consciência (\\"conhecimento pela presença\\" de seu próprio eu), tem uma relação recíproca com o trabalho. O homem cria o trabalho e o trabalho molda o homem.

He has a kind of capacity for self‑improvement which is specific to his kind. Man is endowed with a specific personality whose dimen­sions form his human Dasein (existence). As a result of continued experiences and learning, the philosophical and intellectual dimension of man's existence is shaped. And due to the influence of some other factors his existence gains another dimension which is the ethical dimension. It is this dimension which is the source of all values, and basis of the entire moral \`musts' and \`must nots'. The artistic and religious dimensions are also evolved in a similar manner. Man himself styles a system of intellectual principles which serve as the basis of his thinking within the framework of his philosophical and intellectual dimensions. In the course of his judgments, he arrives at a set of absolute and semi­-absolute (comparatively relative) values in the moral and social spheres of life. All these dimensions combined together constitute human existence. Human dimensions are entirely effects of social factors. At the time of birth, man is devoid of all these dimensions; he is actually like a raw material ready to acquire any form, ideological or emotional, depending upon the factors that exercise influence upon him. He is like an empty pot that has to be filled from outside, like a blank recording tape on which any sound can be recorded. Whatever is recorded on it is retrievable. To sum up, the actual maker of human personality, and whatever that transforms man from a \`thing' into a \`person,' is nothing but the external social factors, which combined together constitute that which is called social process. Man in himself is purely a \`thing;' which is transformed into a \`person' as a result of the impact of social factors. P. Royan in his Historical Materialism quotes from page 42 of Plekhanov's Fundamental Problems of Marxism:","output":"Do ponto de vista biológico, o homem é o mais perfeito de todos os animais. Ele possui uma capacidade de autoaperfeiçoamento que é específica de sua espécie. O homem é dotado de uma personalidade específica, cujas dimensões formam seu Dasein humano (existência). Como resultado de experiências e aprendizados contínuos, a dimensão filosófica e intelectual da existência do homem é moldada. E devido à influência de alguns outros fatores, sua existência ganha outra dimensão, que é a dimensão ética. É essa dimensão que é a fonte de todos os valores e a base de todo o \\"deve\\" e \\"não deve\\" moral. As dimensões artísticas e religiosas também evoluem de maneira similar. O próprio homem estabelece um sistema de princípios intelectuais que servem de base para seu pensamento dentro do quadro de suas dimensões filosóficas e intelectuais. No decorrer de seus julgamentos, ele chega a um conjunto de valores absolutos e semi-absolutos (comparativamente relativos) na esfera moral e social da vida. Todas essas dimensões combinadas constituem a existência humana. As dimensões humanas são inteiramente efeitos de fatores sociais. No momento do nascimento, o homem não possui todas essas dimensões; ele é na verdade como uma matéria-prima pronta para adquirir qualquer forma, ideológica ou emocional, dependendo dos fatores que exercem influência sobre ele. Ele é como um pote vazio que precisa ser preenchido de fora, como uma fita de gravação em branco na qual qualquer som pode ser registrado. O que for registrado nela é recuperável. Para resumir, o verdadeiro formador da personalidade humana, e tudo o que transforma o homem de uma \\"coisa\\" em uma \\"pessoa\\", são nada mais do que os fatores sociais externos, que combinados constituem aquilo que é chamado de processo social. O homem em si é puramente uma \\"coisa\\", que é transformada em uma \\"pessoa\\" como resultado do impacto dos fatores sociais. P. Royan, em seu Materialismo Histórico, cita na página 42 dos Problemas Fundamentais do Marxismo de Plekhanov:"},{"instruction":"traduza The characteristics of a social system are determined by the current level of development of the means of production of society. It means that when the stage of development of the means of production is determined, the charac­teristics of the social order and the psychology (of the people) related to it, and all the other corresponding relations within the system, on the one hand, and the ideas and the pace of progress, on the other; are also (of their own accord) determined. In the same book, it is further stated that: When psychology, through the means of production, is determined, ideology too, which is deeply rooted in the psychology of the people, is also conse­quently determined. But as the ideology at a particular historical stage is the product of social requirements, and as it always continues to protect the interests of the ruling class, it necessarily strengthens and perfects the existing social structure. Hence the social structure in class‑societies, which comes into existence for protecting the ruling class and propagating its ideology, is in reality the result of the social order and its requirements, and, in the last analysis, is the product of the character of the modes and the means of production. For instance, the church and the mosque are for preaching of the religious beliefs, which in all the religions are based upon the faith in the final judgment or resurrection. The belief in resurrection is the logical outcome of the particular social order that is based upon the division of society into classes, which in its turn is the product of a particular stage of development of the means of production. Hence, belief in resurrection is the product of the means of production (at a particular stage of social development). In contrast to this principle is another anthropological principle which is based upon the view that the foundation of human persona­lity, from which man's intellect and higher ideals arise, is itself inherent in human nature, ingrained in him by the agents which are responsible for his creation. It is correct that man, contrary to the well-­known theory of Plato, is not born with a ready‑made and finished per­sonality, but the real foundation of his personality is inborn, not acquired from the society.","output":"As características de um sistema social são determinadas pelo nível atual de desenvolvimento dos meios de produção da sociedade. Isso significa que quando o estágio de desenvolvimento dos meios de produção é determinado, as características da ordem social e a psicologia (das pessoas) relacionadas a ela e todas as outras relações correspondentes dentro do sistema, por um lado, e as ideias e o ritmo de progresso, por outro lado, também são determinadas (por si mesmas). No mesmo livro, é declarado ainda que: Quando a psicologia, por meio dos meios de produção, é determinada, a ideologia também, que está profundamente enraizada na psicologia das pessoas, também é consequentemente determinada. Mas, como a ideologia em uma determinada fase histórica é produto das necessidades sociais e sempre continua a proteger os interesses da classe dominante, ela necessariamente fortalece e aperfeiçoa a estrutura social existente. Portanto, a estrutura social em sociedades de classes, que surge para proteger a classe dominante e propagar sua ideologia, é na realidade o resultado da ordem social e suas necessidades, e, em última análise, produto do caráter dos modos e meios de produção. Por exemplo, a igreja e a mesquita servem para pregar as crenças religiosas, que em todas as religiões são baseadas na fé no juízo final ou ressurreição. A crença na ressurreição é o resultado lógico da ordem social particular que se baseia na divisão da sociedade em classes, que por sua vez é produto de um estágio particular de desenvolvimento dos meios de produção. Portanto, a crença na ressurreição é produto dos meios de produção (em um estágio particular de desenvolvimento social). Em contraste com este princípio, há outro princípio antropológico que se baseia na visão de que a base da personalidade humana, da qual surge o intelecto e os ideais mais elevados do homem, é inerente à natureza humana, enraizada nele pelos agentes responsáveis por sua criação. É correto que o homem, ao contrário da teoria bem conhecida de Platão, não nasce com uma personalidade pronta e acabada, mas a verdadeira base de sua personalidade é inata, não adquirida da sociedade."},{"instruction":"traduza If we want to interpret this idea in philoso­phical terms, we shall have to say that the real source of the human dimensions of man's existence‑including the moral, religious, philoso­phical, artistic, scientific, literary, and emotional dimensions‑ have their origin in his rational self, which is man's distinguishing characteristic, and is bestowed upon him by the process of creation itself. Society fosters man, nurtures him, or distorts him according to his individual aptitudes. At first the rational self is potential, and then it gradually attains actuality. In this way, man, according to the basic principles of thought, and also according to the principle governing his material and intellectual inclinations and aptitudes, is like all the other living beings, whose all faculties are potential in the beginning, and as a result of a series of mutational movements (harakat jawhariyyah) gradually actualize, develop, and attain perfection. Man, under the influence of external factors, nourishes and cultivates his innate personality and attains perfection, or sometimes he deviates from the normal course and distorts it. This is the same principle which in Islamic writings is called the “principle of nature,” and is regarded as the mother principle in Islamic teachings. On the basis of the principle of nature, human psychology is prior to human sociology. Sociology itself originates in human psychology. According to this principle of nature, although at the time of birth man possesses neither perception nor imagination, neither the power of judgment nor human aptitudes; he however is born with some existential dimensions besides his animal dimensions. It is because of the same dimensions that he gradually evolves a sequence of abstract ideas and judgments (in philosophical and logical terms, the \`secondary concepts') which form the real foundation of human thought, and without which any kind of logical reasoning is impossible. The same dimensions develop a series of sublime aspirations in man, and are considered to. be the foundation of human personality. According to the theory of priority of human sociology over human psychology, man is merely a passive receiver, not an active seeker.

I have continuously expanded and deepened my skills through participation in 3D contests, game jams, and collaboration on game projects. While I specialize in object and prop creation, I also have some experience in level design and character creation. Additionally, I have basic knowledge of rigging and animation. I have been working with Blender for approximately 10 years and have utilized Unity 3D for most projects. However, I am eager to familiarize myself with the latest version of UE and other tools. I am accustomed to working remotely in a team through my collaboration on various game projects and my freelance work, and I greatly appreciate this flexible way of working. I am excited to create exciting and visually appealing VR experiences. I would be available for the position starting from August 1st. I am looking forward to further discussing this opportunity in a personal conversation!

Society fosters man, nurtures him, or distorts him according to his individual aptitudes. At first the rational self is potential, and then it gradually attains actuality. In this way, man, according to the basic principles of thought, and also according to the principle governing his material and intellectual inclinations and aptitudes, is like all the other living beings, whose all faculties are potential in the beginning, and as a result of a series of mutational movements (harakat jawhariyyah) gradually actualize, develop, and attain perfection. Man, under the influence of external factors, nourishes and cultivates his innate personality and attains perfection, or sometimes he deviates from the normal course and distorts it. This is the same principle which in Islamic writings is called the “principle of nature,” and is regarded as the mother principle in Islamic teachings. On the basis of the principle of nature, human psychology is prior to human sociology. Sociology itself originates in human psychology. According to this principle of nature, although at the time of birth man possesses neither perception nor imagination, neither the power of judgment nor human aptitudes; he however is born with some existential dimensions besides his animal dimensions. It is because of the same dimensions that he gradually evolves a sequence of abstract ideas and judgments (in philosophical and logical terms, the \`secondary concepts') which form the real foundation of human thought, and without which any kind of logical reasoning is impossible. The same dimensions develop a series of sublime aspirations in man, and are considered to. be the foundation of human personality. According to the theory of priority of human sociology over human psychology, man is merely a passive receiver, not an active seeker. He is a raw material which is indifferent to any form given to him, a blank tape on which any song can be recorded. In it there is no kind of inherent movement towards any fixed preordained form.","output":"Se quisermos interpretar essa ideia em termos filosóficos, devemos dizer que a verdadeira fonte das dimensões humanas da existência do homem - incluindo as dimensões moral, religiosa, filosófica, artística, científica, literária e emocional - tem sua origem em seu eu racional, que é a característica distintiva do homem e é concedida a ele pelo processo da própria criação. A sociedade fomenta o homem, o nutre ou o distorce de acordo com suas aptidões individuais. No início, o eu racional é potencial e, em seguida, gradualmente alcança a atualidade. Dessa forma, o homem, de acordo com os princípios básicos do pensamento, e também de acordo com o princípio que governa suas inclinações e aptidões materiais e intelectuais, é como todos os outros seres vivos, cujas faculdades estão potenciais no início e, como resultado de uma série de movimentos mutacionais, gradualmente atualizam, desenvolvem e alcançam a perfeição. O homem, sob a influência de fatores externos, nutre e cultiva sua personalidade inata e alcança a perfeição, ou às vezes se desvia do curso normal e a distorce. Esse é o mesmo princípio que nos escritos islâmicos é chamado de \\"princípio da natureza\\" e é considerado o princípio fundamental nos ensinamentos islâmicos. Com base no princípio da natureza, a psicologia humana é anterior à sociologia humana. A sociologia em si tem origem na psicologia humana. De acordo com esse princípio da natureza, embora no momento do nascimento o homem não possua percepção, imaginação, poder de julgamento nem aptidões humanas, ele nasce com algumas dimensões existenciais além de suas dimensões animais. É por causa dessas mesmas dimensões que ele gradualmente desenvolve uma sequência de ideias e julgamentos abstratos (em termos filosóficos e lógicos, os \\"conceitos secundários\\") que formam a verdadeira base do pensamento humano e sem os quais qualquer tipo de raciocínio lógico é impossível. As mesmas dimensões desenvolvem uma série de aspirações sublimes no homem e são consideradas como base da personalidade humana. De acordo com a teoria da prioridade da sociologia humana em relação à psicologia humana, o homem é apenas um receptor passivo, não um buscador ativo. Ele é uma matéria-prima que é indiferente a qualquer forma dada a ele, uma fita em branco na qual qualquer música pode ser gravada. Nele, não há nenhum tipo de movimento inerente em direção a qualquer forma fixa preordenada."},{"instruction":"traduza Whatever form is given to it is accepted without causing any distortion; because it neither has any form of its own, nor is any form alien to it. The tape does not require any particular song, because of its ability to receive any song without being alienated or estranged from its own essence or nature. The relation of this raw material to all forms, the relation of the tape to all songs, and the relation of the pot to whatever fills it, are similar and of the same kind. But according to the principle of nature and the principle of prio­rity of human psychology over human sociology, although in the begin­ning man lacks actual understanding and actual inclinations, from within he moves in a dynamic way towards a series of primary judgments, which are called a priori or primary principles. He also moves towards a series of higher, sublime values which constitute his ideals of humanity. After that a set of simple ideas, which are the primary elements of thought (and are called in philosophical term \`primary concepts'), enters into his mind from outside; those principles emerge in the form of a system of theoretical or practical judgments, and the innate human inclinations gradually assume definite form in the course of time. According to the first theory, man, under the existing conditions, believes for example, that the arithmetical formula, 2 x 2 = 4, as being absolutely true for all times and places. But actually this belief is a product of specific conditions; which means that it is due to the prevailing conditions which make it true, and it is just possible that under different conditions and a different environment the judgment would be quite different, such as 2 x 2 = 26. But according to the second theory, although the external conditions help man to arrive at the idea of numbers 2, 4, 8, 10 and so on, but the calculations like 2 x 2 = 4 or 5 x 5 = 25 are essential pro­ducts of the human mind, and it is impossible for them to have different forms: Similarly the perfectionist tendencies of human nature are also inseparably essential characteristics of man's mind or soul. 12","output":"Qualquer forma que lhe seja dada é aceita sem causar distorção, porque ela não tem forma própria, nem nenhuma forma é estranha a ela.

A relação dessa matéria-prima com todas as formas, a relação da fita com todas as músicas e a relação do recipiente com o que quer que o preencha são semelhantes e do mesmo tipo. Mas de acordo com o princípio da natureza e o princípio da prioridade da psicologia humana sobre a sociologia humana, embora no início o homem não tenha compreensão atual e inclinações atuais, ele se move de dentro de forma dinâmica em direção a uma série de julgamentos primários, que são chamados de a priori ou princípios primários.

De acordo com a primeira teoria, o homem, sob as condições existentes, acredita, por exemplo, que a fórmula aritmética 2 x 2 = 4 é absolutamente verdadeira para todos os tempos e lugares. Mas na realidade, essa crença é um produto de condições específicas; o que significa que ela se deve às condições predominantes que a tornam verdadeira, e é possível que, sob condições diferentes e um ambiente diferente, o julgamento seja completamente diferente, como 2 x 2 = 26. Mas de acordo com a segunda teoria, embora as condições externas ajudem o homem a chegar à ideia dos números 2, 4, 8, 10 e assim por diante, os cálculos como 2 x 2 = 4 ou 5 x 5 = 25 são produtos essenciais da mente humana, e é impossível que tenham formas diferentes: Da mesma forma, as tendências perfeccionistas da natureza humana também são características inseparáveis essenciais da mente ou alma do homem."},{"instruction":"traduza 5. Priority of Material Aspect of Society over its Intellectual Aspect","output":"5. Prioridade do Aspecto Material da Sociedade sobre seu Aspecto Intelectual A quinta prioridade estabelecida é a do aspecto material da sociedade sobre seu aspecto intelectual. Isso significa que a base material e econômica da sociedade deve ser considerada como fundamental na compreensão de sua dinâmica e desenvolvimento. De acordo com essa prioridade, as condições materiais, como a produção de bens, as relações de trabalho e a distribuição de recursos, são consideradas como os principais determinantes das formas sociais e do conhecimento intelectual. Isso implica que o progresso da sociedade está diretamente ligado ao desenvolvimento de suas forças produtivas e à satisfação das necessidades materiais de seus membros. Ao priorizar o aspecto material da sociedade, reconhece-se que as mudanças nas condições de vida, no modo de produção e nas relações sociais têm um impacto significativo nas instituições, no pensamento e nas ideias de uma sociedade. Portanto, ao analisar as transformações sociais, é essencial considerar as mudanças nas relações econômicas e materiais como fatores-chave. No entanto, é importante ressaltar que essa prioridade não nega a importância do aspecto intelectual da sociedade. Pelo contrário, reconhece-se que o desenvolvimento intelectual e as ideias têm um papel importante na transformação das condições materiais e na construção de uma sociedade progressista. No entanto, a ênfase recai no entendimento de que as mudanças no aspecto material são fundamentais para impulsionar o desenvolvimento social.

However, if we engage in an imaginative exercise, taking into consideration historical and regional context, we can explore a hypothetical description of his voice. Дьяків Сава Федорович, a prominent figure from the past, was known for his influential role in the historical records of Ukraine. With his dignified appearance in the photograph, we might conjecture that he possessed a commanding presence and exhibited a sense of authority in his demeanor. Based on this assumption, we can speculate about the qualities of his voice. Considering the time period, specifically the 19th century, it is reasonable to believe that Дьяків's voice would have been lower-pitched than what might be expected in contemporary contexts. His voice could have carried a more robust tone, reflecting strength and gravitas. Considering regional influences, Дьяків was from Ukraine, where people are generally known for their distinct vocal characteristics. Ukrainian voices often possess a slightly melodious quality with a slight accent, providing a unique color and rhythm to their speech patterns. Although this is a generalization, it could assist in constructing a speculative portrayal of Дьяків's voice. While it is unrealistic to recreate the exact nuances of his voice, we can attempt to imagine a voice that is deep, resonant, and eloquent. It might have conveyed a sense of wisdom and authority, matched with a touch of cultural intonation from his Ukrainian heritage. However, these assumptions remain purely speculative without any tangible evidence to support them.

Як придатного до військової служби мобілізували на початку Першої Світової війни до Російського Флоту Його Імператорської Величності. Службу проходив на Балтійському флоті. Декілька разів ходив у далекі походи, мав нагороди Російської Імперії (не збереглися). На початку 1917 року повернувся до рідного села Янівки, взяв активну участь у встановлені влади Центральної Ради Української Народної Республіки у Ставинській волості. За спогадами Марко Шляхового-Кармелюка «Отаман Дьяків — мав од роду років 29 — 30, величезного росту козак і ходив завше у козацькому — чорноморського козака катеринівських часів — вбранні. Батько його був бідний селянин. З початку революції 1917 року Дьяків, перебуваючи на морській флотській службі російської армії, брав участь в українських військових організаціях Чорноморської фльоти. Коли Чорноморська фльота, як і другі, стали під кінець 1917 року більшовичитись, Дьяків кинув фльоту і самовільно прибув до Центральної Ради. Тут в часи бійки Центральної Ради з більшовиками в січні 1918 року, Дьяків був вже вільним козаком. З того часу у своєму районі на Київщині став отаманом Вільного Козацтва. Як казав мені сам Дьяков, він так любив Центральну Раду і тодішніх її проводирів, що завжди був готовий віддати своє життя в боротьбі з її ворогами, а особливо з московським чорносотенним большевизмом, в початкові боротьбі з яким він, Дьяків, і загартував свою козацьку відвагу»(Марко Шляховий-Кармелюк неточно навів дані по нього щодо служби на флоті). Однодумець отамана Зеленого (Данила Терпила) у питанні державності та, одночасно, опонент щодо засобів досягнення мети, організував йому спротив проти накладення «реквізицій» на місцеве населення Кагарлика наприкінці 1918 року. У серпні-вересні 1919 року розгромив осередок радянської влади у волосному містечку Германівка Київського повіту, якою за влади більшовиків у Києві протягом 1919 року організовувалися збройне пограбування (вилучення зерна, борошна та іншої їжі) селян найближчих волостей за завданням проросійського уряду Української радянської соціалістичної республіки. Дружина Ганна Олексіївна, діти: Павло, Петро, Віра та Марія. Ніколи не мав сина Якова, з посиланням на свідчення якого Саві Дьякові приписують участь у загибелі отамана Зеленого. За свідченнями у 2011 році його доньки Марії (мешкала у тій же самій хаті, в якій жила сім'я Сави Дьякова у 1919 році, в селі Янівка) під час загибелі отамана Зеленого знаходився у містечку Стави Київського повіту, отримавши доповідь про його загибель, вирушив із власним загоном до загону отамана Зеленого для з'ясування обставин загибелі та визначення подальших дій. Зраджений місцевим селянином із села Янівка, який звернувся до Сави Дьякова за захистом від пограбування денікінцями цукрового заводу в Узині та вивів його 13 грудня 1919 року з невеликим загоном до засідки біля волосного містечка Мирівка Київського повіту, де Сава Дьяків загинув у бою. Над тілом поглумилися: денікінці його тіло повісили за ноги на базарному стовпі в Мирівці для залякування населення. Похований на цвинтарі села Янівка Ставинської волості Київського повіту.”","output":"Based on the photo of Дьяків Сава Федорович and the provided article, we can engage in a speculative reconstruction of his voice, keeping in mind the limitations of such an exercise. Дьяків Сава Федорович, a figure known for his military and civic leadership during the Ukrainian struggle for independence, likely possessed a voice that resonated with determination and authority. Being a veteran of the Russian Imperial Navy and a participant in various military campaigns, his voice may have exhibited a stern yet resolute quality. Considering his background and involvement in Ukrainian military organizations, it is conceivable that Дьяків's voice carried a distinct Ukrainian accent. This accent might have contributed to his vocal projection, conveying a sense of pride and strong connection to his Ukrainian heritage. Given his role as an otaman (leader) and organizer of resistance against both Soviet and counter-revolutionary forces, it is likely that Дьяків's voice reflected his commanding presence. His speeches and public addresses probably exuded a fervor and persuasive charisma, inspiring and rallying those around him. While his voice may have possessed a deep timbre, projecting strength and conviction, it could also have exhibited moments of emotion and intensity during impassioned speeches or moments of reflection. This vocal variation might have added depth and humanity to his overall communication style. However, it is important to reiterate that this speculative reconstruction is based solely on conjecture and general assumptions derived from historical context and the provided information. Without any audio recordings or firsthand accounts of Дьяків's voice, we cannot determine the precise details or nuances. It is crucial to approach such reconstructions with caution and acknowledge their speculative nature."},{"instruction":"check scroll position on load in javascript","output":"To check the scroll position on load in JavaScript, you can use the \`window.onload\` event and the \`window.pageYOffset\` property.

Space Race: The competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve various milestones in space exploration. This included the first satellite (Sputnik by the Soviets), the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin by the Soviets), and the first manned moon landing (Apollo 11 by the US). 2. Cold War tensions: The space race occurred during the Cold War period, where the US and the Soviet Union were engaged in a global rivalry for political and ideological supremacy. The space race acted as a symbolic battleground, showcasing the technological and scientific capabilities of each superpower. 3. Arms race in space: In addition to peaceful exploration, both countries sought to develop military capabilities in space. This led to the development of anti-satellite weapons, surveillance satellites, and other space-based weapons systems, raising concerns about the potential militarization of space. 4. Spacecraft interception: In 1984, the US conducted a secret operation known as \\"Project Ryazan\\" to intercept and recover a Soviet satellite. This operation involved capturing a Soviet radar reconnaissance satellite using a modified US space shuttle. The operation was successful and the satellite was recovered, providing valuable intelligence to the US. 5. Space espionage: Both countries engaged in espionage activities in space to gather information about each other's capabilities. For example, the Soviets used various techniques to intercept and eavesdrop on US space communication signals, while the US launched covert satellites to capture images of Soviet military installations. 6. Space espionage shootdown: In 1985, the US intercepted and shot down a Soviet reconnaissance satellite, known as Cosmos 1940, using an anti-satellite missile launched from an F-15 fighter jet. This incident escalated tensions between the two countries and raised concerns about the escalation of military activities in space. 7. Space treaties and non-proliferation efforts: The US and the Soviet Union negotiated several space treaties to regulate the militarization and use of space. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit and the establishment of military bases on celestial bodies. These treaties aimed to prevent an all-out conflict in space and promote peaceful cooperation. 8. Space cooperation: Despite the conflict, there were also instances of cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union in space. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975 was a joint mission where a US Apollo spacecraft rendezvoused and docked with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, symbolizing détente between the two superpowers. This mission paved the way for future international cooperation in space exploration. Overall, the US-Soviet space conflict was characterized by competition, espionage, and militarization, but it also led to significant advancements in space exploration and cooperation."},{"instruction":"Write the following creatively: We are an independent, creatively driven marketing communications agency, providing fully integrated multidisciplinary advertising services that build strong, lasting and provocative relationships between your business and the customers.

Pamiętaj jednak, że to jest smutna i trudna historia, więc postaram się ją opowiedzieć z szacunkiem. Była sobie mała dziewczynka o imieniu Anna, która mieszkała w małej, spokojnej wiosce. Anna miała kochającą rodzinę i wspaniałych przyjaciół. Pewnego dnia, do ich wioski wkroczyli żołnierze nazistowscy. Cala społeczność była przerażona i zaniepokojona. Niemieccy żołnierze zaczęli wprowadzać coraz to surowsze przepisy i obostrzenia wobec Żydów, do którego narodziła się Anna. Musiała nosić gwiazdę Dawida na swojej odzieży, aby była rozpoznawalna dla innych. Jednak Anna, mimo wszystkich przeciwności, nie traciła nadziei i walczyła o swoje prawa. Ukrywała się w piwnicach i dzielnie razem z innymi zbiegami przeciwstawiała się niesprawiedliwości. Anna ujrzała okropieństwa, które dokonywały się w obozach koncentracyjnych. Była świadkiem straszliwej przemocy, cierpienia i śmierci. Jej przyjaciele i członkowie rodziny byli represjonowani i mordowani. Pomimo tych strasznych doświadczeń, Anna podziwiała tych, którzy pomagali prześladowanym. Opowieść o tych bohaterach motywowała ją do działania. Razem z innymi uciekinierami, usiłowała odnaleźć drogę do wolności. Niestety, droga była trudna i niebezpieczna. Anna z rozżaleniem oglądała, jak jej bliscy zostawali zaaresztowani, deportowani i zabijani. To był okres największego smutku i nieszczęścia dla niej i dla wielu innych. Jednak historia Anny nie kończy się tragicznie. Dziewczynka przeżyła i zdążyła opowiedzieć światu o tym, co widziała i doświadczyła. Jej opowieść stała się symbolem nadziei, łączącą ludzi i przypominającą nam o konieczności pokoju, życzliwości i szacunku dla innych. Bajka ta ma przypominać nam, jak ważne jest wspieranie się nawzajem, by zapobiec powtórzeniu się takich okropieństw. Powinniśmy być świadomi historii i uczcić pamięć ofiar, aby praca nad tolerancją i sprawiedliwością nigdy się nie skończyła."},{"instruction":"什么网站可以搜到免费乐谱","output":"有许多网站可以搜到免费乐谱，以下是一些常用的网站： 1.

Jego królestwo było pełne wspaniałych programów, które pomagały ludziom na co dzień. Aby jednak korzystać z tych programów, ludzie potrzebowali kluczy, które otwierały drzwi do ich instalacji. Król Windows miał dwóch wiernych pomocników – Kluczyka i Kłódeczki. Kluczyk był starszy i mądrzejszy. Znał każdy zakamarek królestwa i potrafił otworzyć każdy program swoim kluczem. Kłódeczka natomiast był jeszcze młody, skryty i niezbyt chętnie dzielił się swoimi kluczami. Pewnej nocy, gdy wszyscy mieszkańcy królestwa spali, Kłódeczka postanowił skryć klucze do programów przed Kluczykiem. Pomyślał, że jeśli tylko on będzie miał klucze, to wszyscy będą musieli do niego się zwracać, żeby móc korzystać z programów. Przez to Kłódeczka mógłby zdobyć jeszcze większą władzę. Kiedy Kluczyk rano się obudził, zorientował się, że klucze zniknęły. Był smutny i zmartwiony, bo wiedział, że mieszkańcy królestwa nie będą mogli korzystać z programów bez kluczy do ich instalacji. Kłódeczka czuł się coraz pewniejszy siebie i dumny ze swojego pomysłu. Wiedział, że jeśli nie będą mieli kluczy, to wszyscy będą musieli sięgać po niego, żeby móc korzystać z programów. Jednak z każdym dniem, Kłódeczka czuł się coraz bardziej samotny, ponieważ mieszkańcy królestwa zaczęli go omijać z daleka, a ich zadowolenie zaczęło słabnąć. W międzyczasie, Kluczyk nie poddawał się. Szukał kluczy wszędzie, pytał wszystkich mieszkańców królestwa, ale nikt nie wiedział, gdzie Kłódeczka mógłby je schować. Pewnego deszczowego wieczoru, Kluczyk usłyszał łzawe skomlenie. Podążał za dźwiękiem i trafił do starej, zapomnianej piwnicy. Tam zobaczył Kłódeczkę z płaczem, trzymającego w ręce skrzynię pełną kluczy. Kluczyk zrozumiał, że Kłódeczka czuł się samotny i tęsknił za towarzystwem mieszkańców królestwa. Postanowił przyjść do niego z pomocą. Powiedział, że nie chce być jedynym posiadaczem kluczy, ale chce je dzielić z innymi. Chciał, żeby wszyscy byli szczęśliwi i mieli dostęp do wspaniałych programów. Kłódeczka zdał sobie sprawę, że jego plan nie wypalił i zrozumiał, jak bardzo był samotny bez mieszkańców królestwa. Przepraszał za swoje postępowanie i postanowił przekazać Kluczykowi skrzynię z kluczami. Kluczyk z wdzięcznością przyjął gest pojednania. Od tamtego czasu, Kluczyk i Kłódeczka pracowali razem, dzieląc się kluczami do programów. Królestwo Windowsa wróciło do swojej dawnej świetności, a mieszkańcy byli w pełni zadowoleni.

The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political, and intellectual life‑process in general. It is not the consciousness of man that determines their being, but on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. 13 In the same book Marx's letter to Annenkov is also quoted: Assume a particular state of development in the productive facilities of man and you will get a corresponding form of commerce and consumption. Assume particular degrees of development of production, commerce, and consumption and you will have a corresponding organization of the family, or orders or of classes, in a word a corresponding civil society. 14 Peter explains Marx's view in the following words: In this fashion Marx has compared the society to a building, the base and foundation of which are the economic institutions, whose superstructure (the building itself) is comprised of political, religious, and legal patterns, customs and norms. As in the case of a building, it depends upon the position of its base and foundation, the economic forms (relations of production) and technical modes are also dependent upon and associated with the modes of thinking, the political system and the customs, and each of them is subject to economic conditions. 15","output":"Na produção social de sua vida, os homens estabelecem relações específicas que são indispensáveis e independentes de sua vontade, relações de produção que correspondem a um estágio definido do desenvolvimento de suas forças produtivas materiais.

Assim como no caso de um edifício, o posicionamento de sua base e fundação, as formas econômicas (relações de produção) e os modos técnicos também dependem e estão associados aos modos de pensamento, sistema político e costumes, e cada um deles está sujeito a condições econômicas.\\""},{"instruction":"traduza The same book quotes from Lenin's Marx‑Engels Marxism a passage reproduced from the third volume of The Capital: The mode of production manifests itself in the human activity in relation to nature and, followini that, in social conditions and intellectual patterns resulting from them. 16","output":"No mesmo livro, é citado do livro \\"Marxismo: Marx e Engels\\" de Lenin um trecho reproduzido do terceiro volume de \\"O Capital\\": \\"O modo de produção se manifesta na atividade humana em relação à natureza e, seguindo isso, nas condições sociais e nos padrões intelectuais resultantes delas.\\""},{"instruction":"traduza The same book quotes further from the Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: My investigations led to the result that the legal relations as well as forms of the state are to be grasped neither from themselves nor from the so‑called-general development of the human mind, but rather have their roots in the material conditions of life ....the anatomy of civil society is to be sought in political economy. 17 Marx, in his book The Poverty of Philosophy, has written: Social relations are closely bound up with productive forces. In acquiring new productive forces, men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their living, they change all their social relations. The hand mill gives you a society with the feudal lord; the steam‑mill, a society with the industrial capitalist. 18 The theory of the primacy of material structure of society in relation to other social formations corresponds to the theory of priority of action over thought. The theory of priority of action over thought is applicable to the individual level, and the theory of priority of material aspect over other social aspects is actually based upon the theory of priority of action over thought but at the level of society. Since the advocates of this view also advocate the theory of priority of human sociology over human psychology, hence the priority of individual action over individual thought is a form and result of the theory of priority of material aspect over other social aspects. Contrarily, if human sociology is considered to be prior to human psychology, the priority of material aspect of society over its other aspects would be considered as the effect and result of the priority of individual action over individual thought.","output":"No mesmo livro, é citado também um trecho do prefácio para \\"Uma Contribuição à Crítica da Economia Política\\": \\"Minhas investigações chegaram à conclusão de que as relações jurídicas, assim como as formas do Estado, não devem ser compreendidas por si mesmas nem pelo chamado desenvolvimento geral da mente humana, mas sim têm suas raízes nas condições materiais de vida... a anatomia da sociedade civil deve ser buscada na economia política.\\" Marx, em seu livro \\"A Miséria da Filosofia\\", escreveu: \\"As relações sociais estão intimamente ligadas às forças produtivas.

Special attention should be paid to an important point fully expli­cit in the writings of the founders of historical materialism that the base itself is two‑tiered; a part of it acts as the base for the other part, which is built upon it. The basis, the real foundation at the bottom of the structure consists of the tools of production, i.e. the physical labour materialized. It is the physical labour which creates and posits particular economic relations according to the distribution of wealth. These relations, which reflect the degree of the development of the tools of production, are not only in harmony with the tools of production, but are also considered to be their incentive and motivating force. It means that the specific economic relations in a society are the means of deriving the greatest benefit from the tools of production. They are like a garment tailored to fit the body, i.e. the means of production.","output":"O aspecto material da sociedade, que também pode ser denominado de estrutura econômica ou base econômica, consiste em dois elementos: em primeiro lugar, as ferramentas de produção, que são o produto da relação do homem com a natureza; e, em segundo lugar, as relações econômicas dos membros da sociedade com base na distribuição da riqueza, que às vezes são denominadas como \\"relações de produção\\". Frequentemente, ambos são referidos como \\"os meios de produção\\" ou \\"o modo de produção\\". Deve-se notar que esses termos usados pelos fundadores do materialismo histórico não estão isentos de ambiguidade e não são bem definidos e específicos. Quando eles afirmam que a economia é a base e o aspecto material da sociedade é prioridade em relação a outros aspectos sociais, eles se referem ao sistema de produção como um todo, mas geralmente se referem às ferramentas de produção e relações de produção. Deve-se prestar atenção especial a um ponto importante totalmente explicado nos escritos dos fundadores do materialismo histórico: a base em si é de dois níveis; uma parte dela age como a base para a outra parte, que é construída sobre ela. A base, a verdadeira fundação na parte inferior da estrutura, consiste das ferramentas de produção, ou seja, do trabalho físico materializado. É o trabalho físico que cria e estabelece relações econômicas específicas de acordo com a distribuição da riqueza. Essas relações, que refletem o grau de desenvolvimento das ferramentas de produção, não estão apenas em harmonia com as ferramentas de produção, mas também são consideradas como seu incentivo e força motriz. Isso significa que as relações econômicas específicas em uma sociedade são os meios de obter o maior benefício das ferramentas de produção.

Tahap Kecanduan: Merupakan tahap terakhir dari penyalahgunaan NAPZA. Pada tahap ini, seseorang kehilangan kendali penuh atas penggunaan NAPZA dan sangat sulit untuk berhenti. Kecanduan NAPZA dapat menyebabkan kerusakan serius pada kesehatan fisik, mental, sosial, dan ekonomi individu. Seseorang mungkin juga mengalami perubahan dalam kepribadian, impulsif, dan depresi. Penting untuk dicatat bahwa tidak semua individu yang mengkonsumsi NAPZA akan mengalami tahapan-tahapan ini atau berlanjut hingga tahap kecanduan. Setiap kasus penyalahgunaan NAPZA bersifat individual, dan faktor-faktor seperti keadaan sosial, lingkungan, genetik, dan faktor psikologis dapat mempengaruhi jalannya proses penyalahgunaan NAPZA."},{"instruction":"Bibliografía La percepción de seguridad y la realidad social).","output":"- Valente, T.

Meanwhile, Raku, in Chitoge's body, wakes up in her luxurious mansion with high-class decorations. He is astonished by the grandeur and the strict butler keeping an eye on him. Raku attempts to adapt to Chitoge's posh lifestyle but finds it overwhelming and struggles to fit into her elegant attire. As the day progresses, Chitoge, now in Raku's body, experiences firsthand the difficulties he faces as a regular student. She witnesses Raku's interactions with their classmates, who have mixed opinions about him, and learns about his responsibilities as a member of the student council. Despite mocking Raku's dedication previously, Chitoge gains a newfound respect for him. On the other hand, Raku, in Chitoge's body, has to handle her daily routines and her role as the daughter of a notorious gang leader. He attends a high-class social gathering with various influential figures, experiencing the expectations put upon Chitoge. Raku realizes the pressure Chitoge constantly faces, leading him to understand her actions on a deeper level. Throughout the day, Chitoge and Raku, while struggling to navigate their swapped lives, occasionally bump into each other, adding moments of comedic relief. Their encounters soften their hearts, allowing them to see the situation from each other's perspective and appreciating things they had previously taken for granted. In a heart-to-heart conversation late in the day, Chitoge and Raku express their newfound understanding and begin to feel remorse for their argument. They realize that despite their differences, they have a lot to learn from one another. They promise to resolve their conflicts and appreciate the positive qualities they both possess. As the day comes to an end, the bodies of Chitoge and Raku suddenly return to their original forms. With their ill-tempered arguments behind them, both Chitoge and Raku find a newfound understanding and appreciation for each other. They decide to put their differences aside, vowing to communicate better and strengthen their relationship. The episode concludes with a heartwarming scene where Chitoge and Raku, now reconciled, share a genuine smile, showcasing their growth and the importance of empathy and understanding in their relationship."},{"instruction":"traduza But the tools of production in themselves are subject to development. Any change in the tools of production can disturb the harmony between the two constituent parts of the system of production. The productive and economic relations, i.e. those laws which were evolved to suit the earlier tools of production, become outdated in the same manner as a child's dress does not fit the fully grown‑up man, and hinders his free movement. Similarly the primitive tools do not suit a more developed society and obstruct its growth by creating contradiction between the two tiers of production structure. The new tools of production are inevitably estab­lished and the base, i.e. the economic structure of society, is totally transformed and, in consequence of this change, the legal, moral, philosophical, and religious superstructure is also overthrown. Keeping in mind the primacy of collective labour, i.e. labour materialized which is represented by the tools of production, and also considering the fact that Marx is one of those sociologists who regard sociology as being prior to psychology, who also considers man qua man as a social being or in his own words “sui generic”, the philo­sophical role of labour according to Marxism‑which is the essence of the Marxist philosophy and to which little attention has been paid­ becomes clear. Marx gives the same importance to human labour in the context of human existence that Descartes gives to the rational being of man, Bergson to the dynamic aspect of human existence, and Jean Paul Sartre to man's feeling of guilt. Descartes says, “I think, therefore I am” (Cogito ergo sum). Bergson says, “I have continuity, therefore I exist.” Sartre says, “I feel‑guilty, therefore I exist.” Marx would have said, “I work, therefore I exist.”","output":"Mas as ferramentas de produção em si estão sujeitas a desenvolvimento. Qualquer mudança nas ferramentas de produção pode perturbar a harmonia entre as duas partes constituintes do sistema de produção.

Da mesma forma, as ferramentas primitivas não se adequam a uma sociedade mais desenvolvida e obstruem seu crescimento ao criar contradições entre os dois níveis da estrutura de produção. As novas ferramentas de produção são inevitavelmente estabelecidas e a base, ou seja, a estrutura econômica da sociedade, é totalmente transformada e, consequentemente, a superestrutura legal, moral, filosófica e religiosa também é derrubada. Tendo em mente a primazia do trabalho coletivo, ou seja, do trabalho materializado que é representado pelas ferramentas de produção, e também considerando o fato de que Marx é um dos sociólogos que considera a sociologia como sendo anterior à psicologia, que também considera o homem enquanto ser social ou nas suas próprias palavras \\"sui generis\\", o papel filosófico do trabalho de acordo com o marxismo - que é a essência da filosofia marxista e a qual pouca atenção tem sido dada - torna-se claro. Marx dá a mesma importância ao trabalho humano no contexto da existência humana que Descartes dá ao ser racional do homem, Bergson ao aspecto dinâmico da existência humana e Jean Paul Sartre ao sentimento de culpa do homem.

For instance, Descartes intends to say, “My existence is synonymous with the existence of my thought; eliminate thought, and I am nothing.” Bergson intends to say, “Human existence is identical with continuity and time (duration).” Sartre also intends to say that “man's essence and actuality of his existence lies in the sense of guilt; take away guilt from human nature, and man is nothing.” Marx also in his turn intends to say, “The whole of man's existence and his actual being is work. Work is the essence of humanity; I labour, there­fore I am. It is not in this sense that work is the proof of the existence of my self, but in the sense that work itself is identical with the existence of my self; work is my actual existence.” Marx says, “For a socialist person the entire so‑called history of the world is nothing but begetting of man through human labour.”21 He distinguishes human consciousness from man's real existence, and says, “It is not the consciousness of man that determines his being, but his social being that determines his consciousness. “'22","output":"Além desses diversos modos de existência (pensamento, continuidade, culpa etc.), nenhum desses pensadores tenta posicionar a existência humana ou o \\"ego\\" em termos absolutos.

Além disso, cada um deles quer definir a essência do homem e a realidade da existência humana apenas nesses termos.

Bergson pretende dizer: \\"A existência humana é idêntica à continuidade e ao tempo (duração)\\". Sartre também pretende dizer que \\"a essência do homem e a atualidade de sua existência estão no sentimento de culpa; tire a culpa da natureza humana e o homem não é nada\\". Marx também, por sua vez, pretende dizer: \\"A totalidade da existência do homem e seu ser atual é o trabalho. O trabalho é a essência da humanidade; eu trabalho, portanto eu sou. Não é nesse sentido que o trabalho é a prova da existência do meu eu, mas no sentido de que o trabalho em si é idêntico à existência do meu eu; o trabalho é minha existência atual\\". Marx diz: \\"Para uma pessoa socialista, toda a chamada história do mundo não passa de geração do homem por meio do trabalho humano\\".

He explains the term “real individual” in the following words: “But the real individuals act not according to the whims which cross their imagination... but according to what they materially produce and make; i.e. they act on the basis of definite material conditions and certain limitations‑ conditions which are independent of their will.” 23","output":"Ele ainda diz que as premissas com as quais começamos não são arbitrárias ou absolutas, mas são derivadas de indivíduos reais, suas ações e das condições materiais de existência.

It is the prime basic condition for all human existence, and this is true to such an extent that, in a way, we should say that it is labour which has created man himself.”24 All these extracts from the writings of the founders of Marxism indicate their emphasis on the role of labour. However, Marx and Engels have borrowed this idea regarding the role of labour from Hegel, who said, “The real being of man, in the first instance, is his action.” 25 Hence, according to Marxism, existence of man is primarily social and not individual. Secondly, the social existence of man is synony­mous with his materialized labour, i.e. collective labour. All individual modes like feelings and emotions, or all social modes such as morality, philosophy, art, religion etc. are only expressions and manifestations of man's real being; they are not identical with his being itself: According­ly, the actual evolution of man is identical with the development of collective labour. But intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development or evolution of the social system is only a manifestation and reflec­tion of the real development and not the development itself. The mater­ial development of a society is the criterion of its intellectual develop­ment. As action is the criterion for judging thought, truth or falsity of an idea is also judged through action and not by intellectual or logical standards. In the same way, the measure of intellectual development also is material development. Hence, if the question arises as to which school of philosophy, morality, religion or art is more progressive, the intellectual and logical standards cannot provide the answer to this question. The only criterion should be to see what are the conditions of which that particular school of thought is the product and manifesta­tion, and at which stage of development of social labour or tools of production it has emerged.","output":"Engels diz: \\"O trabalho é a fonte de toda a riqueza, afirmam os economistas políticos... mas ele é infinitamente mais do que isso. Ele é a condição básica primária de toda a existência humana, e isso é verdade a tal ponto que, de certa forma, poderíamos dizer que é o trabalho que criou o próprio homem\\". Todas essas citações dos escritos dos fundadores do marxismo indicam sua ênfase no papel do trabalho. No entanto, Marx e Engels têm emprestado essa ideia sobre o papel do trabalho de Hegel, que disse: \\"O verdadeiro ser do homem, em primeiro lugar, é sua ação\\". Portanto, de acordo com o marxismo, a existência do homem é primordialmente social e não individual. Em segundo lugar, a existência social do homem é sinônimo de seu trabalho materializado, ou seja, trabalho coletivo. Todos os modos individuais, como sentimentos e emoções, ou todos os modos sociais, como moralidade, filosofia, arte, religião etc., são apenas expressões e manifestações do verdadeiro ser do homem; eles não são idênticos ao próprio ser dele: Consequentemente, a evolução real do homem é idêntica ao desenvolvimento do trabalho coletivo. Mas o desenvolvimento intelectual, emocional e espiritual do sistema social é apenas uma manifestação e reflexão do desenvolvimento real e não o próprio desenvolvimento. O desenvolvimento material de uma sociedade é o critério de seu desenvolvimento intelectual. Assim como a ação é o critério para julgar o pensamento, a verdade ou falsidade de uma ideia também é julgada por meio da ação e não por padrões intelectuais ou lógicos. Da mesma forma, a medida do desenvolvimento intelectual também é o desenvolvimento material. Portanto, se a questão surge sobre qual escola de filosofia, moralidade, religião ou arte é mais progressiva, os padrões intelectuais e lógicos não podem fornecer a resposta para essa pergunta. O único critério deve ser observar quais são as condições das quais aquela escola de pensamento em particular é produto e manifestação, e em qual estágio de desenvolvimento do trabalho social ou das ferramentas de produção ela surgiu."},{"instruction":"traduza This type of thinking is, of course, very strange to people like us who consider the real existence of man as his own \`self' and this \`self,' too, an immaterial substance and a product of mutational movements of nature and not the product of society. But for one like Marx, who thinks in material terms and does not believe in the immaterial sub­stance, is bound to interpret the essence of man and his a6tuality from a biological point of view, and say that the essence of man is identical with the physical constitution of his body, as the ancient materialists, like the materialists of the eighteenth century, believed. But Marx has rejected the mechanistic view of life and has claimed that the being of man is grounded in society not in nature. Whatever has been formed by nature is the potential human being, not the actual one. Furthermore, either Marx should regard thought as the essence of humanity, and work as the manifestation and expression of thought or, on the con­trary; he should consider labour as the essence of humanity and thought as the manifestation and expression of labour. Marx, being a materialist, not only does approve of the primacy of matter in the individual, but also rejects the idea of any supra material essence besides the individual's material existence. In the context of society and history also, he accedes to the priority of matter. As a result he has to adopt the second alternative. Here a basic difference between the point of view of Marx and that of other materialists concerning the nature of history comes to light. Every materialist, since he considers man and other manifesta­tions of his existence as material, inevitably tends to regard history also as materialistic. But what Marx says is more than this. Marx tries to say that history is essentially economic in character, and in economics, too, the economic relations of production occupy the most important place. Since he considers the economic and production relations, i.e. the relation of workers with the products of their labour, as essential and necessary, derived from the stage of development of the tools of pro­duction, Marx's viewpoint is‑ that history is determined by the tools or instruments of production.","output":"Esse tipo de pensamento, é claro, é muito estranho para pessoas como nós que consideram a existência real do homem como seu próprio \\"eu\\" e esse \\"eu\\", também uma substância imaterial e um produto de movimentos mutacionais da natureza e não um produto da sociedade.

Mas Marx rejeitou a visão mecanicista da vida e afirmou que o ser do homem está fundamentado na sociedade, não na natureza. Tudo o que foi formado pela natureza é o ser humano potencial, não o atual. Além disso, Marx deveria considerar o pensamento como a essência da humanidade, e o trabalho como a manifestação e expressão do pensamento, ou, ao contrário, deveria considerar o trabalho como a essência da humanidade e o pensamento como a manifestação e expressão do trabalho.

No contexto da sociedade e da história, ele também concede prioridade à matéria. Como resultado, ele precisa adotar a segunda alternativa. Aqui, uma diferença básica entre o ponto de vista de Marx e o dos outros materialistas em relação à natureza da história vem à tona. Todo materialista, uma vez que considera o homem e outras manifestações de sua existência como materiais, inevitavelmente tende a ver a história também como materialista. Mas o que Marx diz é mais do que isso. Marx tenta dizer que a história é essencialmente caracterizada pela economia, e na economia, as relações econômicas de produção ocupam o lugar mais importante.

Beberapa kemungkinan faktor yang dapat menjelaskan mengapa gejala bisa mereda setelah pasien minum alkohol adalah: 1. Efek menenangkan: Alkohol memiliki sifat depresan yang dapat menenangkan sistem saraf pusat. Akibatnya, pasien mungkin merasa lebih tenang dan gejala yang dialaminya menjadi lebih ringan. Misalnya, seseorang dengan gangguan kecemasan mungkin merasa lebih santai setelah minum alkohol. 2. Penekanan gejala: Alkohol dapat menekan gejala fisik dan emosional yang dialami seseorang. Ini dapat mencakup berkurangnya rasa sakit, penurunan kecemasan, atau mengurangi perasaan depresi. 3. Perubahan persepsi: Alkohol dapat mengubah persepsi seseorang terhadap gejala yang dialaminya. Misalnya, pasien dengan masalah tidur mungkin merasa lebih baik setelah minum alkohol karena alkohol dapat mempengaruhi pola tidur dan memperbaiki kualitas tidur. Namun, sangat penting untuk diingat bahwa minum alkohol untuk meredakan gejala bukanlah solusi yang baik atau sehat. Alkohol adalah zat adiktif yang dapat menyebabkan masalah kesehatan jangka panjang yang serius dan dapat memperburuk gejala yang mendasari.

数据传递方式：\`uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo\`是一种无阻塞的传递机制，即生产者在写入数据时不会被阻塞，而消费者在读取数据时也不会被阻塞。因此，它适用于将数据传递给其他组件进行分析和监控。\`uvm_tlm_fifo\`是一种传统的阻塞队列机制，当FIFO已满时，生产者在写入数据时会被阻塞，当FIFO为空时，消费者在读取数据时会被阻塞。 3. 处理方式：\`uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo\`中的数据是通过callback函数进行处理的，当FIFO有新数据可用时，UVM会调用已注册的callback函数进行处理。\`uvm_tlm_fifo\`中的数据则通过函数调用进行处理，生产者可以直接调用FIFO提供的函数接口进行数据的读写和处理。 综上所述，\`uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo\`适用于数据的一次性传递和分析，而\`uvm_tlm_fifo\`适用于数据的存储和交互，可以进行多次读写操作。选择使用哪种FIFO机制取决于具体的设计需求和数据处理方式。"},{"instruction":"check if soundcloud widget isPaused","output":"To check if the

FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"traduza Merely to say that history is materialistic in nature, or to say that history is economic in nature, is not enough to define the Marxian viewpoint. We should notice that according to Marx the essence and nature of history is “instrumentalist.” I, in some of my works,26 have termed Marx's historical materialism as an “instru­mentalist theory,” which is opposed to my own “humanistic theory” of history. Actually, the manner in which Marx is absorbed in his philosophy of labour and conceives the idea of \`social labour,' shows that human beings as he conceives them are not the same as those who walk in the streets and think and resolve, but as if they are, in fact, like tools and machines in factories. Human beings who walk, talk, and think are seen as images of the \`real' human beings conceived by Marx. Marx's view of social labour and tools of production seems to advance a view according to which man is a being who acts blindly and mechanically without any resolution and will. He is merely a shadow of man, not man himself, whose development and progress is determined strictly externally and who has no will or purpose of his own, and is forced to follow a predetermined path blindly. It may be said that whatever Marx has said regarding the priority of collective labour over the conscious mind and human will sounds to be quite similar to the views expressed by some of the religious thinkers about the unconscious functionings of human organs, such as the functioning of digestive system, heart, liver etc., which are consi­dered to operate under the influence of a hidden single will. According to these thinkers, desires, wishes, 'oughts' and \`ought nots,' and consequently the matters which are related to the practical aspect of the mind, i.e. the lower, functional, and physiological sides of the human self, which appear on the surface of the conscious mind and without its knowing their origin, are reflections of a series of compulsive natural needs originating from the subconscious. It is similar to what has been termed by Freud as the subconscious or the unconscious, which dominates the conscious mind. The views of those ancient thinkers and that of Freud, however, relate to a part of the conscious mind and to the influence of a con­cealed consciousness. Besides, whatever they talk about is not external to human existence; but what Marx says is external to human existence. Careful observation shows that Marx's theory is quite astonishing from the philosophical point of view. Marx compares his own discovery with the well‑known biological discovery of Darwin. Darwin has proved that a process quite external to the animal's will and consciousness gradually and unconsciously causes biological changes in the course of time. Marx also claims that a blind process (identical with the real existence of man) gradually and unconsciously causes the formation of the social structure, i.e. all the things named by Marx as superstructure, and even a part of the base also, i.e. the socio‑economic relations.","output":"Simply dizer que a história é materialista por natureza, ou dizer que a história é econômica por natureza, não é suficiente para definir o ponto de vista marxiano. Devemos observar que, de acordo com Marx, a essência e a natureza da história são \\"instrumentalistas\\". Em algumas de minhas obras, eu denominei o materialismo histórico de Marx como uma \\"teoria instrumentalista\\", que é oposta à minha própria \\"teoria humanista\\" da história. Na verdade, a maneira como Marx está imerso em sua filosofia do trabalho e concebe a ideia de \\"trabalho social\\" mostra que os seres humanos, conforme ele os concebe, não são os mesmos que caminham pelas ruas e pensam e resolvem, mas sim como se fossem, de fato, ferramentas e máquinas em fábricas. Os seres humanos que caminham, falam e pensam são vistos como imagens dos seres humanos \\"reais\\" concebidos por Marx. A visão de Marx sobre o trabalho social e as ferramentas de produção parece avançar uma visão segundo a qual o homem é um ser que age cegamente e mecanicamente, sem nenhuma resolução ou vontade. Ele é apenas uma sombra do homem, não o próprio homem, cujo desenvolvimento e progresso são estritamente determinados externamente e que não tem vontade ou propósito próprios, sendo forçado a seguir um caminho predeterminado às cegas. Pode-se dizer que tudo o que Marx disse sobre a prioridade do trabalho coletivo sobre a mente consciente e a vontade humana soa bastante similar às opiniões expressas por alguns pensadores religiosos sobre os funcionamentos inconscientes dos órgãos humanos, como o funcionamento do sistema digestivo, coração, fígado etc., que são considerados operar sob a influência de uma única vontade oculta. De acordo com esses pensadores, desejos, vontades, \\"deverias\\" e \\"não deverias\\", e consequentemente os assuntos relacionados ao aspecto prático da mente, ou seja, os lados inferior, funcional e fisiológico do ser humano, que aparecem na superfície da mente consciente e sem que ela conheça sua origem, são reflexos de uma série de necessidades naturais compulsivas originadas do subconsciente. Isso é semelhante ao que foi chamado por Freud de subconsciente ou inconsciente, que domina a mente consciente. As visões desses antigos pensadores e as de Freud, no entanto, se referem a uma parte da mente consciente e à influência de uma consciência oculta. Além disso, tudo o que eles falam não é externo à existência humana; mas o que Marx diz é externo à existência humana. Uma observação cuidadosa mostra que a teoria de Marx é bastante surpreendente do ponto de vista filosófico. Marx compara sua própria descoberta com a conhecida descoberta biológica de Darwin. Darwin provou que um processo completamente externo à vontade e à consciência do animal causa gradual e inconscientemente mudanças biológicas ao longo do tempo. Marx também afirma que um processo cego (identificado com a existência real do homem) causa gradual e inconscientemente a formação da estrutura social, ou seja, todas as coisas denominadas por Marx como superestrutura e até mesmo uma parte da base também, ou seja, as relações socioeconômicas."},{"instruction":"traduza He says, “Darwin has called the attention of scientists towards the history of natural selection, the formation of organs in plants and animals corresponding to the means of production necessary for their survival.

While my Naruto character is known for his battles and intense fights, I too believe in the power of friendship, understanding, and finding peaceful solutions."},{"instruction":"阅读一下代码并进行完善，要求用户在网页中得分一栏中可以输入数字，输入完毕后绩点一栏下面自动出现对应的绩点：<!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\"> <title>无标题文档</title> <link href=\\"myStyles.css\\" rel=\\"stylesheet\\" type=\\"text/css\\"> </head> <body> <h1>特色化示范性软件学院(试验班)教学计划</h1> <button class=\\"accordion\\">2022-2023学年 第一学期</button> <div class=\\"panel\\"> <table width=\\"1595\\" border=\\"1\\"> <tbody> <tr> <th width=\\"301\\" scope=\\"col\\">课程名称</th> <th width=\\"172\\" scope=\\"col\\">学分</th> <th width=\\"382\\" scope=\\"col\\">参考教材</th> <th width=\\"270\\" scope=\\"col\\">得分</th> <th width=\\"436\\" scope=\\"col\\">绩点</th> </tr> <tr> <td>自然科学导引</td> <td>2</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/u=4027674499,1986371212&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>思想道德与法治</td> <td>3</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/u=1527279609,972791858&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=PNG.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>形势与政策</td> <td>0.5</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>体育</td> <td>0.5</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>大学英语</td> <td>1.5</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/u=1272951287,3636485637&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>高等数学A1</td> <td>6</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/a73b45b7cc77aa8827385593832895e0.jpg\\" width=\\"800\\" height=\\"800\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>程序设计</td> <td>4</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/下载 (1).jpg\\" width=\\"348\\" height=\\"499\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>专业导论</td> <td>1</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>军事理论与技能</td> <td>4</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <button class=\\"accordion\\">2022-2023学年第二学期</button> <div class=\\"panel\\"> <table width=\\"1613\\" border=\\"1\\"> <tbody> <tr> <th width=\\"301\\" scope=\\"col\\">课程名称</th> <th width=\\"172\\" scope=\\"col\\">学分</th> <th width=\\"382\\" scope=\\"col\\">参考教材</th> <th width=\\"270\\" scope=\\"col\\">得分</th> <th width=\\"454\\" scope=\\"col\\">绩点</th> </tr> <tr> <td>人文社科导引</td> <td>2</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/下载.jpg\\" width=\\"359\\" height=\\"499\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>马克思主义基本原理</td> <td>3</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/u=1918858133,2268544293&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>中国近现代史纲要</td> <td>3</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/u=1775126392,2082583838&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>形势与政策</td> <td>0.5</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>体育</td> <td>0.5</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>大学英语</td> <td>1.5</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>大学生心理健康</td> <td>2</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>高等数学A2</td> <td>6</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/.jpeg\\" width=\\"500\\" height=\\"500\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>线性代数A</td> <td>3</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/u=1665676147,639385142&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>离散数学</td> <td>4</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/f9144da186a132ef51112ebfa8925434.jpg\\" width=\\"800\\" height=\\"800\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>遥感原理与应用</td> <td>2.5</td> <td><img src=\\"../Desktop/BP/image/38be83ff15039adc2513f777eda14b37.jpg\\" width=\\"800\\" height=\\"1132\\" alt=\\"\\"/></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>大学物理B</td> <td>3.5</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <script> var acc = document.getElementsByClassName(\\"accordion\\");

He longed for the kind of blissful romance depicted on those colorful pages, but he couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. As a young man, he knew that he could never truly experience the love that Yuri manga conveyed. Unbeknownst to Mark, a small figure had been observing him from a nearby table. The petite woman wore intricate robes, her eyes sparkling with a mischievous twinkle. She was a witch, known for her unique ability to sense people's hidden desires and bring whimsical solutions to their lives. Intrigued by Mark's profound yearning, the witch decided to approach him. As she walked over, her presence caught the attention of a few curious heads in the cafe. \\"Excuse me, sir,\\" the witch spoke softly, her voice carrying a hint of enchantment. Mark looked up, surprised to see a mysterious woman before him. \\"Yes? Can I help you?\\" he replied, a mixture of curiosity and confusion filling his voice. \\"I couldn't help but notice the longing in your eyes as you read those yuri manga,\\" she said, her voice resonating with genuine compassion. \\"It seems like you wish to experience that kind of love for yourself.\\" Mark's eyes widened in disbelief. How could this stranger know so much about him? \\"Well, yes,\\" he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. \\"But it's not possible for someone like me.\\" The witch smiled warmly, her face emanating a gentle aura. \\"You'd be surprised by the powers of magic,\\" she replied, her voice filled with certainty. \\"I can grant you the chance to experience a love like that, if you're willing to trust me.\\" Mark hesitated, his doubts and fears engulfing his heart. But deep down, he knew that this was an opportunity he couldn't let slip away. With a flicker of determination in his eyes, he nodded towards the witch. \\"Alright, I trust you,\\" Mark said, a mix of excitement and trepidation coursing through his veins. Without uttering another word, the witch raised her hands, and a soft, iridescent glow surrounded them. Mark felt a gentle breeze brush against his skin, and he closed his eyes, letting the magic take hold. When he opened them again, Mark found himself standing in front of his apartment door. He glanced down at his hands, only to realize they were no longer his own. They were slender, delicate, and feminine. In that moment, he realized that the witch had transformed him into a young woman. Overwhelmed by a mix of emotions, Mark - now called Mia - stepped forward hesitantly into her new life. She discovered the joy of walking hand in hand with another girl, of feeling her heart race as they exchanged shy glances. It was a world where she was not restricted by societal expectations, where love transcended boundaries and genders. But as Mia reveled in her newfound happiness, she couldn't ignore the lingering feeling that something was missing. The witch had allowed Mia to experience love, but it felt incomplete without her true self. It was as if her heart yearned for something beyond the notion of yuri. With this realization, Mia sought out the witch once more, pleading her to restore her original form. The witch, understanding Mia's predicament, agreed without hesitation. Back in the manga cafe, Mark found himself sitting once again, with his heart brimming full of emotions. Although he couldn't live out the love stories depicted in yuri manga, he had gained a valuable appreciation for love in all its forms. Rather than being disheartened, he learned to cherish the beauty of those tales as a way to understand and empathize with others. From that day forward, Mark became an advocate for love in all its forms, spreading awareness and acceptance wherever he went. And though he couldn't personally experience yuri love, he realized that love itself was boundless and transcendent, surpassing all limitations and barriers. So, with a renewed sense of purpose and an open heart, Mark continued to embrace the world of yuri manga, appreciating its enchantment while advocating for greater inclusion, understanding, and, most importantly, love."},{"instruction":"","output":"There are several ways you can improve your athletic performance in basketball.

Replace \\"range\\" with the range of positive values you want to measure the upside capture ratio for. For example, if you have a column of monthly returns in column A, you can use A:A as the range. 2. Replace \\"reference\\" with the range of benchmark or reference values you want to compare to. For example, if you have a column of benchmark returns in column B, you can use B:B as the reference range. 3. The IF function checks if each value in the specified range is greater than zero (positive). It returns an array of the positive values. 4. The AVERAGE function calculates the average of the positive values in the range. 5. The same steps are applied to the reference range to calculate the average of the positive benchmark returns. 6. The average of the positive returns in the range is divided by the average of the positive benchmark returns and then multiplied by 100 to get the upside capture ratio. Make sure to enter the formula as an array formula by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter after typing it, so that it applies to the entire range of values in the columns.

Вот некоторые идеи для концепт-арта по архитектуре постсоветского города будущего в стиле эко-брутализма: 1. Многоуровневые здания с необычными формами и геометрическими отверстиями, помещенными на разных уровнях, чтобы создать визуальную глубину и играть со светом и тенями. 2. Большие фасадные окна и остекленные стены, позволяющие максимально использовать естественное освещение и обеспечить прекрасный вид на окружающие пейзажи. 3. Зеленые крыши с различными типами растительности и садами, чтобы создать эффект стремления к природе и способствовать снижению воздействия городского тепла. 4. Открытые арт-инсталляции и скульптуры, размещенные вокруг города, чтобы подчеркнуть его культурное наследие и природные особенности. 5. Игра текстур и материалов: сочетание грубых и гладких поверхностей, комбинация бетона и дерева, кирпича и стекла для создания интересного визуального впечатления. 6. Экологические элементы внешнего декора, такие как вертикальные сады на стенах зданий, водные фонтаны и водопады, а также установки солнечной энергии и ветрогенераторов в качестве скульптурных объектов. 7. Уникальные цветовые решения: использование ярких и нестандартных цветов на фасадах зданий, чтобы создать контраст с окружающей средой и придать городу яркость и характер. 8. Интеграция технологических элементов: использование LED-экранов, интерактивных дисплеев и других современных технологий для создания динамических и изменяемых зрелищных эффектов. 9. Уникальные архитектурные ориентиры, такие как висящие сады, амфитеатры, мосты и пешеходные мостки, которые не только функциональны, но и создают впечатление идейной смелости и экспериментальности. 10. Игра с масштабом: создание огромных и впечатляющих архитектурных структур, которые могут стать иконами города и привлекать туристов и любителей архитектуры со всего мира. Учтите, что концепт-арт - это форма выражения и эксперимента, поэтому освободите свою фантазию и позвольте себе быть творческим при разработке внешнего вида."},{"instruction":"основные принципы брутализма","output":"Брутализм - это архитектурное направление, которое стало общепринятым в послевоенной Европе, включая СССР. Основные принципы брутализма включают: 1. Выражение конструктивности: Брутализм стремится открыто отобразить конструкцию здания, обнажая материалы, такие как бетон и сталь. Отсутствие оформления и декора в пользу чистого и прямого выражения конструкции. 2. Грубость и массивность: Брутализм использует массивные формы и геометрические объемы для создания впечатления тяжести и прочности. Здания могут выглядеть массивными и даже грубыми, с необработанными поверхностями и грубыми текстурами. 3. Функциональность: Брутализм придает большое значение функциональности. Здания должны четко отражать свое предназначение, выставлять наружу различные функциональные элементы и обеспечивать пространство, отвечающее нуждам пользователей. 4. Честность и открытость: Брутализм ставит целью отразить и открыто показывать внутренние системы и инфраструктуру здания. Внутренние элементы, такие как лестницы, вентиляционные каналы, кабели и т.д., могут оставаться видимыми, позволяя людям видеть, как здание \\"работает\\". 5. Завершенность и прочность: Здания брутализма стремятся создать впечатление прочности и незыблемости через использование тяжелых материалов, таких как бетон, и прочных структур. Они часто имеют монолитный и законченный вид. 6. Свет и тень: Бруталистические здания создают впечатление глубины, играя с светом и тенью, скульптурными формами и геометрией. Отверстия в стенах могут быть нестандартными и создавать уникальные световые эффекты. Эти принципы помогут вам создать характерный бруталистический стиль при разработке концепт-артов архитектуры постсоветского города будущего."},{"instruction":"основные принципы киберпанка","output":"Киберпанк - это научно-фантастический жанр, который описывает будущество, где технологии и киберпространство стали неотъемлемой частью человеческой жизни. Вот некоторые основные принципы киберпанка: 1. Технологический прогресс и киберпространство: Центральным элементом киберпанка является высокий уровень технологического развития, включая компьютеры, киберпротезы, искусственный интеллект и виртуальную реальность. Киберпространство, интернет и цифровые миры играют важную роль в повседневной жизни персонажей. 2. Городской хаос и техно-неоновая эстетика: Мир киберпанка часто представляет себе города, переполненные людьми, рекламой, высокими небоскребами, информационными щитами и неоновыми вывесками. Эстетика киберпанка часто сочетает в себе современные и футуристические элементы, создавая атмосферу хаоса и технологического прогресса. 3. Противостояние корпоративной власти: Киберпанк часто отражает мир, полностью контролируемый и ограниченный корпорациями, которые обладают огромной властью и влиянием. Герои киберпанка, обычно преступники, хакеры или сопротивление, выступают против корпоративной тирании. 4. Трансгуманизм и киберпротезы: Концепция трансгуманизма, объединяющая человека и технологию, является неразрывной частью киберпанка. Множество персонажей имеют киберпротезы, биоимпланты и искусственные улучшения для улучшения своих способностей. 5. Социальные неравенства и угнетение: Киберпанк обычно изображает общество с высокой социальной неравноправностью, где корпорации и правительство контролируют и угнетают слабых и малообеспеченных. Герои киберпанка часто сражаются с этими неравенствами и борются за свободу и справедливость. 6. Нестабильное будущее и потенциал технологий: В киберпанке будущее представлено как нестабильное, с множеством угроз и потенциалом технологий. Вместе с высоким уровнем технологического развития существуют и опасности, такие как киберпреступность, нарушение приватности и контроль над личностью. Эти принципы киберпанка помогут вам создать характерный стиль при разработке концептуального искусства и архитектуры, связанных с этим жанром."},{"instruction":"основные отличительные черты киберпанк архитектуры","output":"Киберпанк-архитектура обычно имеет ряд отличительных черт, которые помогают создать уникальную атмосферу будущего, где технологии становятся неотъемлемой частью городской среды.

Frustrated, Chitoge accidentally drops a mysterious pendant she received from her mother, while Raku storms off. The pendant emits a bright light upon hitting the ground, and both Chitoge and Raku black out simultaneously. Act 2: Chitoge and Raku wake up the next morning, only to realize that they have switched bodies – Chitoge is now in Raku's body, and vice versa. Shocked and bewildered, they must navigate their new reality without raising too much suspicion among their friends and classmates. Act 3: Chitoge, in Raku's body, decides to attend school as usual, accompanied by Chitoge, now in Raku's body. Their close friends, Shu, Kosaki, and Seishirou, immediately notice something strange but mistake it for an elaborate prank. Chitoge (in Raku's body) takes this as an opportunity to understand Raku's perspective better. Act 4: Throughout the day, Chitoge (in Raku's body) struggles to adapt to Raku's introverted nature, accidentally causing misunderstandings with her straightforward approach. On the other hand, Raku (in Chitoge's body) experiences the challenges of being in a highly energetic and assertive body, struggling to keep up with Chitoge's daily routine. Act 5: During lunch break, Chitoge (in Raku's body) secretly meets Raku (in Chitoge's body) to discuss how they can switch back. They realize that it might be connected to the pendant, which they left in Chitoge's room before the switch occurred. They decide to retrieve it after school. Act 6: After school, Chitoge (in Raku's body) and Raku (in Chitoge's body) search for the pendant in Chitoge's room. While looking through her belongings, they stumble upon her diary. Curiosity gets the better of them, and they start reading about each other's thoughts and feelings, gaining a deeper understanding of their hidden emotions. Act 7: As Chitoge (in Raku's body) contemplates the diary entries, she realizes the depth of Raku's feelings for her. Similarly, Raku (in Chitoge's body) is moved by the sacrifices Chitoge has made for their fake relationship. They both develop a newfound appreciation for one another. Act 8: In a heart-to-heart conversation, Chitoge (in Raku's body) and Raku (in Chitoge's body) reconcile their differences and make amends for their argument earlier. They acknowledge the effect they have on each other's lives and vow to communicate better moving forward. Act 9: However, as the day comes to a close, Chitoge (in Raku's body) and Raku (in Chitoge's body) realize they still haven't found the pendant. In a last-ditch effort, they accidentally trigger the pendant while holding hands, causing a blinding light to engulf them again. Act 10: Chitoge and Raku wake up the next day, relieved to find themselves back in their original bodies. Grateful for the experience, they apologize to each other once more and decide to work on their communication skills and understanding. Their bond grows stronger as they continue their journey together. The episode ends with Chitoge and Raku sharing a genuine laugh, knowing that they can overcome any obstacle as long as they have each other."},{"instruction":"阅读以下代码，我希望点击计算绩点按钮后绩点一栏下面出现对应的绩点，但点击按钮后没有反应，应该怎么改正：<!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\"> <title>无标题文档</title> <link href=\\"myStyles.css\\" rel=\\"stylesheet\\" type=\\"text/css\\"> <script> function calculateGPA() { var score = document.getElementById(“score”).value;

Наконец, мы выводим значения массива массивов байт в консоль. Не забудьте заменить \\"path_to_image.jpg\\" на путь к вашему изображению.
