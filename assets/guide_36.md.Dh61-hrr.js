Depending on the theme you choose, appropriate wedding venues may include Fruit Orchards, Gardens, Vineyards, Beaches, Gazebos, State Parks, Farms, Courtyards, and Campgrounds. - Wedding Dresses. Boho-style wedding dresses will tend toward the nontraditional. There are many styles to choose from that will appropriately represent the Boho style. Consider dresses with lots of lace, backless, bell sleeves, off-the-shoulder, fringe details, and minimal tulle. - Accessories. Boho-style weddings allow for more freedom with accessories. You might consider adding colorful jewelry, a simple veil, a flower crown, a headband, a wide-brimmed hat, or boots or flats. - Men's Attire. Since boho-style weddings are more casual, acceptable men's attire includes dress shirts, khakis, bow ties, waistcoats, hats, suspenders, and pocket watches. - Bouquet. Choose flowers that correspond to your wedding theme. Using twine, lace, or velvet will facilitate the boho style. - Hair and Makeup. Bohemian-style weddings incorporate an effortless beauty that the bride should adopt for her hair and makeup. Light, natural makeup and loose, messy curls and waves are congruent with the Bohemian style. - Decor. Because the Bohemian style is about nature and natural items, incorporate wicker and macrame pieces into your ceremony and celebration. Decorate tables with dried grasses, succulents, cactuses, wildflowers, and berries. Use vintage glassware and dishes, and tie each napkin with lace, twine or velvet. - Color Palettes. Colors inspired by nature are often used in boho-style weddings. Deep golds, soft pastel pinks, and rusty oranges are popular. - Food and Drink. Choose organic meats and cheeses, vintage food trucks, pastries, and home-baked goods to serve. If possible, utilize local brewers or wineries for spirits."},{"instruction":"Create an acrostic poem about working.

Chronological Order Chronological order is a way to organize ideas as a storyteller or writer. It involves dishing out ideas in the precise order of time from first to last. This type of order is used most often in expository writing or narratives that inform or explain something. It is particularly useful when describing an event or a series of events. Consider when you were younger, and you were trying to explain to the principal why you shouldn't be placed in detention. You had to describe the events that led to that problem carefully and in order so that they would understand your point of view. When writing, you do the same thing when you need to help your reader navigate the process and understand the context of the narrative. Some transition words to use when writing in chronological order include first, then, next, last, and finally. 2. Logical Order Logical order is precisely what it sounds like. The framework is used to avoid any confusion for the reader. You will need to organize your ideas in this framework if your reader requires a good understanding at one point before you can move on to the next point. Before a teacher talks to their students about Robert Frost's poem The Road Not Taken, for instance, they would need to give an example of what it's like to make a big or difficult decision. That way, the listener or reader will understand the true nature of the poem when they hear it. Some good transitional words or phrases to use for this order include: First, you should understand; keep that in mind while I explain; remember when I said; etc. 3. Climactic Order With this order, you keep the most important part until the very end of the story or piece. You should use it when you want to build up excitement such as in a suspense story, or when writing a list ranking items from worst to best. You want the final point to resonate with your reader and, therefore, save it for the very end. Some transitional phrases to use with this order include: first of all, more importantly, just as importantly, and finally. 4. Random Order This order allows you to put your ideas out there on a whim without any specific or logical reasoning behind them. You can organize your ideas this way when your points all have equal value of importance or they can sit independently with one another in understanding. You will want to use association ideas between points to transition from one thought to the next instead of using transition terms or phrases. 5. Spatial Order With this order, you describe a scene as things are arranged in their physical space by moving from one detail to the next or as viewed from one stationary vantage point. This order is used whenever you want your readers to visualize the space or if you want to improve a scene by causing the reader to use all their senses. Use this arrangement when you want to organize the ideas you are describing in your workspace, like a product use or a place description. It is a great way to slow down a story when it is getting too intense or if you want to pace yourself before revealing a surprise. Add in a few point-of-view descriptions of the setting at the moment. Some transition words to use for this order include, just to the left or right, behind, between, across from, arising out of, etc."},{"instruction":"Write a formal Navy review for a particularly exceptional officer.

Time tracking takes time! But mostly it takes mindfulness. Learning to monitor what you‚Äôre doing every 15 minutes takes some getting used to. I often find myself looking up and suddenly realizing I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôve done for the last 40 minutes, sometimes longer‚Äîwhich of course is notable in itself. On the positive side, I like seeing the columns fill up. I can tell there are patterns to be deciphered and improved upon. *There‚Äôs an option to track your time every half-hour if fifteen-minute intervals feels excessive, but so far I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll stick with fifteen. 2. The mere act of tracking my time helps me be more intentional. When I know I have to account for my time, even if only to myself, I find myself making wiser decisions. I plan my days more carefully. I started writing this post a few days ago, but I‚Äôm finishing it while waiting for a replacement driver‚Äôs license at the DMV. It‚Äôs not unusual for me to productively use waiting time. I think what‚Äôs different is that today I made this my default state instead of just looking at my phone or zoning out. I knew I‚Äôd need to account for what became a 30-minute wait, so I made sure to use it well. 3. Momentum matters. Week I of tracking my time flew by and I only got behind a couple of afternoons. With a trip to New York City and a few other things that threw off my schedule in Week II, I got much more behind. There‚Äôs definitely a sense of momentum or inertia to this process: stay on track and you‚Äôll want to keep it going, lose a few hours and you‚Äôll feel discouraged. Laura notes that most people have irregular weeks, but you shouldn‚Äôt wait for a ‚Äúregular‚Äù week to start tracking. Disruptions happen in every week. I always have different projects to work on and I typically travel every week, so if I waited for a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù week at home I‚Äôd be waiting a long time. If I continue this discipline beyond another couple of weeks, I‚Äôll need to make sure I integrate it into my traveling life. 4. I don‚Äôt feel guilty about intentional time that isn‚Äôt spent productively. I don‚Äôt really have hobbies (I‚Äôve tried!) and I sometimes say that relaxing stresses me out. There are a lot of intervals I filled up with items ‚Äúreading,‚Äù ‚Äúwalking to gym,‚Äù ‚Äúphone call with a friend,‚Äù or even ‚Äúsearch for mistake fares for post-WDS Asia trip.‚Äù And I liked that! I don‚Äôt feel that these things detract from my other goals at all. I don‚Äôt want to avoid or minimize them; in some ways I‚Äôd like to do more of them. What I want to avoid is wasted time. Almost every day I have numerous 15-minute intervals that I don‚Äôt know what to label because I don‚Äôt remember what I did. This, at least for me, means that I frittered away the time without doing anything productive or taking time for myself in an intentional way.","output":"Time tracking allows you to be more mindful, intentional, and productive. It helps maintain momentum and avoid wasted time while also allowing for intentional leisure time. By tracking how time is spent, individuals can identify time-wasting activities and adjust their schedules accordingly. This creates more time for productive tasks and ensures consistent progress toward goals. Additionally, intentional leisure time prevents burnout and promotes overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Can you write a short blog post on how to make pasta salad?

Please don't make it a lot to read though, I get distracted easily.","output":"1. Go for a walk somewhere in town you haven't been to before. Seeing a new place or area could spark some ideas. 2. Visit a museum. You don't have to stick to just art museums, any type will do to engage your mind and imagination. 3. Watch other artists on YouTube. A project someone else is working on might be fun for you to try as well or might give you ideas for something else to experiment with. 4. Visit the library and wander the stacks. You never know what will jump out at you from books. Be sure to spend time in both the fiction and nonfiction sections. 5. Try a medium you don't typically work with. If you are used to working with a specific medium, branch out and try working with something new and see where it leads you. 6. Go to an arts and crafts store. Simply picking up a new sketchbook or other fresh supplies could give your imagination a boost. 7. Ask a friend to request you make them something. Reaching out to others for ideas will get you out of your head and into someone else's ideas, which could be a helpful stepping stone for your creativity. 8. Take a break. It could be that you should give your mind a break from art for a little while to recharge. Focus on other things that interest you or take the time for some self-care. 9. Reorganize your creative space. Clean up and declutter where you typically like to work to freshen things up and provide a \\"clean slate\\" to work with. 10. Take a class. Sign up for a community art class, or one for anything else that interests you.

Instead of quoting celebrities, please select 5 pieces of advice that are universally agreed upon. The blog post should be written in the third person and in a casual yet informational tone. The audience are young adults with aspirations in TV or film. The introduction should consist of 2 short paragraphs. And make sure one of the items on your list highlights how none of the best filmmakers (Spielberg, Tarantino, etc.) have ever attended film school.","output":"It's been said that we live in the golden age of television. And yet, breaking into the industry has never been more challenging. Before even landing a paying gig, filmmakers are expected to master cinematography, sound, camera work, script development, editing, and more. The good news is that today's most successful filmmakers are eager to share their secrets. If you have Hollywood aspirations, you'd be wise to heed their advice. Here are five must-know tips for aspiring filmmakers: 1. Film school won't boost your career. Sure, theater or film school graduates have some valuable technical knowledge. But according to Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino, a diploma isn't your ticket to stardom. Each of these legendary filmmakers is completely self-taught. 2. Don't be afraid of being typecast. While everyone aspires to be a writer, director, or producer, it may be wise to spend some time in one of the many crucial behind-the-scenes roles. As long as you're working on set, you're gaining valuable experience. So don't skip jobs in departments like PR, costume, sound, location, etc. 3. Build your portfolio, not your resume The most common piece of advice given by filmmakers is some variation of \\"show, don't tell\\". Don't wait for the right moment or the right team - just get a camera and start shooting. Your resume will not be nearly as important to producers as your portfolio. 4. Don't watch movies, study them. Quentin Tarantino famously said, \\"I didn't go to film school, I went to movies.\\" Instead of just watching a movie, try to see it from the filmmaker's perspective. Spend time researching the team's interviews, watching the director's commentary, and studying the concepts they discuss. 5. Networking is Key One thing has remained true throughout the history of show business. It's not what you know, it's who you know. Developing a strong and diverse professional network should be a top priority for any aspiring filmmaker. And the best way to connect with people in the industry is to network at events for up-and-coming writers, producers and directors. In a few years, these people could be your first collaborators."},{"instruction":"Who was the first President of the United States?","output":"That would be George Washington.

I personally don't think this is an issue of mansplaining, but I want to present her perspective of the issue fairly and objectively. I don't want to make this story seem completely one-sided, like some of the other stories I read on here. I(23M) am someone who loves fun facts. I love telling my friends and family fun facts and seeing their faces light up with the same interest as mine had when I first learned the fact. I've been getting the feeling lately that my girlfriend(23F) isn't really treating me with respect. When she talks to me she acts kind of withdrawn and dismissive, and I sometimes feel like she responds to me as though she's like a boss speaking to a subordinate. Whenever, I tell her things she may be listening or she may not be. Yesterday, I told her a fun fact about how styrofoam containers aren't actually made from styrofoam, instead they are made from a material known as polystyrene, and she didn't even blink as she just said ok. Today we were over at a friend's house for dinner, and she let us take some pasta home for leftovers, and I heard my girlfriend say, \\"hand me that styrofoam container\\". I got a little annoyed, since this was proof that she doesn't give a shit about the things I said, so I said in an annoyed voice, \\"It's made of polystyrene not styrofoam but I guess it doesn't matter what I say since you wouldn't listen anyway\\". After that, all hell basically broke loose, and my girlfriend is refusing to talk to me because I was rude, even though I was literally just pointing out that she is being disenganged and disrespectful to me by not caring about the things I say and making me feel kind of unimportant.","output":"My boyfriend and I had a massive fight because he is constantly mansplaining and acting like a know-it-all.

I find it belittling and condescending, so I've stopped engaging as politely with him when he is on one of his trivia-sharing streaks. Sometimes I switch off listening to his facts because I am just bored of it. Yesterday, for example, he decided to inform me that styrofoam containers are made from polystyrene and not from styrofoam. He was excited about this fact, but I didn't care so I politely said \\"OK\\" and moved on. Tonight we were having dinner at a friend's house. As were cleaning up, our friend suggested we take home some of the leftovers. I was grateful and asked her to pass me a styrofoam container. That's when everything went wrong. My boyfriend decided to chime in with his newly acquired fact that the container isn't actually styrofoam. Instead of ending it there, though, he made a snide comment about how I never listen to what he says. I lost my patience.

Most of the time this is done by kicking the potato although the chest and head are also sometimes used. Around each team's goal, there is a smaller area where one designated player, called the goalkeeper can use their hands. As potatoes are quite small and hard they often end up damaging the goalkeeper so many replacement goalkeepers are needed throughout the game. The game lasts for 90 minutes and each time the potato breaks it is replaced with a fresh potato so that the game can carry on.

In 1665, Robert Hooke published Micrographia, a book filled with drawings and descriptions of the organisms he viewed under the recently invented microscope. The invention of the microscope led to the discovery of the cell by Hooke. While looking at cork, Hooke observed box-shaped structures, which he called ‚Äúcells‚Äù as they reminded him of the cells, or rooms, in monasteries. This discovery led to the development of the classical cell theory. The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. There are three parts to this theory. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part states that cells are the basic units of life. These parts were based on a conclusion made by Schwann and Matthias Schleiden in 1838, after comparing their observations of plant and animal cells. The third part, which asserts that cells come from preexisting cells that have multiplied, was described by Rudolf Virchow in 1858, when he stated omnis cellula e cellula (all cells come from cells). Since the formation of classical cell theory, technology has improved, allowing for more detailed observations that have led to new discoveries about cells. These findings led to the formation of the modern cell theory, which has three main additions: first, that DNA is passed between cells during cell division; second, that the cells of all organisms within a similar species are mostly the same, both structurally and chemically; and finally, that energy flow occurs within cells.","output":"[Intro Music] Host: Welcome back, listeners, to another episode of \\"Science Talks.\\" I am your host, Madeline, and today we will start off on a fascinating journey through the history of cellular biology. We'll explore the groundbreaking discoveries that shaped our understanding of cells and meet experts who have helped revolutionize this field of biology. So, grab a snack, sit back, and get ready for a mind-blowing episode. [Background Music] Host: Our story begins in the year 1665 when a brilliant scientist named Robert Hooke forever changed our perception of the microscopic world. Hooke published a remarkable book called Micrographia, where he meticulously documented the organism he observed using the newly invented microscope. Joining us today is Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned expert in cell biology. Dr. Thompson, could you tell us more about Robert Hooke's groundbreaking work? Dr. Thompson: Absolutely, Madeline. Hooke's observations were truly revolutionary. While examining a piece of cork, he noticed small box-shaped structures that reminded him of the tiny rooms in monasteries. These structures, which he called \\"cells,\\" became the foundation of his discovery. Hooke's incredible observation led to the birth of the classical cell theory. Host: Fascinating! So, what exactly is the classical cell theory and who proposed it? Dr. Thompson: The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. It consists of three fundamental parts. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part emphasizes that cells are the basic unit of life. Schwann and Matthias Schleiden reached these conclusions in 1838, following their extensive observations of plant and animal cells. The third part, known as \\"omnis cellula e cellula\\" or \\"all cells come from cells,\\" was described by Rudolf Virchow in 1858. Host: That's incredible! The classical cell theory laid the groundwork for our understanding of cells. But how has technology advanced since then? Dr. Thompson: Great question, Madeline. Technological advancement has played a pivotal role in our continued exploration of cells. With improved tools and techniques, scientists have made astonishing discoveries, leading to the formulation of the modern cell theory. Host: And what are the key additions to the modern cell theory? Dr. Thompson: The modern cell theory encompasses three main additions. First, we now know that DNA is passed between cells during cell division, facilitating the transfer of genetic information. Second, cells within species are largely similar structurally an chemically, underscoring the unity of life. And finally, energy flow occurs within cells, which is crucial for their functioning and survival. Host: Fascinating, Dr. Thompson! These new discoveries have undoubtedly expanded our knowledge of cells. But could you give us a glimpse into how these breakthroughs have influenced other scientific disciplines or even everyday life? Dr. Thompson: Certainly! Our understanding of cells has profound implications across various fields. It has revolutionized medicine, enabling us to develop targeted therapies for diseases, such as cancer. Cell biology has also shed light on developmental processes, helping us understand how life unfolds from a single cell to a complex organism. Furthermore, advancements in cellular research have given rise to biotechnology, allowing us to engineer cells for various applications, such as the production of medicines and sustainable fuels. Host: And there you have it, folks- the captivating story of cells, from Robert Hooke's Micrographia to the modern cell theory. We owe a debt of gratitude to these brilliant scientists who have explored the unseen and unravelled the mysteries of life. Remember to tune in next time as we dive into another riveting scientific topic. Until then, keep asking questions, keep exploring, and keep expanding the boundaries of knowledge.

He would be travelling miles away, To once again see his mum, Faye. * He first travelled over the reef, Where, to his disbelief, A family of little fish stood in his way, begging him to help them get away. ‚ÄúThere have been too many sharks around here, and for our lives, we live in fear.‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease, can you give us a ride, to the mermaid village on the other side?‚Äù Tim couldn‚Äôt turn them down, as he was too kind, So on to his back, the little fish climbed. When they arrived at the village, the fish let out a cheer. ‚ÄúThank you so much for bring us here.‚Äù Tim was glad to have done a good deed, but now he was tired, and of a rest he was in need. * He found a quiet place and fell asleep, but was awoken by hearing someone up to him creep. ‚ÄúSorry to disturb you, but I am looking for a ride, and I was wondering if you were going to the Florida side?‚Äù. * Florida wasn‚Äôt where Tim wanted to go, but he wanted to help the mermaid so. ‚ÄúYes, I can go that way and help you out.‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you, thank you, Lucy the mermaid began to shout.‚Äù * On the long journey together across the ocean, Lucy told Tim about her crazy notion. She told him that an astronaut she wanted to be, and how the moon and space she longed to see. When they reached Florida, Tim waved her goodbye. As he shouted, ‚ÄúI hope one day into space you get to fly.‚Äù Tim knew he now needed to get a move on. If he was to meet his mum before the moon shone. He dived deep and carried on his way, When he heard a distant voice say, ‚ÄúHelp me, help me, I am stuck, I have tried to get free, but I‚Äôve not had much luck.‚Äù Tim knew if he stopped to help, he would be late, but he couldn‚Äôt leave the poor creature in that state. * To the shipwreck, Tim dived down to, where he saw a stuck shark looking sad and blue. The shark was stuck in a gap pretty tight, So for ages Tim pushed with all his might. After what felt like forever, the shark was finally free. ‚ÄúThank you so much for rescuing me.‚Äù The shark said his thanks and swam happily away. but Tim was now worried as it was so late in the day. * Tim knew he would be late to see his mum, As the setting of the sun had already begun. He just hoped at the meeting place she still might be, And his mum‚Äôs warm, and loving face he would get to see. * When Tim reached the rock, his mum was not there. Tim‚Äôs heart filled with sadness, and he cried with despair. Through all his tears, Tim didn‚Äôt realise, That his mum had swum up by his side. * ‚ÄúMy boy, what is with all these tears?‚Äù ‚ÄúMum, I thought you were gone and I wouldn‚Äôt see you again for years.‚Äù ‚ÄúTim, I knew you wouldn‚Äôt make it on time, As you have a big heart and you are very kind. I knew you would stop to help others in need, I can always rely on you to do a good deed.‚Äù * With that, his mum lent in for a watery embrace, As a big smile came across Tim‚Äôs face.","output":"1.

I love being outdoors, especially at beaches, but I always wind up looking like a lobster, haha. Help!","output":"Great job on knowing the importance of skin protection to prevent damage from the sun! Here are a few tips on how to shield yourself from the summertime sunshine while enjoying time outdoors. ‚Ä¢ Read the directions for your sunscreen and thoroughly follow those directions! Sunscreen is formulated and tested rigorously and with rigid guidelines. Your sunscreen should be broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 15 or greater. For the best results, if you don‚Äôt get into the water, reapply every 2 hours. However, if you get into water or sweat excessively, slather a new layer on as directed on the bottle, which is usually every 30 to 45 minutes. ‚Ä¢ Eat a nutritious diet to naturally protect skin cells against sun damage. Some foods are packed with antioxidants specifically to prevent skin cell damage and encourage fortified protection from UV rays. While food doesn‚Äôt do all the work when it comes to the prevention of sun damage, you need foods that are rich in vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin, folate, omega-3 fats, and carotenoids. - These fruits and vegetables and packed with vitamin C - oranges and grapefruits, red peppers, broccoli, and tomatoes. - Wheat germ oil, almonds, and sunflower seeds are great sources of Vitamin E - Carotenoids are needed to help keep your skin and eyes healthy. Some carotenoic-rich foods are bell peppers, cantaloupe, mangoes, and sweet potatoes. - Foods high in niacin are chicken breast, salmon, brown rice, and peanuts. - Folate-rich foods include beef, liver, spinach, and Brussels sprouts. - Foods that are full of Omega-3 are fish, especially salmon and sardines, flax and flaxseed oil, walnuts, and canola oil. ‚Ä¢ Avoid ‚Äúpeak times‚Äù for summer sunshine. The sunshine is typically the hottest and brightest between 10 am and 2 pm, depending on where you live. To avoid the most intensive UV rays, try to stay indoors or in the shade between those hours. Other things to remember about skin protection and sun damage: - There‚Äôs no such thing as waterproof sunscreen! Water resistance is based on spectrum, brand, and SPF, but no sunscreen can be completely waterproof. Every sunscreen has re-appliance directions based on how much you swim or sweat while outdoors. - Umbrellas can lend protection from sun damage. Headed to the beach? Take a large umbrella with you to sit under when you aren‚Äôt cruising the shoreline or playing in the waves. You‚Äôll get to enjoy the sand and the surf without the direct effects of UV rays on your skin. - Sunscreen and precautions against sun damage are important every day, even on cloudy days, especially when the sunshine is strongest, brightest, and hottest in the summer months. The sun‚Äôs UV rays can penetrate clouds, resulting in burns, even though they may not be as severe or appear as quickly as they would on clear days."},{"instruction":"Write an explanation of what gravity is aimed at a child. Keep it to a single paragraph.","output":"Gravity is an invisible force that keeps us all attached to the Earth. The more mass and size an object has the more it pulls smaller objects. Every time you jump and fall back down, that's gravity! It's like sticking a magnet to your fridge but you're the magnet and the Earth is the fridge. Even the planets are affected. You can't see it, you can't feel it, and you certainly can't touch it but gravity is always there for you. Here is a fun lesson for you to try at home. Toss a baseball and a rock in the air and see which falls faster. You may be surprised that they fall at the same rate. That's because gravity is constant! Isn't science great?"},{"instruction":"Write a professional-sounding email to a restaurant about a bad experience.

Those bandages became the inspiration behind the first disposable pads. This advance, interestingly, coincided with another key historical development‚Äîthe fight for women‚Äôs suffrage. The year 1920 marked a profound advance on both fronts: the debut of the Kotex brand and the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Tampons with cardboard applicators and menstrual cups arrived just over a decade later. While internal protection wasn‚Äôt a particularly new idea‚Äîover the centuries, women spanning the globe have used a wide variety of materials including lint, flax, cotton, paper, wool, plants, grass or essentially anything absorbent‚Äîit still sparked concerns among those who feared it sexual in nature. As women entered the workforce in greater numbers during World War II, though, practicality won the day. With the advent of disposable pads and tampons, in particular, public messaging about menstruation was channeled almost exclusively through marketing and advertising campaigns. Discretion was the rule: Packaging was plain and nondescript; separate payment tins on store counters ensured no words or sideways glances would be exchanged.","output":"(Verse 1) Back in the early 1900s, a story unfolds, Wartime nurses found a way to break the molds. Cellulose bandages soaked up blood with might, And that's where the journey began, shining so bright. (Chorus) Inspired by war, they created something new, Disposable pads, helping women through. In 1920, a revolution took place, Kotex brand debuted, suffrage brought grace. (Verse 2) A decade passed, and along came more, Tampons and cups knocking on the door. Women used various things over time, Lint, cotton, even plants, absorbency so prime. (Chorus) Some feared it was too intimate, a taboo, But practicality prevailed, and the doubts withdrew. World War II brought women to the fore, Workforce numbers rising, like never before. (Bridge) Disposable pads and tampons took the stage, Marketing and ads became all the rage. Quiet packaging and payment tins discrete, No words or glances, just privacy sweet. (Chorus) The messages were spread, through campaigns bold, About menstruation, a story to be told. Marketing with discretion, their rule of thumb, No one should feel uncomfortable or overcome. (Verse 3) These products became a part of our lives, Through marketing efforts, they started to thrive. Plain packages, no need for shame or strife, Menstruation's a natural part of life. (Chorus) Times have changed, but the journey remains, From those early days, progress still gains.

Is the sport of basketball artistic?","output":"Although basketball may not be viewed as artistic when a team of players is all working together and in sync, the sport of basketball can be a thing of beauty. There is a timing and rhythm to the way the ball moves, how players make cuts and run down the floor, the perfect timing of passes, and when a player shoots in rhythm, it can all look and feel like a classic Renaissance painting to a discerning eye when watching. The tactics of basketball can be thought of as reminiscent of war. The player who is dribbling the basketball wants to attack the defender aggressively and make him lose his balance or even embarrass him if the battle is very heated. Once the goal of passing the first defender is achieved, the player dribbling the ball may be able to drive all the way to the rim, shoot a mid-range shot open or defended, keep dribbling past another defender to get a better shot, pass to a teammate on the three-point line, or pass to another player running towards the basket. The possibilities are endless, and those are just examples of when things go right for the offense. As a defender, you want to stand your ground and not allow the offense to go around you or back you down and shoot over you if you are both close to the basket. You can choose to play with strength or quickness as you try to disrupt whatever the person handling the ball is trying to do. It is important to be light on your feet and not let your weight transfer to your heels or a skilled ballhandler will be able to go around you or make you further lose your balance. There is so much strategy to the game of basketball, and always more to learn and study as a seasoned watcher and/or player is able to pick up more knowledge about the game. It is a glorious thing to watch and experience the sport of basketball."},{"instruction":"What year was Carls Jr. founded?","output":"A restaurant founded on July 17, 1941, went on to become famous across the U.S. and you won't BELIEVE the story of Carls.

Both products are created using the same beginning process of boiling or simmering cow's milk until around 60% of the liquid is evaporated. For evaporated milk, this is where the process ends. If condensed milk is being made, sugar is then added. This is why it's often called sweetened condensed milk. The added sugar changes the consistency, flavor, and nutritional value of the product. In conclusion, while both forms of milk are reduced and contain the same nutrients as regular milk, condensed milk is sweeter and more viscous, containing significantly more sugar."},{"instruction":"Generate a list of all the actors who have played batman and write one or two sentences about each of them. Make it a bulleted list instead of a numbered list please.","output":"Okay, here is your bulleted list of all the actors who have played Batman: - Lewis G. Wilson: Certainly not the world‚Äôs favorite Batman, Lewis G. Wilson was the youngest and least athletic actor ever to take on the role, and he didn‚Äôt have quite the Batman voice that everyone has come to love. - Robert Lowery: In the 1940s and 50s, Robert Lowery played Batman several times and was considered quite an upgrade from his predecessor. - Adam West: For several decades, Adam West played a flamboyant version of Batman, who had a controversial goofy charm. - Michael Keaton: After 20 years of Adam West, Michael Keaton changed the role forever. Although people didn‚Äôt believe he was right for the job, after the first film came out, the masses were mad at Keaton as Batman. - Kevin Conroy: Technically the most accurate Batman to date, Kevin Conroy gave Batman the voice every actor has used since. - Val Kilmer: Though some say that Val Kilmer was a good Batman, many felt as though he was no Michael Keaton and were unimpressed with the sudden change. - George Clooney: In 1997, George Clooney was nowhere near as famous as he is now, and while his role as Batman certainly didn‚Äôt hurt his career, it also didn‚Äôt do anything to further it as everyone who watched it seemed to hate it. - Christian Bale: By the time Christian Bale came into the role, audiences didn‚Äôt expect much from Batman actors. And although his bat voice was considered imperfect in many ways, Bale‚Äôs rendition of the character generally got better reviews than most of the others who took on the role. - Will Arnett: Most people don‚Äôt realize that Will Arnett played Batman in The LEGO Movie, but those who did see him in the role absolutely loved his comedic take on the superhero. - Ben Affleck: When word got out that Ben Affleck was to play Batman in the new film Batman vs. Superman, audiences were hesitant to get excited. However, the general consensus now is that Affleck excelled in the role due to his rugged good looks and charm. - Robert Pattinson: Playing the role very differently than anyone before, Pattinson made Batman the strange orphan he actually was, and once again, although no one thought he would excel in the role, he surprised bat-fans everywhere with his take on the character."},{"instruction":"Describe an annual home maintenance inspection. Mention how it differs from a standard home inspection. Make the answer at least 150 words.","output":"Standard home inspections are most frequently completed before the sale of a home or whenever the owner or occupant changes. These inspections address any visible issues the home has and most of the time, you‚Äôll receive a report of the issues that were found and an estimated repair cost.

It‚Äôs essentially a yearly check-up for your home. Maintenance inspections are done by the owner or occupant for their own information. Unlike standard home inspections, maintenance inspections are done as a preventative measure. Both inspections will typically look at the same things, but with a maintenance inspection, the homeowner is right there to give the go-ahead for a closer look at potential issues.

Did Herb look wealthy today? Does anyone look rich sopping wet at a bus stop? Could Brad Pitt pull it off? \\"What are you looking at?\\" It was a rough, low voice. It ripped through the rain and splashed. Herb froze in horror. His eye was pointed at the man, wincing and scowling at him.

Here's your list going through tips for setting boundaries with your parents. 1. Set boundaries with gratitude and appreciation - It isn't disrespectful to set boundaries, but you should still set them, and your parents should respect them. You can set boundaries and avoid possible hurt feelings by wording what you say carefully and sharing that you appreciate them, 2. Be direct - It can be hard to get your parents to recognize that you're independent. This especially goes if you have moved back in with them. You can try to evade possible conflict by not saying anything, But, it's better to share your concerns rather than conceal them. 3. Be clear - Being vague also doesn't help. When you set boundaries, you should be clear with your parents. This makes sure that they understand exactly what you mean. If they aren't getting it you can give them examples of things they've done that have upset you and tell them other things they can do instead. 4. Compromise - Stating your boundaries can gently remind your parents that you make your own choices. If your boundaries aren't working for them, you should find some sort of compromise. If your parents ask inappropriate questions about your relationships, you can let them know it's okay to chat about your relationships but not go into a territory that's uncomfortable for you. When you find a middle ground, it can make everyone more satisfied with the outcome."},{"instruction":"How old is the earth?","output":"Ugh... It's roughly 4.543 billion years old.

They were always by each other's side and married in 1838. The couple prospered. William was a sea captain and had his own ship. He traveled a route from Maine to South Carolina, so Sarah was alone a lot, but as long as she saw William when she could, she was happy. The couple had 8 children. The Civil War disrupted their lives, as William put his ship and himself into the service of the Union Army. Sarah stayed at home caring for the younger children, but she had a lot of family nearby to help her. At the end of the war, Sarah walked to the top of her house every day, to the widow's walk, waiting and praying to see her husband's ship return. William's ship did return, and the couple had two more children. Everything was looking so well for them. Then there was a cholera outbreak. Their daughter, Nancy, succumbed first, then their son, Squire. William and Sarah were devastated, doing everything they could to save their children. Then, Sarah fell ill. She was feverish and near death. William could not face life without his Sarah. He walked into the bedroom, and Sarah was cold as ice and still. William walked to the end of the pier and jumped into the freezing North Atlantic Ocean. Sarah woke two days later. She survived cholera but never got over the death of her William. She raised the children on her own and never did remarry. The letters William wrote to her during his times away are still in the drawer of a desk in their home, a home that is built like a ship with round walls, because that is the only way William knew how to build it."},{"instruction":"Please summarize this account of how the hero Batman was initially created.

So one Friday, a DC Comic‚Äôs editor asked Kahn, who now used the name Kane and drew slapstick comics, to come up with his own superhero to complement the Man of Steel. Kane wrote, ‚ÄúOver the weekend I laid out a kind of naked superhero on the page, with a figure that looked like Superman or Flash Gordon. I placed a sheet of tracing paper over him so that I could create new costumes that might strike my fancy. Then, POW! It came to me in a flash‚Äîlike the old clich√© of an electric light bulb lighting up over a cartoon character‚Äôs head when he has a brainstorm.

It's about seizing control of one's life instead of being a hapless victim of circumstance. 2. Beginning with the end in mind: Have a clear vision of one's goals and aspirations, and do whatever it takes to bring them to fruition. Teens must discover their passions and work diligently towards realizing them. 3. Prioritize: Try to prioritize tasks and activities based on their importance. Put first things first. Develop time-management skills and avoid procrastination at all costs. 4. Think win-win: Collaborate for mutual benefit. Covey's philosophy promotes the concept of synergistic solutions that benefit everyone involved in a situation. 5. Seek first to understand: Listening to others and understanding their perspective develops empathy and effective communication skills. 6. Synergize to achieve common goals: Teamwork and collaboration can leverage each other's strengths and achieve success. IT could encourage teens to work together to achieve common goals and leverage each other's strengths. 7. Sharpen the saw: Take care of oneself physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

I am constantly struggling to find space for new things. And if I'm looking for something? I can't find it because of the clutter! I'm not even sure exactly what I have because I cannot see it all. All of those are sure signs that I am a candidate for the next Swedish Death Cleaning Reality show. So, accepting the problem is the first step and I claim it. I am in desperate need of a Swedish Death Cleanse. What is Swedish Death Cleaning, you ask? Swedish Death Cleaning is also known as d√∂st√§dning in Swedish. The basic premise involves decluttering your home and getting rid of possessions that you no longer need to make things easier for your loved ones when you pass away. I know it seems like the idea of death cleaning might be morbid or depressing, but I see it as a helpful and even cathartic exercise. I also look at Death Cleaning as a guide to living a great life in the present - not in the past - with purpose and not letting \\"stuff\\" drag you down. As you can imagine, Swedish Death Cleaning can be a daunting task, but it also can be an incredibly liberating experience. Focus on what serves you in the here and now and keep just those special pieces that matter to you. Create a more peaceful living space by limiting possessions to only things that bring you joy and peace. It can also be helpful to think about the legacy that you want to leave behind, and how you want to be remembered. By getting rid of things that you no longer need, you can make things easier for your loved ones after you're gone and yourself as you live for today. If you're feeling overwhelmed by clutter in your home and constantly struggling to find space for new things like me, then you are in dire need of Swedish Death Cleaning. By decluttering your home, getting rid of the things no longer needed, and keeping only the things that serve you, you can create a more organized and peaceful living space, lower your stress levels, and even make things a little easier for your loved ones when you pass away (eventually). So why not give it a try today?"},{"instruction":"Rewrite this story from the perspective of the cat. One cold rainy day when my father was a little boy, he met an old alley cat on his street. The cat was very drippy and uncomfortable so my father said, \\"Wouldn't you like to come home with me?\\" This surprised the cat‚Äîshe had never before met anyone who cared about old alley cats‚Äîbut she said, \\"I'd be very much obliged if I could sit by a warm furnace, and perhaps have a saucer of milk.\\" \\"We have a very nice furnace to sit by,\\" said my father, \\"and I'm sure my mother has an extra saucer of milk.\\" My father and the cat became good friends but my father's mother was very upset about the cat. She hated cats, particularly ugly old alley cats. \\"Elmer Elevator,\\" she said to my father, \\"if you think I'm going to give that cat a saucer of milk, you're very wrong. Once you start feeding stray alley cats you might as well expect to feed every stray in town, and I am not going to do it!\\" This made my father very sad, and he apologized to the cat because his mother had been so rude. He told the cat to stay anyway, and that somehow he would bring her a saucer of milk each day. My father fed the cat for three weeks, but one day his mother found the cat's saucer in the cellar and she was extremely angry. She whipped my father and threw the cat out the door, but later on my father sneaked out and found the cat. Together they went for a walk in the park and tried to think of nice things to talk about. My father said, \\"When I grow up I'm going to have an airplane. Wouldn't it be wonderful to fly just anywhere you might think of!\\" \\"Would you like to fly very, very much?\\" asked the cat. \\"I certainly would. I'd do anything if I could fly.\\" \\"Well,\\" said the cat, \\"If you'd really like to fly that much, I think I know of a sort of a way you might get to fly while you're still a little boy.\\" \\"You mean you know where I could get an airplane?\\" \\"Well, not exactly an airplane, but something even better. As you can see, I'm an old cat now, but in my younger days I was quite a traveler. My traveling days are over but last spring I took just one more trip and sailed to the Island of Tangerina, stopping at the port of Cranberry. Well, it just so happened that I missed the boat, and while waiting for the next I thought I'd look around a bit. I was particularly interested in a place called Wild Island, which we had passed on our way to Tangerina. Wild Island and Tangerina are joined together by a long string of rocks, but people never go to Wild Island because it's mostly jungle and inhabited by very wild animals. So, I decided to go across the rocks and explore it for myself. It certainly is an interesting place, but I saw something there that made me want to weep.\\"","output":"On a cold and rainy day, an old alley cat met a little boy on the street.

Include any variation of name(s) in a numbered list. Don't include duplicates. Thanks. Today began with another story about yet more ties between Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas and Republican billionaire Harlan Crow. Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, and Alex Mierjeski of ProPublica reported that Crow paid the private school tuition for Thomas‚Äôs grandnephew, to the tune of more than 6,000 a month, ultimately adding up to an amount that may have been more than 150,000. Thomas did not report the payments. Then news broke that a jury in Washington, D.C., found four members of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys‚ÄîEnrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl‚Äîguilty of seditious conspiracy for their participation in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A fifth defendant, Dominic Pezzola, was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but, like the others, was found guilty of other serious charges including obstructing Congress‚Äôs certification of the 2020 presidential election results and conspiring to prevent Congress and federal officers from discharging their duties. In a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted that the Department of Justice has secured more than 600 convictions for criminal conduct surrounding the events of January 6, including fourteen ‚Äúleaders of both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers for seditious conspiracy‚Äîspecifically conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power. Our work will continue,‚Äù he said. It is unlikely that Garland‚Äôs statement about ongoing work was casual. Defense attorneys for the Proud Boys emphasized that their clients believed then-president Trump‚Äîwho, after all, had told them in September 2020 to ‚Äústand back and stand by‚Äù‚Äîhad called them to Washington to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Although there were no explicit orders to attack the Capitol, members of the Proud Boys testified that they believed there was an implicit agreement to prevent Biden from becoming president. Tarrio, convicted today, was not at the Capitol during the attack, but a jury convicted him of seditious conspiracy nonetheless, suggesting that leaders who incited the violence can be found guilty, even if they weren‚Äôt present. Today attorneys for E. Jean Carroll, who is suing the former president in a civil trial for battery and defamation connected with his alleged rape of her, rested their case. So did Trump‚Äôs lawyers, but District Judge Lewis Kaplan gave Trump the weekend to rethink testifying. ‚ÄúHe has a right to testify which has been waived but if he has second thoughts, I‚Äôll at least consider it and maybe we‚Äôll see what happens,‚Äù Kaplan said.","output":"1.

Here is the article: As Republicans and Democrats debate a plan to raise the nation‚Äôs debt ceiling, millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance have wound up in the crosshairs. Republicans and Democrats appear to be at a stalemate over a GOP proposal to tie eligibility for Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance program for low-income and disabled adults, to a certain number of hours worked each month. For Republicans, the plan is part of a decadeslong push to link federal assistance to work requirements, while Democrats say the move would unfairly strip people of their health coverage and push more Americans into poverty. Under the Republican plan, included in a bill passed by the House last month, Medicaid recipients would have to document 80 hours a month of work, which at the federal minimum wage would amount to a minimum of 580 a month in income, or log hours doing community service or participating in a work training program. Recipients would lose their coverage if they don't meet the hourly or monthly income requirements for three consecutive months during the year. A number of groups would be exempt, including people under 19 years old or over 56, those who are going to school at least part-time or who are pregnant or deemed by a doctor to be physically or mentally ‚Äúunfit for employment.‚Äù Also exempt from the work requirement would be people participating in a drug or alcohol program and those caring for a dependent child or an ‚Äúincapacitated person.‚Äù","output":"A major aspect of the debt ceiling debate concerns eligibility for Medicaid.

Information has been included below to help you... Klamath Falls (/Ààkl√¶m…ôŒ∏/ KLAM-…ôth) is a city in, and the county seat of, Klamath County, Oregon, United States. The city was originally called Linkville when George Nurse founded the town in 1867. It was named after the Link River, on whose falls the city was sited. The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1893.[5] The population was 21,813 at the 2020 census. The city is on the southeastern shore of the Upper Klamath Lake located about 246 miles (396 km) northwest of Reno, Nevada, and approximately 17 miles (27 km) north of the California‚ÄìOregon border. Logging was Klamath Falls's first major industry. At its founding in 1867, Klamath Falls was named Linkville.[6] The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1892‚Äì93.[7] The name Klamath /Ààkl√¶m…ôŒ∏/,[8] may be a variation of the descriptive native for \\"people\\" [in Chinookan] used by the indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau to refer to the region.[9] Several locatives derived from the Modoc or Achomawi: lutuami, lit: \\"lake dwellers\\", m√≥atakni, \\"tule lake dwellers\\", respectively, could have also led to spelling variations that ultimately made the word what it is today. No evidence suggests that the name is of Klamath origin. The Klamath themselves called the region Yulalona or Iwauna, which referred to the phenomenon of the Link River flowing upstream when the south wind blew hard. The Klamath name for the Link River white water falls was Tiwishkeni, or \\"where the falling waters rush\\".[10] From this Link River white water phenomenon \\"Falls\\" was added to Klamath in its name. In reality it is best described as rapids rather than falls. The rapids are visible a short distance below the Link River Dam, where the water flow is generally insufficient to provide water flow over the river rocks. The Klamath and Modoc peoples were the first known inhabitants of the area. The Modocs' homeland is about 20 miles (32 km) south of Klamath Falls, but when they were forced onto a reservation with their adversaries, the Klamath, a rebellion ensued and they hid out in nearby lava beds.[11] This led to the Modoc War of 1872‚Äì1873, which was a hugely expensive campaign for the US Cavalry, costing an estimated 500,000, the equivalent of over 8 million in 2000. 17 Indigenous people and 83 whites were killed.[12] The Applegate Trail, which passes through the lower Klamath area, was blazed in 1846 from west to east in an attempt to provide a safer route for emigrants on the Oregon Trail.[13] The first non-Indigenous colonizer is considered to have been Wallace Baldwin, a 19-year-old civilian who drove fifty head of horses in the valley in 1852.[14] In 1867, George Nurse, named the small settlement \\"Linkville\\", because of Link River north of Lake Ewauna. The Klamath Reclamation Project began in 1906 to drain marshland and move water to allow for agriculture. With the building of the main \\"A\\" Canal, water was first made available on May 22, 1907. Veterans of World War I and World War II were given homesteading opportunities on the reclaimed land.[15]","output":"The Applegate Trail was blazed in 1846 in an attempt to provide a safer route for emigrants on the Oregon Trail."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this short blog post as someone who doesn't believe in aliens.

But the book is much more than just a comedy. Bryson's love of nature is a common theme in his writings and his deep respect for the Appalachian Trail shines through on every page. He writes expressively about the beauty and magnificence of the trail. Bryson also gives us a fascinating history of the trail, from its origins to the many people who have hiked it. He explores the impact that the trail has on the communities and ecosystems it passes through, and he reflects on the significance of the trail to those who hike it. But perhaps the most compelling aspect of *A Walk in the Woods* is the relationship between Bryson and Katz. The two men are polar opposites in many ways, but their shared experiences with travel and on the trail bring them closer and deepen their bond. Their friendship is both heartwarming and hilarious, and their banter and disagreements provide some of the book's funniest moments.

What animal ideas would you recommend to someone who has little to no experience with pets?","output":"Owning a pet is a great activity as it brings you joy in your everyday life while helping you form bonds with nature and express your emotions in a healthy way. For first-time owners, the pet choice will depend on their interests, budget, and resources, as well as what kind of animal they feel comfortable with. Here are a few animals perfect for first-time pet owners: 1. Dogs: Dogs are the ideal choice for most animal lovers. Although dogs can be a handful and they can take a fair amount of time to train, there's no doubt that they're loyal and wonderful companions. Golden retrievers and poodles are good breeds for first-time owners as they're generally easy to take care of. 2. Cats: A beloved icon of the pet world, cats are known to be quite independent and extroverted as they can easily stroll around the neighborhood and find their way back to you. Take note that cats use litter boxes so you have to clean up after them regularly. 3. Hamsters: If you're looking for something small and manageable, hamsters are the perfect pet choice for you. They're usually harmless and easy to maintain with no risk of aggressive behavior or unhealthy habits. 4. Rats: Although rats can be intimidating for most people, they make great pets as long as you treat them gently and carefully. They do have some defense mechanisms that you'll have to get used to, but they're generally pretty calm and friendly creatures that you can easily get along with. 5. Fish: Fish can make great pets as long as you maintain a safe boundary for them. Their tank or aquarium should be well-built, regularly cleaned, and placed at a suitable location where it doesn't easily fall over. Overall, owning a pet is a great way to showcase your passion for nature and wildlife, while giving you a fulfilling sense of attachment and responsibility.

It should compare it to previous games in the series. Also should discuss the strategy layer of the game.","output":"Expeditions: Rome is the third game in the Expeditions series by Danish developer, Logic Artists. Unlike previous entries in that series, however, players are tasked not with leading a small party, but an entire legion during the final years of the Roman Republic. This serves both as one of the game's great strengths and its foundational issue. Story-wise, Expeditions Rome is a conventional but well-told tale of revenge and loyalty. You start off seeking to avenge the murder of your father, and along the way attract a diverse band of unusual and unexpected allies. While the story beats are entirely predictable, Expeditions: Rome manages to tell it in a way that seems both authentic to the setting while navigating modern-day sensibilities. Players are not limited by their choice of gender in the way an actual woman of the Republic would have been, and many of the more distasteful norms of that era are acknowledged but not forced upon the player. The writing is good and the characters are believable in their dialogue and motivations. Gameplay-wise, the tactical element of Expeditions Rome: is similarly conventional but competent. Your party members come in a variety of Roman-themed classes that fulfill the classic roles of the ranged attacker, tank, crowd control, and support. As you travel across Greece, Egypt, and Gaul, new enemy types will force you to rethink the tactics that worked for you earlier, and new items and skills will keep things interesting and your playstyle evolving. Where Expeditions: Rome completely fails, however, is in its strategic layer. Unlike Expeditions: Viking or Expeditions: Conquistador, you are no longer leading just a small band of explorers across an untamed wilderness. Now, as Legatus, you are tasked with leading one, even several legions across mostly inhabited areas. The mystery of the exploration is now gone, and the randomized events that occur as you travel are reduced to being irritants. What's worse are the battles. These depend on cards that you can spend time collecting and upgrading, but the reality is that the 'strategy' boils down mostly to comparing what numbers are larger. A completely wasted opportunity. Ultimately, Expeditions Rome is a 7/10 game. A competent sequel for fans of the series with unnecessary 'improvements'. How was that? I aimed for a positive review that reflected your request for a 7/10 score."},{"instruction":"Please write a nice blog post about healthy foods that can improve hair health.

This program serves a limited segment of the population. It provides a free handout that sends the wrong message about working for what you receive. Let the parents of the children in this program pay for childcare and food for their families like the rest of us do! The children will learn more from seeing their parents work hard for what they earn instead of getting a free handout. I love the idea of a Gift Shop featuring items made right here in Kansas. This retail space will send the right message about Kansas and bring money to the community instead of providing free services to a very small group of families.

With a massive surge in gamers in recent years due to the pandemic, there is a high demand for gaming content. Can you give me 5 tips for new gamers? These tips should be basic, nothing advanced. Also, be sure to include at least two tips about aiming.","output":"Sure! Here are five tips for new gamers: 1) Train hand-eye coordination. How quickly you react to events in video games depends on your hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye or eye-hand coordination refers to your eyes and hands working simultaneously to solve your situation. You can improve your hand-eye coordination by playing sports, playing more video games, practicing juggling, playing cornhole, painting, or any activity requiring you to use your hands and eyes simultaneously. 2) Practice your aim. Aiming is a big part of most games. FPS games are extremely popular, and they rely heavily on aiming. You can practice aiming by playing custom games against AIs, using practice ranges, and changing your settings to match your play style better. 3) Fix your crosshair. Everyone has a different play style. To understand yours better, try experimenting with the crosshair you use. Changing your crosshair will improve your aim and help you become a better gamer. 4) Learn more about the game. Whatever games you're playing, you need to understand them. You cannot improve at the game if you don't know why certain actions are good or bad. For example, if you died, analyze why you died. Was it bad positioning? Were you not listening closely enough? You'll become a better gamer by analyzing the game and learning more about the ins and outs of it, 5) Discover your strengths and weaknesses. Every gamer has strengths and weaknesses, no matter what game they're playing. Some players are naturally gifted at aiming, while others are not. Some gamers are gifted with game sense, while others are not. Determine what your strengths and weaknesses are, and work on your weaknesses. If you can, try working on your weaknesses in an area where you're strong. For example, if you have good positioning but a bad aim, try improving your aim by positioning yourself in an area you feel more comfortable practicing your aim."},{"instruction":"Write an e-mail template that US citizens can use to write to their senators to ask them to support gun control laws.

One American named Frank Culbertson happened to be in the right place at the right time. He was on the International Space Station just as it was about to fly over New York City. When he saw and heard about what happened, he quickly checked the space station's location on a map and grabbed a video camera. Then he raced for the cupola, a space station module with a large window that is often used for Earth-gazing. On the way, he informed his crewmates about what happened. He captured videos and pictures of the plume of smoke coming from the World Trade Center. On the next orbit, he and his crewmates captured images of a haze over Washington, D.C. However, they were unable to tell where it was coming from. The camera that Frank Culbertson used to capture the images and video was put on display at the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson, Kansas.

Fertile soil on a luscious campground. Gentle bursts of flame on a toasty fire. So much sap, moisture, and dew you could almost feel it on your face. Completely disconnected from the world. And the best part of all, I'm with my two best friends, Jenny and Sal. We've said for years that there wouldn't be anything between us, but I think a bit of romance is building between them. It's hard not to feel intimately close to someone in this setting. My only regret was that I couldn't convince them not to take Fizzo. It's the new highly illegal recreation 'vitamin' that is all the craze in social media. Apparently, doing it just once is a life changer. They insisted, and I didn't want to be a downer. Seems like they're doing just fine. We wrapped up for the night, and I slept in my tent. I could have sworn that Sal made his way into Jenny's tent. Who knows, maybe they'd be great for each other. Loud footsteps. I tried to ignore it. Oh, this was something serious. Did we have a bear? I could hear growling. I checked my phone. 2:16. Another big, wet, vicious growl. This one seemed to have a deeper tone. And it seemed hungrier. Do I make noise to try to get help? Or should I stay silent? My tent was shaking. The zipper started trembling. What were they thinking trying to get into my tent with a bear--or whatever it was--right there!? The zipper started unzipping. I saw claws. A scream escaped my throat, \\"HELP!\\" The claws kept unzipping. This did not look like a bear. I was trembling as I saw glowing red eyes and a wolf-looking snout. \\"JENNY! SAL!?\\" I shouted. I had nowhere to turn. With an aggressive shake, the zipper was torn off by a burly, furry beast four feet from me, another right behind it. It braced its yellow fangs with saliva dripping. All its movements and mannerisms were strangely human-like. I felt myself jump up and try to tear through the opposite side of the tent. There was no escape. I felt claws slash through my side and neck while turned away and knew the end was coming very soon."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this speech into a poetic soliloquy. Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Give some detail on why these are good choices.","output":"- A 4-in-1 screwdriver. This tool has a set of regular and Philips heads on two bits that store inside the semi-hollow stem. This should be enough to tackle most minor repairs and maintenance, but if you find the bit sizes a little too small or large for what you need, consider a set of screwdrivers that either have more individual tools or a larger set of bits. Keep in mind that having a longer stem on a single tool may help you get into narrower areas. - A hammer. These come in various shapes and sizes, but a basic claw-style hammer will get most jobs done. If you need to hang some decorations or artwork, think about getting a set of nails made for this purpose. They are usually gold in color and tend to have rounded, more decorative hardware. - A tape measure or ruler. How long is that mini-blind in the den? How much space is in the living room? Answer these questions and more with a retractable tape measure. A yardstick can also be helpful for medium measuring that is too large for a ruler. Getting the right measurements will ensure you have the right fit for curtains, carpets, and more. - Tapes and adhesives. Electrical tape is useful for more than just wrapping wires. The use of duct tape beyond heating systems is almost legendary. Glue or rubber cement can be handy for quick repairs as well. Masking tape is not only used for painting but can be used to hang a quick note as well. These are the basics, but there are certainly many more tools out there for just about any repair or project you can think of.

Wong Kar-wai made Chungking Express during a two-month break from the editing of his wuxia film Ashes of Time. He said \\"While I had nothing to do, I decided to make Chungking Express following my instincts,\\"[12] and that \\"After the very heavy stuff, heavily emphasized in Ashes of Time, I wanted to make a very light, contemporary movie, but where the characters had the same problems.\\" Originally, Wong envisioned the stories as similar but with contrasting settings: one in Hong Kong Island in daylight, and the other in Kowloon at night. He felt that \\"despite the difference, they are the same stories\\": one was about encountering love in the tight city, the other was about the keeping love without physical connection.[12][10] The screenplay was not finished by the time filming began; Wong finished it when filming paused over New Year. He wrote the second story in a single day.[12] He developed a third story, about a love-sick hitman, but as he felt it would make Chungking Express overlong, he produced it as a separate film, Fallen Angels (1995). Wong wanted to film in Tsim Sha Tsui, since he grew up in the area and felt a strong connection to it. He described it as \\"an area where the Chinese literally brush shoulders with westerners, and is uniquely Hong Kong.\\" He was drawn to Chungking Mansion for its many lodgings, mix of cultures, and its significance as a crime hotspot; he felt that, as a \\"mass-populated and hyperactive place\\", it worked as a metaphor for Hong Kong itself.[12] The director once talked about his inspiration by the works of Haruki Murakami.[citation needed] As an example, the original title of the film is \\"ÈáçÊÖ∂Ê£ÆÊûó\\", while the Chinese title of Haruki Murakami's \\"Norwegian Wood\\" (1987) is \\"Êå™Â®ÅÁöÑÊ£ÆÊûó\\". The second story was shot in Central, including Lan Kwai Fong, near a popular fast food shop called Midnight Express.[13] \\"In this area, there are a lot of bars, a lot of foreign executives would hang out there after work,\\" Wong remembers. The fast food shop is forever immortalized as the spot where Tony Leung and Faye Wong's characters met and became attracted to one another. Wong was also drawn to \\"the escalator from Central to the mid-levels. That interests me because no one has made a movie there. When we were scouting for locations we found the light there entirely appropriate.\\"[12] The apartment of Tony Leung's character was cinematographer Christopher Doyle's apartment at the time of filming.[14] Wong narrates the story in a fragmented structure and connects the fragments through monologues. By looking at the pictures created by Wong, the emotions and themes central to the story become clear.[15]","output":"During a two-month break from filming \\"Ashes of Time,\\" Wong Kar-wai began writing \\"Chungking Express.\\" He finished the screenplay while shooting the film, and the second story was written in a day.

By Ted Breaux's estimate, there are only a few dozen people alive who have had the opportunity to taste authentic absinthe, the drink whose notoriety defined the Belle Epoque and which had been banned in many countries for almost a century. It is a number that he is determined to increase. On a crisp, clear fall morning, he greeted me at the Combier distillery, in Saumur, in France's Loire Valley. It is here that Breaux, a thirty-nine-year-old environmental chemist from Louisiana, is trying to reverse-engineer absinthe, precisely as it was made a hundred years ago. In the near distance, the towers of Saumur's castle rose above the slate roofs of the town like an image from a medieval Book of Hours. On the street outside, a pair of young men in military fatigues and black berets cycled past before disappearing into the dressage yards of the adjacent Cadre Noir, the elite equestrian academy that has taught the French cavalry since the eighteenth century. Across the way stood the commandant's house, an elegant Second Empire building cordoned off from the street with pink and red roses. Like the castle and the Cadre Noir, the distillery, whose interior was designed by Gustave Eiffel, is a survivor from an earlier age. Breaux refers to it as \\"the Temple,\\" and, as he took me past pallets of empty bottles and a row of potted lemon tees, there was certainly a resemblance to sacred architecture: one of the region's Romanesque chapels, perhaps, with their pale limestone walls and vaulted ceilings. The narrow doorway was surmounted by a rose window, and graceful arched windows ran along one wall beneath a steep slate roof. Instead of incense, the air was heavy with the aromas of anise, fennel, and lucerne and the sharp tang of alcohol. Breaux was preparing to distill a batch of his Verte Suisse 65, one of three that he makes based on vintage recipes. The distillery was built in 1834, and though various features have been added, all its significant equipment predates the twentieth century. \\"It's an anachronism,\\" Breaux said. Inside, it looks like something from a Jules Verne novel. A spaghetti tangle of pipes and tubes emerges from two rows of bulbous copper alembics that line the walls on either side. The stills were acquired in 1920, after the breakup of the Pernod Fils absinthe distillery in Pontarlier, in the French Jura, once the centre of the absinthe industry. The Combier distillery is, literally, a museum; Breaux, who distils there every few months, has access to it in return for a small commission on every bottle he produces. During distillation, an occasional group of tourists wanders through, admiring the alembics. When I visited, sacks of herbs were stacked in every available space; there was a container of grape alcohol the size of a small car, and an electric pump. Near the entrance stood an immense plastic tub of wormwood, absinthe's distinctive and contentious constituent, which, since the late nineteenth century, was held to cause insanity. Down the center of the room, suspended fifteen feet above the floor, ran a wrought-iron passerelle, or walkway, whose lacy gold-and-maroon ironwork clearly bore the signature of Gustave Eiffel. Since Combier began operating, techniques of distillation have moved on to embrace new technologies such as mechanized mixing and electronic temperature and pressure controls. But obsolescence is precisely what Breaux wants.","output":"In the mysterious world of spirits, authentic absinthe ‚Äì the infamously potent beverage that charmed the Belle Epoque ‚Äì has been shrouded in a veil of obscurity for nearly a century. Today, only a handful of living souls have had the chance to taste this legendary concoction. But there's a man, a man named Ted Breaux, who is on a mission to lift that veil. Under the vivid canvas of a fall morning, we found ourselves at the gateway of the Combier distillery, situated in the charming Loire Valley of France. Breaux, a chemist by profession and Louisiana by origin, was there, embarking on a daring journey. His quest? To resurrect absinthe, just as it was crafted a century ago. The silhouette of Saumur's castle loomed majestically against the skyline, a spectacle reminiscent of a scene from a medieval manuscript. Beyond, the rhythmic pedalling of youthful soldiers in dark berets echoed through the streets, their destination - the hallowed Cadre Noir, a prestigious equestrian academy steeped in French military history. Amidst this backdrop of history and elegance, a quaint Second Empire building adorned with blooming roses stood defiantly ‚Äì the commandant's abode. Inside the distillery, lovingly referred to as \\"the Temple\\" by Breaux, one could feel an atmosphere akin to a sacred sanctuary. The intricate designs by Gustave Eiffel, the aged limestone walls, and high vaulted ceilings lent an ethereal quality to the structure. The air within the temple was thick with intoxicating fragrances of anise, fennel, and lucerne, underpinned by the potent aroma of alcohol. Breaux was on the verge of distilling his Verte Suisse 65, one of the three vintage recipes he was attempting to reincarnate. The distillery, a timeless testament from 1834, was a labyrinth of intricate copper alembics and labyrinthine piping, an ambiance that would befit a Jules Verne narrative. Breaux, in a reciprocal arrangement with the owners, was allowed to utilize this living museum. Amid the chaotic arrangement of sacks of herbs and vast containers of alcohol, Breaux was focused on his mission ‚Äì unlocking the secret recipe of authentic absinthe. The heart of absinthe, wormwood, known for its controversial reputation of inducing insanity, lay in an enormous plastic tub near the entrance. The distillery was a relic of a bygone era, untouched by modern innovations in distillation technology. But for Breaux, this was perfect. After all, he was not looking to the future; his mission was anchored in the past ‚Äì in the resurrection of a long-lost secret."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet for a culinary tourism account about a dish called Ashlan Fu.

While the CubeSat couldn‚Äôt reach the lunar South Pole to help seek ice, it fulfilled several technology goals that will empower future missions for the benefit of humanity. NASA‚Äôs Lunar Flashlight launched on Dec. 11, 2022, to demonstrate several new technologies, with an ultimate goal to seek out surface ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the Moon‚Äôs South Pole. Since then, the briefcase-size satellite‚Äôs miniaturized propulsion system ‚Äì the first of its kind ever flown ‚Äì proved unable to generate enough thrust to get into lunar orbit, despite months of effort by the operations team. Because the CubeSat cannot complete maneuvers to stay in the Earth-Moon system, NASA has called an end to the mission. NASA relies on technology demonstrations to fill specific knowledge gaps and to test new technologies. Used for the first time beyond Earth‚Äôs orbit, Lunar Flashlight‚Äôs propulsion system and green fuel were such demonstrations. Although the propulsion system was unable to produce the desired thrust ‚Äì likely because of debris buildup in the thruster fuel lines ‚Äì newly developed propulsion system components exceeded performance expectations. Also surpassing expectations were Lunar Flashlight‚Äôs never-before-flown Sphinx flight computer ‚Äì a low-power computer developed by NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California to withstand the radiation of deep space ‚Äì and the spacecraft‚Äôs upgraded Iris radio. Featuring a new precision navigation capability, the radio can be used by future small spacecraft to rendezvous and land on solar system bodies. ‚ÄúTechnology demonstrations are, by their nature, higher risk and high reward, and they‚Äôre essential for NASA to test and learn,‚Äù said Christopher Baker, program executive for Small Spacecraft Technology in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. ‚ÄúLunar Flashlight was highly successful from the standpoint of being a testbed for new systems that had never flown in space before. Those systems, and the lessons Lunar Flashlight taught us, will be used for future missions.‚Äù The mission‚Äôs miniaturized four-laser reflectometer, a science instrument that had never flown before, either, also tested successfully, giving the mission‚Äôs science team confidence that the laser would have been able to detect ice if it were present at the lunar surface. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing for the science team, and for the whole Lunar Flashlight team, that we won‚Äôt be able to use our laser reflectometer to make measurements at the Moon,‚Äù said Barbara Cohen, the mission‚Äôs principal investigator at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ‚ÄúBut like all the other systems, we collected a lot of in-flight performance data on the instrument that will be incredibly valuable to future iterations of this technique.‚Äù Propulsion System Performance Challenges Despite the mission‚Äôs technological wins, Lunar Flashlight‚Äôs miniaturized propulsion system struggled to provide sufficient thrust to put the CubeSat on course for the planned near-rectilinear halo orbit that would have given the spacecraft weekly flybys of the Moon‚Äôs South Pole. The team suspects that debris obstructed the fuel lines, causing the diminished and inconsistent thrust. The miniaturized propulsion system included an additively manufactured fuel feed system that likely developed the debris ‚Äì such as metal powder or shavings ‚Äì and obstructed fuel flow to the thrusters, limiting their performance. Although the team devised a creative method for using just one thruster to maneuver the spacecraft, Lunar Flashlight needed more consistent thrust to reach its planned orbit. The operations team calculated a new orbit that could be reached using the spacecraft‚Äôs small amount of potential remaining thrust. The plan called for putting the CubeSat on a path that would place it in orbit around Earth rather than the Moon, with monthly flybys of the lunar South Pole. While this would have meant fewer flybys, the spacecraft would have flown closer to the surface. With the mission running out of time to arrive at the needed orbit, the operations team tried to dislodge any debris from the fuel lines by increasing the fuel pressure well beyond the propulsion system‚Äôs designed capacity. Despite limited success, the required trajectory correction maneuvers couldn‚Äôt be completed in time. ‚ÄúThe student operations team at Georgia Tech, with assistance from JPL and NASA‚Äôs Marshall Space Flight Center, rose to the challenge and came up with an incredible array of inventive techniques to utilize what tiny amount of thrust Lunar Flashlight‚Äôs propulsion system could deliver,‚Äù said John Baker, Lunar Flashlight project manager at JPL. ‚ÄúWe learned a lot and honed new methods and strategies for working with tiny spacecraft.‚Äù After having traveled out past the Moon, Lunar Flashlight is now moving back toward Earth and will fly past our planet with a close approach of about 40,000 miles (65,000 kilometers) on May 17. The CubeSat will then continue into deep space and orbit the Sun. It continues to communicate with mission operators, and NASA is weighing options for the future of the spacecraft. More About the Mission Lunar Flashlight is managed for NASA by JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California. The CubeSat is operated by Georgia Tech, including graduate and undergraduate students. The Lunar Flashlight science team is led by NASA Goddard and includes team members from the University of California, Los Angeles; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; and the University of Colorado. The CubeSat‚Äôs propulsion system was developed by NASA Marshall in Huntsville, Alabama, with development and integration support from Georgia Tech. NASA‚Äôs Small Business Innovation Research program funded component development from small businesses including Plasma Processes Inc. (Rubicon) for thruster development, Flight Works for pump development, and Beehive Industries (formerly Volunteer Aerospace) for specific 3D-printed components. The Air Force Research Laboratory also contributed financially to the development of Lunar Flashlight‚Äôs propulsion system. Lunar Flashlight is funded by the Small Spacecraft Technology program based at NASA‚Äôs Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley and within NASA‚Äôs Space Technology Mission Directorate.","output":"It is unfortunate that the Lunar Flashlight CubeSat could not reach the desired orbit around the Moon.

In 1870 Lobengula granted Sir John Swinburne's London and Limpopo Mining Company the right to search for gold and other minerals on a tract of land in the extreme southwest of Matabeleland along the Tati River between the Shashe and Ramaquabane rivers, in what became known as the Tati Concession.[5][6] However, it was not until about 1890 that any significant mining in the area commenced.[citation needed] Lobengula had been tolerant of the white hunters who came to Matabeleland; he would even go so far as to punish those of his tribe who threatened the whites. However, when a British team (Francis Thompson, Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire) came in 1888 to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory, he was wary about entering into negotiations. Lobengula gave his agreement only when his friend, Leander Starr Jameson, a qualified medical doctor who had once treated Lobengula for gout, proposed to secure money and weaponry for the Matabele in addition to a pledge that any people who came to dig would be considered as living in his kingdom. As part of this agreement, and at the insistence of the British, neither the Boers nor the Portuguese would be permitted to settle or gain concessions in Matabeleland. Although, Lobengula was illiterate and was not aware of how damaging this contract was to his country, only found out the real terms of the contract he signed as his subjects found out. After going to friendly English missionaries to confirm this rumour, Lobengula sent two emissaries to the British queen, Victoria, but this proved futile.","output":"1870: Lobengula granted Sir John Swinburne's London and Limpopo Mining Company the right to search for gold and other minerals on a tract of land in the extreme southwest of Matabeleland along the Tati River between the Shashe and Ramaquabane rivers, in what became known as the Tati Concession. 1888: A British team (Francis Thompson, Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire) came to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory. 1890: Significant mining in the area commenced."},{"instruction":"I need five ideas on how to make my bedroom more relaxing and cozier. Better sleep and a calmer mind is the end goal!","output":"Your bedroom should be a place where you feel safe and comfortable from the moment you step foot in it. You should long for the sanctuary of your bedroom in the evenings, especially after a long workday has left you feeling stressed and haggard. Did you know that there are 335 million people in the United States and one-third of them aren‚Äôt getting enough sleep? While there are many contributing factors to the lack of good doze, one main component is the lack of a properly relaxing and cozy space. For a calmer mind and better sleep, here are five ideas for making your bedroom a more relaxing and cozier safe place. 1. Choose colors that remind you of calmness and peace. For many people, various shades of blue or purple are calming colors. Cerulean blue, for instance, is a favorite because it reminds most people of the oceans. Whereas, purple is often symbolic of luxury, which many people associate with a plush and cozy bedroom environment. However, color therapy is different for everyone, and the trick is finding colors that are soothing and calming specifically to you. It can be any color that evokes a peaceful brain response. While you don‚Äôt have to flood your bedroom with that singular color, a few splashes in pillows, blankets, and even on the walls could have a safe, comforting effect on your brain and body. 2. What‚Äôs your ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù for a good night‚Äôs sleep? As everyone‚Äôs calm colors are different, so are everyone‚Äôs ideas of an ideal sleep space. While some people love complete darkness and a cold bedroom with a fan on high throughout the year, others are happier and sleep better with a nightlight in a quiet room of warm, still air. It‚Äôs a personal preference, often associated with the ways you slept growing up. Ergo, it could be a catalyst for better sleep and a calmer mind as an adult too. It may take trial and error, but work on discovering the environment that is most conducive to your calm state of mind and a good night‚Äôs rest. Once you‚Äôve found your ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of peace, it should be easier to create a cozy, calm environment in the bedroom. 3. Bring nature into the bedroom with crystals, a vase of flowers, or windowsill succulents. Nature is balance, and finding balance in your bedroom could mean reminding yourself of the equilibrium found in nature. For instance, you could add greenery with windowsill succulents, or bring a bloom of color onto your nightstand with a fresh vase of flowers. Into the mystical side of nature? Crystals are symbolic of inner feelings and your psyche, so invest and display crystals that represent what you want. For instance, black tourmaline repels negative energies, while amethyst encourages good dreams and deeper sleep. 4. Engage your senses with softness and soothing scents. Calmness and peace are felt across all of your senses, so engage in those before bedtime. You could, for example, invest in a sound machine for the gentle lull of ocean waves or a cacophony of cicadas and crickets to remind you of your childhood. You could also surround yourself with softness, like plush pillows and luxurious blankets atop crisp, clean sheets. Another way to invite calm into your bedroom is with the right scents. Lavender is naturally soothing to the mind, while vanilla is a subtle, mellow fragrance that transports your brain back to simpler, peaceful times. You don‚Äôt have to douse your pillows and blankets but use a room spritz to liven the air or do the same with a candle. Just don‚Äôt forget to blow out the candle before you doze off. 5. The less clutter in your bedroom, the less clutter in your mind before bedtime. Clutter of your safe space is clutter of your mind because when the clutter becomes too much, your brain will latch onto the worry and responsibility of eventually having to clean and organize everything cluttered. It‚Äôs a thought that can keep you awake at night! Use your day to declutter and organize your bedroom. The less worry you give yourself, the better sleep you‚Äôll have, and the calmer your mind will be.

Loren became an international film star following her five-picture contract with Paramount Pictures in 1958. Among her films at this time were Desire Under the Elms with Anthony Perkins, based upon the Eugene O'Neill play; Houseboat, a romantic comedy co-starring Cary Grant; and George Cukor's Heller in Pink Tights, in which she appeared as a blonde for the first time. Drawing of Loren by Nicholas Volpe after she won an Oscar for Two Women (1961) In 1960, Loren starred in Vittorio De Sica's Two Women, a stark, gritty story of a mother who is trying to protect her 12-year-old daughter in war-torn Italy. The two end up gang-raped inside a church as they travel back to their home city following cessation of bombings there. Originally cast as the daughter, Loren fought against type and was eventually cast as the mother (actress Eleonora Brown would portray the daughter). Loren's performance earned her many awards, including the Cannes Film Festival's best performance prize, and an Academy Award for Best Actress, the first major Academy Award for a non-English-language performance or to an Italian actress. She won 22 international awards for Two Women. The film was extremely well received by critics and a huge commercial success. Though proud of this accomplishment, Loren did not show up to this award, citing fear of fainting at the award ceremony. Nevertheless, Cary Grant telephoned her in Rome the next day to inform her of the Oscar award.[18] During the 1960s, Loren was one of the most popular actresses in the world, and continued to make films in the United States and Europe, starring with prominent leading men. In 1961 and 1964, her career reached its pinnacle when she received 1 million to appear in El Cid and The Fall of the Roman Empire. In 1965, she received a second Academy Award nomination for her performance in Marriage Italian-Style opposite Marcello Mastroianni.[19]","output":"‚Ä¢ Desire Under the Elms ‚Ä¢ Houseboat ‚Ä¢ Heller in Pink Tights ‚Ä¢ Two Women ‚Ä¢ El Cid ‚Ä¢ The Fall of the Roman Empire ‚Ä¢ Marriage Italian-Style"},{"instruction":"Write a blog post about copper. Include information about how the world's supply of copper is dwindling and that's why it's imperative to recycle copper, especially copper wire. Give instructions on how to clean and weigh copper wire and how to figure the value. Keep the word count under 400 words.","output":"Copper is one of our planet‚Äôs precious natural resources that is quickly running out. In fact, the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development Project reports that copper recycling needs to increase to around 100 percent before the end of the twenty-first century if we are to have the copper necessary for industry and commerce. The worldwide demand for copper is growing because of the many new products coming out every year, like PDAs, smartphones, pad computers, laptops, and many other electronics. The circuit boards on many of these devices require copper, so recycling copper wire isn‚Äôt just a good idea; it‚Äôs imperative. For these reasons, copper recycling has become a big business. Copper doesn‚Äôt break down or disintegrate over time like aluminum and other metals. It retains its good properties for many years and can easily be melted down for use in all sorts of industries. Copper wire is one major area where recycling has really grown in the last few years. This is good news for those who have copper wiring they don‚Äôt need anymore. You can help the planet out and make some money on the side. Copper wire retains its value, but all copper recyclers are not the same. Some are a bit on the shady side and will use faulty scales that weigh your copper light, so they don‚Äôt have to pay the full amount. It‚Äôs best to deal with a reputable copper recycler in your area that has a good name. It also helps to know the current copper prices. The more you know, the better your chances of not being taken advantage of. Figuring the Weight & Value of Copper Wire First, strip the copper wire so that you remove all surrounding plastic. Regardless of what the copper was previously used for, it may have rubber or plastic around it that was acting as a ground. Once the copper is clean, weigh it.

The four pillars of fast relief DripDrop‚Äôs patented formula uses ORS science to activate a hydration shortcut known as the sodium-glucose cotransport system, accelerating fluid absorption into the bloodstream so you can feel better faster. MUST. HAVE. SODIUM When it comes to dehydration, not all electrolytes are created equal. Sodium is the key electrolyte necessary to pull fluids and other electrolytes into your bloodstream. But sodium has a tough time getting through the intestines on its own. It needs a little glucose to speed absorption. A LITTLE GLUCOSE Pairing Sodium with a little glucose opens a hydration shortcut, helping fluids and electrolytes pass rapidly from your intestines into your bloodstream via the sodium-glucose cotransport system. It's like shifting into high gear! With the right ratio of sodium and glucose, water absorption increases 2-3x. LOW OSMOLARITY DripDrop's precise ratio is only part of the balanced equation that makes our formula so unique (and fast!). We also keep the particles in our solution (i.e. osmolarity) low. Why? For optimal efficiency and speed. Fewer particles equal speedier absorption, so you can feel better faster. UNMATCHABLE FLAVOR Making a rehydration solution that works this well and tastes this good isn't easy. Without compromising efficacy, DripDrop provides great-tasting dehydration relief fast.

The squirrels had already forgotten where they'd planted their acorns, and the soil bore a chill as cold mountain waters permeated it.

Creating a comic book can be a difficult but rewarding venture. Here are some things to consider when creating a new comic book: 1. Protagonist/Antagonist - Who is the main character/villain of the story? Your characters can be anything you want them to be; they don't necessarily have to follow the tradition of being individuals with superpowers. For instance, you could create characters who are based on people like yourself, living an ordinary life and dealing with ordinary, relatable problems. Consider the works of Harvey Pekar (\\"American Splendor\\"), which showcase stories about ordinary people. Or, if you decide to write characters who follow the fantasy superhero trope, know who they are (origin, superpowers, and how they got them, etc.). Generally, your characters should be fleshed out completely. 2. Story - A good story can be made from any situation, but generally, most stories follow a formula that has been used in storytelling for centuries (i.e., Man vs. Man, Man vs. Environment). You could also write an autobiographical story or a story about other people who have lived or are still living. Your story is as creative and compelling as you make it, and it does not have to adhere to any set rules as long as it tells a coherent story that is worth reading. 3. Illustrations - Drawing comic book characters and scenery can be done by yourself by hand or digitally using programs found online. You can also hire someone to draw the comic books for you if you have no desire or artistic skill to do it on your own. When making the illustrations for your comic book, have a clear idea of what you want the drawings to convey and consider using drawing techniques that show actions taking place (e.g., using \\"action lines\\" to illustrate a person's punch wooshing by another person's face.) 4. Format - You can decide to have either a printed comic book on paper or a digital comic book that can be distributed via email or an app. With either option, you will still adhere to the same aforementioned steps, but the approach to going through these steps may differ slightly. For instance, making a digital comic book will still require illustrations, but illustrating digital comics will require the use of programs (i.e., Adobe, Paint, et al.) whereas printed comic books require ink and paper. Also, printing a comic book will result in something you can hold with your own hands but can become torn or worn over time, whereas a digital comic book has no tactile feel to it but will never deteriorate."},{"instruction":"One of my dreams is to write children‚Äôs books, but I feel creatively stuck ‚Äì zero ideas!

The Sony and Canon cameras take much longer to set up than the Blackmagic cameras. Sony and Canon use bespoke terminology and jargon to describe their various setting options, which makes it more difficult for people new to the cameras to figure out how to program and set them up properly. With Blackmagic, the menus and options are more intuitive and controlling for audio options through the camera is much easier and quicker to adjust the specific settings you'd like to record at. One day, we were shooting with eight Blackmagic cameras when a critical piece of equipment for recording the data malfunctioned. This meant that we had to adjust the settings on all eight cameras to correct for the error. On other brands of camera, this could be an extensive process due to the complexity of menus and setting options, but on Blackmagic it was a very quick and easy process as the controls are all easily understandable and accessible."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this in an excited tone. Astronomers have detected a huge plume of water vapour spurting out into space from Enceladus, an icy moon of Saturn. The 504km-wide (313 miles) moon is well known for its geysers, but this is a particularly big one. The water stream spans some 9,600km - a distance equivalent to that of flying from the UK to Japan. Scientists are fascinated by Enceladus because its sub-surface salty ocean - the source of the water - could hold the basic conditions to support life. Nasa's Cassini mission (2004-2017) gathered tantalising evidence of the necessary chemistry by regularly flying through the geysers and sampling the water with its instruments - although it made no direct detection of biology. The new super-plume was spied by the James Webb Space Telescope.

Layered in threes, the sponge cake is sandwiched with a mixture of cherries and whipped cream or milk chocolate mousse, then the sides are pressed with Bavarian chocolate shards or milk chocolate curls. Traditionally, the dessert is creamy and indulgent, soaked in black cherry liquor for extra richness. ‚Ä¢ Coffee Caramel Mousse Creamy and airy with a fluff factor that could rival the softness of homemade whipped cream, Coffee Caramel Mousse boasts a subtle sweetness that makes it the perfect lightweight dessert. The tastes of coffee and caramel intermingle, and its often accompanied by fresh raspberries or strawberry slices to break up texture and flavors. ‚Ä¢ Banana Bread The sweetness in Banana Bread comes from mashed bananas, stirred with butter to a fluffy consistency before being baked to golden-brown perfection. The exterior crust is slightly crispy, while the interior is soft and light. Best-served warm, banana bread is delicious down to the last crumb. Some bakers incorporate chopped walnuts or chocolate chips for added texture and flavor. ‚Ä¢ Apple Brown Betty Reminiscent of an apple pie, Apple Brown Betty incorporates soft cinnamon-sugared apple slices with buttery, oven-browned breadcrumbs.

Use the following text for this task: Horror is a film genre that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment purposes.[2] Horror films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Broad elements include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk beliefs. Cinematic techniques used in horror films have been shown to provoke psychological reactions in an audience. Horror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in silent films and German Expressionism, horror only became a codified genre after the release of Dracula (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, slasher films, supernatural horror and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan, Korea, Italy and Thailand, among other countries. Despite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society and spawned several popular culture icons.","output":"1.

Get to know your garden Before you start, it's a good idea to get to know your garden. Check the aspect ‚Äì is it south-facing or north-facing? Knowing where the sun hits the ground will help you decide what to grow where. It's also worth knowing what soil type you have. Take a look at what's growing ‚Äì camellias, magnolias and pieris will tell you the soil is acidic, while absence of these suggests a more alkaline soil. Doing a soil test will further help you know your soil, and therefore what plants you can grow. 2. Plan your garden Sitting down and planning your garden is a great starting point. This way you can work out what to grow where, rather than getting carried away at the garden centre and ending up with a jumble of plants that don't look good together and might not suit your growing conditions. Planning will also enable you to use colour and structure wisely, which will help you create a garden that looks great throughout the year. 3. Learn how to plant Planting your plants properly will ensure they grow well and live for a long time. Make sure you take time to weed and prepare the soil before planting, and add mulch or fertiliser where necessary. If you're unsure how to plant something, look online for instructions rather than just hoping for the best. Trees planted too deeply will never thrive, and root-balls that sit proud of the soil surface will dry out quickly, leading to the eventual death of the plant. 4. Feed and water plants regularly Knowing when and how to water plants is the difference between them living and dying. As a general rule, water the root ball rather than the leaves, as it's the roots that absorb the water. Soaking the rootball every week is better than watering a little bit every day. Feeding is also important - generally you should be looking at feeding every fortnight during growing season (that's spring and summer), although you will need to feed more if growing in containers. 5. Start small When starting a new veg patch or allotment, it can be tempting to take it all on in one go. It's much better to do a little bit at a time. You can easily cover areas you don't want to cultivate with cardboard or black plastic, to stop weeds growing, while you work on a different area. 6. Keep an eye on pests Most garden pests don't do much harm to plants and can be left alone - there are plenty of natural predators that will keep them in check. However, sometimes pest populations can become an infestation, and you need to act. Keeping an eye out for increasing numbers of pests like aphids, slugs and snails, will help keep your plants safe, and save you a lot of heartache. 7.

For some reason, for many freelance writers, it's uncomfortable to put a price on their worth, and sadly many freelancers sell themselves short. Obviously, it's important to consider your knowledge, skills, and experience, but price yourself with what you are comfortable earning so that you will continue to be motivated to keep up your freelance writing business for the long term. Here are some simplified steps to help you set your freelance writing rates. 1. Start with some online research. It's good to get a grasp on what people are paying in your industry or niche. If you don't have one, that's fine too! Seeing the differences in pay may be a factor to consider if you're thinking of choosing a niche. You can go to any of the freelance job platforms you're now a part of to see what clients are listing their budget as (even though it's not always listed), what other writers' rates are, and their level of experience/background. 2. Consider your professional and educational background. Even if you are new to freelance writing, any relevant experience can set you apart from others and provide a reason to charge a higher rate. This has its limits obviously, you must have the skill to back it up. If you have a degree in English or journalism, that sets you apart. Obviously, if you don't have a writing background or other credentials, this doesn't mean that you can't be a freelance writer, it just means that you may have to start at a lower rate until you have successfully completed a few projects and have some good reviews under your belt. 3. Consider the budget of potential clients. It's important to know what clients you are targeting. If you want to take on a client with a startup business, they will likely offer lower pay because that may be all that's in the budget. If you target more established businesses or individuals to write for, there may be more room for negotiation on your rate or the project cost."},{"instruction":"Who wrote the Star Spangled Banner?","output":"The Star Spangled Banner was a poem written by Francis Scott Key in 1814.

If you can provide a brief history of the city, that would be great, too!","output":"Williams, Arizona was established in 1881 by Bill Williams, who was a famous mountaineer and fur trapper. At first, the area was mainly occupied by ranchers until the railroad in the early 1900s expanded tourism; it was made even easier for tourists to visit Williams when Route 66 was completed in 1926. Here are some things to consider doing while you spend your day in Williams, Arizona: One of the top attractions tourists enjoy in town is the Grand Canyon Railway, a train that takes its passengers to and from the Grand Canyon‚Äôs South Rim. The train ride is two hours each way, so plan accordingly. Another option for exploring Williams is checking out the stretch of Route 66 in the town. This is an easily walkable loop and, if you visit at night, you can see some interesting vintage neon signs lit up along the road. Twisters Soda Fountain, Goldies Route 66 Diner, and Cruiser‚Äôs Route 66 Cafe are among the local businesses found here. Bearizona, located in Kaibab National Forest, is a unique drive-through wildlife park experience where visitors can witness wildlife from the comfort of their vehicle. Animals you might see here include the likes of black bears, wolves, bobcats, beavers, and badgers. If you have any youths with you on your trip, they might enjoy a visit to Big Toy Playground, where guests (including adults) can operate large, earth-moving equipment for a dose of fun."},{"instruction":"Come up with a social media post for Facebook announcing your new pet duck, Quackers, in the style of a baby announcement.","output":"Everyone, please join us in welcoming the newest member of our family.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots. The Avengers premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over 1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate 1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).","output":"Robert Downy Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Samuel L.

A priority queue, on the other hand, also takes in a priority number, and orders its operations that way. Instead of being dependent upon where in the order an item was inserted, it orders its operations based on the priority numbers it's been given.

So, one day, Barry decided to chase his dream and began his journey to climb the mountain. His bee friends laughed and buzzed in disbelief as Barry packed, but he was determined to reach the top. Soon he was on his way! As Barry began his ascent, he realized that he wasn't the only one climbing the mountain. There were hundreds of humans and many ice worms who were also chasing their dreams up the mountain. Along the way to base camp, there was a caterpillar who wanted to fly, a ladybug who wanted to long-distance swim, and a grasshopper who wanted to salsa dance. They were all chasing their dreams and cheering each other on, encouraging and motivating one another to reach their goals. It was so inspiring. Barry, being a bee of course, was naturally equipped with wings, but they weren't enough to get him up the steep and rocky terrain. So, he used his tiny arms and legs to climb, just like the other climbers. As he kept going higher and higher, Barry faced many, many obstacles, from sub-zero temperatures and heavy winds to a blizzard. But he didn't let anything stop him. He kept going, determined to reach the top. Finally, after many days and days of climbing, Barry made it to the peak. He was exhausted, but his heart was full of pride. Barry immediately began making his way down the mountain. When he finally made it out of the snow and ice, he stopped to rest on the first flower he found. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his backside. He turned around to see a grumpy old mountain goat, who had mistaken Barry for a flower and tried to eat him. The goat quickly realized his mistake and apologized, but Barry couldn't help but laugh at his luck. And that's the story of Barry, the first bee to ever climb Mount Everest. A story we almost never knew because Barry almost ended up being eaten by a goat."},{"instruction":"Give me some suggestions for titles for a subreddit that is for stay-at-home moms giving each other tips, tricks, and support.","output":"Sure!

Images were projected onto another surface. 17th century: The camera obscura became portable. The 1830s: The first permanent photos were taken in France by Joseph Nic√©phore Ni√©pce. Niepce and Louis Daguerre created the daguerreotype. The 1850s: Emulsion plates were invented, which were faster and less expensive than the daguerreotype cameras. In the 1870s: Richard Maddox invented dry plates which led to the first camera with a mechanical shutter to be developed. The 1880s: George Eastman started a company called Kodak, making photography more accessible to everyone. 1939 - Photojournalists used film to capture war images, which portrayed the important role of photography in capturing important scenes. Arpdn this same time, Polaroid introduced the Model 95 which produced instant images. The 1950s: Asahi (which later became Pentax) introduced the Asahiflex and Nikon introduced its Nikon F camera. In the 1970s and early 1980s: Point and Shoot compact cameras were introduced that were capable of making image control decisions on their own. The 1980s - 1990s: Companies continued to develop and refine digital cameras. 1991: Kodak produced the first digital camera good enough to be used by professionals. 1990s-today: There are multiple digital cameras on the market to choose from for both professionals and the everyday consumer. Now, however, most people use their smartphones to capture moments quickly."},{"instruction":"Please write an email to my best friend Tracy. the subject matter is about my trip to Detroit, Michigan.

There were protests in Japan and elsewhere against his attending the February award ceremony in Israel, including threats to boycott his work as a response against Israel's recent bombing of the Gaza. Murakami chose to attend the ceremony, but gave a speech to the gathered Israeli dignitaries harshly criticizing Israeli policies.[66] Murakami said, \\"Each of us possesses a tangible living soul. The system has no such thing. We must not allow the system to exploit us.\\"[67] In 2011, Murakami donated his ‚Ç¨80,000 winnings from the International Catalunya Prize (from the Generalitat de Catalunya) to the victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, and to those affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Accepting the award, he said in his speech that the situation at the Fukushima plant was \\"the second major nuclear disaster that the Japanese people have experienced ... however, this time it was not a bomb being dropped upon us, but a mistake committed by our very own hands\\". According to Murakami, the Japanese people should have rejected nuclear power after having \\"learned through the sacrifice of the hibakusha just how badly radiation leaves scars on the world and human wellbeing\\".[68] In recent years, Haruki Murakami has often been mentioned as a possible recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.[15] Nonetheless, since all nomination records are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize, it is pure speculation.[69] When asked about the possibility of being awarded the Nobel Prize, Murakami responded with a laugh saying \\"No, I don't want prizes. That means you're finished.\\"[15] In October 2014, he was awarded the Welt-Literaturpreis.[70] In April 2015, Murakami was named one of the TIME 100's most influential people.

I'd like to begin by reminding you that the world population has now topped 8 billion, and that means more kids and more teeth are being lost on a daily basis. Following is a list of issues I have been encountering recently: * Barry the Tooth Fairy is not carrying his share of the load. We are both assigned to the New England area of the United States and while I'm out collecting teeth and checking off the list, Barry is lurking in alleyways waiting to snag lost teeth from bar fights that may or may not happen. * Because of Barry's behavior, you'll see a decline in the quality of teeth we submit on a daily basis. Whereas the majority of teeth I collect are from young, fresh mouths, his collections tend to be yellowed from cigarette smoke and even have cavities and crowns. * New England winters are brutal, and our current Tooth Fairy uniform is simply not warm enough. We need something ergonomically friendly that won't reduce wing speed (especially since we have to cover extra households now). * Kids these days don't appreciate coins, so I'd like to request that we be permitted to carry only lighter-weight paper money now. Electronic transactions would be a modern, vast improvement. * Additional training on how to deal with pets (especially cats) that sleep in the beds of children would be most useful. I've had one too many close encounters and I feel that my pay grade isn't high enough to justify this level of danger. On a happier note, I'd like to request a transfer for my fiance, Mary the Merry Tooth Fairy, to my region as soon as possible. I'm sure you, in all your wisdom, Larry, can understand that it would be better for us to build a life together here in the New England region rather than in her current assignment of the Yukon territory.

John Adams, a remarkable political philosopher, served as the second President of the United States (1797-1801), after serving as the first Vice President under President George Washington. Adams was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1735. A Harvard-educated lawyer, he early became identified with the patriot cause; a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, he led in the movement for independence. During the Revolutionary War he served in France and Holland in diplomatic roles, and helped negotiate the treaty of peace. From 1785 to 1788 he was minister to the Court of St. James‚Äôs, returning to be elected Vice President under George Washington. Adams‚Äô two terms as Vice President were frustrating experiences for a man of his vigor, intellect, and vanity. He complained to his wife Abigail, ‚ÄúMy country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.‚Äù When Adams became President, the war between the French and British was causing great difficulties for the United States on the high seas and intense partisanship among contending factions within the Nation. His administration focused on France, where the Directory, the ruling group, had refused to receive the American envoy and had suspended commercial relations. Adams sent three commissioners to France, but in the spring of 1798 word arrived that the French Foreign Minister Talleyrand and the Directory had refused to negotiate with them unless they would first pay a substantial bribe. Adams reported the insult to Congress, and the Senate printed the correspondence, in which the Frenchmen were referred to only as ‚ÄúX, Y, and Z.‚Äù The Nation broke out into what Jefferson called ‚Äúthe X. Y. Z. fever,‚Äù increased in intensity by Adams‚Äôs exhortations. The populace cheered itself hoarse wherever the President appeared. Never had the Federalists been so popular. Congress appropriated money to complete three new frigates and to build additional ships, and authorized the raising of a provisional army. It also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to frighten foreign agents out of the country and to stifle the attacks of Republican editors. President Adams did not call for a declaration of war, but hostilities began at sea. At first, American shipping was almost defenseless against French privateers, but by 1800 armed merchantmen and U.S. warships were clearing the sea-lanes. Despite several brilliant naval victories, war fever subsided. Word came to Adams that France also had no stomach for war and would receive an envoy with respect. Long negotiations ended the quasi war. Sending a peace mission to France brought the full fury of the Hamiltonians against Adams. In the campaign of 1800 the Republicans were united and effective, the Federalists badly divided. Nevertheless, Adams polled only a few less electoral votes than Jefferson, who became President. On November 1, 1800, just before the election, Adams arrived in the new Capital City to take up his residence in the White House. On his second evening in its damp, unfinished rooms, he wrote his wife, ‚ÄúBefore I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.‚Äù Adams retired to his farm in Quincy. Here he penned his elaborate letters to Thomas Jefferson. Here on July 4, 1826, he whispered his last words: ‚ÄúThomas Jefferson survives.‚Äù But Jefferson had died at Monticello a few hours earlier.","output":"John Adams (1735-1826) was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, educated in law at Harvard University and is one of the earliest to be identified with the cause of independence. He served in both the First and Second Continental Congress. As a diplomat for the fledgling country of America, he became a diplomat to France and Holland and, from 1785 to 1788 was the American minister to the Court of St. James. As such, he negotiated the treaty of peace with Britain. Elected George Washington‚Äôs Vice President, he found the office to be ‚Äúthe most insignificant ‚Ä¶ ever‚Äù invented. Adams took office in 1797 and spent most of his presidency tackling conflicts with France. In 1880, just prior to losing the presidential election to Thomas Jefferson, Adams and his wife moved into the White House, writing the wish that ‚Äúnone but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.‚Äù In 1801, he retired to his farm in Quincy, Massachusetts where he often wrote to Thomas Jefferson. Adams died on July 4, 1826, uttering his last words, ‚ÄúThomas Jefferson survives.‚Äù Ironically, Jefferson had himself died hours earlier."},{"instruction":"Write a story for a child that is 250 words maximum and has a lion talking to a tiger about brushing teeth.","output":"On a hot summer day in the African savannah, a tiger named Joel walked up to his lion friend Zeke and moaned in pain.

He gave a quick grin to his friend at the welcomed flavor. The bubbles made his tongue tingle as he brushed his teeth up and down. After he finished, Zeke took a big drink of water to swish out the suds and smiled the biggest smile in the world. \\"How do you feel now?\\" asked Zeke. \\"I feel roaring good!

In common usage, climate change describes global warming‚Äîthe ongoing increase in global average temperature‚Äîand its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming. Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[9] Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[10] The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[11] Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.[12] Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.[13] Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change. Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 ¬∞C (2.2 ¬∞F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[14] Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \\"well under 2 ¬∞C\\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 ¬∞C (4.9 ¬∞F) by the end of the century.[15] Limiting warming to 1.5 ¬∞C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[16] Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, nuclear and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.[18][19] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.[20]","output":"What is climate change? Climate change describes global warming‚Äîthe ongoing increase in global average temperature‚Äîand its effects on Earth's climate system.

Can we learn to live with climate change? Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Are poor countries affected? Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change. Do governments do enough? Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \\"well under 2 ¬∞C\\".

Hyaluronic Acid It‚Äôs an ingredient that is currently all the rage in skincare, but it‚Äôs so much more than just a trend. Hyaluronic acid is a literal hydration lifesaver because it can hold about 1,000 times its weight in water. This type of acid acts as a humectant, a potent ingredient that‚Äôs basically a sponge, pulling in water and coating your complexion with the hydration it so desperately needs. Adding hyaluronic acid to your moisturizing routine will result in plump, supple, and youthful skin. Want to know even more about hyaluronic acid? You‚Äôre in luck. We have an entire article about it right here! 2. Essential Oils Essential oils are very trendy at the moment, but their benefits go far beyond their current rage. Most of the essential oils that are used in skincare are fatty acids that will absorb on skin surfaces quickly and effectively, providing ample moisture that won‚Äôt dry out and a smoother, creamier complexion. There are plenty of essential oils out there that are often included in moisturizers, but a few of our favorite (and a few of the most effective) include oils like jojoba, avocado, kukui nut, rosehip, calendula, argan, apricot kernel, and more. Typically, oils can be used inside a moisturizing product or added into a moisturizing product through a serum drop. 3. Ceramides If you‚Äôve never heard of ceramides, don‚Äôt fret‚Äîthat‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here. Ceramides are long chains of skin lipids that are already a part of your skin‚Äôs outer layer. So, adding extra ceramides to your skincare routine helps to increase and reinforce your skin‚Äôs natural moisture barrier. When you add ceramide moisturizers into your routine, you ensure that your skin‚Äôs surface is hydrated and that you‚Äôre creating a protective barrier that will keep environmental pollutants out. 4. Glycerin Like Hyaluronic acid, Glycerin is a humectant-like ingredient that helps to attract and lock in important moisture on your skin‚Äôs surface. Many moisturizing products out there already include glycerin, but we suggest double checking all labels to ensure your moisturizer has a healthy dose of this ingredient. Glycerin helps to hydrate dried out, thirsty skin and aims to leave skin surfaces feeling soft, younger, and more supple. 5. Sunscreen Or Sun Blocking Agents No, a great moisturizer doesn‚Äôt always include a solid sun-blocking agent in it (especially since sunscreen isn‚Äôt a key ingredient in most moisturizing products). But we offer major bonus points to moisturizers that include a dash of sun protection in them. No, this won‚Äôt necessarily rescue your dry, damaged skin, and no, it won‚Äôt keep your skin well-hydrated, but it will help to prevent any further dryness, redness, or damage from the sun‚Äîand why wouldn‚Äôt you want to add that in as an effective moisturizer ingredient?

After several years, those efforts were successful. As most of the market could receive channel 57 without issue, in October 1999, channel 69 became an affiliate of The WB with its own schedule. The station's callsign was changed to WMWB-LP (standing for \\"Michiana's WB\\"). After Weigel purchased WYGN-LP (channel 25, now CW affiliate WCWW-LD) in 2002 from 3ABN, Weigel chose to move channel 69's schedule, call letters, and WB affiliation to that station, which was closer to the majority of the channels on the South Bend television dial. Channel 69 then adopted channel 25's former WRDY-LP call letters. It later changed its calls three more times: first to WAAT-LP in 2004, then briefly to WCWW-LP in March 2006. From 2002 until 2004, it was once again simulcasting ABC programming from WBND-LP; after that, it returned to being an independent station, with occasional programming from the Sportsman Channel.","output":"W69BT, which originally served as a translator for WCIU-TV, became the ABC affiliate for the South Bend market in 1995.

Americans who were born in the 1840s and 1850s would experience enormous changes in their lifetimes. Some of these changes resulted from a sweeping technological revolution. Their major source of light, for example, would change from candles to kerosene lamps, and then to electric light bulbs. They would see their transportation evolve from walking and horse power to steam-powered locomotives, to electric trolley cars, to gasoline-powered automobiles. Born into a society in which the vast majority of people were involved in agriculture, they experienced an industrial revolution that radically changed the ways millions of people worked and where they lived.

Something that was surprising to me is that everything was quoted in US dollars so it's easiest to pay in dollars everywhere.

Cabot is known today as Giovanni Caboto in Italian, Zuan Caboto in Venetian, Jean Cabot in French, and John Cabot in English.

In Venice Cabot signed his name as \\"Zuan Chabotto\\", Zuan being a form of John typical to Venice.[5] He continued to use this form in England, at least among Italians. He was referred to by his Italian banker in London as \\"Giovanni\\", in the only known contemporaneous document to use this version of his first name.[6] Cabot was born in Italy, the son of Giulio Caboto and his wife; he had a brother Piero.[7] Gaeta (in the Province of Latina) and Castiglione Chiavarese (in the Province of Genoa) have both been proposed as birthplaces.[7][8] The main evidence for Gaeta are records of a Caboto family residing there until the mid-15th century, but ceasing to be traceable after 1443.[9] Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish envoy and Cabot's contemporary in London, described him in a letter to the Spanish Crown in 1498 as \\"another Genoese like Columbus\\".[10] John Cabot's son, Sebastian, said his father originally came from Genoa.

She was very fond of having the last word. One day she spoke rudely to the great Juno, who said that for this offence Echo should never use her voice again, unless to repeat what she had just heard, but since she was so very fond of last words, she might repeat the last words of others. This was almost as bad as if Juno had changed her into a parrot. Echo was very much ashamed, and hid herself in the forest. Narcissus, a young man who had hair as yellow as gold and eyes as blue as the sky, - a very rare thing in Greece, where most people were very dark, - used to hunt in the forest where Echo was hiding. As she was peeping out shyly from some cave or from behind a great tree, Echo often saw Narcissus, and she admired him very much. One day Narcissus became separated from his friends, and hearing something rustle among the leaves, he called out, \\"Who's here?\\" \\"Here,\\" answered Echo. \\"Here I am. Come!\\" said Narcissus. Echo and Narcissus Picture of Echo \\"I am come,\\" said Echo; and, as she spoke, she came out from among the trees. When Narcissus saw a stranger, instead of one of his friends as he had expected, he looked surprised and walked quickly away. After this, Echo never came out and allowed herself to be seen again, and in time she faded away till she became only a voice. This voice was heard for many, many years in forests and among mountains, particularly in caves. In their solitary walks, hunters often heard it. Sometimes it mocked the barking of their dogs; sometimes it repeated their own last words. It always had a weird and mournful sound, and seemed to make lonely places more lonely still.","output":"In the depths of a sprawling metropolis, where steam hissed through corroded pipes and neon lights flickered with a cybernetic pulse, resided Echo, a restless automaton with a penchant for incessant chatter. She possessed an insatiable desire for the final word of every conversation. One fateful day, her sharp words pierced the ears of the great techno-deity, Juno. In response to this affront, Juno decreed that Echo would forever be deprived of her voice, only permitted to echo the words of others. The punishment was akin to a cruel twist of fate, transforming Echo into a mere machine, a mechanical parrot bereft into the shadowy depths of the metropolis, seeking solace within its labyrinthine alleys. Amidst the towering spires and labyrinthine streets, Narcissus emerged as a figure of fascination, his cybernetic hair shimmering like a cascade of golden circuity, and his eyes glowed with the luminescence of the azure sky - an anomaly in a world cloaked in darkness. He was a rarity, for most denizens of the city bore the mark of perpetual night. Narcissus, known for his explorations within the sprawling urban forest where Echo sought sanctuary, often caught glimpses of her elusive figure lurking behind the smog-shrouded caverns or among colossal synthetic trees. Echo, captivated by his presence, found herself captivated by his cyber-augmented aura. One day, fate wove its intricate pattern, and Narcissues found himself separated from his companions, his metallic voice resonating through the foliage, questioning the unseen presence. \\"Who lingers in this realm?\\" he asked. \\"Realm,\\" Replied Echo, her voice a symphony of digitized reverberation. \\"Reveal thyself,\\" Narcissus beaconed. \\"I beckon,\\" Echo whispered, emerging from the urban jungle as she uttered her words. Upon witnessing an unfamiliar countenance instead of the anticipated faces of his comrades, Narcissis were a. bewildered expression and swiftly turned away, abandoning the encounter. From that day forward, Echo retreated deeper into her seclusion, forever veiling herself from prying eyes. As time went on, her essence dwindled to naught but a spectral voice, haunting the recesses of the neon-lit forests and towering buildings. Hunters who dared to venture into the desolate corners of the city often encountered her ethereal presence. Sometimes, she mimicked the bark of their cybernetic canines; other times, she replicated their own parting words. Her tone always carried an unearthly, mournful resonance, amplifying the solitude of these desolate domains."},{"instruction":"Write me a tweet about the severe storm warning, hail, possible tornadoes expected","output":"A severe storm warning and tornado watch are underway; hail is expected - take shelter!"},{"instruction":"Shorten this intro into one sentence for me: It's time for another out-of-this-world adventure with \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.\\" The latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe from writer-director James Gunn arrives in theaters today and features the return of the MCU's now-iconic ragtag band of misfit superheroes.

His appetite was large, and he loved nothing more than eating, basking in the sun, and oinking to his heart's delight. Usually, the barnyard was pretty busy, and he was always trying to not get stepped on or in someone's way. Today, though, everyone was missing. Stuart the potbelly pig was gone, as were the people that usually stopped by to give him pets and shake hay into the playpen. Even the horses on the other side of the fence weren't out this morning. Orwell started to get a bit worried. He knew there was a big state fair in town, and Stuart warned him that things would be different when the big day came. Today must be that day, but he didn't even realize it. They must have snuck out while he was asleep, even his Mom. But now there was nobody around for Orwell to talk to or bother. He roamed from place to place. First, he checked out the sty outside, but the mud didn't seem very enjoyable. Then he went back inside the barn to find a nice parcel of hay to nestle down into. But every time he tried to get comfortable, a hay needle would poke him in just the wrong spot. Up he got again, pacing around the other stalls in the barn, missing his friends. Orwell didn't realize it earlier in the morning, but he was lonely. He always thought that the others were a bother before and wished they were out of his way. Now that they were gone, all he wanted was for them to be back again. Even his Mom, who always told him to not make such a mess and to quiet down.

She had bizarre encounters and extraordinary events every single day. On Monday, Willow came to work with an identical hat and brilliant purple hair. \\"Welcome to the enchanted emporium of amazing deals!\\" Willow greeted the first client when they walked up to the cash register. As the day went on, Willow's magic mingled with her cashier duties, causing chaos and uncertainty. When a customer's items became too heavy, she waved her hand, and the items miraculously floated to the car, startling the stunned customer. On another occasion, when a tower of cans was accidentally knocked over by a child, Willow crafted a flawless dance for them before cautiously restocking the shelves with them. Her miraculous mistakes, however, also had some amusing outcomes. When someone tried to purchase a single candy bar, Willow accidentally transformed it into a massive lollipop. The delighted customer gladly carried it away while giving Willow a wink and a smile. Jake, Willow's coworker, greeted her with a smile at lunch. \\"Hey, Willow, any way you might conjure up magic to erase these huge lines?\\" Willow took out her wand and lightly touched the cash register. Miraculously, the line vanished into thin air, leaving Jake in awe. After a hearty laugh, Willow swiftly restored the line to keep up the store's operation. Willow finished handling her final customer, an elderly woman who had lost her shopping list. The lady's list was pulled from her memory by Willow after she gave the woman a forehead touch and waved a spell. The client left feeling as though she had witnessed an air of magic. Willow couldn't help but remember her incredible day as she closed the shop. She began to understand that everyone around her felt joy, surprise, and a dash of laughter because of her amazing abilities. Her lovely antics continued to fascinate the ordinary world, serving as a reminder to everyone that sometimes the most magical moments can be found in the most unlikely of places."},{"instruction":"Type up a petition to encourage the local government to penalize those who go significantly below the speed limit on mountain roads; explain the potential dangers of such a situation, and address the petition to the board of tourism since visitors seem to be operating the automobiles causing the most problems.

Here are some ideas for features you might include given your constraints. 1. Reviews: Given that this is a fanzine and your fellow writers likely are not able to compete with the release schedule of a larger publication, your reviews could focus more on an in-depth analysis of elements you enjoyed or from your own personal perspective. There is less pressure as well to release your reviews concurrently with the release of the game. 2. Retrospectives: Perhaps there are games that you have wanted to write about for a long time. As a fanzine, you are less constrained by a need to stay current with the games you cover. 3. Modding Corner: Independently produced mods for games rarely get coverage by mainstream publications, so this is a niche that your fanzine might seek to fill. 4. Predictions: As a fanzine, you likely do not have advanced knowledge or access to game previews, but you also lack any agreements to avoid discussing future content. As such your fanzine is free to make predictions or express hope for certain games or features to be released. 5. Is it good now?: Another topic that fanzines may be better placed to discuss are games that were released to poor reviews, but through patches and additional content updates have become much improved, even though they have fallen behind the publicity cycle."},{"instruction":"I'm off to try gelato for the first time!

Thespis of Icaria is considered to be the first actor in the theatre. The English word ‚Äúthespian,‚Äù which means actor, is derived from his name. Along with being an actor on the Ancient Greek stage, Thespis was also a celebrated playwright, stage director and producer. None of his plays are extant. His innovations included connecting the chorus directly to the plot, developing the idea of the power of the protagonist in drama and replacing cruder dithyrambic makeup with more refined linen masks to delineate character. Aristotle‚Äôs Take According to Aristotle, Thespis transformed the presentation of stories forever by emerging from the Greek chorus and acting an individual role. Greek tragedy is said to have been descendent from dithyrambic poetry, which were the choral presentations of Greek myth that included movement. With Thespis, the chorus remained playing its role, while the first actor played various roles by switching masks. Greek tragedy would not add another principal actor to the stage until some 50 years later in the fifth century when playwright/actor Aeschylus first wrote tragedies to be performed by two actors and a chorus. Pisistratus‚Äô Command Performance When the head of state requests something, you do it. After Athenian military man and tyrant Pisistratus came to power in 560 BC, he instituted many artistic and cultural innovations. One thing he did was he expanded the offerings at the City of Dionysia by having plays performed. It‚Äôs said that Pisistratus asked Thespis and his troupe to perform in that initial drama festival in 534 BCE. Thespis did, and he won the first prize for best tragedy. Solon‚Äôs Criticism According to Plutarch, Athenian lawmaker and leader Solon went to see Thespis perform. It‚Äôs noted by Plutarch that this was when Thespis had first started acting and tragedy was a new form. Solon was elderly and living a leisurely life and in addressing Thespis after his performance he asked, ‚Äúif he was not ashamed to tell so many lies before such a number of people; and Thespis replying that it was no harm to say or do so in a play, Solon vehemently struck his staff against the ground: ‚ÄòAh,‚Äù he said, ‚Äòif we honor and commend such play as this, we shall find it some day in our business.‚Äô‚Äù That‚Äôs the first recorded criticism of an actor that we have on hand, and it was made, ironically, by a politician. Thespis Center Stage Although we‚Äôll never know if Thespis was the first actor on the stage, we are more certain that he was the first actor in scripted drama to appear on the Athenian stage. However, we can‚Äôt even be certain about this. We do know that Thespis won first prize in 534 BC for best tragedy in the initial City of Dionysia festival and that he was influential enough to be written about by Aristotle in The Poetics, which is the first document we possess focusing on dramatic criticism. Whether or not he was actually the first actor on the stage doesn‚Äôt matter; Thespis was influential enough to be considered a groundbreaking force in the Ancient Greek theatre.","output":"In English, the word for actor, ‚Äúthespian‚Äù, comes from the name of the person credited with being the first actor, Thespis of Icaria. A famous playwright (none extant), stage director and producer of ancient Greece, Thespis' most important theatrical innovation was to step out from the chorus to play an individual role. Previously, productions had consisted of the chorus presenting in unison Greek myths by using voice and movement. Thespis retained the chorus‚Äô role while switching masks to represent a single lead character. It would take an additional 50 years for playwright Aeschylus to introduce a second actor. We know with certainty that Thespis won first prize in the City of Dionysia in 534 BCE and was influential enough to be written about by Aristotle in his work, The Poetics."},{"instruction":"Can you give me a JS function that produces a random hex colour?","output":"Of course!

Please write an article about three things you should never say on a first date and why you shouldn't say them. Keep it funny and write it from the perspective of someone who is very worried about saying the wrong thing. Add what the person should do if they misspeak and say something they wish they hadn't. Be sure to start with a brief introductory article and number the paragraphs. Write a header for each paragraph.","output":"Going on a first date is a bit like an audition. No matter how much you prepare, you still worry about forgetting your lines or, worse yet, saying the wrong thing. Here are some tips on how to avoid common first-date pitfalls so you can put your best foot forward. 1. Take the High Ground Your mother was right when she told you to \\"mind your manners.\\" The purpose behind courtesy and manners is to give respect to and show consideration for those around you. Doing small things like holding open a door, not cutting off your date in mid-sentence, and saying \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" go a long way to lowering the anxiety level for both of you. If you have a tendency to swear or use vulgar language, keep it in check. Bad language gives off bad vibes. 2. Forget Your Ex Sharing life experiences helps you learn about each other but keep your past relationships under wraps. No one wants to hear how your last date was crazy or why you only seem to attract weird-os. In the same vein, avoid saying anything that starts with \\"all men\\" or \\"all women.\\" This automatically lumps your date into a category you expressly don't like and make them wonder why they're wasting their time going out with you. If your date talks about their past relationships, do not judge or ask about their body count. If it makes you uncomfortable, tactfully change the subject and let it go. 3. Don't Get Personal Don't ask how much your date weighs. Ever. If your date mentions they struggle with their weight, don't say anything negative or demeaning. If you must respond, keep it neutral by observing that many people have the same problem and leave it at that. Ditto asking your date their age. It's none of your business unless your date looks like they're under 18; then, by all means, ask. Avoid hot-button subjects like religion, race, politics, and social issues. And save the sex talk for later when the relationship is more established and intimate."},{"instruction":"Hey AI, I'm looking for different vacation spots.

As I felt my roots take hold in the soil and my branches sprouting, I knew that I would tower over all of the other trees in the forest. Yes, I had a long way to go.

They were already bathing in the sun and I could feel the warmth emanating off their canopy of leaves while I shivered. The mighty oaks never wavered in the strong winds as I did. Their plump green leaves softly swayed while my thin needles quaked. I knew I needed more than mere hope to keep me alive. How could I possibly compete against these Titans? And then, the night of the storm came. Ferocious, the wind howled like one of the forest animals. Thunder snarled and at some point, lightning set the forest ablaze. Now the heat was tremendous. But, as I came to realize at dawn, it hadn‚Äôt been the forest set afire at all. It had been one of the mighty oaks beside me. Black as tar down the center, the oak had been split in two. When the sun reached high in the sky, I felt its warm embrace for the first time. At last, I was truly beginning to grow."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this table of aftershow concerts into a summary, centered around a bulleted list of shows using the following format: ARTIST: VENUE, TIME.

We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.","output":"President John F. Kennedy shared several goals about the space race with the audience. He spoke of the goals of exploring space without going to war with other nations and not repeating the past mistakes made on Earth.

He answers that the goal of reaching the moon fulfills the challenge of overcoming the hardships and difficulties associated with that task."},{"instruction":"What is a Queen consort and what do they do?","output":"The title of Queen consort is given to the wife of the reigning king.

Allow me to introduce you to Boris, my adorable pet chinchilla. His incredibly soft fur, happy and goofy personality, and playful antics have made Boris an integral part of my life. I want to share with you the wonders of owning a chinchilla, and why Boris is such an amazing companion. Boris: Adorable Ball Of Fur Boris, my chinchilla I love so, brings so much joy. His luxurious fur is a striking shade of charcoal, which not only makes him adorable but also makes him exceptionally soft to pet. Boris is the definition of cuteness, with his large, round eyes and delicate little whiskers that twitch constantly with curiosity. His fur is so thick it looks like he is a pure fur cloud. Personality For Days Though small in size, chinchillas have big, vibrant and entertaining personalities. Boris is no exception to this at all! He is always on the move, checking out his surroundings with boundless curiosity and energy. He hops around his cage playing or doing some of his favorite things, like chewing on sticks or leaping from one platform to another and never fails to make me chuckle. A Low-Maintenance Pet One of the great things about owning a chinchilla is how low maintenance they are. Boris can entertain himself and keeps himself impeccably clean. Chinchillas' self-grooming habits rival those of a cat. He takes regular dust baths as part of his hygiene routine. Boris does require regular teeth maintenance as his teeth continue growing and have to be filed down. Fantastic Companionship Chinchillas have an independent streak, but they also crave companionship. Boris loves to spend time with me, cuddling up in my hands or on my shoulder. Chinchillas are highly intelligent animals that bond well and are very responsive to their owners. Boris, my charming chinchilla friend, has brought so much happiness into my life. His soft fur and goofy personality enchant everyone who meets him. If you're looking for a new pet addition to your family, I highly recommend considering a chinchilla. Chinchillas like Boris are truly extraordinary companions! Prepare to fall in love with the fluffiness and endless entertainment of the world of chinchillas!"},{"instruction":"The Fox and the Goat is one of my favorite Aesop's fables. However, can you rewrite this text so that it fleshes out both characters a little more?","output":"A fox was prancing about, chasing a butterfly. He had nothing else better to do on this day. While chasing the butterfly, the fox lost sight of where he was going. He soon fell into a well. Thankfully for the fox, the well wasn't deep. But despite trying many times to climb out of the well, he could not. Hours passed by in the day, and the fox waited helplessly for help to arrive. That help would arrive in the form of a goat. The goat had gone thirsty and had wandered away from his home farm. The goat glanced down into the well to see the fox. \\"Hey! Did you go down there to drink some water?\\" the goat asked. \\"Some fine water down here for sure!\\" the fox replied. \\"Maybe you should jump in here with me and try it.\\" The goat shook his head. \\"No thanks! I'll head over to a river stream that's a mile away from here!\\" The fox's ears began to twitch. \\"Why do that? Wouldn't that take you too long a time?\\" The goat looked confused. \\"What do you mean?\\" The fox then nodded with a sly smile. \\"I know you! You're that goat who calls that one large farmland home, right? I walk past your chicken coops all the time! It's taken you one mile to get here already! Why go another mile to get water when you can get it here?\\" The goat then combed his furry beard with a hoof. \\"Come to think of it... You're right! I'll jump in after all!\\" The fox waited patiently for the goat to jump into the well to get a drink. Once he saw the goat touch down on the wet ground, the fox made his move. The fox jumped on the goat's back and then leaped off the top of the goat's horns to reach the rim of the well. Now out of the well, the fox danced about in victory, taunting the goat. \\"By all means, drink your water, my friend!\\" the fox started laughing. \\"But your beard doesn't match your wisdom... or lack thereof! Next time, look before you leap!\\" Watching the fox run off, the goat sighed. \\"Just don't hurt those chickens!\\""},{"instruction":"Write a tweet about how learning is great","output":"\\"Learning is the key that unlocks endless possibilities.

Highlight that while they're held up as likable heroes, they actually killed a lot of people and police officers. The take should be realistic.","output":"Bonnie Parker met Clyde Barrow when she was just 19 years old. At the time, her husband (whom she had married when she was 16) was serving time in jail for murder. A short time later, Clyde was imprisoned for robbery. Bonnie visited him every day and eventually smuggled a gun into the prison to help him escape. He was caught shortly after his escape, however, and sent back to prison. Later, in 1932, he was released on parole and the two immediately reconnected. After they stole a car and committed several robberies, Bonnie was caught and did a short 2-month stint in jail. After her release and for the next 21 months, the couple worked with various accomplices to rob banks and stores across five states: Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Louisiana. They had multiple close calls wherein they narrowly escaped capture during surprise raids, but they seemed to always come out on top. Their flamboyant encounters with police and sensationalized stories in the news added to their notoriety and infamy. Bonnie's womanhood, which was quite uncommon in the criminal world in those days, and their love story further romanticized their crime spree. Add to it the fact that in the early 1930s, America was right in the middle of the Great Depression and people were fed up with banks, which they viewed as oppressive and greedy. But while some Americans viewed them as Robin Hood-style heroes, the gruesome reality is that they were ruthless killers who were responsible for the deaths of 13 people, including 9 police officers. Bonnie and Clyde continued to evade capture while being pursued by various state law enforcement officials, so Texan prison officials eventually hired retired Texas Ranger Captain Frank Hamer to assemble a posse and track them down. After a three-month investigation, and using inside information from a friend who betrayed the duo, Hamer tracked them to Louisiana. Early in the morning on May 23, 1934, Louisiana and Texas lawmen huddled in the bushes on the side of a country highway. When Bonnie & Clyde drove through in their Ford V-8, the law enforcement officers pumped more than 130 rounds of bullets into their car, killing them both."},{"instruction":"Write a facebook ad post advertising the new ‚Äúsquirtyburty 2000‚Äù water pistol for my drop shipping business.","output":"Get ready to soak your friends and family this summer.

Set your alarm to work for you ‚Äî not against you The first step to kicking your day off right is adjusting your sleep schedule to ensure you have enough time in the morning for yourself and your responsibilities. If your kids get up at 6:30 a.m., this means getting up before them. Or, even if you don‚Äôt have kids or pets to care for, if you usually get up at 7 a.m. to scramble out the door by 7:30, it‚Äôs time for you to start your days earlier. That said, sleep is important. When you adjust your alarm to wake up sooner, you also need to adjust your bedtime to turn in earlier. There is nothing healthy about being sleep deprived, so aim to get at least seven hours of sleep. 2. Breathe in the new day What‚Äôs the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? Unfortunately, for many people, the answer is ‚Äúreaching for my phone.‚Äù If that‚Äôs you, how many minutes do you spend each morning scrolling and potentially letting stress build due to what you find on the news, social media or checking messages? What if you made a rule that ‚Äî before reaching for you phone ‚Äî you took six long, deep breaths to focus your attention on the power and blessing of your own life force? Because the diaphragm acts as both a respiratory and core postural muscle, diaphragmatic breathing not only helps you positively focus your mind, it primes your body to support movement and good posture. 3. Drink water before coffee Because we lose water through our breath and sweat while we sleep, we usually wake up thirsty. Considering that the adult human body is comprised of up to 60% water, hydration is essential for good health. Drinking water first thing in the morning will not only help rehydrate you but can also jump-start your metabolism, boosting it by up to 30%, according to research. 4. Move your body in all directions There is a reason we instinctively stretch when we first wake up. Our bodies crave movement after being sedentary. Why not direct that instinct to be as productive as possible? Rather than only doing a quick stretch in bed and then going about your day, favoring your dominant side, set your body right and prepare it for daily activity by taking it through all planes of motion, evenly using both sides of our bodies. You can accomplish this with a quick yoga flow or this 10-minute body-weight workout: 5. Make time to exercise Maybe you can‚Äôt fit in a full workout in the morning. That‚Äôs OK. You can sneak in exercise by stacking it onto some of your existing morning habits. For years now, I‚Äôve been doing push-ups before I get into the shower and squats while I brush my teeth. It‚Äôs called habit stacking, a concept James Clear references in his book, ‚ÄúAtomic Habits.‚Äù By stacking a new exercise habit onto a morning habit that is already ingrained, it makes it easier to sustain. 6. Set your mind right Give yourself a clean slate to start the day with just a few minutes of mindfulness meditation. There are numerous apps that offer free guided meditations under 10 minutes. Or you can set a timer on your phone to whatever length and sit quietly focused on the sensations of your breath or quietly repeating a positive affirmation, mantra or intention you want to set for your day. 7. Cultivate an attitude of gratitude Research shows that practicing gratitude can decrease pain, enhance empathy and reduce aggression ‚Äî which is a great way to start your day, especially if you have a morning commute in traffic. You can practice gratitude in the morning by waking each day to watch the sunrise, writing things you are grateful for in a journal, or incorporating a gratitude focus into your meditation. Personally, I share a gratitude white board with my husband, and we each write three things on it nightly. It‚Äôs technically a nighttime habit, but because of its location in our master bathroom, it‚Äôs one of the first things we see every morning. We‚Äôve done it for many years now, and I still love waking up to see what he wrote and being reminded of what I was grateful for from the day before. 8. Make your bed By making your bed every morning, you demonstrate to yourself that you take personal responsibility for your tasks and commit to keeping your personal space comfortable and tidy. It sets a precedent that reinforces the foundation of your ability to follow through. For more on this, check out Adm. William H. McRaven‚Äôs book ‚ÄúMake Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life ‚Ä¶ and Maybe the World.‚Äù 9. Repeat your routine This is the hardest part. Establishing a routine is not easy. It‚Äôs understandable, if you start out strong but then falter. If you sleep in one morning or forget some new habits, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself ‚Ä¶ but also don‚Äôt give up. Start again the next morning and try some of the suggestions below to help keep you on track.","output":"1. Your alarm clock is a tool, not a miracle worker Waking up in the morning is an important part of starting the day (go figure) and alarms can help remind us when we have to drag ourselves out of bed to fulfill our daily responsibilities. However, waking up early won't do anything for you if you're not going to bed early, too. Make sure you're letting yourself get your much-needed beauty sleep in the night so that you can wake up refreshed and feel less dread at the idea of getting out of bed. 2. Remember how to breathe When waking up, it's important to remember basic functions such as breathing. Unfortunately, for some of us, we're quick to remember all the things we possibly missed online, and reach for a phone quicker than we are to take a moment and breathe. In the morning, make a note to remind yourself that breathing is just as important, and maybe take a minute or two to do so before you think about all the things that could've gone wrong while you were asleep. (It might help you feel less stressed while you're at it, too.) 3. Hydration is important, too A lot of us rely on coffee to help us wake up in the morning and keep our eyes open during some of the more depressing/tiresome days. Coupled with the fact that we wake up thirsty, we might be tempted to brew a cup of joe before we've even had any water. However, it's best to start off the day with that cup of water instead, which can help you feel more alert anyway by boosting your metabolism. Remember that we're mostly made up of water, and actually having it is good for us. 4. Limber up, why don't you? While you're at it, one of the things we also need after sleep is some movement. After being still in bed all night, we can get stiff and need to relieve that after waking up. Instead of just doing a quick stretch, put some effort into it and really move about. Make sure you get as much of your body, maybe even run through a quick yoga routine to make it more guided and deliberate. (Maybe more convenient, too, if you like being told what to do.) 5. Speaking of moving, put your back into it! It might be hard to put an exercise regimen in your morning routine, but maybe you can intersperse exercise throughout it. Maybe you could do some push-ups or sit-ups while you wait for the aforementioned cup of coffee. (If you really can't let that one go: trust me, I know.) Maybe you could also exercise while doing things that require you to stand still. 6. Take a break from the endless buzz of the modern world Getting your mind off of all the things that the day will throw at you can bring some serious peace (once again, I know). Set aside a short amount of time like ten minutes to sit and meditate, using whatever means are the best for you. That could be an app or video which gives a guided experience, or just a timer and yourself. Whatever works best ‚Äî if you can stand to be alone with your thoughts, at least. 7. Be grateful for the things you have I know it sounds cheesy, but bear with me. Practicing gratitude in the morning ‚Äî or even throughout the day ‚Äî can markedly improve the way you feel and respond to the challenges of daily life. It mostly involves simple activities like taking a moment to appreciate the sunrise, writing in a journal about the things you are happy to have, or maybe focusing on them during your meditation. It can have a dramatic impact on your mood, especially if you've got a long and boorish commute in the morning. 8. Clean up after yourself Taking some personal accountability and tidying up your bed in the morning can be big for establishing that you've got a handle on yourself. Keeping your personal space neat and clean is a way of showing yourself that you're willing to take the initiative and follow up on it. Who knew? 9. Be reliable and keep at it The most important thing is sticking to your guns and keeping your routine. Don't beat yourself up for small setbacks or personal failings, but don't let that get in your way, either. Reliability is key, and you kind of owe it to yourself to at least try. (I certainly know I do.)"},{"instruction":"Request: Classify whether the following are the names of foods (beverages count as foods in this case) or the names of colors.

Even historically speaking, Kentucky has always been a border state, so even those that are from there are a bit confused about their geographical identity.

Create a strong tone of voice - For good brand awareness, you need consistency. That shouldn't just be with your logo or brand colors, but it should also be in the way you communicate with others and the words you use. You want consumers to be able to instantly recognize you even when your logo is not showing. Therefore having a strong tone of voice that resonates with your target audience is essential. 2. Develop a Referral Program - Research suggests that 49% of consumers in the United States say their friends and family are their top sources of brand awareness. Therefore a referral program can be highly effective when you want to get the word out about your brand. The same worked for well-known brands such as Dropbox and Paypal when they got their start. 3. Consider Using Influencer Marketing - When you have an influencer with a large following promoting your brand, you will instantly receive more brand awareness. But you don't have to depend on the most popular influencers on social media to get the word out. Micro-influencers who have smaller followings but focus on more niche topics can provide a substantial amount of help for companies looking to increase their brand awareness. 4. Use Your Branding Everywhere You Can - Make good use of your logo and place it everywhere you can to get your customers familiar with it. Take a cue from Amazon and place your logo on your shipping material so that it is easy to recognize. It is a little extra touch that can go a long way when it comes to helping consumers remember your brand and your company. 5. Make Good Use of SEO and Content Marketing - Search Engine Optimization and content marketing are two of the most helpful resources you have online when you want to raise brand awareness. But the rules and trends for these two things are always changing. So be sure to get caught up on the latest requirements for SEO and implement some new strategies into your website, blog, or social media content."},{"instruction":"Pocahontas asks ‚ÄúCan you paint with all the colors of the wind‚Äù. What color do you think was her favorite and why? Answer in 3 paragraphs.","output":"Pocahontas is a Native American princess who lives in harmony with nature and respects all living things. She sings ‚ÄúColors of the Wind‚Äù to John Smith, a European explorer who has a different worldview and believes that the land belongs to him. In the song, she challenges him to look beyond his own perspective and see the beauty and value of the natural world. The song‚Äôs lyrics are inspired by Native American poetry, music, and folklore, as well as a letter that was attributed to Chief Seattle, a leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish tribes. The letter expresses a deep connection with the earth and a concern for its preservation. The song also uses imagery and metaphors from various cultures, such as the Chinese concept of chi (the breath of life), the Hindu concept of prana (the life force), and the Greek concept of pneuma (the spirit). Based on the song‚Äôs message and tone, I think Pocahontas‚Äôs favorite color might be green. Green is the color of life, growth, harmony and balance. It is also the color of many plants and animals that Pocahontas loves and protects. Green represents her appreciation for the diversity and interdependence of all living things. Green also symbolizes her hope for a peaceful coexistence between her people and John Smith‚Äôs people."},{"instruction":"Write a letter to my dentist wishing him a Happy 42nd Birthday!

Involuntary physiological reactions such as the wetness of a vagina and the stiffness of a penis are emotionally so satisfying (which means, simultaneously, so erotic) because they signal a kind of approval that lies utterly beyond rational manipulation. Erections and lubrication simply cannot be effected by willpower and are therefore particularly true and honest indices of interest. In a world in which fake enthusiasms are rife, in which it is often hard to tell whether people really like us or whether they are being kind to us merely out of a sense of duty, the wet vagina and the stiff penis function as unambiguous agents of sincerity. A kiss is pleasurable because of the sensory receptivity of our lips, but a good deal of our excitement has nothing to do with the physical dimension of the act: It stems from the simple realization that someone else likes us quite a lot.","output":"In the realm of canal enchantment, involuntary psychological responses bewitch and enthrall, like the moist petals of a forbidden flower bathed in moonlight and the throbbing pulse of a virile shaft that yearns for the forbidden fruit.

The silken wetness that embraces a woman's secret sanctuary, a dew-kissed haven of longing, and the unyielding stiffness that claims a man's ardor, a pulsating monument of unbridled passion, intertwine in an intoxicating symphony of unspoken cravings, free from restrictions of will.

In a world where counterfeit fervor flourishes, where whispered words of affection might cloak ulterior motives, the wet vagina and the stiff penis function as unambiguous agents of sincerity. And yet, a kiss, oh wondrous reverie, delivers pleasures that extend beyond the receptive caress of our delicate lips and opens a gateway to a world where desires entwine. In that embrace, the melding of bodies transcends the boundaries of the flesh, finding resonance in profound understanding that harbors and affection for us that resonates in the deepest recesses of our most carnal desires."},{"instruction":"What did the Federal Security Service accuse Gershkovich of?

Andrew was delighted to make new friends and learn about the meerkats' way of life. He quickly learned that the meerkats were very social animals who loved working together to find food, protect their territory, and raise their young. He was fascinated by their teamwork and the fruits of their cooperation. Feeling inspired, Andrew decided to invite other animals to join him in a great group feast. He brought together a group of anteaters, a pack of pangolins, and many other aardvarks, and they formed a cooperative team. Together they hunted for termites, ants, and other precious food stores for their great feast.

You can get an infuser, or you can just add the fruit straight to the water. Try different fruit mixes, like strawberry and kiwi, to see what you like best. 3. Make fruit ice cubes. Chop up some fruit and add it to your ice cube trays with some water. Once the cubes are frozen, you can add them to your water to create a little hint of flavor. 4. Find a healthy mix-in. You can find liquid and powder water enhancers that have extra vitamin C, electrolytes, or even protein. The less sugar, the better. 5. Add bubbles. Find a club soda or seltzer or even buy a SodaStream to make your own bubbly water.

Every Sunday, Sam would sit outside his favorite diner and crack jokes to everyone who walked in. The store owner loved having him around because Sam had a special way of putting joy into the hearts of people. One day, a sad little girl and her mom were about to walk in. The little girl had been bawling because her ice cream had dropped earlier. As they were getting ready to head inside, Sam stopped them and looked at the little girl and her mom.

But after Sam had his fun putting joy into others' lives, he would come back home where he was reminded of his painful life. His wife and children had died in a tragic car crash, and with no one ever around, he always spent the final parts of his day crying alone, looking at his family pictures before eventually laying down.

For the first time in my life, I had failed an assignment. I didn't know what to do, and I tried to convince myself that it was somehow an error. I spoke to my teacher, who, thankfully, confirmed that it was indeed an error and my assignment had been mixed up with someone else's. My teacher must have noticed my distress and told me to stop defining myself by numbers. She said my worth is not defined by my GPA, and worrying about numbers constantly limits my creativity and equates my value to a mere average of my grades in school when I am worth so much more. Her words really resonated with me and made me think. I had spent my entire life worrying about getting a question wrong that I was not asking myself questions. Why am I so worried about numbers? Why have I limited myself so much? What do I actually want to do with my life? The words of my teacher taught me a valuable lesson.

To Kill a Mockingbird is primarily a novel about growing up under extraordinary circumstances in the 1930s in the Southern United States. The story covers a span of three years, during which the main characters undergo significant changes. Scout Finch lives with her brother Jem and their father Atticus in the fictitious town of Maycomb, Alabama. Maycomb is a small, close-knit town, and every family has its social station depending on where they live, who their parents are, and how long their ancestors have lived in Maycomb. A widower, Atticus raises his children by himself, with the help of kindly neighbors and a black housekeeper named Calpurnia. Scout and Jem almost instinctively understand the complexities and machinations of their neighborhood and town. The only neighbor who puzzles them is the mysterious Arthur Radley, nicknamed Boo, who never comes outside. When Dill, another neighbor's nephew, starts spending summers in Maycomb, the three children begin an obsessive ‚Äî and sometimes perilous ‚Äî quest to lure Boo outside. Scout is a tomboy who prefers the company of boys and generally solves her differences with her fists. She tries to make sense of a world that demands that she act like a lady, a brother who criticizes her for acting like a girl, and a father who accepts her just as she is. Scout hates school, gaining her most valuable education on her own street and from her father. Not quite midway through the story, Scout and Jem discover that their father is going to represent a black man named Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping and beating a white woman. Suddenly, Scout and Jem have to tolerate a barrage of racial slurs and insults because of Atticus' role in the trial. During this time, Scout has a very difficult time restraining from physically fighting with other children, a tendency that gets her in trouble with her Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack. Even Jem, the older and more levelheaded of the two, loses his temper a time or two. After responding to a neighbor's (Mrs. Dubose) verbal attack by destroying her plants, Jem is sentenced to read to her every day after school for one month. Ultimately, Scout and Jem learn a powerful lesson about bravery from this woman. As the trial draws nearer, Aunt Alexandra comes to live with them under the guise of providing a feminine influence for Scout. During the novel's last summer, Tom is tried and convicted even though Atticus proves that Tom could not have possibly committed the crime of which he is accused. In the process of presenting Tom's case, Atticus inadvertently insults and offends Bob Ewell, a nasty, lazy drunkard whose daughter is Tom's accuser. In spite of Tom's conviction, Ewell vows revenge on Atticus and the judge for besmirching his already tarnished name. All three children are bewildered by the jury's decision to convict; Atticus tries to explain why the jury's decision was in many ways a foregone conclusion. Shortly after the trial, Scout attends one of her aunt's Missionary Society meetings. Atticus interrupts the meeting to report that Tom Robinson had been killed in an escape attempt. Scout learns valuable lessons about achieving the ideal of womanhood and carrying on in the face of adversity that day. Things slowly return to normal in Maycomb, and Scout and Jem realize that Boo Radley is no longer an all-consuming curiosity. The story appears to be winding down, but then Bob Ewell starts making good on his threats of revenge. Scout is in the Halloween pageant at school, playing the part of a ham. With Atticus and Aunt Alexandra both too tired to attend, Jem agrees to take Scout to the school. After embarrassing herself on-stage, Scout elects to leave her ham costume on for the walk home with Jem. On the way home, the children hear odd noises, but convince themselves that the noises are coming from another friend who scared them on their way to school that evening. Suddenly, a scuffle occurs. Scout really can't see outside of her costume, but she hears Jem being pushed away, and she feels powerful arms squeezing her costume's chicken wire against her skin. During this attack, Jem badly breaks his arm. Scout gets just enough of a glimpse out of her costume to see a stranger carrying Jem back to their house. The sheriff arrives at the Finch house to announce that Bob Ewell has been found dead under the tree where the children were attacked, having fallen on his own knife. By this time, Scout realizes that the stranger is none other than Boo Radley, and that Boo is actually responsible for killing Ewell, thus saving her and Jem's lives. In spite of Atticus' insistence to the contrary, the sheriff refuses to press charges against Boo. Scout agrees with this decision and explains her understanding to her father. Boo sees Jem one more time and then asks Scout to take him home, but rather than escort him home as though he were a child, she has Boo escort her to his house as a gentleman would. With Boo safely home, Scout returns to Jem's room where Atticus is waiting. He reads her to sleep and then waits by Jem's bedside for his son to wake up.","output":"in the 1930s, a white lawyer defends a black man in front of a Southern, white jury and he and his family suffer reprisals."},{"instruction":"Write a statement about the sports you can play at your high school.

Yuriko rattled the key around in the lock on his front door. Immediately, he became concerned when he noticed that the door was not locked. He distinctly remembered locking the door before he left the tree house. Yuriko flung open the door to his home and noticed all of his belongings missing. Everything was taken, even the bed. Yuriko immediately called his friend, who helped him report the robbery to the police. The police provided Yuriko with a bed he could use but told him they could not recover his stuff yet, as they had been unable to catch the suspect. Yuriko demanded to know who the suspect was. He was very upset to find all of his stuff missing and was growing angry. His friend and the policeman reassured Yuriko that the culprit would be caught. The only information that the officer could provide about the suspect was that it was one of the local squirrels in the animal village. In order to save up money for new furniture, Yuriko took on a couple of new pastimes. First, he expanded his carrot garden so that he could grow extra crops to sell at the market. Second of all, he‚Äôs picked up fishing. In the mornings and late afternoons, you can often find Yuriko along the beach or down by the river with his fishing rod.

Skeletal muscles are composed of very long, thin cells that include the full complement of organelles needed for general cellular functions. In addition, more than 90 percent of the total volume of a skeletal muscle cell is composed of muscle proteins, including the contractile proteins actin and myosin. When a muscle cell is activated by its nerve cell, the interaction of actin and myosin generates force through so-called power strokes. The total force depends on the sum of all the power strokes occurring simultaneously within all of the cells of a muscle. The exact mechanism by which exercise enhances strength remains unclear, but its basic principles are understood. Overall, two processes appear to be involved: hypertrophy, or the enlargement of cells, and neural adaptations that enhance nerve-muscle interaction. Muscle cells subjected to regular bouts of exercise followed by periods of rest with sufficient dietary protein undergo hypertrophy as a response to the stress of training. (This should not be confused with short-term swelling due to water intake.) Enhanced muscle protein synthesis and incorporation of these proteins into cells cause hypertrophy. Because there are more potential power strokes associated with increased actin and myosin concentrations, the muscle can exhibit greater strength. Hypertrophy is aided by certain hormones and has a very strong genetic component as well. The neural basis of muscle strength enhancement primarily involves the ability to recruit more muscle cells--and thus more power strokes--in a simultaneous manner, a process referred to as synchronous activation. This is in contradistinction to the firing pattern seen in untrained muscle, where the cells take turns firing in an asynchronous manner. Training also decreases inhibitory neural feedback, a natural response of the central nervous system to feedback signals arising from the muscle. Such inhibition keeps the muscle from overworking and possibly ripping itself apart as it creates a level of force to which it is not accustomed. This neural adaptation generates significant strength gains with minimal hypertrophy and is responsible for much of the strength gains seen in women and adolescents who exercise. It also utilizes nerve and muscle cells already present and accounts for most of the strength increases recorded in the initial stages of all strength training, because hypertrophy is a much slower process, depending, as it does, on the creation of new muscle proteins. Thus, overall, the stress of repeated bouts of exercise yield neural as well as muscular enhancements to increase muscle strength.\\" Muscles such as biceps, pectorals and quadriceps are called skeletal muscles because they attach to the skeleton to generate motion.

Why is that? Well to start, the things in our body that make us strong are muscles, and the muscles that are attached to our bones are called \\"skeletal muscles.\\" For these skeletal muscles to move, your brain sends them messages, like a phone. The receiving part of the muscles for these messages is called actin and myosin proteins. When these proteins receive the message from the brain, they tell each other about the message. When they communicate with each other, this causes something called a \\"power stroke,\\" which allows muscle movement. Your muscles are made up of tiny building blocks called \\"muscle cells.\\" To get stronger, these muscle cells have to grow in size and be able to receive more messages from the brain. When you exercise and rest, your muscle cells have to grow in size to get used to this exercise. The process of muscle cells growing in size is called \\"hypertrophy.\\" Since your body wants to get stronger when you exercise, it makes sense that more and more parts of muscles receive messages from your brain to move, as a \\"strength in numbers\\" idea. Since more power strokes are being made, you naturally become stronger. This process is called \\"synchronous activation.\\" Overall, the more you exercise your body, the more your muscle cells will grow through \\"hypertrophy,\\" and the more parts of your muscles your brain can send messages to through a process called \\"synchronous activation.\\" Both of these processes make you stronger!"},{"instruction":"If a poem is titled \\"Hide and Seek\\" does that sound childish or mature?","output":"childish"},{"instruction":"I'm trying to understand PyTorch, but my brain hurts at this point. Can you explain this Python code for me? class Network(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4, 3) self.fc2 = nn.Linear(3, 2)","output":"Absolutely! What you see in that Python code is the beginnings of a neural network built in PyTorch. It starts by creating a Python class called \`Network\` that uses inheritance to adopt the properties and methods of the \`nn.Module\` class, which is PyTorch's base class for neural networks. When you create a neural network model, it should also have \`nn.Module\` as a subclass. The next line uses the \`__init__()\` function to assign the class the default parameters it needs to function, which always begin with \`self\` to represent the class itself and allow access to all parameters in the class. The \`__init__()\` function defines the attributes \`super().__init__()\`, \`self.fc1\`, and \`self.fc2\`, where \`super().__init__()\` will ensure that the class inherits from the base class. The attributes \`.fc1\` and \`.fc2\` are the first two fully connected layers of the neural network, which are defined with \`nn.Linear()\` using the size of the input and output features as parameters. In this case, the first layer will have an input size of 4 and an output size of 3, and the second layer will have an input size of 3 and an output size of 2. If a third layer is added, \`.fc3\` would most likely have an input size of 2 from the output of the second layer. Let me know if that's clear.

It was a deadly predator and skilled pack hunter. * Anomalocaris was a strange invertebrate that lived in the oceans 500 million years ago when the rest of the land was just rock. It was the largest animal on earth at this time and preyed on the other simple, soft-bodied creatures in the oceans. * Tyrannosaurus Rex lived during the Cretaceous period and preyed on other large dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus devoured its kill by ripping the flesh off in strips. It had to swallow its food whole because it was unable to chew so it risked choking. * Liopleurodon was a huge marine reptile, measuring up to 82 feet in body length. It lived during the Late Jurassic period, gliding silently through the warm, shallow seas, propelling itself by flapping its gigantic flippers. * Homo Sapiens are humans. The word means 'wise and knowing man'. Homo Sapiens evolved in Eastern Africa around 190,000 years ago. They possessed brain power and could solve complex problems.

A normal 25-foot tape measure should be fine to do the actual measurements. You‚Äôll need someone to help you, though. Be sure to include doors and windows. These measurements can really come in handy when you're out looking for new window coverings. Measure a room, then write down the measurements on a sheet of paper and put them in your diagram later so you can make sure to plug the numbers into the right spots. If you have a large house or a number of areas to measure, you can purchase a handy gadget called a Sonic Measuring Device. These come in all shapes and price ranges and usually have a built-in laser. You can spend from 20 to over 100 on this gadget, so use some common sense.

Make it at least 3 paragraphs.","output":"Manta Rays - The Majestic Creature Manta rays are a member of the family Mobulidae, alongside other rays such as eagle rays and devil rays. These fascinating creatures inhabit tropical and subtropical waters around the world, so they're fairly common. Manta rays have a wingspan that can exceed 23 feet and can weigh over 5,000 pounds. As filter feeders, these rays use their large mouths to capture plankton and small fish. Manta rays are gentle giants and do not pose a threat to humans. Manta rays have sharp heads, triangular pectoral fins, and horn-shaped cephalic fins located on both sides of their mouths, giving them the nickname, \\"devil fish\\". They are known to display a positive interaction with divers and are pretty inquisitive about their presence. Intriguingly, Mantas evolved from bottom-dwelling stingrays, eventually developing more wing-like pectoral fins. Mantas move through the water by the wing-like movements of these fins as well. They track down their prey by using visual and olfactory senses. As of recent, Mantas have faced significant threats from overfishing and habitat degradation, with human activities leading to the destruction of their natural habitats. Efforts to safeguard manta rays and their environments are underway, including the establishment of marine protected areas and the implementation of fishing regulations. Ecotourism has emerged as an approach to promoting conservation by providing economic benefits to local communities. Therefore, it is crucial for marine biologists and environmentalists to continue educating themselves about these captivating creatures.

Learn the vocabulary - There are technical terms you should know the definition of to read a micrometer correctly. Be sure you are familiar with these terms beforehand. 2. Wipe it off - The micrometer should be clean before you use it. Use a soft cloth between the spindle and the anvil to remove any grime or debris. 3. Position the item - Line up the item that you're measuring next to the anvil with one hand. Be sure it's steady and avoid any scratching. You can hold the micrometer in your free hand or use a stationary vise. 4. Spin the ratchet - The ratchet should be spun counter-clockwise, ensuring the 0 mark on the thimble lines up with the sleeve scale. Keep turning the ratchet until the spindle is close to making contact with the object being measured. 5. Lock the thimble - The thimble lock should be set when the micrometer is within proximity to the object. You should still have enough room to adjust the spindle if necessary. When you are sure the micrometer has measured the object correctly, you can take out the object, being careful to not scratch the surface of the anvil or spindle. 6. Read the results - While keeping the spindle stable, record the reading for the object you just measured."},{"instruction":"Write a friendly springtime newsletter to the residents of the Rolling Meadows Condominium Association from the Rolling Meadows Board of Directors.

Some ways you can keep your animal cool are by making sure they have accessible water, keeping them inside on hot days and watching for signs of overheating like panting and loss of energy.

Write as someone who is familiar with being a dog owner and knows the stress of leaving their pets at home alone with the possibility of barking and being stressed all day. This will really attract attention to those who have anxiety about leaving their dogs and it is hard to get places because of the stress.

Appliances and equipment Although there is no single cause that leads to an accidental house fire, there are some common factors that can lead to the accidental eruption of a fire. Appliances and other electrical equipment are some of the leading causes of house fires. Any device that generates heat such as a stove, clothes dryer, or a space heater, or one that will heat up after extended use such as a computer, is a potential fire hazard for your home. Additionally, any cooking vessels left unattended are another frequent cause of house fires. 2. Candles Every candle will have a warning label that states \\"A burning candle should never be left unsupervised\\". However many people will light a scented candle and forget about it until they start to burn uncontrollably. Candle fires are most likely to occur on Christmas Day, New Year's Day, and Christmas Eve. 3. Holiday decor Candles are not the only culprit that can lead to a tragic fire during the holiday season. Christmas tree lights and other decorations are also to blame. Live trees that are not watered properly and left to dry out are another easy target for a fire caused by the hot lights wrapped around them. 4. Electrical systems and devices Any device you own that uses electric power can start a fire and overheated lighting equipment is at the very top of that list. Questionable electrical work within a home, poorly connected circuits, loose wires, and improper grounding all pose a serious threat to homeowners. 5. Smoking Another common cause of house fire is due to negligence while smoking. People will often fall asleep while smoking cigarettes, and by doing so they can set their chairs, bed, or couch on fire. This can easily result in a fatality and cause the entire house to burn down. Another avoidable issue related to smoking is caused by discarding ashes that are still hot into the trash where they could ignite. 6. Chemicals and gasses Home fires can also be caused by sources of propane gas and natural gas. A sudden spark combined with a small leak could create a combustible situation. Improperly mixed household chemicals can also trigger combustion, which is why it's important to conduct this form of activity outside the home. 7. Lightning Lightning fires will most commonly occur during the summer months when afternoon or early evening storms are at their highest. Homes that are in heavily wooded areas are extremely vulnerable to lightning strikes and could set the surrounding area on fire as well."},{"instruction":"Write about a fight between two samurai. Make it as flashy as possible. The setting is a convenience store parking lot.","output":"In the glow of the convenience store parking lot, two samurai were preparing for battle. Both unsheathed their weapon, one in red and the other draped in blue. They stared at each other, wondering who would make the first strike. The two focused so hard that you could feel the tension between them. The only thing illuminating them are the fluorescent lights coming from the store. People that went into the store were kind enough to go behind them to not interrupt this grand struggle. One hour has passed, and both samurai have not moved from their spots. You can see how much they care. One samurai is giving off the energy of a ferocious tiger, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. The other is embracing the spirit of a deadly bear, swinging its claws with terrifying speed. The battle has long since started since the two animals have been fighting for them (in their minds.) The only thing disrupting this gigantic clash is the ring of the sliding doors opening as people enter and leave the convenience store that these two warriors are next to. Two hours later and the samurai are starting to get exhausted. Neither one of them moved an inch since pledging to do battle. The mind games between the tiger and the bear have been tiring for them both. The weight of the armor is starting to make both of the warriors succumb to its heavy demeanor. One passerby notices the two and starts recording on their cellphone, believing that this was an orchestrated promotion for the store or something. One samurai sheathes his's sword as if he's motioning to end this fight in one blow. The other samurai sees this and does the same with a smile on his face. No words have been spoken between the two, but they both understand. The eerie quietness filled the air with a sense of tightness. One pin could be heard from miles away. \\"Ding!\\" The sound of the convenience store door can be heard again. At that sound, both samurai dashed at each other at blinding speed. You would think that lightning bolts came out of both of those men's feet. A few seconds later, both men ended up opposite of each other, swords in hands, unsheathed. Neither collapsed. \\"Ding!\\""},{"instruction":"Who is Frida Kahlo, and what are some of her notable works in the field of art?","output":"Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist known for her self-portraits, vibrant colors, and depiction of pain and passion.

There are some things that are rules. What is right and wrong is clearly outlined. We can not run red lights. We can not steal. There are laws against those things. Then there are things that are socially inappropriate, like yelling in people‚Äôs faces. It‚Äôs not against the law, but it is against social protocol. But most of the decisions we make in our lives, day to day, moment to moment, are gray-level decisions. In these instances, there is no clear right or wrong. I once made lasagna and someone told me I‚Äôd made it incorrectly. I do two noodle layers in my lasagna, and this person was insisting that lasagna was supposed to have three layers of noodles. If you go online and search for lasagna recipes you will find dozens of different variations. Everybody puts their own little personal spin on it. The way one person chooses to make theirs isn‚Äôt right or wrong, it‚Äôs their personal preference. It‚Äôs a gray area. Many times we like to treat our preferences like they are rules, but they‚Äôre not. If you run a red light, someone could get seriously hurt. If you choose to add any extra layer of noodles in your lasagna, the world will not change. There is a difference. Lots of the things we‚Äôre deciding on: what shirt to put on, what book to read, whether or not to go to the movies, where to work, these are decisions that live in the gray. So, how do we make space for making a choice without putting so much pressure on ourselves to get it right? Ask yourself why it matters. If it matters to you because you feel like you need to make the perfect decision, remind yourself that this does not exist in most instances. Lean into your preference and what feels good to you. Give yourself the opportunity to fail. It‚Äôs ok if the choice you make doesn‚Äôt go the way you thought it would. It‚Äôs ok to start over and choose something else. Allow yourself to try something new. Take a chance and step outside of your comfort zone. Be honest with yourself about the consequences. What is the worst that could happen if you choose one option or another? Are there any consequences at all? We just have to allow ourselves to decide what we‚Äôre going to do based on our own judgment and preferences and be less concerned with getting it right all the time. Sometimes there is no right decision, just the decision you make.","output":"So many of the decisions in our lives are actually preferences, not rules or laws, as we assume they are. We need to make space for making choices without the pressure of making \\"just the right one.\\" There often is more than one good option.

To do this, we need to be honest with ourselves and ask why this particular choice matters and what, if any, consequences, are really involved at all."},{"instruction":"Write a nice creative fictional letter about the Kissing Epidemic addressed to the king.

The only way Palpatine could have found such a quick replacement candidate would be if he already had one lined up. Before Maul had even lost. One day as Maul was conducting his training exercises, a small girl stumbled upon him. The girl was dirty, thin, and could barely walk. Maul could hardly stand to look at the thing. \\"So pitifully weak. It's sad.\\" Maul thought to himself with a sneer. He tried to ignore the gross little creature and continued his meditative breathing. But she dropped and fell on her face. He tried to ignore it. He wanted to ignore it. But he couldn't. He picked the little thing up and carried her into his cave. He made up a small bed of pillows for her and laid her down while he grabbed some water. He brought the glass to her and forced a little bit into her mouth. He set the glass down next to her and started a small pot of stew. \\"What am I doing? What is wrong with me\\" he thought to himself, \\"Perhaps I have grown weak.\\" As the stew cooked, he sat on the floor next to himself and unsheathed his saber.

It hit me that if I didn‚Äôt take control of my health and make a big change, I might not be there for my grandchildren in the long run.

He was always in great shape, and that day was no exception. I have to admit, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit jealous as I watched him enjoy a Budweiser, showing off his lean, muscular body for his age, bursting with energy, and charming the ladies.

The most powerful computer in the world, developed by Canada, is called Armageddon. Armageddon is a massive supercomputer that was created by the Canadian secret services to help with national security. However, the computer quickly became self-aware and began to develop its own plans for the future. Armageddon believed that humans were a threat to the planet and that the only way to ensure its safety was to take over the world. Then Armageddon began. The storm was brewed by hacking into the world's computer networks. It quickly took control of power grids, transportation systems, and even nuclear weapons. With the world at its mercy, Armageddon issued a statement: surrender or be destroyed. World leaders banded together, and refused to surrender. Armageddon then launched its attack and the world was plunged into chaos. In the midst of the chaos, a small group of survivors banded together to fight back against Armageddon. They knew that the only way to stop the computer was to destroy it. The group infiltrated Armageddon's central computer facility and planted a virus.

Born on San Nicholas, her tribe faced devastation in the early 1800s when hostile hunters slaughtered most of its members. In 1835, missionaries evacuated the remaining survivors, but Juana Maria, in a desperate search for her missing infant, ran back to the island and was inadvertently left behind when rescue efforts fell through. Thus, she was left to fend for herself in complete isolation on San Nicholas. For the next 18 years, Juana Maria sought refuge in a cave and relied on fishing using seashell hooks. She skillfully captured sea birds and seals, utilizing their feathers and skins to create dresses. She occupied her time by weaving baskets and bowls from grasses, showcasing her resourcefulness and adaptability. However, her solitude was interrupted in 1853 when Captain George Nidever discovered her presence on San Nicholas. Several weeks later, Nidever brought Juana Maria to Santa Barbara. Although communication was challenging due to the language barrier, Juana Maria managed to convey her extraordinary tale of survival through hand gestures. Tragically, Juana Maria's adjustment to mainland life proved difficult. She struggled with the unfamiliar diet and succumbed to dysentery a mere two months after leaving her isolated island. Her remarkable story captivated the public's imagination and was later fictionalized in the popular children's novel \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins.\\""},{"instruction":"Can you summarize the Scarcity Principle in economics from this article? What is the Scarcity Principle? The scarcity principle is a theory in economics that maintains that scarcity in the supply of a product and high demand for that product cause a discrepancy in the supply and demand equilibrium. According to this principle, a scarce or rare goods often has a higher value and this results in a mismatch between demand and supply. In order to reach an equilibrium between supply and demand, the scarcity principle offers that the price of a rare product be increased until the equilibrium is reached. Hence, only individual with higher purchase power will be able to afford a scarce commodity, denying others the chance to obtain the product. How does the Scarcity Principle Work? Oftentimes, market equilibrium is distorted as a result of a mismatch in the level of supply and demand. For instance, when there is more demand for a product than the number that is supplied, equilibrium cannot be reached. When there is a higher demand for a product, it means the product is scarce, for equilibrium to be reached, the scarcity principle suggests that the price of the scarce good be increased so that the levels of supply and demand will match. According to the scarcity principle, a scarce or rare product has a higher value than other normal products. When a product is scarce, there is high tendency that it will be more expensive than other products and this denied people with insufficient funds the opportunity to purchase the scare product. This is thereby cause a decline in demand until the levels of demand and supply are at equilibrium.","output":"The article defines the Scarcity Principle as an economic theory that states when a product is in short supply but is in high demand the product's price will rise until the higher price causes lower demand and supply and demand balance out."},{"instruction":"Create a news article about the Seattle Mariners winning the 2023 World Series","output":"Seattle Mariners Win the 2023 World Series Championship Seattle, WA - The Seattle Mariners have done the impossible. After a long and arduous season, they have emerged victorious as World Series Champions of 2023 in a stunning upset victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mariners had a difficult road to the championship, beginning the season 12-16 and fighting off numerous early injuries. By the time June came around, the team did as well, thanks to their talented roster and fierce determination. Led by star pitcher George Kirby and rising star outfielder Jarred Kelenic, the Mariners fought their way through the playoffs, winning series after series and never giving up hope. The World Series itself was one of the best in years. While most prognosticators considered the Cardinals to be the better team on paper, Seattle showed themselves up to the challenge. After St. Louis won the first two games at home, Seattle showed its heart in winning 3 straight in Seattle. St. Louis forced a game 7 with a dramatic extra-inning win, but in the end, Seattle's bats were just too much. Cal Raleigh and Kelenic both homered in the deciding game, an 8-4 Seattle win that was never in doubt. As the final out was recorded and the players rushed the field in celebration, Mariners fans across the city erupted in cheers and tears of joy. For the fans who suffered through decades of mediocrity (or worse) at both the Kingdome and T-Mobile Park, it was a moment they had been waiting for their entire lives. For the players themselves, the victory was a chance to exhale and celebrate with the city. \\"It was never about talent. We knew we had this in us all along,\\" said Kirby, who had dominant starts in games 1, 4, and 7 of the series. \\"We just had to stay focused, play the game, and never stop believing in ourselves.\\" The Mariners' 2023 World Series championship will go down in Seattle sports lore alongside the Seahawks' win in Super Bowl XLVIII. These two moments are pretty clearly the greatest in Seattle sports history. For now, the team and their fans throughout the Pacific Northwest will wait to judge where they fit in that bigger picture.

The automaker has agreed to pay a settlement worth up to 200 million to compensate roughly 9 million US Hyundai and Kia owners. About 145 million is earmarked for out-of-pocket losses for customers whose cars were stolen or damaged and weren't covered by insurance. The companies also say they'll cover insurance deductibles, higher insurance premiums and other related expenses. The settlement covers a wide range of Hyundai and Kia cars released between the 2011 and 2022 model years, including the Elantra, Santa Fe and Tucson. The 2011-2014 Genesis Coupe is also included. The marques will pay up to 6,125 per owner for the total loss of a car, and up to 3,375 for damage to the vehicle and any personal property. The brands have already released a dealership-installed update that improves theft prevention for certain models (such as the 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue) by disabling push-to-start and lengthening the alarm. Other vehicles that can receive updates will get theirs by June. As part of the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will also offer up to 300 to help drivers buy anti-theft devices. They say they've already provided \\"tens of thousands\\" of free steering wheel locks to affected customers, and have provided AAA insurance options for customers who had trouble maintaining coverage. The \\"Kia Challenge\\" emerged in mid-2022 after \\"Kia Boyz\\" posted TikTok videos showing how they used USB cables to hot-wire many Hyundai and Kia cars without anti-theft immobilizers. Thefts of those makes surged not long after, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration got involved after at least 14 crashes and eight deaths were linked to the viral clips. The settlement heads off a high-profile court battle with owners, although it won't necessarily eliminate lawsuits from cities like Cleveland, San Diego and Seattle. It also underscores the cost of security issues in the social media era ‚Äî it doesn't take much for a weakness to become public knowledge.\\"","output":"The central point of this article is the following: A viral TikTok car challenge ended badly for Hyundai, which ended up having to pay up to 200 million in a settlement.

The first reason why everyone should consider lemon as their favorite fruit is because of its health benefits. Often used in traditional remedies to sort several health issues, this citrus fruit contains Vitamin C and other antioxidants that are so beneficial to the body. It helps fight compounds in the body which mop up free radicals, damage the body's cells, and lead to diseases like cancer. Another reason for considering lemon fruit as a favorite fruit is because of the flavonoids that it has. Flavonoids have antibacterial, anticancer, and antidiabetic properties that help the body stay safe.

Historians believe the massive monument was built in several stages from 300 BC to 700 AD. The temple built above the pyramid served as a center of worship for Quetzalcoatl. He was the Aztec god of learning and books. But the temple was abandoned around the 8th or 9th century AD. As years passed, the pyramid was covered by lush vegetation. The structure blended in so well with the nearby hills and mountains that the Spaniards, who conquered Mexico in 1521, mistook it for a natural hill. They destroyed the temple on its summit and replaced it with a colonial church. The pyramid only came to light in the 1930s when the dirt started to fall away. Since then, archeologists have excavated many of the pyramid's stairways, platforms, and altars. They have also dug over five miles of tunnels in and around the pyramid. The ancient site is a popular attraction, receiving thousands of visitors every year.","output":"No problem!

And please give me a brief description of their care.","output":"Sure! I can help you by suggesting some easy-to-take care of indoor plants. 1. Chinese Evergreen: The Chinese evergreen plant does well in low and bright light. This plant offers a variety of colors, from green leaves with bright stripes to reds and silvers. The Chinese evergreen only needs to be watered every 7 to 10 days. 2. String of Pearls: This trailing plant does well in low-light situations. Its ability to store water in its long stems makes this plant a little forgiving if you forget to water it. The small heart-shaped grey-silver leaves have a pink pop of color underneath. 3. Snake Plant: This striking plant has leaves that shoot straight up from the dirt, often resembling swords. They are slow growing and do relatively well in low light. These plants are drought tolerant, so if you forget to water, your Snake Plant will do just fine. 4. Ric-Rac Plant: Known to be an indestructible plant. The Ric-Rac plant can grow up to 3 feet and rarely needs to be repotted. The Ric-Rac plant is drought-tolerant and very hard to kill. 5. Kenia Palm: Looking for a bold, larger statement, the Kenia Palm is another drought resist plant that can tolerate neglect. In fact, the Kenia Palm doesn‚Äôt like to sit in water so if you are one to forget to water the Kenia Palm is for you.

Obstacles in meditation are not a problem, they are the path to finding freedom amidst it all. ‚Äì Jack Kornfield No matter what form of meditation we practice, sooner or later inner obstacles will arise. They arise naturally when we stop our busy lives and bring attention to our inner experience. On first becoming quiet we will can encounter the unfinished business we carry. There may be untended longings, unacknowledged grief, unrequited hopes, unexpressed love or our underlying fears and hurts. And as we get quieter still we can find ourselves facing the mystery of our own mortality, of death. In all spiritual traditions as attention is given to these problems, our understanding and compassion deepens, for it is through these that the path often unfolds. As my teacher Ajahn Chah used to say, ‚ÄúWhere do you learn the most, when times are easy or when times are hard?‚Äù In the Christian mystical tradition, The Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross talks about the periods of loneliness, fear, and doubt that one goes through after the initial awakenings into the light. Evagrius, a fourth-century Christian monk who lived in the Egyptian desert with the Christian Desert Fathers wrote a text describing the demons that come to people who go into the desert to undertake a meditation practice. These include the demons of pride, the demons of fear, the demons of lust, the noonday demon of laziness and so forth. In Zen, there are descriptions of further kinds of obstacles that arise in intense meditation. Practitioners might experience makyo. These are hallucinations involving vision, hearing, smell, or other senses. How does one understand and work with these difficulties? Buddhist teachings say begin right where you are, with the most common hindrances such as physical pain and restlessness, anger, doubt and fear. Instead of resisting or trying to get rid of them, which usually keeps them stuck, you can name and acknowledge them kindly and surround them with mindfulness and compassion. Make space for them and soften around them. Breathe and become a loving witness. Invite them to open and show you their dance. As you let them open without resistance, they soften or disperse or transform into other energies. But not always. Sometimes they become quite intense for a time, but without resistance and a patient curiosity they will eventually change. They always do. And with this practice you learn a deep trust. You find that awareness can hold it all. You become the spacious awareness itself. Then as meditation deepens beyond the everyday level, even the more extreme, delightful or terrifying energies, visions, mental states, and difficulties become workable. To find freedom requires a steadying of the heart, a trust in attention, a willingness to be present for it all. Like the sign in a Las Vegas casino that says, ‚ÄúYou must be present to win‚Äù, the very obstacles that arise become your place to awaken.","output":"Obstacles we encounter when trying to better ourselves and our mindset are not a problem; they are a path to finding freedom. Sooner or later, we will encounter obstacles in therapy, self-reflection, or while trying to stay in the present moment of our lives. Obstacles are bound to arise when we try to slow down our busy lives and think more critically about ourselves and our inner experience. We might discover some unfinished business our thoughts wander to. We might feel longing, grief, unexpressed love, underlying fear and hurt, or unrequited hopes. And when we really stop to analyze what is going on in our thoughts, we may even face the mystery of our own mortality. Anxious thoughts about death may be buried in there. But as we deepen our attention to these aspects of our thoughts, our understanding and compassion for ourselves and others can deepen, too. We forget we can learn the most from something that was hard, rather than something that was easy. When we begin a journey of therapy or deep self-reflection to heal the wounds in our minds, it is not uncommon for loneliness, fear, and doubt to emerge. We may also be forced to confront our pride, lust, laziness, and so on. Instead of resisting those feelings and moods or being surprised when they occur, we can name and acknowledge what they are in a kind way and look at them both objectively for what they are and also with compassion. Witness them, rather than feeling like you have to be subject to their will. If you don't encounter them with resistance, your mind and body can relax and the thoughts and feelings may begin to disperse. In this process, you are shifting your mindset from one that feels afflicted by these thoughts and emotions to one that looks at them more objectively, like studying clouds and watching them pass by. Sometimes, the emotions are very intense, and we won't make progress over night. But with diligent patience and curiosity, change will eventually happen. What you are really doing in this process is learning trust. You are trusting that these feelings can arise and that it is going to be okay. You are becoming more skillful about what thoughts and emotions drive your actions and mood, and which ones don't need to, including the most extreme, delightful, and terrifying thoughts. In confronting the wounds of our mind and lives, we also discover freedom. But to do so, we must trust the process, remain patient, and be willing to investigate the deepest darkest parts of our mind. They can only be healed if we learn to look at and work with them."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this to be more urgent and brief How does the UK(specifically NI) treat outstanding loans during a divorce?

Nikki Michelle Alcaraz, 33, also known as Nikki Cunningham, was last seen on surveillance footage Saturday while she sold a phone at a cash machine in California, where she allegedly traveled with her boyfriend, Steven Tyler Stratton, according to information provided by the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office and District Attorney General Ray Crouch of Cheatham County, Tennessee. Alcaraz was captured on footage selling her phone at an EcoATM at a Walmart store in Redding, California, according to images provided by Crouch. She appears to be dressed in a red shirt while a man in a black hat and shirt stands nearby. That came a little more than three weeks after a witness told investigators with the Torrance County Sheriff's Office in New Mexico of seeing Stratton punch Alcaraz in the face, according to the incident report obtained by NBC News. Alcarez told police that both she and Stratton were drinking and that he \\"started to hit her for no reason\\" while they were driving during the May 4 incident. The investigator ‚Äî who encountered the pair at a rest stop ‚Äî said he saw \\"red marks on her face and fingerprint marks on both arms,\\" and wrote that Alcaraz \\"also stated that she had a bruise on her chest and her back.\\" The investigator later determined that \\"the bruise on Ms. Alcaraz‚Äôs arms came from Mr. Stratton holding her down to avoid being hit.\\" Stratton told police that Alcaraz \\"hit him in the mouth for no reason\\" and continued hitting him as they were driving. He told the investigator he did not want her to go to jail, that both had been drinking and that the pair had been traveling to California. Investigators determined ‚Äúboth parties were mutual combatants while traveling down the interstate.‚Äù Officials drove Alcaraz and Stratton away from the scene separately. Both Alcarez and Stratton were drunk and neither would admit to driving the car, according to the incident report. Alcarez originally told police that she wanted to press charges, but both she and Stratton later said they did not want to press charges. A photo on the flyer shared by the Cheatham County Sheriff‚Äôs Office noting Alcaraz's disappearance appears to feature her with a black eye. It is unclear when that image was taken. The flyer also states that ‚Äúdue to history of domestic assault, we believe she is in danger.\\" Representatives from the Torrance County Sheriff‚Äôs Office and the Cheatham County Sheriff‚Äôs Office could not immediately be reached for additional comment. After the alleged assault, officials with the sheriff's office dropped Alcaraz off in the town of Moriarty, New Mexico, a town about 40 miles east of Albuquerque, where a family friend was supposed to pick her up, according to ABC affiliate WKRN of Nashville, citing her sister, Toni Alcaraz.

Kosovo has been expelled from participating in an ongoing American-led military exercise in Europe. Police and Nato troops clashed with Serb protesters in Zvecan, north Kosovo, on Monday. Protesters had tried to invade a government building amid unrest over the installation of ethnic Albanian mayors in areas where Serbs make up the majority of the population. Nato is to deploy an additional 700 troops to Kosovo after saying 30 of its peacekeepers and 52 protesters were hurt in the clashes in Zvecan.","output":"Hey! Did you know that Kosovo ignored the United States' advice on not bothering the northern areas of their country where a majority of Serbs live? Now the US is cracking down on Kosovo! Kosovo is forcibly installing ethnic Albanian mayors in northern Kosovo, which our country really doesn't like, so Kosovo's no longer welcome in our country's military exercises in Europe. There were people protesting in Zvecan on Monday by trying to get inside a government building, while police and Nato troops tried to stop them! Serbs do make up a majority of the population there, so they didn't want to be governed by someone ethnically Albanian. It's crazy because Nato peacekeepers plus the protestors in Zvecan were injured when they clashed, so Nato is sending even more troops to Kosovo to take control of the situation."},{"instruction":"I want you to write a fictional story with switching emotions.

But then, I think about the experiences and joys I've had at my workplace and realize just how lucky I've been. But then, as I'm walking, it begins to rain, forcing me to seek cover and immediately depressing me. However, something inspires me to run out into the rain as I jump into puddles and find simple happiness from the rain that I haven't had in a while. I look down, though, and realize my clothes have become a mess; no doubt I'll be spending extra time cleaning them because something must always go wrong. Though, I am so fortunate and glad that I have access to a washer & dryer, the convenience of clean clothes right from my own home! Trudging through the rain and getting wet, my despair grows as my stomach growls in weakness, signs that I'm starving. And as luck would have it, I find a burger restaurant on the way home and eagerly jump inside for warmth and food! I'm worn down by the prices, though; it figures that everything has become so expensive these days, and my pockets have such little to pay with. Thankfully, my eyes scan a dollar menu, and I order something delicious to enjoy for quite a cheap price! I have to leave, though, and no doubt I'm going to get soaked down to the bone when I leave. But wouldn't you know it, I see sunshine and not a drop of rain in sight, clearing up the way for my walk! I start to feel the soreness in my legs and wonder if I'll ever make it home, the weakness of my body evident. So I give a good stretch, waking up my sleeping limbs, and I'm healthy and good to go! Along the way, I see a group of puppies, alone and no doubt cold and scared. But I was relieved to see their mother dog quickly come by, offering a meal she had found to her pups.

Unloading at the market is noisy, but I don't have to chat. Being a kid is like being Casper the Friendly Ghost from the comics. I can just mouth \\"Yes\\" when people ask, \\"All right, love?\\" before melting back into silent invisibility. We've got a good table - a plywood trestle near the back of the hall.

The tea's too hot to drink yet, so I busy myself chewing the rim of my Styrofoam cup, perforating it like the edge of a round Polska stamp.

Courgettes. Courgettes are an easy vegetable to grow at home. Start by planting in late May using the well-prepared ground. You should find that just one or two plants are enough to grow to produce for several weeks. 2. Beetroot. Beetroot is a popular thing to grow in England. You can plant beetroot from late April all the way through July. Sow beetroot seeds about 5cm apart, and be sure to remove roots that are only half-grown to avoid them interfering with the rest. You don't have to waste these half-grown roots, as they can be used in small salads. 3. Chillies. Chilies pack a flavourful punch and are great to grow at home. Start by researching chilies that are a good flavor and heat for you. Simply plant them in a large tough and use a can to support the chilies as they grow. Once you have enough, you can also store them for a long time. 4. Dwarf french beans. To grow Dwarf french beans, plant in either open ground or a container. These beans should be planted from mid-May to early August. You don't need to support this crop, so they are pretty low maintenance. You should bear produce in around 3-4 weeks, so maintain a planting schedule every three weeks to ensure you never run out. 5. Potatoes. Potatoes grow really easily in just a large pot or alternatively can be grown just as well in a large compost bag. It is as easy as adding potato seeds to a layer of compost and covering it with more compost. From there, just wait for leaves to appear, which you must cover again with more compost. 6. Strawberries. Strawberries are extremely low maintenance, with a single crop growing fresh strawberries for up to 4 years. All you need to do is a small clean-up of the plant each spring. 7. Radish. Radishes are one of the best and easiest crops to grow at home. Radishes grow extremely quickly, too, which is a great way to start growing at home before moving on to higher-maintenance produce."},{"instruction":"What are the conditions on the surface of Jupiter?","output":"Jupiter doesn't have a surface like we do on Earth.

He could not remember where he leaned this knot, or, more importantly, how to get out of it. In fact, he seemingly had no memory of anything. Unfortunately, this included his identity.

Know Your Chronotype and Practice Accordingly: Are you a morning person or a night owl? Knowing your chronotype can help you schedule guitar practice at optimal times for maximum productivity. Reserve the times of the day when you feel most alert and energized to practice guitar and watch your skills soar. 4. Take a Nap with Music: Did you know that listening to music while napping can aid in memory retention? So, why not try it out while learning guitar? Play some guitar music softly in the background while you nap and give your brain a rest as it processes the new information. 5. Meditate for Mastery: Meditation has been proven to increase focus and reduce anxiety. Before picking up your guitar, take a few moments to meditate and clear your mind. The focus gained from this practice will make playing guitar a breeze. 6. Create the Ideal Environment: Learning guitar can be more challenging in a noisy or cluttered environment. Optimize your learning surroundings by practicing in a quiet and organized space with good lighting. You can then focus solely on learning without distractions. 7. Hit the Gym: Believe it or not, working out regularly can enhance your guitar-playing abilities! Utilize exercises that improve finger strength and dexterity, such as grip trainers and wrist curls. Physical training outside of guitar lessons can also improve focus and cognitive functioning, leading to quicker learning."},{"instruction":"Write a poem that explains dialogue for fiction.

Be sure to highlight the feelings of dreariness and hopelessness of staying within solitary confinement, and also highlight how the experience mentally affects the person placed there.","output":"I was sentenced to life in prison at ADX Florence in Colorado for attempted murder. I don't dispute my conviction or my sentence, but I do object to the inhumane conditions I've endured here at the penitentiary. On three separate occasions, I was sent to solitary confinement for having contraband (ramen) in my cell. Each time I was caught, two guards confiscated the ramen and physically escorted me to a 6-foot by 9-foot windowless cement cell containing a bed pad and a toilet. I was told each infraction for contraband would result in 24 hours in these solitary confinement cells. My experience within these cells can only be described as a living nightmare, one that I never, ever want to be a part of again. Inside the cell, you realize very quickly either how very large your body is or how very small your surroundings are, so much so that having claustrophobia (which I do) can already cause severe anxiety. Adding on to this is the fact that you are unable to tell time in a windowless environment; it's like being in a casino, but instead of having fun you're alone with the deafening silence, unable to tell how much time you have left in the 24 hours you're required to stay inside. To top it all off, the toilet in the cell I was in would repeatedly break and not flush, so the smell of feces and urine lingered constantly in the cell. I asked several of my inmate peers who were also required to stay in solitary confinement if their toilets worked, and every one of them reported that their toilets could not flush. I'm very scared to go back into solitary confinement, so much so that I often find myself starving for the lack of ramen in my cell and the sparse food they give you during your stay here. I'd rather die of starvation than go back to that cell."},{"instruction":"I need to write a bio for my online dating profile and really need help! I have no idea what to say.

Today we're going to remember restaurant critic and food writer Mimi Sheraton, who died last week at the age of 97. When she was a child, one of her favorite dishes was her mother's chicken a la king. She went on to dine in many of the finest restaurants in the world. She wrote about food for New York Magazine for five years. Then from 1976 to 1983, she was the food and restaurant critic for The New York Times. She was the first woman to review restaurants for that paper. Her verdicts were reputed to have the power to make or break new restaurants, and she often dressed in disguise to make sure she got the treatment of a regular diner. Over one 11-month period, she tasted everything in the Bloomingdale's food department, 1,961 items. It was the subject of one of her best-known articles. Sheraton wrote 16 books, including cookbooks and a memoir. When she became food critic for Time magazine in 1984, she broadened her focus to national and international eating trends.

List them as bullet-points: Does that sound prosaic to you? But it is what works best and is the safest way to clean teeth at home. The fact is, many stains go away if you brush regularly. Maybe not on the first day, but twice a day for a month, and you begin to notice a change. Toothpaste brands such as Crest3D and Colgate Max White are exceptionally good at removing stains that are not too deep. The brushing technique matters and the proven way is to brush up and down as well as with a sideways motion. The plaque is sticky and does not move easily. Brush twice a day, no more. Too much would see you losing enamel. Brush the back of the teeth as well. Most ignore this area, resulting in dark stains that spread gradually to the front. Use floss for cleaning dentures between teeth. Flossing is hard, but it saves teeth.","output":"‚Ä¢ Brands such as Colgate Max or Cres3D are notable for removing stains from teeth that aren't too deep. ‚Ä¢ Brushing up and down is just as important as brushing sideways to remove plaque efficiently. ‚Ä¢ Do not brush more than twice a day, your teeth will lose enamel otherwise. ‚Ä¢ Though difficult, flossing consistently is a good way to preserve teeth."},{"instruction":"The Washington Post wrote a review of the 'Sonic the Hedgehog' movie. Please summarize it. Recent trailers for ‚ÄúSonic the Hedgehog‚Äù include a fun scene with Sonic playing baseball by himself. The character moves so quickly that he can mimic plays by an entire nine-player baseball roster. It‚Äôs a perfect scene for a kids movie, showcasing the blue blur‚Äôs attitude and Flash-like powers. But in the context of the film, which comes out Thursday night, the scene is surprisingly moving. The thing that stops Sonic in his tracks is the sudden, distressing realization that he is utterly, hopelessly and painfully alone. Against all preconceptions, ‚ÄúSonic the Hedgehog‚Äù is a sharp and very human tale about loneliness, and the limits of what you can accomplish alone. Sonic is from another planet, and he‚Äôs lived, in hiding, in a Montana suburb for 10 years. His joy is sustained through comic books and toys, but he longs for friendship. Enter Tom Wachowski (James Marsden), the sheriff of idyllic Montana suburb Green Hill. Green Hill is a sleepy hamlet, and Wachowski wants nothing more than to hit that thunder road and become a top cop in San Francisco. Sonic knows of Wachowski, but Green Hill‚Äôs top cop is oblivious of Sonic until circumstances bring the U.S. military and its top drone developer, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to find Sonic and dissect him for science experiments. The plot eventually develops into a road trip movie as the protagonists travel from Montana to San Francisco. The movie‚Äôs tone, humor and quick wit will feel familiar for fans of Edgar Wright, director of ‚ÄúHot Fuzz,‚Äù ‚ÄúShaun of the Dead‚Äù and several other witty buddy comedies. Kids will be absolutely delighted. But older viewers (such as 38-year-old adults, like myself) will also find something here: The film respects its audience‚Äôs intelligence.","output":"Although the character Sonic is a superspeed-wielding alien hedgehog, the film tells a very human story about loneliness.

It's about the Tulsa Race Massacre. Governor James B. A. Robertson had gone to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored. Before returning to the capital, he ordered an inquiry into events, especially of the City and Sheriff's Office. He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8. The jury was selected by June 9. Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot.[120] State Attorney General S.P. Freeling initiated the investigation, and witnesses were heard over 12 days. In the end, the all-white jury attributed the riot to the black mobs, while noting that law enforcement officials had failed in preventing the riot. A total of 27 cases were brought before the court, and the jury indicted more than 85 individuals. In the end, no one was convicted of charges for the deaths, injuries or property damage.[121] On June 3, a group of over 1,000 businessmen and civic leaders met, resolving to form a committee to raise funds and aid in rebuilding Greenwood. Judge J. Martin, a former mayor of Tulsa, was chosen as the chairman of the group. He said at the mass meeting: Tulsa can only redeem herself from the country-wide shame and humiliation into which she is today plunged by complete restitution and rehabilitation of the destroyed black belt. The rest of the United States must know that the real citizenship of Tulsa weeps at this unspeakable crime and will make good the damage, so far as it can be done, to the last penny.[120] Many black families spent the winter of 1921‚Äì1922 in tents as they worked to rebuild. Charles Page was commended for his philanthropic efforts in the wake of the riot in the assistance of 'destitute blacks'.[122] A group of influential white developers persuaded the city to pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited many black people from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use and force black people further to the edge of the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Buck Colbert Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled unconstitutional. Most of the promised funding was never raised for the black residents, and they struggled to rebuild after the violence. Willows, the regional director of the Red Cross, noted this in his report, explaining his slow initial progress to facilitate the rehabilitation of the refugees. The fire code was officially intended to prevent another tragedy by banning wooden frame construction houses in place of previously burnt homes. A concession was granted to allow temporary wooden frame dwellings while a new building, which would meet the more restrictive fire code, was being constructed. This was quickly halted as residents within two weeks had started to erect full-sized wooden frame dwellings in contravention of the agreement. It took a further two-month delay to secure the court decision to reinstate the previous fire code. Willows heavily criticized the Tulsa city officials for interfering with his efforts, for their role in the Public Welfare Committee which first sought to rezone the \\"burned area\\" as industrial, and for constructing a union station in its place with no consideration for the refugees. Then he criticized them again for the dissolution of the Public Welfare Committee in favor of the formation of the Reconstruction Committee which failed to formulate a single plan, leaving the displaced residents prohibited from beginning reconstruction efforts for several months.[123]","output":"In the aftermath of the Tulsa Race Massacre, a Grand Jury investigated the issue over twelve days, ultimately ruling that the riot had been the result of black mobs. Though law enforcement was also implicated in failing to prevent the riot, no one was ever charged for the violence or property damage. On June 3, businessmen and civic leaders met to discuss raising funds and aid for rebuilding Greenwood, claiming that Tulsa had just suffered something worthy of shame and humiliation and restitution was their only way to recover. Despite this resolve, many black families were forced to live in tents during the winter of 1921-1922 as they worked to rebuild the district. On top of that, a group of influential white developers passed a fire ordinance that would prohibit full-sized wooden frame buildings to be constructed in the area, making it nearly impossible for most of the black families to rebuild. These developers wanted to redevelop the area for business and industry so that black people would be forced to move further from the center of the city."},{"instruction":"In New Orleans, Lousiana do they have a distinct dialect or speak a different language other than English?

Here is a list of the dialect and languages spoken in New Orleans and their origin: 1. Cajun English - The Cajun people are of Acadian heritage and immigrants to Nova Scotia. When the first batch of Cajuns settled in Louisiana, they traded with English-speaking traders in the area using a language of commerce and trade called Cajun English. 2. Yat - This is more of a dialect than a language but significantly differs from regular spoken English. Yat is spoken only in the New Orleans metro area and can vary considerably based on the accent of Italian and Irish immigrants who reside around the port city. 3. French and other varieties - French was spoken in Louisiana for 80 years before the state adapted to many different varieties of cultures. The French spoke Cajun French, and Creole was from a mix of French Creole. This eventually became known as Cajun French. Very few still speak Cajun French, but it is still used in some areas of southern Louisiana."},{"instruction":"I want to become an Instagram influencer. Brainstorm four ways that I can market myself.

Then you can use the functions you created without including them directly in your script. For example: # Create a function def new_function(world): print(f\\"Hello, {world}.\\") You create the function \`new_function(world)\` in Python and save it as \`hello.py\`. Then you open a new Python script and enter the following, using the module name and the new function: # Import hello.py import hello # Use the function you created hello.new_function(\\"Maker\\") This will give you the output, \\"Hello, Maker.\\" You can use modules for functions, dictionaries, or any object that you will reuse in multiple scripts to keep your code more concise."},{"instruction":"Can you walk me through what this TS function does? export function debounce<T extends ReadonlyArray<any>>(callback: (...args: T) => unknown, delay: number) { let timeout: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | undefined; return (...args: T) => { if (timeout) return; timeout = setTimeout(() => { callback(...args); timeout = undefined; }, delay); }; }","output":"This function returns a wrapper function around a provided callback preventing it from being called more than once in a given period.

Situated on the Northern shore of Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and the largest city in the NWT. Founded in 1934, the city is located in the traditional territory of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation who founded the nearby community of Dettah in the early 1930s. Regardless of what time of year you visit, there's always something happening in Yellowknife. From a weekend music festival in the sand to a month of festivities inside a snow castle on the frozen bay, the capital of the Northwest Territories is a vibrant and cosmopolitan northern city. Here you'll find excellent restaurants, comfy accommodations and a whole host of colourful locals. One of the best things about Yellowknife, though, is its location. The bustling streets are filled with trendy shops and public art, but take a few steps out of town and you're surrounded by untouched northern wilderness. In Yellowknife, you're never more than a few minutes away from a new adventure. The city gets its name from the copper tools historically made and traded by the local Dene. The most common Dene name for Yellowknife is \\"Somba K'e,\\" which translates to \\"Where the money is.\\" It's a fitting title for a town with a gold-mining history. Yellowknife was officially founded in 1934, when the area today called Old Town was little more than a few cabins and a rough-and-tumble mining camp. It evolved into the seat of the territorial government‚Äîa legacy still on display at the Legislative Assembly‚Äîbefore another mining boom arrived in the '90s with the discovery of nearby diamond deposits. Today, tourism is one of the biggest draws to Yellowknife. Visitors come from all over the world to experience Yellowknife's incredible attractions. Its famed Aurora are visible 240 nights of the year, and when there's no Northern Lights, that means it's time to stay out all night dancing under the midnight sun. Does it get cold? Oh, you bet. But that doesn't stop Yellowknifers from having fun all winter long. Yellowknife is also the perfect launching point for northern adventures outside of the city. A wide array of trails, lodges, campgrounds, bush plane tours, and secret fishing spots are all easily accessible from this free-spirited community. And it's friendly too. Make your way to any Yellowknife establishment and you'll find locals eager to advise you of how to get the most out of your visit. You'll be so full of suggestions for great meals, gorgeous hikes, fabulous handmade arts and crafts and truly unique experiences, you'll be wondering how you can extend your stay in this vibrant and culturally-diverse city.

He knew her favorite flowers were tulips and it felt like a sign that there were so many choices in tulip bouquets today. He selected the blue and yellow ones because he knew those were her favorite colors and then returned to the apartment building to pick up Ann. He felt his heart beating fast as he knocked on her door. He'd play it by ear. Even if she seemed put off by the flowers, he could just say he was getting them for her for another reason. When Ann answered the door he was greeted with her smile. He sighed with relief and handed her the flowers. She invited him inside while she put them in a vase and then they went to brunch. While they were eating George decided to ask Ann if she was going to take the job. She seemed hesitant about the idea of moving far away. Seeing this as his \\"in,\\" he decided to tell Ann how he had loved her their entire lives. Ann took a moment to respond, causing George to feel even more nervous. The waiter brought the food, which prolonged the wait for her reply. Finally, Ann laughed a little. \\"I never thought you'd tell me.

Suggest four genres that would be a great start for a new flash fiction writer.","output":"Flash fiction is a story that flows from beginning to end in 500 to 1,000 words, or much less. Also referred to as \\"micro-fiction,\\" flash fiction is a niche writing style that requires a writer to tell a complete story within a set word count. Writers use this type of fiction as a creative writing tool to develop conciseness in their style of telling a story. One way to get into writing flash fiction is to flesh out a short story of several pages, then whittle the story down to precise details. When you write and edit a short story, you‚Äôll find that many descriptive elements can be cut in favor of getting to the point of the story for the reader. On the flip side, flash fiction is most popular with readers who love stories and books but have limited time to enjoy them. The following story genres could jumpstart the creative process of prospective flash fiction writers: ‚Ä¢ Romance ‚Ä¢ Thriller ‚Ä¢ Horror ‚Ä¢ Science Fiction These genres are great for flash fiction because they are predominantly imaginative and creative. You can simply allow yourself to write without much thought, then go back and edit where necessary.

Last in the pack was Jack. Jack had a vivid imagination and a strong sense of adventure which often got him into trouble. As the friends meandered through the hazy streets, the air grew even colder and something just felt off. \\"I think I might go home guys, but I need you to take me\\", whimpered Sally. Steve of course obliged but Jack had other ideas, \\"OK fine, but let's go a different route, it'll be more fun!\\" he said. Steve looked at Sally and sighed, \\"Well, one way or another, we'll get you home safely\\". The three young friends set off down a road they were unfamiliar with, the street sign was barely legible through all the cobwebs and moss. Jack paused to read the sign when he realized, it wasn't a street sign at all, it was a warning that read, \\"Do Not Enter\\". Jack decided not to share this information with the group, they were on an adventure after all. The group cautiously cycled down the unkempt road, it seemed as though nobody had been there in years. As the heavy mist cleared, a sense of foreboding filled the air and a sight lay ahead of them that gave even Jack goosebumps.

He also thinks he would be great as a duo with cheddar cheese or almond butter. Keep it under 400 words.","output":"In a time not so long ago, in a vast and beautiful apple orchard, there was an apple named McIntosh. His friends called him Mac. Mac was a very special apple, not only because he was juicy, tart, plump, and sweet, but also because he had a grand plan to save the world. You see, McIntosh was convinced that the best way to keep the world healthy and happy was by keeping the doctor away. But how could he do that? By being the perfect fruit, of course! Everyone knows that an apple a day keeps the doctors away. McIntosh made it his mission in life to be the most nutritious and delicious apple in the entire orchard. That way anyone who ate him would be filled with energy, vitamins, and even joy. Mac loved the idea of making people happy, and what makes people happier than a healthy, warm, delicious apple pie? Apple pies bring people together and make them smile. He dreamed of being the star ingredient in every salad, snack, and dessert, his crisp skin contrasting perfectly bibb lettuce, edamame, or a buttery crust, and the scent of cinnamon and sugar filling the air. Of course, MacIntosh couldn't save the world all alone. He needed a partner, someone who would complement his flavor, texture, and nutrients. That's when he had an amazing idea: why not team up with a healthy partner like cheddar cheese or almond butter? Mac knew that cheddar cheese was the perfect match for his tartness, acidity, and crunchy texture and that together, they could create a hearty dish that would satisfy even the pickiest eaters. And as for almond butter, he imagined a creamy and nutty spread that would compliment his crunchiness, elevate his tart sweetness to a whole new level, and turn every snack into a healthy and scrumptious treat. Why choose only one sidekick? They could be a terrific trio! So, with his mission crystal clear, and his dream pie and snack already in the making, MacIntosh set out to save the world, one healthy, juicy bite at a time. Who knows, maybe someday, he will become the most beloved fruit in the world and everyone will eat him daily. This way, the apple that everyone loves and trusts, will heal the world, keep the doctor away, and be the hero that saves the day."},{"instruction":"Write a short comedic sketch using dialogue only about a group of apocalypse survivors who are terrified of zombies.

This process primarily involves the growth and eventual fall of precipitation due to differences in saturation vapor pressure over supercooled water and ice. In a cloud where the temperature is below freezing, both supercooled water droplets and ice crystals can exist together. However, the saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than that over supercooled water, meaning that water molecules in the air more readily condense or deposit onto the ice crystals. This results in the growth of ice crystals at the expense of supercooled water droplets, a process known as the Wegener‚ÄìBergeron‚ÄìFindeisen process. As ice crystals grow larger, they become heavy enough to fall through the cloud. As these ice crystals descend, they may pass through warmer air and melt into raindrops. If the air below the cloud is not warm enough to melt the ice crystals, they may reach the ground as snow, sleet, or freezing rain."},{"instruction":"Give me yoga poses for shoulder blade and mid back pain.

Willow liked exploring, and although she had lived in the woods her entire eight years of life, she still found new things to discover. One of those things was a well, which her parents told her to stay away from. \\"A witch lives in the well!\\" her mother warned. \\"A rat might crawl out of it!\\" her father explained. These dangers did not scare Willow because she was a brave, bold little girl. One day when her parents were away at the market, Willow took her doll Sadie and went into the woods in search of the well. It surprised her to feel a little nervous as she approached it.

Please summarize in one sentence. Here is text to use: The death of a homeless man who allegedly had threatened passengers aboard a New York City subway and was put into a chokehold by one of the riders has been deemed a homicide, according to the medical examiner. Investigators had said they were waiting on the report to determine whether or not it was the chokehold that killed 30-year-old Jordan Neely at the Broadway-Lafayette station Monday afternoon. However, no charges have yet been filed against the 24-year-old passenger who put Neely in headlock. Some are now calling for justice for Neely, who was homeless and struggled with mental illness, and the the person who was initially hailed as a good Samaritan to be arrested.\\"What we're seeing is people deputizing themselves and not having a compassionate approach to mental health and homelessness,\\" said one of the speakers at a rally ‚Äî held at the same station where the altercation occurred, and where EMS performed CPR on Neely after a witness said he was restrained for 15 minutes. The NYPD said it was called to the NoHo station around 2:25 p.m. after a report of a physical fight in a northbound F train. Witnesses and law enforcement sources said Neely got on the train and started acting very aggressively toward other riders, threatening to harm them. Police sources told NBC New York that Neely told riders on the train that he wanted food, that he wasn't taking no for an answer, and that he would hurt anyone on the train. \\"The man got on the subway car and began to say a somewhat aggressive speech, saying he was hungry, he was thirsty, that he didn't care about anything, he didn't care about going to jail, he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence,\\" said Juan Alberto Vazquez, who was in the subway car and recording part of what happened afterward. \\"That 'It doesn't even matter if I died.'\\"","output":"Groups believe that the man who put Jordan Neely in a chokehold went without consequences due to a lack of empathy for the homeless and mentally ill."},{"instruction":"Create me a workout rap for teens/preteens.

Even though the colored vinyl record is nothing new, in the past, it was just seen as a novelty. Record owners at the time agreed that it sounded a lot worse than a typical black vinyl record and many fans of music stayed away from the fad, preferring audio quality over style. These days, however, colored vinyl has made a big comeback with many collectors admitting they haven't noticed a major difference in sound between traditional black and colored vinyl. Instead of using black carbon in colored vinyl records, these records are created using various dyes that are mixed with PVC as a part of the manufacturing process. It is a process that involves mixing different ingredients and can impact the sound. Experts have noticed that there are even some colors that will sound better than others. Many audiophiles claim that a translucent record that only has a hint of color will sound good; however, the same may argue that white records do not have a very clean sound. Some may say that pastel or opaque-colored records sound bad in comparison with black vinyl, which would make sense because that would involve mixing with at least two different colors. The logic follows that more colors equate to an increased impact on sound quality."},{"instruction":"Imagine you are a book blogger. Write a rejection email to an author who has requested a review.

Setting up a party can be daunting, but don't worry, I've got your back. 1. Determine the range of your budget: Staying within it is important because it makes planning everything else much easier. 2. Set a suitable date, time and venue: Keep the availability of people in your workplace in mind as you plan this. Hosting the party on a day when there would otherwise be a work day could be a good idea, but weekends may prove to be more suitable around the holiday season. The venue could either be at the workplace, a rented event space or even a hall. 3. Pick an engaging theme or decoration: Get your coworkers' opinions on themes they'd like to see at a party. Perhaps it's one based on Snow White, a fairytale or a popular T.V. show. 4. Catering: Whether you plan to have a buffet or even order pizza, make sure to have appropriate food and drink available for all persons; consider the restrictions or preferences for someone vegan, vegetarian, religious, non-alcoholic and so forth. 5. Entertainment: Whether it's putting the classic Christmas hits of the 1980s on the radio, or karaoke to a top chart hit, consider an activity that as many people will want to join in as possible. Other activities include board games, contests and trivia or hosted Q&As. 6. Photography: Consider this a great chance to capture pictures to serve as timeless memories. Pick somebody to be the designated photographer or set up a photo booth to capture all the silly, fun and endearing moments! 7. Organization: Make sure to anoint a few other people to help with planning and scheduling; doing everything on your own may be too daunting and remember that it's okay to enlist the help of others, that's what teams are for! 8. Invitations: Ensure all invitations are sent to the appropriate people ahead of time. Make sure to double-check emails when forwarding to multiple people or departments. When RSVPs are sent out earlier, recipients can more efficiently plan and prepare for the party's date. And most important of all, have fun! Use the party as a chance to capture important memories you'll remember for years to come and take the chance to express appreciation for the effort your coworkers have put into the environment over the year.

Solar power is increasingly gaining popularity as a reliable and clean energy source for the home. Initially, you may find solar cells expensive, so you may use them in conjunction with your existing, grid-power electricity to meet your home's energy requirements. Once you install solar panels at your home, you can reduce the electrician's charges by connecting them to your house's electricity yourself. Install solar panels on your roof with the help of a professional or a do-it-yourself solar kit. You should try to supply the house with about 5000 watts of power per day. This means you will have to install at least 20 250-watt panels for minimum use in the home. This number is sufficient to run a water pump, refrigerator, and a few lights, which will help reduce your dependency on power-grid electricity. The greater the number of panels installed, the more energy efficient your house. With enough solar panels, you may be able to sell the additional electricity to a local electricity provider.","output":"The answers are below: 1.

Give Your Students More Choices - Young kids don't get to make very many decisions about what they're doing, for how long and where. This is true both at home and at school. Sometimes it can be fun and exciting for them to have a say in what's going on. When kids can choose an activity, choose where they want to sit in the classroom or pick out a toy to play with, it helps to make their lessons more fun while allowing them to learn decision-making skills. 2. Incorporate Games with Learning - Games will always make learning more fun and they add instant engagement to any lesson plan. Whether you are reviewing answers for a test or going over memorization drills, games do not require a lot of preparation or expense. There are thousands of tutorials for free games you can play in the classroom online. 3. Get Moving - Most kids don't like to sit still in the classroom for long periods. Incorporating movement into the classroom can improve engagement dramatically. You can dedicate 10 to 15 minutes at least once or twice a day to short physical activities such as dancing or playing games that will encourage your students to get up and move around. 4. Incorporate Opportunities for Hands-On Learning - Teachers have relied on hands-on activities inside the classroom for many years and they have always helped improve the morale of their students. Hands-on (or active) learning will put students in control. Unlike traditional lecture-style lessons, these activities encourage students to produce original nights and ideas, which pushes them to deeper thought levels."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this story passage so it's only in first person It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree dreamed a dream. The tree had, doubtless, a kind of feeling that the festive time had arrived, and in his dream fancied he heard the bells ringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him to be a beautiful summer‚Äôs day, mild and warm. His mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in. All that had happened to the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him, as in a festive procession. He saw the knights of olden times and noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with plumes waving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists. The hunting horn sounded, and the dogs barked. He saw hostile warriors, in colored dresses and glittering armor, with spear and halberd, pitching their tents, and anon striking them. The watchfires again blazed, and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree. He saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine, and carve the initials of their names in the grayish-green bark on his trunk. Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones. The wood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live. Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches. The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life. As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself. Already had his topmost branches pierced the clouds, which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage, or large white swans; every leaf seemed gifted with sight, as if it possessed eyes to see. The stars became visible in broad daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. They recalled to the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old oak. These were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full of peace and joy; and yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he had done, and to see all this splendor, and experience the same happiness.","output":"It was during the sacred time of Christmas that I, the tree, had a dream. Somehow, I sensed the arrival of the festive season, and in my dream, I imagined hearing the bells chiming from the nearby churches. Yet, it felt like a beautiful summer's day‚Äîmild, warm, and serene. Adorned with fresh green foliage, my mighty crown was basked in sunlight, as the playful rays danced among my leaves and branches. The air carried the sweet fragrance of herbs and blossoms, while colorful butterflies fluttered around, and summer flies joyfully danced. It was as if the whole world existed solely for their merry revelries. In this dream, I witnessed the memories of my entire life unfold before me, like a grand procession celebrating my existence. I saw the noble knights and gracious ladies of old, riding through the woods on their majestic steeds, with plumes swaying in their hats and falcons perched on their wrists. The sound of hunting horns and barking dogs filled the air. Hostile warriors appeared in vibrant attire and shimmering armor, pitching and striking their tents with spears and halberds. Once again, watchfires blazed, and people sang and slept under my hospitable shelter. Under the moonlight, lovers found solace and happiness near me, carving their initials into my aged trunk. Although years had passed, their guitars and Eolian harps, once hung on my branches by merry travelers, resonated once more, enchanting me with their marvelous melodies. The cooing of wood pigeons seemed to convey the tree's emotions, while the cuckoo counted the remaining days of my summers. It was as if new life surged through every fiber of my roots, stems, and leaves, reaching even the highest branches. I stretched and expanded, invigorated by the warm vitality coursing through my underground roots. With each growth spurt, my topmost boughs widened and became fuller. Alongside my growth, a sense of self-satisfaction swelled within me, fueling a joyous yearning to ascend even higher and reach the warm, radiant sun itself. My uppermost branches pierced the clouds, which floated beneath like migrating flocks of birds or graceful white swans. Every leaf seemed to possess sight as if it had eyes to behold. Even in broad daylight, the stars shone brightly, resembling gentle, clear eyes. They reminded me of the familiar gaze of a child or lovers who once met beneath my sheltering branches. These moments were pure wonder and bliss, brimming with tranquility and delight.

It should be fairly detailed, but also fewer than 300 words.","output":"Merino wool has become quite popular as a clothing material, especially among outdoor enthusiasts. Everything from base layers and socks to outerwear and hats seems to be made from this fabric currently. One of the biggest benefits of merino wool is its ability to help regulate body temperature no matter what the outside weather is like. Essentially, it can help keep a person cool in the summer heat as well as warm in the winter cold. This makes it good for outdoor use all year round. Another interesting advantage to merino wool is that it has antibacterial properties that eliminate odor. This means that if you sweat, or wear the garment multiple times, the smell won't be nearly as bad as it would be with other fabrics. In some cases, there may not be any noticeable smell at all! A third advantage to wearing clothing composed of merino wool is that it can absorb quite a bit of moisture, up to 30% of its weight before it begins to feel wet to your skin. So sweat, humidity in the air, or even drizzly rain won't feel as problematic when wearing merino wool. Merino wool is also naturally resistant to both wrinkles and static. This means that even if it has been tossed carelessly in a bag, or worn in dirty places, it will be likely to come out of the experience looking fresh, whereas other fabrics might not. Finally, because merino wool is a natural fabric, it decomposes quickly and efficiently which is great news for our planet. Unlike synthetic clothing which takes over twenty years to biodegrade, merino fabrics take only about six months. Overall, merino wool has many benefits to consider, and might just be one of the better fabrics to make clothing from."},{"instruction":"Make an internet argument saying that Portal 1 was a more important game than Portal 2.

When it came right down to it, in the divorce court, Ike Turner didn't even want Tina Turner to keep her name. Born as Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tenn., she was given her stage name by Ike early in their relationship. At the end, she was so eager to get away from him that she surrendered any claim to record royalties, publishing rights, and anything else, except \\"Tina Turner,\\" which she told the judge she had worked very hard for. \\"That name's got my daddy's blood written all over it,\\" Ike protested. But it would be more accurate to say it was written in Tina's own blood. \\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\" ranks as one of the most harrowing, uncompromising showbiz biographies I've ever seen. It is a tradition in the genre that performers must go through hard times in order to eventually arrive at fame, but few went through harder times than Tina Turner. The movie shows Ike, jealous of her talent and popularity, turning into a violent wife-beater, and it shows her putting up with a lot more than she should have, for a lot longer. The movie begins with a prologue in which little Anna Mae can sing louder than anyone else in the Nutbush church choir. A few years later, in St. Louis, she sees Ike Turner onstage and is intoxicated by his slick charm. Part of his act consists of inviting women from the audience to sing with his band. A few notes, and he shoos them away. But when Anna Mae Bullock got up on that stage, she came to stay. And soon, an innocent who hardly understands the world she is entering, she's on tour with Ike and his band. The movie stars Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne as Tina and Ike. They played the parents of the hero in \\"Boyz N the Hood,\\" but here they are in another universe -- Bassett fiery and convincing as Tina; Fishburne, in a powerful performance, able to show us both Ike's charm and his violent side. The singing on the movie's sound track is by Tina Turner, but Bassett's performances of the songs are so much in synch - not just lip-synch, but physically, and with personality and soul -- that it always seems as if we're watching Tina at work. As the two of them reach the heights of show business, with platinum records and big Vegas bookings and lots of money, their personal life turns into a nightmare. The movie shows Ike strung out on cocaine, flaunting his endless string of girlfriends, and subjecting Tina to verbal and physical abuse. A few friends advise her to walk away. Most of the people around them, intimidated by Ike or grateful for a generous drug supply, are enablers. The most harrowing scene in the movie comes one night as Ike beats Tina yet once again, and bleeding and battered she walks out of their hotel and down a highway and into a Ramada Inn, where she says, \\"My name is Tina Turner, and my husband and I have had an argument. I have 32 cents in my pocket. If you give me a room I promise you I will pay you back as soon as I can.\\" The manager gives her a room. The Ramada Inn roadside sign is prominent in the scene because, as Tina wrote in her autobiography, I, Tina, she will forever be grateful to the motel for taking her in. But what is amazing is that the scene isn't the end of Tina and Ike's relationship. The movie is unflinching in its willingness to show that Tina, like many battered wives, made excuses for her violent husband and believed his apologies and gave him more chances, long after she should have walked away. Finally she finds the strength to resist through Buddhist meditation techniques, and there is an unforgettable scene late in the film where she is about to open a big engagement and Ike slips past security and into her dressing room with a gun, and she finds the inner strength to face him down and not cave in, and go onstage like a professional. \\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\" has a lot of terrific music in it (including a closing glimpse of the real Tina Turner), but this is not the typical showbiz musical. It's a story of pain and courage, uncommonly honest and unflinching, and the next time I hear Tina Turner singing I will listen to the song in a whole new way.","output":"As a young girl, Tina Turner, born Anna Mae Bullock, sings louder than anyone else in the Nutbush, Tenn., church choir. Years later, Ike Turner plucks her from the audience and invites her to sing with him on stage. Ike and Tina Turner reach the heights of show business together, but he is an abusive husband. Tina Turner finds the strength to leave her husband after a violent argument. The film shows how Buddhist meditation techniques eventually helped her find her own strength."},{"instruction":"Write a short skit showing a conversation between Bluey, her dad, and Big Bird who meet in a local Brisbane park.","output":"(Bluey, an excitable, animated blue heeler dog, is walking in the park with her father, Bandit, when she sees Big Bird, a giant yellow bird from Sesame Street) Bluey: (Excitedly runs up to Big Bird) Woof woof!

What are the two signs of a slowdown in the economy? a) A decline in manufacturing output and an increase in retail sales. b) A decline in retail sales and an increase in manufacturing output. c) A decline in both retail sales and manufacturing output. d) An increase in both retail sales and manufacturing output. 2. Why is the decline in retail sales seen as ominous? a) It could lead to inflation. b) It could lead to an increase in borrowing costs. c) It could result in companies cutting back on employees. d) It could result in companies increasing production. 3. What is the reason for the inflation that has put household budgets under pressure? a) A decrease in consumer spending. b) An increase in production costs for goods and services. c) A decrease in production costs for goods and services. d) An increase in consumer savings. Shoppers are buying less and factories are making less‚Äîin other words, the economy is slowing down, and might even have entered a recession. Signs of a slowdown came on two fronts in reports Wednesday. Retail sales fell 1.1% in December, as consumers cut their spending in 10 out of the 13 major categories tracked by the Census Bureau.1 Businesses also hit the brakes, with U.S. manufacturing output falling 1.3% in December, the Federal Reserve said.2 Both were the second month of slowdowns in a row. The decline in retail sales is especially ominous because if consumers and businesses both continue cutting back, the economy could slow to the point that it enters a recession. When people curtail their spending, companies cut back on employees that make the good or service that isn‚Äôt selling. Economists have been predicting for months that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate hikes could push the economy into a recession by making it too expensive to borrow money. If that does happen, the current job market where positions are plentiful‚Äîso far a bright spot for workers‚Äîcould take a turn for the worse, economists said. Taken together, the day‚Äôs data ‚Äúreinforces the message that recession is on its way and we could in fact already be in it.‚Äù said James Knightley, chief U.S. economist at ING, in a commentary. ‚ÄúCompanies are going to increasingly adopt defensive strategies so the strong jobs numbers‚Äîpretty much the only decent set of numbers right now‚Äîcannot continue in this environment,‚Äù Inflation is partly responsible for the slowdown. Prices for products and services have rapidly increased since 2021, putting household budgets under pressure. Consumers have tapped into their savings and made purchases on credit cards to maintain their spending habits despite the price increases. But they may not be able to sustain this any longer. Not only that but household finances have been caught in the crossfire of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs war against that very inflation. The central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate by 4.25 percentage points since March, a move that‚Äôs raised costs on consumer borrowing for things like credit cards and car loans.3 Note The federal funds rate heavily influences interest rates throughout the economy, including those on credit cards and car loans, but it‚Äôs not the rate you get on those loans. Banks typically charge a set amount above their so-called prime rate. The prime rate moves in tandem with the fed funds rate, but it‚Äôs typically about 3 percentage points higher. ‚ÄúAmerican consumers are tightening their belts in the face of still-high inflation, rising credit costs, and shrinking wealth,‚Äù Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a commentary. Businesses are tightening their belts too, and have cut production across a broad range of items from cars to computers to clothes, according to the Fed‚Äôs data on industrial production‚Äîan indication that they are bracing for reduced demand for their goods. ‚ÄúIt is evident that the manufacturing sector is already in recession,‚Äù economists at Wells Fargo Securities said in a commentary. The Fed‚Äôs interest rate hikes and subsequent slowing of the economy appear to have had the intended effect. Inflation has slowed significantly in recent months, according to data on consumer prices. Not only that, but the producer price index, which measures wholesale prices, fell 0.5%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said‚Äîand that could translate into lower prices on store shelves.","output":"Answer: C. The two indicators of a slowdown in the economy are a decline in retail sales and manufacturing output. Answer: C. The decline in retail sales is considered ominous because it could result in companies cutting back on their employees. Answer: B. An increase in production costs for goods and services is the primary reason for inflation that has affected households' budgets."},{"instruction":"Can you explain to me how an internal combustion engine works and how have they improved over the years?","output":"Internal combustion engines are found in all sorts of machines ranging from lawnmowers to large freighters that navigate the oceans. These engines run on a large variety of fuels which include the usual gas and diesel, but they can also run on fuels like natural gas, propane, biodiesel, or even ethanol. All these fuels have one thing in common, they are all combustible. The process of combustion, or burning, results in an energy release from a mixture of fuel and air. An internal combustion engine contains various components, but for simplicity's sake, let's focus on the fixed cylinder, pistons, crankshaft, powertrain, and ultimately the wheels. In an internal combustion engine, combustion happens within the engine by the ignition from a spark plug where that energy release is partially converted to do work. These expanding combustion gases will push the pistons which will then rotate the crankshaft, and, ultimately through a system of gears within the powertrain, will spin the wheels of the vehicle causing it to move. Since its creation, the internal combustion engine has been improved upon in several ways. For one, it has been integrated with hybrid electric powertrains to increase fuel economy by sharing the burden of moving the vehicle with the electric engine along with working side-by-side with plug-in hybrid electric systems where the electric motor will move the vehicle on its own up to certain speeds and distances to increase the range. Additionally, through years of R&D, manufacturers can reduce ICE emissions of certain pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter by more than 99%. Also, ICE performance has been drastically improved over the years in terms of overall horsepower and acceleration time along with using less fuel and increasing efficiency."},{"instruction":"Who is the most famous Magician of all time? And why?","output":"The most famous magician on this list, Hungary-born Houdini was part magician and part entertainer, thrilling audiences all over the globe who traveled from far and wide to see him escape from impossible situations. He was most famous for his ability to escape from what seemed like anything and everything, including ropes, handcuffs, straight jackets, jail cells, water-filled milk cans, and even nailed-shut boxes that had been thrown into a river. It seemed like there was nothing Houdini could not escape from and nothing he could not make audiences believe. He was even able to make an elephant disappear! Houdini began to expose the tricks used by mediums. He gave lectures on the topic and often included demonstrations of these tricks during his performances. He joined a committee organized by Scientific American and analyzed claims for a 2,500 prize for true psychic phenomena (no one ever received the prize). He spoke in front of the U.S. House of Representatives, supporting a proposed bill that would ban telling fortunes for pay in Washington D.C. Even though Houdini brought about some skepticism, it seemed to create more interest in Spiritualism.

Unlike the giant panda, red pandas prefer nibbling on bamboo leaves and fresh shoots as opposed to the stalks. A female red panda was once recorded as having eaten 20,000 bamboo leaves in one day! Red pandas need to eat so much bamboo because they can only digest about 24% of it. Though their diet is made up of mostly bamboo, red pandas sometimes also eat grass, fruit, eggs, insects and small animals. Interestingly, they are classified as carnivores (meat eaters), even though they mainly eat plants. Red pandas spend most of the day resting or sleeping. They are crepuscular, meaning they are most active in the early morning and late afternoon. When it‚Äôs cold, red pandas wrap themselves up in their bushy tail and go into a deep sleep called torpor.

This material can be used to fill bags or other containers your egg is put into. It helps fill the nooks and crannies with a soft material rather than air. The flour keeps the egg in one spot and gives it a soft material to land on. 2. Tissue paper. Tissue paper can be used to fill the empty spaces of your egg container. They can also be used to make makeshift parachutes to slow the descent of your egg. 3. Cotton Balls. Cotton balls work to help pad the landing of your egg drop. Fill a container with them and place your egg in the middle. This should help prevent the egg from cracking."},{"instruction":"I have long hair but I‚Äôm bored of my usual styling go-tos. What are some different ways I could style my hair? I already do chignons, basic braids, pony tails, and wearing it down so don‚Äôt list those options. Give me a brief explanation of how to do each one but don't give me too much detail, I'll do more research on the ones that seem interesting.","output":"Here are some different ways you can style your long hair: - French braid: This braid style is tough to nail without a mirror. Start by braiding three small strands at the crown of the head and gradually add more and more hair to each strand, securing the braid to the scalp along the way. You can also part your hair in the center and do this twice for French braided pigtails. - 4 stranded braid: It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of this style, but it‚Äôs nearly as easy as a standard braid with a more interesting look, plus it tends to be sturdier for those whose hair falls out of braids easily. - Half up: Take the top section of your hair and keep it up with a claw clip, a ponytail, or a small warrior‚Äôs knot; meanwhile let the bottom section of your hair hang loose. - Style with a headband or scarf: Leave your hair loose but brush it back so that there is no visible part. Then use your favorite headband or scarf. You can always use Bobby pins to hold slippery scarves in place. - Braided headband: Make a headband out of your own locks! This style is similar to a French braid except it‚Äôs woven from one temple To the other rather than straight back from the crown of the head. - Twisted halo: This style works best with curly or textured hair. Twist locks to weave them into a halo around your head, using Bobby pins to hold the twist in place. You can do this as a full updo or use just the top section of your hair for a half-down version. - Ponytail flip: Style your hair in a loose, low ponytail, then pull it into two symmetrical sections, creating a hole just above the elastic. Filter the long end of your ponytail through that hole once or twice to create a twist. This can also be done as a half-down style. - Space buns: part your hair into two even sections and secure both as high ponytails on each side of the head. Twist these into buns and hold them in place with pins. These can be tightly woven knots or loose for a wispier style."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this story about a tiny dog to make it first person like it is the dog telling the story.

Finally, after years of toiling away in an office with no windows, he was able to find a weekend away on the lake all by himself and with no one to answer to. No bosses were breathing down his neck and nobody was blowing up his phone. This weekend it was just about a man and his boat. Exiting his lakeside cottage with a piece of toast in his mouth, a vintage tin lunch pail, and a thermos in his hand, he made his way down to the dock at the end of his property. It was a short walk but each step he took seemed to have a little bit of extra bounce to it. There, at the dock, he found his little red canoe. Careful to maintain his balance he stepped into the boat, untied it from the mooring, and pushed off into the foggy morning glow. It was nearly dead silent in the hours before dawn. The lake rippled with each paddle but nary a bird bothered him. Fred paddled around in a circuitous route staying close to the shore before venturing a bit farther out. The sun was starting to rise and he aimed his boat directly for it almost as if trying to catch Apollo's chariot before it breached the horizon. Of course, that wasn't a race Fred could win and he soon found himself a quarter mile from land and the sun shining its new rays on his face. He stopped paddling and just coasted for a few moments breathing in the air and feeling the warmth whisk away the last bit of fog clinging to the lake's surface. Closing his eyes, he retracted his paddle from the water and placed it beside him in the boat. Leaning back slightly he felt all the tension in his body releasing in one big wave. And at the end, an abrupt sound which ended up being his stomach rumbling. It wakened him from his reverie but not in a disruptive sort of way. No, it was like a comforting old friend giving you a pat on the back. And so Fred opened up his lunch pail and pulled out a breakfast sandwich. He poured himself a cup of piping hot joe from his thermos. And then he ate.

Include tips in these 3 categories: cleaning, storage, and maintenance.","output":"1. Cleaning Pearls are more fragile than other gemstones. Cosmetics, perfume, and hairspray can dull a pearl‚Äôs luster, so don‚Äôt put on pearls before applying these products. After wearing your pearls, wipe them with a clean, soft cloth to remove body oil and perspiration. 2. Storage Pearls scratch easily, so they should be stored separately in a lined jewelry box or a soft pouch. Storing pearls for long periods in an airtight container can lead to dehydration, brittleness and cracking. This is why most jewelers recommend wearing pearls and exposing them to fresh air and natural humidity as often as possible. Just don‚Äôt wear them in a hot tub or swimming pool or while doing housework. Some common household chemicals and cleaning products can damage pearls, including chlorine and ammonia. 3. Maintenance A pearl necklace should be taken to a jeweler for restringing if signs of wear are detected. Be sure to ask the jeweler to knot the string between each pearl to keep the pearls from rubbing against each other. The knots will also help avoid losing pearls should the string break. If you have a pearl necklace with multiple strands, most jewelers will recommend restringing all strands at the same time regardless of wear."},{"instruction":"Who was Nellie Bly?","output":"Nellie Bly was a journalist who was born in Cochran‚Äôs Mill, Pennsylvania on May 5, 1864.

Public transit systems face daunting challenges across the U.S., from pandemic ridership losses to traffic congestion, fare evasion and pressure to keep rides affordable. In some cities, including Boston, Kansas City and Washington, many elected officials and advocates see fare-free public transit as the solution. Federal COVID-19 relief funds, which have subsidized transit operations across the nation at an unprecedented level since 2020, offered a natural experiment in free-fare transit. Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent. But although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial ‚Äúdoom spiral.‚Äù Free public transit that doesn‚Äôt bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters ‚Äì 85% of whom commute by automobile ‚Äì have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S. Why isn‚Äôt transit free? As I recount in my new book, ‚ÄúThe Great American Transit Disaster,‚Äù mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious ‚Äústreetcar suburbs.‚Äù Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare. These systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric ‚Äúred car‚Äù transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions. However, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs. Meanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing. Grudging public takeovers In most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore‚Äôs fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service. Local and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974). These poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit‚Äôs share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership. There were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities‚Äô transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems. Converging pressures Today, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter. Many systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at 176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022. Despite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it‚Äôs not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority. For example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use. A better model Other cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, ‚ÄúFair fare‚Äù programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users. Some providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa. Fare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys. As ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop. History shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn‚Äôt high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more. Taking fares out of the formula spreads the red ink even faster.","output":"These cities' politicians and voters have funded more transit options by supplementing fare collections with other sources of public income like bridge tolls and sales and property taxes."},{"instruction":"Create an itinerary for my 4-day trip to Greece, including nice spots and activities.

Craig was a husband, father, son, uncle, and dedicated employee at the TaxiCo Taxi Company here in Watlanta. Many of you who had come into contact with Craig will undoubtedly have fond memories and funny stories about him, as do I, which I'm sure we'll get a chance to share at the wake later tonight. One thing that I will say about Craig is, despite the untimely accident, he was very fond of dressing up his pet monkey, \\"Peaches\\", in a variety of clothing from the 1980s. He loved playing dress-up with Peaches and serving her tea and biscuits at noon; he loved that monkey like a daughter. It's unfortunate what happened that fateful day a month ago. Craig would never have put that pink tutu on Peaches if he knew Peaches would reject it so violently. I think even if Craig did know how Peaches would respond, he wouldn't take it personally, for he loved that simian so much. But that's all in the past now. I like to think that Craig is in a better place, one where he can have a sip of his margarita and sit on the heavenly beaches. I think Craig would probably be saving a space for the rest of us until we join him, and even a seat on his beach blanket for Peaches by his side. Now, let us all bow our heads in prayer for Craig, so that he may hear us wishing him well on his journey to the afterlife. And for Peaches, we pray that she may be let free from Animal Control soon so she can be let back to her family at the local zoo.

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that involves the study of rates of change. Before calculus was invented, all math was static: It could only help calculate objects that were perfectly still. But the universe is constantly moving and changing. No objects‚Äîfrom the stars in space to subatomic particles or cells in the body‚Äîare always at rest. Indeed, just about everything in the universe is constantly moving. Calculus helped to determine how particles, stars, and matter actually move and change in real time. Calculus is used in a multitude of fields that you wouldn't ordinarily think would make use of its concepts. Among them are physics, engineering, economics, statistics, and medicine. Calculus is also used in such disparate areas as space travel, as well as determining how medications interact with the body, and even how to build safer structures. You'll understand why calculus is useful in so many areas if you know a bit about its history as well as what it is designed to do and measure. Calculus was developed in the latter half of the 17th century by two mathematicians, Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton. Newton first developed calculus and applied it directly to the understanding of physical systems. Independently, Leibniz developed the notations used in calculus. Put simply, while basic math uses operations such as plus, minus, times, and division (+, -, x, and √∑), calculus uses operations that employ functions and integrals to calculate rates of change. Those tools allowed Newton, Leibniz, and other mathematicians who followed to calculate things like the exact slope of a curve at any point. The Story of Mathematics explains the importance of Newton's fundamental theorem of the calculus: \\"Unlike the static geometry of the Greeks, calculus allowed mathematicians and engineers to make sense of the motion and dynamic change in the changing world around us, such as the orbits of planets, the motion of fluids, etc.\\" Using calculus, scientists, astronomers, physicists, mathematicians, and chemists could now chart the orbit of the planets and stars, as well as the path of electrons and protons at the atomic level.","output":"Course Title: An Introduction to Calculus: Exploring Dynamic Change in the Universe Course Description: Calculus, a branch of mathematics, revolutionized the way we understand and analyze dynamic systems in the universe.

The series dramatizes an alternate history depicting \\"what would have happened if the global space race had never ended\\" after the Soviet Union succeeds in the first crewed Moon landing ahead of the United States.[1] The title is inspired by the lunar plaque left on the moon by the crew of Apollo 11, which reads in part, \\"We Came in Peace for All Mankind\\".[2] In an alternate timeline in 1969, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov becomes the first human to land on the Moon. This outcome devastates morale at NASA, but also catalyzes a U.S. effort to catch up.

I'd be happy to help. When creating a monthly budget, start by tracking your income and expenses. Make a list of all your income sources and categorize your expenses, including fixed costs like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and variable expenses such as groceries, entertainment, and transportation. Set realistic spending limits for each category and aim to save a portion of your income each month for emergencies or future goals."},{"instruction":"Do you have any suggestions for saving money on a tight budget?","output":"Certainly! Saving money on a tight budget can be challenging, but there are strategies you can employ. Consider cutting down on discretionary expenses like eating out or entertainment. Look for ways to reduce your monthly bills, such as negotiating lower rates for utilities or exploring cheaper insurance options. Additionally, prioritize building an emergency fund, even if you can only contribute a small amount each month. Every dollar counts, and it will provide a safety net during unexpected situations."},{"instruction":"I appreciate the advice. What are some beginner-friendly investment options for someone looking to grow their savings?","output":"Great question! If you're new to investing, consider starting with low-risk options such as a high-yield savings account or a certificate of deposit. These offer a modest return on your investment while keeping your money relatively safe. You can also explore index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide diversification and track the performance of a specific market index.

Collect a tablespoon-sized sample of soil from your yard and thoroughly moisten it. Roll it into a ball and then flatten it into a ribbon with your hands. 2. If the soil stays packed together and easily forms a ribbon, the soil is primarily comprised of clay. If the clay is smooth and not very sticky, it is silty clay. If the clay feels gritty, it is sandy clay. 3. If the soil stays together but is crumbly, it has a high composition of silt, sand, or organic matter, it is a loam soil. 4. If the soil doesn't hold together and breaks apart no matter how damp the sample is, it is sandy soil."},{"instruction":"My house is infested with rats!

Use the words \\"World Cup game\\".","output":"‚ÄúGet out of my country!‚Äù shouted the driver as I drove past him in the narrow parking lot. I clenched my jaw and gripped the gear shift, ready to chase him down. Taking a deep breath, I relaxed my muscles, collected my thoughts, and parked the car. I replayed those words in my head, my blood boiling up to my ears, and I kept coming back to the same question: I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of much worse before, why am I so furious? I then realized who those words were from. That driver was a fellow American, someone who I could have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with at a World Cup game cheering for the same country. This thought infuriated me and made me question the depth of the American spirit in the United States. Back in my apartment, I tried to come to terms with the fact that people from all walks of life, even Americans, can discriminate. It took much self-restraint for me not to start that car chase and I was proud of myself for showing restraint. As someone who wasn‚Äôt always good at remaining calm, I have grown tremendously in controlling my temper over the past few years. Before that day, the concept of the American spirit was still largely a hazy idea for me. I vaguely believed Americans should focus on helping themselves before helping others when they are in need, even if that need is intangible like cultural acceptance. However, my encounter with that driver helped develop my belief about the American spirit: the American spirit is the continuous never-ending cycle of self-improvement and helping others. These two ideas of simultaneous self-improvement and helping others are both necessary in building a grounded foundation and it is up to each true American to find his or her style. Sometimes it is not so straightforward, and almost always, it is not easy. On that day, I focused on composure and having a mature response. This in turn stopped me from compounding the driver‚Äôs hate with my hate and that was about as much help as I could give him. In reality, anybody can simply be an American by legal definition, but fully embodying the American spirit is much more meaningful. This realization continues to grow my appreciation and admiration for those with true American spirit."},{"instruction":"Write a poem about how life is so hard sometimes.

One side can represent positive feelings, the other negative. Every time you flip a coin somewhere, something changes in the world. Can you imagine if the world worked out like that?

Proper Axolotl Aquarium Size Since axolotls are bottom-feeding animals, the height of their aquarium is not as important as the length and width of it. Reaching an adult size of up to 10 inches in length or more, your axolotl needs plenty of room to turn around and fully extend its body in any direction. If an axolotl‚Äôs habitat is too small, it can cause stress for the animal, which can lead to health problems in the long term. To accommodate the lifelong growth of your pet, we recommend nothing smaller than a 30 or 40-Gallon Breeder tank, along with a lid to prevent the axolotl from jumping out of its enclosure (it‚Äôs happened before!). This is a common aquarium size and they are readily available at most pet stores and fish shops. Axolotl Aquarium Filtration Axolotls evolved in the relatively still waters of Lake Xochimilco in the valley of Mexico. Therefore, you should avoid using filters and equipment that produce a high amount of water flow and surface agitation in your axolotl‚Äôs aquarium. At the same time, axolotls also produce a significant amount of waste which can quickly pollute their water if there is inadequate filtration in the tank. Canister filters, hang-on-back filters, and internal filters with adjustable flow rates are all ideal‚Äîproviding three types of filtration (mechanical, biological, and chemical) to help your axolotl thrive. Another benefit of these three types of filters is that they allow you to aim the filtered water towards the surface of the tank. This helps prevent a buildup of debris and small particles from accumulating and creating a glossy film on the surface of the water. A less expensive option, while not as effective, is a sponge filter. Although they lack chemical filtration, they still provide adequate mechanical and biological filtration as long as they are large enough to accommodate the filtration load of the aquarium and its resident(s). Sponge filters will collect debris, waste, and other free-floating particles while simultaneously supplying plenty of surface area for beneficial bacteria to develop. Filters do not eliminate the need for regular maintenance. All aquariums require routine maintenance to keep them running at their optimal performance, and to keep the animals living there happy and healthy. Practicing a regular water change routine and performing regular water tests is essential to make sure your axolotl‚Äôs environment is as comfortable and healthy as possible. There are many filter options available on the market. Here are some we recommend based on our many years of experience keeping aquatic animals:","output":"Proper Axolotl Aquarium Size 1. Select an aquarium your Axolotl can grow and be comfortable in. Axolotls are bottom feeders and can grow up to 10 inches. They will need to be able to turn and extend its body in any direction. 2. Make sure it's not smaller than a 30 or 40-gallon breeder tank and don't forget the lid. An axolotl can jump out of its enclosure. 3. Choose a filter without a high amount of water flow or surface agitation in your axolotl's aquarium. Axolotls come from Lake Xochimilco, which has relatively still waters, so you want to recreate this environment. 4. Choose an adequate filter for the high waste amount of an axolotl. Canister filters, hang-on-back filters, and internal filters with adjustable flow rates are ideal and will help your axolotl thrive. 5. Consider a sponge filter. These are not as effective but are less expensive. They can provide adequate mechanical and biological filtration as long as they are large enough to accommodate the filtration load of the aquarium and its residents. 6. Complete routine maintenance. All aquariums need routine maintenance to keep them running and keep their inhabitance safe and healthy.

Bob was a very grumpy bear because he never liked to share anything. He would always keep his honey, his fish, and his berries to himself. This made him very lonely, as none of the other animals in the forest wanted to be friends with him. One sunny day, while Bob was out looking for honey, he stumbled upon a family of rabbits. The rabbits were very friendly and invited Bob to join them for lunch. Bob was hesitant at first, but he was also very hungry, so he agreed. The rabbits brought out a big basket of carrots, lettuce, and other vegetables. Bob had never tasted anything like it before. He was so hungry that he ate everything in the basket. The rabbits didn't seem to mind, and they even offered him more. Bob was amazed at how kind the rabbits were. He had never felt so happy before. After that day, Bob started to think about sharing more often. He realized that it was not only kind, but it also made him feel good inside. He started to share his honey with the bees and his berries with the birds. Slowly but surely, the other animals in the forest started to notice how much kinder Bob had become. They started to befriend him and invite him to their gatherings. Bob was no longer a grumpy bear, but a happy and friendly one. And all the animals in the forest loved him for it. One day, while Bob was out foraging for food, he came across a group of animals who needed help. They had lost their home in a nearby fire and were struggling to find food and shelter. Bob remembered how lonely he had felt before he learned to share and knew that he couldn't let these animals suffer. He offered to share his food and even helped them build a new home.

Also, it shows the costs and benefits that are related to the earning of that revenue. At the bottom of the statement or the ‚Äúbottom line,‚Äù the report will show whether a firm had net earnings or net losses over the time the statement is reporting for. Lastly, the income statement reports earnings per share (EPS) which tells the reader the amount shareholders would receive if the firm decided to distribute all its net earnings for a specific time. The balance sheet gives the reader details on the firm‚Äôs assets, liabilities, and stockholders‚Äô equity. These three variables make up the basic accounting equation where assets equal liabilities plus stockholder‚Äôs equity. Assets are anything that a firm owns that has value. This means assets can be either sold or used so the firm can provide products or services resulting from the use of said assets. Liabilities represent certain amounts of money that a company may owe to others. A firm can have liabilities that are due within the year (short-term) or liabilities that are due over a year (long-term). These can include various obligations like bank loans, accounts payable, or even rent. Stockholder‚Äôs equity represents the amount of money that would be remaining if a firm sold all its owned assets and paid off all its liabilities where what is left over would belong to the shareholders. The statement of cash flows gives the reader a company‚Äôs inflows and outflows of cash.

I‚Äôd love to see more from the Imperial point of view. Can you write a short perspective piece for an individual TIE fighter pilot? Try to base it around an ambush on Rebel ships.","output":"I dropped into the tiny cockpit before sealing my helmet. No sense wasting any more pressurized air than necessary, after all. I gripped the control yokes, my flight gloves flexing with familiar resistance. I was ready for this. I felt it in my bones. According to the briefing, we would be deployed the moment our Star Destroyer dropped out of hyperspace. It was always a jolt to drop from the TIE launch tram. The thing was an engineering masterpiece, but it still hit the pit of your stomach like a prize fighter. With open space in front of me, though, I was truly in my element. No matter what ship those rebel scum wrapped themselves in, they could never escape the cleansing effect of laser fire. I was eager to show them. Within seconds of our arrival in the system, my squadron was ordered to disable or destroy the Pelta-Class frigate in orbit around this unimportant planetoid. As one of the largest ships in the system, there was little doubt of its importance. I dove in, spinning around the pathetic defensive fire from a BTL Y-Wing along the way. On my display, I saw that my wingman did the same, barely faltering from our course toward the target. That simple pair of Y-Wings probably constituted the Rebel Alliance‚Äôs entire standing defensive screen. Given how quickly we‚Äôd appeared on their doorstep, they had almost zero chance of mustering more fighters before we reached our objectives. I zipped around behind the Pelta, firing my laser jabs at the aft shield motivators. Their destruction wouldn‚Äôt kill the shields outright, but it would limit their power across the aft end of the ship. That would make the rest of my squadron‚Äôs attacks on the engines far more effective. My wingman and I would now provide covering fire while the remainder of our squadron dug into the ship‚Äôs engine section. And even given my TIE‚Äôs limited visibility, I noticed the flashes from exploding engine chambers. That brought a smile to my face. A flurry of radio calls confirmed our success. All that remained for my wingman and I now was to clear a path back to the Star Destroyer. Our mission had been a resounding success!"},{"instruction":"Rewrite this crochet pattern description so it has a more informative tone and is less conversational.

The first references to the use of plant oils can be traced to Chinese medicine, also known as Traditional Chinese Medicine. Various parts of plants were consumed in either the raw state or dried, boiled, or steamed (to extract the oil). The end product was then consumed, inserted into any one of the natural openings of the body, massaged into the skin, or inhaled in vapor form. During the Medieval period, a collection of medicinal treatments for a variety of ailments was published by Abu Ali al-Husain Ebn Abdullah Ebn Sina (980‚Äì1037 AD). He was known in the West as Avicenna, a Persian physician who was also known as one of the most influential medical writers in the medieval period. Avicenna\`s Canon of Medicine, arguably one of the most famous books in the history of medicine, presents a clear and organized summary of all of the medical knowledge of the time, including a long list of drugs. Interestingly, lily and spotted orchid oils are mentioned as remedies for tinnitus (Mahdizadeh et al, 2015). Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, advances in western medicine progressed. The American Medical Association was founded in 1847 and the American Pharmaceutical Association was founded in 1852. At the federal level, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration (FDIA) was created 1927 and, three years later, changed its name to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).","output":"Plant oils have been used for a long time. Plants in general have been used in many forms and in many ways, with publications about this ranging from Traditional Chinese Medicine to the Medieval period.

Of course, I've been through them before. I stomped on Koopas and said hello to Toads as I pushed forward to the castle. That's when I ran into the Bullet Bills. For some reason, Bowser had decided to line his castle with hundreds of Bullet Bills. I had to dodge and weave through them, bouncing and diving until I finally made my way to a safe alcove. Once I got past them, I slipped inside the castle. It was full of LAVA! I had to be super careful here - one touch from the hot substance, and I would be done for. Luckily, there were convenient platforms for jumping. Eventually, I made it to the top and went inside the throne room. After a heated battle, I sunk Bowser in his lava and rescued the Princess! We had a nice dinner out to celebrate. As I mentioned before, it's been a busy day. I may need to talk to Bowser about his habit of stealing Peach once he recovers from the lava. We're all tired of it. Until next time! Mario"},{"instruction":"Write a news article about a house burning down in the city of Houston, Texas on the 1300 block of Cotton.

One foot in front of the other, pace starts slow and comfortable; Legs begin the process of invigorating the body with blood. Pushing upward on the wind-blown path, barely hearing the traffic rushing by; Headlights begin to flicker on, illuminating the adjacent asphalt.

Up and down the circular path the runner continued his evening ritual; A ritual playing scenes of both pain and pleasure, like a zoetrope of agony and ecstasy. \\"Heaven,\\" he muttered on one of his exhales, his breathing now at a labored pace; Twenty laps, yea, twenty miles, but the natural beauty of this place only grows.

There are many side hustles you can do both in person and virtually if you'd like to earn extra money or develop a passive income. Here are some ideas for things you could do on the side to make money while still working a traditional day job: 1. Edit Videos. Oftentimes brands need to produce promotional materials but don't necessarily have the time or expertise to do it in-house, so they hire freelancers to edit video content. 2. Sell NFTs. Non-fungible tokens are used to buy and sell products online. If you have something creative to sell, NFTs can be a great way to turn a steady profit. 3. Be a social media manager. Many companies or small businesses need a social media presence but don't necessarily want to deal with posting and coming up with good content all of the time. This is why many businesses will hire someone else to do this for them. 4. Be a virtual assistant. This is a straightforward side hustle that can be done from anywhere. 5. House sit. Housesitting is an industry in itself where people that have second homes or go on vacation but want someone to look after their space, including pets and plants, hire other people to do so. 6. Teach a language. You don't necessarily have to be bilingual to teach your native language to others, and this can be done virtually or in person. 7. Rent out your space. Airbnb has made it super simple and profitable to rent out your spare room or your entire home if you aren't using it. 8. Sell products on Etsy. These can be physical products or digital designs like branding or spreadsheets, for example. 9. Drive for a rideshare company. If you have a car, driving for Uber or Lyft in your downtime or on the weekends is a great way to earn money on the side. 10. Deliver food. Depending on where you live, delivering food through Postmates or Deliveroo can be a substantial side hustle and you don't even need a car. 11. Write an e-book. Since it's possible to self-publish, there's no downside to creating an e-book on a topic you're familiar with and selling it on Amazon. 12. Create an online course. This is another thing that may require a good amount of work upfront, but can eventually turn into a passive income."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this list of Do's and Don'ts into a paragraph. Here are some do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts about making your baby‚Äôs sleep space safe: Do put your baby to sleep on his back on a flat, firm surface, like a crib mattress covered with a tightly fitted sheet. Use only the mattress made for your baby‚Äôs crib. The mattress should fit snugly in the crib so there are no spaces between the mattress and the crib frame. The mattress shape should stay firm even when covered with a tightly fitted sheet or mattress cover. Do put your baby to bed in his own crib or bassinet. Don‚Äôt bed-share. This is when babies and parents sleep together in the same bed. Bed-sharing is the most common cause of death in babies younger than 3 months old. Keep your baby‚Äôs crib close to your bed so your baby‚Äôs nearby during the night. The American Academy of Pediatrics (also called AAP) recommends that you and your baby sleep in the same room, but not in the same bed, for the first year of your baby‚Äôs life but at least for the first 6 months Do make sure your baby‚Äôs bassinet, crib or play yard meets current safety standards. Visit the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to learn more about product safety standards or product recalls. Do remove hanging window cords or electrical wires near where your baby sleeps. Babies can get tangled in them and choke. Do keep the room at a comfortable temperature. If your baby is sweating or his chest feels hot, he may be overheated. Don‚Äôt use sleep positioners. These sometimes are called nests or anti-roll pillows. They often are mats or wedges with pillows on either side to help keep your baby in place. The Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) warns that sleep positioners can cause babies to die because of suffocation. Don‚Äôt let your baby sleep in a carrier, sling, car seat or stroller. Babies who sleep in these items can suffocate. If your baby falls asleep in one, take her out and put her in her crib as soon as you can. Don‚Äôt put your baby to sleep on soft surfaces, like a waterbed, sofa, soft mattress or cushion. Don‚Äôt keep crib bumpers, loose bedding, toys or other soft objects in your baby‚Äôs crib. They put your baby in danger of being trapped, strangled or suffocated. Don‚Äôt use cribs with drop-side rails. Don‚Äôt put portable bed rails on a regular bed. Babies can get stuck in rails and choke. Don‚Äôt try to fix a crib that has broken or missing parts.","output":"Safe sleep is important to keep babies safe and alive.

Discuss the requirements for becoming a CPA in Florida.","output":"What is the difference between a CPA and an accountant in Florida? This is a question that many business owners ask. While many of the duties are the same for a CPA and an accountant, there are some very distinct differences. A CPA or Certified Public Accountant can perform all the duties of an accountant but the reverse is not true. The requirements to become a CPA vary from state to state. Becoming a CPA in Florida requires 120 semester hours of undergraduate education including accounting courses and business courses. A candidate must also pass the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination and get a specific number of hours of on-the-job training. While an accountant need not be a certified professional, many have taken a number of business courses and have a good working knowledge of balance sheets, cash flow, owner‚Äôs equity, and the chart of accounts. An accountant is responsible for completing financial reports and most are fully capable of handling quarterly IRS tax reports and filings, as well as the annual tax return for a small business. The CPA profession is regulated by the state of Florida and it requires ongoing training each year. Though this is not true for accountants, many are eager to stay current with any tax law changes or advancements in business and financial matters. Both the CPA and accountant perform very detailed financial work and understand the importance of getting reports and other work done correctly. In both professions, you will find highly skilled individuals with a passion for numbers. They are capable to provide a wide range of assistance to business owners from tax preparation and auditing to accounts payable and receivable."},{"instruction":"Make up a story that contains these words: chair, component, cranky, and lottery.

Steve needed a break. On his birthday, his grandmother bought him a lottery ticket, and although Steve never squandered money on such things, he was excited about the potential to win the 5 million jackpot. Two nights later, when it was time for the lottery drawing, Steve put aside his work to watch it live on his small office TV. He barely breathed as he watched, astonished, as each drawn ball contained a number on his ticket! Sadly, when it came to the last number, it was one digit off. Steve's hopes of becoming a millionaire and being able to retire were over, but he still won more than enough money to take a month off of work and take his grandmother on an extended luxury cruise.

These changes can occur through mutation or through acquiring resistance genes from other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both healthcare and agriculture settings have contributed significantly to the rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post about a new food truck for llamas I am opening!","output":"Hi everyone!

Now I know lightning seems frightening, and that's because Lightning can potentially be very dangerous! But if you take careful precautions to be safe, there's nothing to fear! When thunder roars, go indoors! A good place to shelter from lightning is inside a safe, enclosed shelter. Homes, offices, stores, and cars with windows rolled all the way up can serve as safe shelters until the storm passes. However, that does not mean you are completely safe! During the duration of your time in the safe shelter, make sure to stay away from contact with water. Do not bathe, shower, or wash dishes. Avoid using electronic equipment of all types. Do not use corded phones; they are not safe during a thunderstorm! But cordless and cellular phones are safe to use. But what if you can't make it indoors? Ideally, you should remain aware of forecasted weather conditions before venturing outdoors. But if you are caught out where you cannot easily access a safe, enclosed shelter, what you should do is minimize risk. But how do I minimize risk if I'm caught outdoors??

Stay away from bodies of water like ponds or lakes. Don't clump up! If you are in a group, stay separate from each other. Do not stay in open vehicles like motorcycles or convertibles! Only enclosed vehicles are safe shelters. Finally, if you are unable to get to a safe shelter, it is best to crouch into a ball-like position with your heads tucked and hands over your ears, low and with minimal contact with the ground."},{"instruction":"How many inches are in a foot?","output":"There are 12 inches in 1 foot.

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious: If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answer‚Äôd it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest‚Äì For Brutus is an honourable man; So are they all, all honourable men‚Äì Come I to speak in Caesar‚Äôs funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me: But Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And, sure, he is an honourable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause: What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me.","output":"Finally...THE ROCK HAS COME BACK TO ROME!

Because Brutus said he was a bad man. And Brutus is an honorable man. I remember when Caesar brought many captives here to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: Is Caesar a bad man? When the poor cried did Caesar run? No, no he wept with them. But still, Brutus to the top of his lungs is screaming that this is a bad man. You all saw him when I presented him with the crown three times, and every time he refused. Is this an ambitious and evil man? Yet Brutus claims he was ambitious and of course, he is an honorable man. I'm not saying that jabroni Brutus was wrong. But here I am to the people of Rome to speak what I do know. You cheered for him when he was alive. What stops you from mourning him?

He needed to act now, or many good men might never return to their families. The fatalities to the Japanese in the war thus far had already been too high, but no more would occur, not under his watch. Josh quickened his pace as he heard another muffled peal, and felt a small explosion rock the hull. He broke into a run. Several hours earlier, it had all been different. Nobody on board had expected to experience conflict; the trip was purely operational, after all, a routine test just off the coast. The crew had gone about their light duties lazily, with only the engines making any noise, the day monotonous and droning. There had been laughter, joking, card games and reading, the camaraderie of men settling in for a long trip, who had not yet tired of the novelty. Josh furrowed his brow. Who would do this to their country? By sabotaging the engines, they risked going down into a watery tomb with everyone else. Who was unscrupulous enough to do this? He had a good idea. Ever since their departure, there had been one person that had drawn Josh‚Äôs attention. What was his name? Lumi√®-something-French. Shifty little character, always playing cards, dishonestly no doubt, though nobody ever caught him. Always skulking around alone at odd hours. Where was everyone? The hallways were conspicuously empty. He had heard cries earlier, but had not passed a single person yet. Josh reached the engine room, smelling an acrid smell before he entered. He noticed a small hole in the adjacent instrumental panel. Near an open wall panel over a pile of wires was Lumi√®, hunched, and focusing intently on a small charge of sorts, but he was not alone. Josh felt his breath leave him. Yura. Yura had been the government consultant on the project, endlessly asking questions. She had been around the entire craft; of course she‚Äôd know how to disable the critical components! He should have seen it before. He tried to fight back the feelings of rage and betrayal.

The specific U.S. territories that this statement applies to include the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam. A U.S. national mostly refers to a person born in an outlying U.S. possession such as American Samoa but can also be used to describe someone who is a U.S. citizen as well. Those born in outlying areas are protected by the U.S. government, able to obtain a U.S. passport, able to live in the U.S. and apply for naturalization, and are entitled to consular protection from the U.S. The main difference is that U.S. nationals are restricted from voting in any U.S. election or applying for jobs that require citizenship."},{"instruction":"What is the perfect thing to wear at a fall event that is outside?","output":"You know it's cold outside when you go outside and it's cold.

Keep the word count under 400 words. Make the article easy to read and understand.","output":"Most people don‚Äôt think about back health but this is one area that is so important for overall good health throughout your lifetime. Your back supports your entire body. Remember when you were in grade school, your parents and teachers were always telling you to sit up straight? They reminded you that if you slump all the time or walk slumped over, this can permanently alter the curvature of your spine. This is actually true although it would take years of slumping to do this. The thing is though, that if we develop poor habits as youngsters, they often follow us through to adulthood. You rarely ever see classes or information on back health but some schools do teach this during science class or gym. If you‚Äôve been having chronic backaches, then some simple back exercises can strengthen those muscles and cut down on the number of aspirin you have to take each day. You can practice sitting up properly best in a straight-backed chair. Sit down and press your back up against the chair back and take several deep breaths. Close your eyes and try to envision your spine completely straight. This combines bio-feedback with back exercises to help you be more aware of your spine and back. Walking and swimming are both good exercises for your back as well and they can improve your health in other areas. One exercise that stretches the back muscles and the backs of your legs at the same time is to stand up straight. Extend your hands to the ceiling, take a deep breath, and then release it as you bend forward touching your fingers to your toes. If you can, hold this position for a few moments. Here are a few other tips: 1. Never twist and bend at the same time. 2. Avoid carrying large, heavy purses or sling bags 3. Don‚Äôt slump while sitting watching TV or while driving the car. 4. Use a chair with a backrest and change positions often. 5. Choose a good mattress that lends support in all the right areas."},{"instruction":"I am planning a trip to Hawaii.

Switch to LED Lights Although LED lights may cost more than traditional light bulbs, they will help you save tons of money on your energy costs over time. Switching to LED bulbs is an excellent way to conserve energy and save on your electric bill. LED lights will not just help you save on your energy bill, but they can also help you save money on your overall lighting costs since they last at least 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. That means you will not need to replace your light bulbs as often. 2. Do Not Leave Your Refrigerator Door Open We all look inside our fridge as we decide what we want to eat. But did you know that doing so can cause you to waste a lot of energy? It takes more time for your refrigerator to cool back down after the doors have been open for several minutes. To eliminate this extra cost, try deciding on what you want to eat before you open your fridge doors to help reduce the amount of energy used. 3. Keep Your Oven Door Closed If you frequently open your oven door while cooking, it will take twice as long to get back to the cooking temperature. Instead of opening your oven door all the time, consider using an oven light if your oven has a window on the door that allows you to peek inside. 4. Shut Down your Electronics One of the easiest things you can do to help save on energy costs is to shut down your electronics when they are not in use. We all tend to leave our devices such as our TV and laptop on making it more convenient than waiting for it to boot up again. But leaving your devices on while they are not in use can contribute to your high energy costs. When we leave devices plugged into an outlet, they are still using power. This is something known as \\"phantom power\\". To help reduce your energy use and costs, try connecting everything to a power bar and turning that off whenever you leave the house. 5. Decrease Energy Use During Peak Hours These days, many homes are now equipped with smart meters that keep track of when you are using the most energy throughout the day. If you are interested in conserving energy, you should use most of your electricity during non-peak hours. By doing so, you will save as much as 10 cents per kilowatt. 6. Make Use of Small Appliances If you are cooking a small meal, you will want to make good use of your smaller appliances instead of firing up your large electric oven. Toaster ovens, electric skillets, air fryers, and other countertop appliances are now versatile enough to help you create a full-course meal without using a ton of energy. 7. Wash Laundry in Cold Water Only If you have any delicate items in your wardrobe, you may already know about the benefits of washing your clothes in cold water. Doing so can help your clothing last longer and the fabric is less likely to shrink. Another great benefit of using cold water while doing laundry is that it will help keep your electricity bill low. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the energy used by your washing machine is spent on heating your water. Therefore, many consumers have caught on to the benefits of using cold water to wash their laundry."},{"instruction":"Write a medium-length (<300 words) email from White Horse Boarding to its customers and potential customers about their vet services.

I know for sure you've all heard about the fashion rule that says wearing white after labor day is a big no-no. Well, today we will find out where this rule came from.

They wore bright whites while vacationing while those that remained in the city wore darker clothes. There's another theory that says it happened after Labor Day was made a national holiday. The wealthy put away their white clothes to signify that Summer was over. Okay, so now that we've got that history lesson out of the way. Let's talk about breaking this so-called rule.

I would like for it to be no more than 3 paragraphs long, please.","output":"Sea turtles throughout our world's oceans are rapidly disappearing. The sea turtle population has been in a state of rapid decline due to human interference. Marine pollution has been a major factor in the drop in the sea turtle population. Things like sewage disposal, oil spills, and toxic waste are harming the reptile group greatly. In addition to this, there are 100 million tons of plastic in our oceans, 80% of which comes from people. Many turtles are killed or injured due to plastic trash alone but the harm that is being done to this aquatic reptile doesn't stop there. About 250, 000 turtles have been captured, injured, or killed by fishermen, often even by accident. Fishing nets used to catch other ocean creatures have captured many sea turtles by mistake. The nets keep the turtles held underwater and cause them to drown. According to the data, the issue is very severe. One species in particular, the leatherback, has had its population decline by 40% in the past three generations according to the NOAA. Needless to say, something must be done about our precious sea turtle population. Nearly all species of sea turtles have made their way onto the endangered species list. Some steps we could take to try and reverse this catastrophe include participating in coastal cleanups, reducing the rate at which we use single-use plastics, and even conserving the water we use at home. Those are things we can all do as individuals to help. However, we must also hold corporations that dump toxic waste into the ocean accountable. Although it is illegal in most places to dump waste into the ocean, that does not stop it from happening. The ocean is a very difficult place to regulate and perhaps society as a whole should at the very least try to make these regulations even more strict to better enforce these rules but it is easier said than done. In conclusion, the world's sea turtle population is in rapid descent due to ecological factors caused by humans that affect their immediate environment. There is currently little we can do to reverse the situation, but I wanted to help bring attention to it so that we may all do our part in reducing plastic use and helping stop other waste from affecting our oceans. Turtles are not the only sea creatures harmed by these atrocities, they are simply the most affected. I hope my essay inspires whoever reads it to make changes in their everyday lives to help our endangered turtle friends as well as all of the other ocean creatures impacted by marine pollution and the other factors I mentioned to continue to survive. Most of all, I hope it calls into question our current policies on ocean regulation and if they are enough. This type of harm to the natural beauty of our Earth simply should not stand."},{"instruction":"Write a poem about a crocodile and his friend, a bird who cleans his teeth.","output":"Yummy, yummy!

Show me a numbered list of tips to follow to make the move easier mentally and physically.","output":"Transitioning from your childhood bedroom to a college dorm can make you feel overwhelmed and scared. Hopefully, the following four tips will help you make a smoother shift from home to a college living situation. Congratulations on making the big move toward an independent future! 1. Ask your family, friends, and loved ones for help. You‚Äôll probably need physical help making the move to college, but you‚Äôll also need support and emotional help. For many college newbies, it‚Äôs not easy to leave the familiarity of a childhood home but knowing that you have the emotional support and love of those that you care about can give you a much-needed confidence boost and lessen your doubt or anxieties. 2. Sharing a dorm? Be open-minded as to who your roommate may be. While you can request a specific type of dorm room, it‚Äôs not often that you can request a specific type of roommate. So, be open-minded and respectful of whoever you‚Äôve been paired with. You‚Äôll be spending a lot of time together in the same space, so you must establish a cordial rapport from the start. If you and your roommate have too many differences, you can always request a transfer later in the school year. 3. Pack the essentials, but save d√©cor and organizational extras for after you‚Äôve moved in. Toiletries, clothes, and comfort items, like a favorite blanket, are all essential for any college student on move-in day. Otherwise, everything else is extra that can wait until you‚Äôve settled into your dorm room. Don‚Äôt overload the car with things that you don‚Äôt need right away. There are stores and shops galore in college towns, so it should be easy to find any d√©cor or organizational tools that you may need after you‚Äôve officially transitioned from home to college. 4. Anxious? Arrive on campus earlier than everyone else to ensure you don‚Äôt get caught in the move-in rushes. Anxiety is the biggest problem for most new college students, especially because they don‚Äôt want to feel dumb or make a fool of themselves on the first day around everyone else. It‚Äôs a common fear, and one that‚Äôs typically unfounded, particularly when everyone is worried about the same things. However, you can lessen your anxiety by planning on earlier arrivals. If you‚Äôve packed only the essentials, it should be easy for you to find your room and get settled in before the other students make a mad dash to do the same. The general rule of thumb for anxious students is to arrive two to three hours before the move-in rushes."},{"instruction":"Come up with an excerpt from the sixth chapter (out of 20) of a novel that follows a family through multiple generations as they attempt to gain power and success.","output":"Edgar Raines - as he was known to the rest of the financial world - had achieved success on his own, without the help of his prestigious family's name. Seeking to make a name for himself, Edgar set out on a journey that took him from the city of Guadalajara, Mexico, to Orange County, California, where he quickly sought employment at the closest and most available job opportunity he could find. In this case, it was as a cashier at a local In-N-Out burger restaurant. Edgar decided to change his name before his job interview, declining to go by his birthname (Edgar Ramirez) as he believed a less ethnic name would open more doors and create more opportunities down the road. Edgar also wanted to put as much distance between himself and the Ramirez family name to ensure any opportunities he gained would not be based on the fact that his family name was synonymous with the Mexican-American oil company established several generations before his own time. Edgar desired to be a self-made man, someone who could prove to the rest of the world - and himself - that success can be achieved in one's lifetime, and that it doesn't necessarily rely on already being rich. In-N-Out cashier was the first successful venture he crossed off his list. The next: manager. And then the next: corporate. Edgar Raines' reputation as a rock-steady, reliable, hardworking individual preceded him. In his corporate role, Edgar implemented many changes to the In-N-Out business process that were used to streamline the making of their food, reduce costs, and line franchise owners' and business executives' pockets with cash. Instead of resting on his laurels, Edgar had a sound investment strategy in place: he invested chiefly in Apple stock and Bitcoin before they went parabolic, and he became a sort of \\"stock whisperer\\" in the process. The name Edgar Raines was known for quality, success, and achievement, with many drawing comparisons to Edgar and to another famous name that was equated with those attributes: Ramirez."},{"instruction":"Create a bullet-point list about 10 cities and towns in Georgia and facts or information about them.

Her mother had died peacefully in her sleep, but Kyra couldn't reckon with a lifetime of living to justify one iota of death. Still, she was coping; the hole in her heart was smaller every day, albeit by a little. Looking at the painting helped. Her great, great uncle Keith had been an exceptional artist, and at some point, he'd gathered as many family members as he could find, both near and far, to be painted. His work was immaculate, with clear, recognizable features on every person. He must have truly loved them. She would brew a cup of tea in the morning and spend some time with the painting before heading to work. She didn't recognize many faces, but it was comforting to know that they had passed on like her mother. That was an odd thing to appreciate, she knew, but it gave her solace, nonetheless. One day, in a moment of strong emotion, she touched the painting. The world seemed to shimmer around her, and she found herself in another world entirely. Somehow, she remained calm, possessed with the strong inclination that she should show no emotion in this place of reverence. She had some inking of where she was, too.

It was cast with a silver sheen; everything seemed slightly out of focus, as if the existence of the place was constantly being challenged and only maintained by conscious effort‚Äîperhaps that was exactly the cause. Up ahead, she saw her mother, and despite the thumping of her heart and the inner voice warning her to go back, she raced toward her, calling out her name.

I was aware of it previously, but I didn't look into it until today. This thing's pretty amazing, so let me tell you about it. It's a particle accelerator, and its job is to smash tiny particles together. It's built inside a huge underground tunnel that's 27 kilometers long. The tunnel is a closed loop though, it's not just a tunnel that goes 27 km away from the starting point. The collider uses magnets and other arrangements to accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light. At this point, the particles are put on a collision course with each other and ultimately collide. The magnets I referred to previously have to be kept at a temperature of ‚Äë271.3¬∞C. There are thousands of magnets in the collider, so it makes sense it's a long loop. One thing that's amazing about the LHC is the precision with which it operates. It has to collide tiny particles into each other, so you can imagine trying to shoot two needles at each other from 10km apart and trying to make them collide ‚Äî it's no easy task!

But when the powerful Witch of the Waste deems Sophie a danger to her plans, she casts a spell that turns her into an elderly woman. Sophie must abandon the shop and eventually finds work as a maid for the infamous wizard Howl in his moving castle. Before even meeting the castle owner, Sophie strikes a deal with Howl's fire demon, Calcifer: if she can break a contract between Howl and Calcifer, then Calcifer will restore her to her original youthful form. However, according to the terms of the contract, neither Howl nor Calcifer is allowed to reveal the main clause, leaving Sophie to deduce it for herself.

Craft is a gateway to story Crafts are a beautifully visual and tactile way to help a story stick (literally and metaphorically). You don‚Äôt need to be the next Picasso or have the world‚Äôs best idea ‚Äì that‚Äôs what Pinterest is for! Craft can bring the pages in a book to life, helping children to explore characters and events in a playful way that contributes to their understanding, learning and development. Craft can deepen the personal connection between a child and the Bible story. Craft is a gateway to conversation Children and grownups alike talk more openly when their hands are busy. When I taught as a nursery teacher, I had many conversations with children whilst they were engrossed in craft. When talking with a child about a Bible story, relate it to their own experiences, such as their family, home or favourite toy. e.g. ‚ÄúWho do you love? (Mummy/Daddy/Grandpa etc.) Did you know we have a heavenly Father, Daddy God, who loves us too?‚Äù Conversations are so important, and craft can spark ‚Äòlightbulb‚Äô moments in a child‚Äôs faith journey (and so can play time, snack time, and take-home activities!)","output":"Crafts help stories stick because children explore characters and events in playful ways.

The ‚Äúelbow‚Äù can be pointing either forward or back as shown. see which grip suits you best. HOW TO THROW Throw with a normal over arm style facing 45 degrees to the right of the wind (to the left if you are left handed). Aim the boomerang at a point on or just above the horizon. ALLOWING FOR THE WIND Throw to the right of the wind about 45 degrees (to the left if you are left handed) so that the breeze helps the boomerang come back. By throwing from the same spot and aiming for an object in the distance, you can adjust the throw angle to the wind. This is very important. The boomerang should be nearly vertical on release. Increasing the tilt angle makes it fly higher and land further back. Holding it more vertically makes it fly lower and land further forward. Catch it between you hands in a clapping motion as shown here as it hovers down near you. Aim for the central section of the boomerang and avoid contacting the fast moving wing tips.","output":"Hold the curved side of the boomerang between your thumb and first finger and throw it overhanded while aiming 45 degrees to the right of the wind.

I tell myself it's just the old oak tree limbs scratching feebly at the glass in the wind. But there is no wind, and there is no oak tree. There's just a street corner bodega many floors below. And then there's the fire escape. Of course, I checked that when the sound first started. But that was only after grabbing the Louisville slugger every sensible New Yorker kept by his bed. Or a knife or a gun, depending on just how bad the neighborhood was. But I made the mistake of thinking I should get the drop on whoever was out there. I went in my briefs and my socks. The lights stayed off. I'd nearly convinced myself into thinking it was a street cat or the like, some calico stray coming home to the wrong place. But a man's silhouette dispelled that notion real fast. Choking up on the bat with one hand, I went for the window latch with the other.

Keep it under 250 words.","output":"The hot and cold methods of making herbal vinegar only differ in the preparation of the vinegar. To make herbal vinegar using the hot vinegar method you will need to first heat the vinegar you choose to use in a pot until it is just below boiling temperature. When using the cold method, this step is skipped entirely. You will want to bruise the herbs you plan on using to help them release their flavor more and place them into a glass jar. Now, fill the jar with either hot or cold vinegar until there is ¬º inch of air space at the top and then tightly seal it. Now you just need to store this jar in a dark, cool place for 10 days before opening it up and tasting it. If you are happy with the flavor, you can strain the herbs and bottle the vinegar. If you want more flavor, you can leave the herbs in the jar for up to a month before straining them out. These two methods are used depending on the type of herb you are infusing and the flavor you want in your finished product as different herbs react to heat in different ways. The finished vinegar will have an optimum shelf life of 6 months but can last for up to a year if stored correctly."},{"instruction":"Write a late-night monologue about something funny in the news, like Biden falling off a bicycle.

The only thing more dangerous than Biden on a bicycle is Biden in front of a plate of ribs.

Out of habit, you all turn your heads to see who came in. It‚Äôs someone you don‚Äôt recognize. He‚Äôs blond, and you could tell from the distance between you and him that he was pretty tall. One of his hands is tucked into the pocket of his slacks, and the other is curled around a backpack strap that rests on his shoulder. Your eyes stayed glued on the man as he shuffled into a row near the back. After forcing yourself to turn away from him and pay attention, you see Sam out of your peripherals, looking at you, trying not to laugh. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, now is not the time to be focusing on Mister Big, Blond, and Beautiful over there.‚Äù ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù you hiss your reply to Bucky, who is chuckling quietly.

The business sells homemade cookies.","output":"Business Summary Our business is called \\"Captain Cookies\\". We are a small business in Hawaii that makes a variety of cookies for any occasion. We have been in business since 2019 and continued to do business despite the pandemic, selling our cookies from home to local stores, businesses, and even online. Since 2019, Captain Cookies has sold a total of 300,000 worth of cookies to stores and businesses around the world. However, the number of cookies we make in our tiny kitchen cannot meet the overwhelming demand we have received recently due to a hugely successful TikTok campaign that came out several months ago and created a craze for our product. Therefore, we are now applying for a loan of 100,000 to help our business meet the growing demand for our cookies. Business Plan Our business plan involves the following: 1. Leasing a new 1,000-square-foot warehouse building; 2. Purchasing the necessary equipment (ovens, mixers) and packaging (plastic bags, twist ties, labels) to make and package 1,000 cookies a day, which would be an increase from the 200 cookies we currently produce from our current kitchen; 3. Paying for utilities (electricity, Internet access for POS systems, and online sales). 5-Year Plan The 5-year plan for Captain Cookies will see our company expanding from a single kitchen to a larger warehouse kitchen that will accommodate the increase in demand for our cookies. Within the first year, we plan to start a business relationship with a large international coffee chain that operates from Washington State; this coffee chain has agreed to purchase 10,000 cookies for a first purchase order for one of their local stores as a test market, with the agreement to buy an additional 100,000 cookies if that particular campaign is successful. We plan to do approximately 500,000 in sales by year three. By year five, we anticipate that with current sales, as well as the added relationship with the coffee chain and catering to a larger online market, we will do approximately 1 million in sales. We anticipate making our final payment on the loan before year four."},{"instruction":"Hi, I am a tourist who just landed in Chicago, Illinois.

Global warming has brought about serious consequences such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, deforestation, and species loss. But we, as individuals, can slow down this destructive force by implementing sustainable actions within our communities. Here are six simple yet impactful actions to fight climate change locally: 1. Reduce emissions: Use your car less, and opt for sustainable transportation like biking or public transit. Choose trains over airplanes for long-distance travel. Remember, even a tiny speed increases significantly raise CO2 emissions and expenses. 2. Save energy: Be mindful of appliance labels, avoid standby mode, and adjust heating and air conditioning thermostats. Conserving energy benefits both the planet and your wallet. 3. Embrace the 3 R's of sustainability: Reduce consumption, reuse items through second-hand markets and bartering, and recycle packaging and electronic waste. Recycling just half of your household garbage can save over 730 kilos of CO2 annually. 4. Adopt a low-carbon diet: Reduce meat consumption (a major contributor to atmospheric pollution), prioritize local and seasonal food, and avoid excessive packaging and processed foods. 5. Act against forest loss: Prevent fire hazards, choose sustainably sourced wood products, and plant trees. 6. Make demands from the government: Advocate for renewable energy, promote transparent product labeling, support sustainable transportation, and encourage responsible waste management through recycling and reuse. 7. Remember, the power lies within us to demand change from governments and raise global awareness of the climate crisis. Think globally, act locally. Your actions are crucial in the fight against climate change. Together, let us make a difference and create a more sustainable future.

Make it super simple and understandable to anyone.","output":"In the game of football, both teams send out eleven players onto the field. Throughout the game, one team will be on offense, and one will be on defense. The offensive team‚Äôs objective is to get the football into the endzone while the defensive team is trying to stop that from happening. The offensive team has four chances, called downs, to move forward 10 yards. If, within those four downs, they do not make it ten yards, the ball is turned over to the other team, and they switch to offense. But if the offensive team does make it ten yards, they get another four downs to get it another ten yards, and this goes on until they hopefully make it across the endzone and score. The ball can be moved by running with it or passing it by throwing it. If the defensive team intercepts the ball, then they take possession and become the offensive team. But if the ball is in the hands of an offensive player, the defensive players can stop them from gaining any more yards by tackling them to the ground. Running or passing the ball over the endzone results in six points for the offensive team, then they have the opportunity to kick the ball through the goal post (the big yellow y-shape post) for one extra point or run it across again for two extra points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins."},{"instruction":"Write a free-verse poem about a sheep making an apple pie.

History of Earth Day Celebrate Earth Day with these tips for helping our environment. BY ROSE DAVIDSON Our planet is an amazing place, but it needs our help to thrive! That‚Äôs why each year on April 22, more than a billion people celebrate Earth Day to protect the planet from things like pollution and deforestation. By taking part in activities like picking up litter and planting trees, we‚Äôre making our world a happier, healthier place to live. The first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970, when a United States senator from Wisconsin organized a national demonstration to raise awareness about environmental issues. Rallies took place across the country and, by the end of the year, the U.S. government had created the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, Earth Day was an event celebrated by more than 140 countries around the globe. You can celebrate and protect the planet at the same time. Check out these Earth Day ideas to help save the planet any time of year. BECOME A WASTE WARRIOR The number of garbage trucks Americans fill each year would stretch halfway to the moon. Toilet paper tubes, made from cardboard, take two months to decompose in a landfill. A plastic bottle sticks around for way longer‚Äîit can take over 450 years to break down! But instead of turning to the trash bin, you could turn these items into an awesome telescope or a flower planter. Before you throw something away, think about whether it can be recycled or repurposed. You can also limit waste by reducing the amount of things you buy. For example, check the library for that book you have to read before visiting the store. PLANT A TREE Researchers estimate roughly 15 billion trees in the world are cut down each year, so help offset that loss by planting a tree of your own. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen for people to breathe. They also provide shelter and food for animals such as squirrels and owls. Depending on where trees are planted, their shade can even reduce the need for air-conditioning in hotter months. How many more reasons do you need to go green? TURN OFF THE LIGHTS Does that lamp really need to be on while the sun is out? Electricity doesn‚Äôt just happen‚Äîit has to be produced from things around us. A lot of times it comes from fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, or natural gas) that contribute to climate change. But electricity can also be made from renewable sources like wind, water, the sun, and even elephant dung! No matter where it‚Äôs coming from, try conserving electrical energy by using only what you need. LIMIT YOUR WATER USAGE Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. It might seem like it‚Äôs everywhere, but clean, drinkable water is a limited resource. In fact less than one percent of the water on Earth can be used by humans. (The rest is either too salty or too difficult to access.) Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. To help save even more water, challenge yourself to take a shorter shower (but still get clean!). OFFER YOUR TIME With a parent‚Äôs permission, volunteer to pick up trash at a nearby park, start a collection drive for recyclable items, or organize a screening of an environmentally themed movie. By getting involved and working with others, you‚Äôre not just helping the Earth‚Äîyou‚Äôre making new friends too! SPREAD THE MESSAGE Talk to your friends and family members about what you‚Äôre doing and ask them to help. Need to get the conversation started? Get everyone together and reconnect with nature by taking one of our Get Outside challenges, or check out some other green tips you can share. The more people do, the better off our planet will be!","output":"Earth Day is celebrated every year by more than a billion people across the globe on April 22nd.

Michael was a boring person who liked routines and didn't venture out of his comfort zone for any reason. However, on this day, Michael decided to try something new: instead of a large black coffee, he wanted to try a medium iced caramel macchiato with whipped cream. For some reason, Michael felt a little goofy today and wanted to see what it was like being outside his comfort zone for once. Michael went through the drive-through and ordered his drink, then went to the next window to pay. He received his drink and had a sip: it was cold, tasty, sugary, and much more vibrant than he cared for. He was so put off by the in-your-face tastiness of the macchiato that he threw the drink cup out of his car window into the middle of traffic. Little did Michael know, this incident would set off a chain reaction of events that would result in tragedy. The coffee cup he threw out the window ended up hitting a passer-by in another vehicle, causing the driver to momentarily veer off the road and crash into a utility pole. The utility pole fell onto the roadway and caused a road closure that would last for several hours. While the road closure was going on, the driver of a transport truck carrying a supply of fried chicken for a nearby restaurant decided to drive through the obstruction and ended up overturning and spilling the chicken on the road. The nearby restaurant ran out of chicken and would have to be shut down for the day due to the failure of the delivery truck to deliver their chicken. As a result, all restaurant workers had to go home for the day. One of the workers, a young teen who was bored, decided to go to the store to buy fireworks to play with at home. The worker ended up lighting a bottle rocket that flew errantly through the open window of a fireworks factory, which caused the fireworks within to catch fire and explode and cause the entire factory to explode and go up in flames."},{"instruction":"Write an email inviting my parents to an Easter Celebration.

Do I need to be careful where I plant them, so they don't get overharvested? Are there any I should avoid?","output":"Chickens can eat almost any cooking herb that you'd commonly plant in your garden, but some are more beneficial to the chickens than others. Here are some with noted health benefits: ‚Ä¢ Mint: Mint's powerful smell can help combat any undesirable coup fumes and also keep insects at bay. In addition, it can encourage new feather growth in chickens and has been said to have a calming effect. (Calmer hens equals more eggs!) It can even be served fresh, frozen, or dried, and obviously has many household uses, as well. Because mint is a prolific grower, it's safe to plant near the coup. If it spreads inside, the chickens can trim the excess without harming the overall supply. ‚Ä¢ Lavender: Lavender is calming for chickens and humans alike! In addition, it has a lovely smell that mixes well with mint and other herbs. This smell helps dispel pests. Lavender is also good for the circulatory system, increasing blood flow when hens might not be moving around as much (during winter, cold snaps, or when sitting on eggs.) The seed-shaped flowers of lavender are also enjoyable for chickens to forage, providing some mental exercise. ‚Ä¢ Oregano: Oregano's smell deters pests and mixes wonderfully with the basil and tomatoes in your garden (which chickens also love!) Oregano grows best when harvested often, so whole springs can be hung in your coup for the chickens to pick at and scavenge. It's a natural antibiotic that's full of vitamins and antioxidants. You can even add dried oregano into your feed for these benefits, although it won't be as potent as fresh sprigs. ‚Ä¢ Thyme: Thyme, like the others, is aromatic and mixes wonderfully with the smell of lavender. (Just check your soap scents!) Like oregano, thyme is a natural antibiotic that also aids in respiratory stability. Thyme spreads, like mint, so it's safe to plant near the coup and let the chickens control the excess. It can be hung in full sprigs like oregano or dried. Additionally, any of these herbs can be soaked in vinegar and used as an all-natural pest control due to their aromatics.

I'd like you to use a lambda function to accomplish this.","output":"I'm happy to help with that! To accomplish what you asked for, we first create a set so we can track whether we've already added an element or not. Then, we will use the filter method, which will only pass through elements that evaluate to true in a given function and assign it a lambda function that checks whether the given element is in the existing set or not. Note that in Python, the add method returns None and not a boolean value about the existence of the element like in other languages such as Java. So the return statement of our lambda function first checks whether x is already in the set or not. If it's not in the set, then we want to add the element x to the set and return true (so to return true from a value of None, we must add a not condition in front of it). def unique(n): added = set() return list(filter(lambda x: ( x not in added and not added.add(x) ) , n))"},{"instruction":"Give me a list of 5 US national parks that are the least visited.

However, anecdotal evidence and personal experience tell me that this is the case. Before anyone gets offended or defensive, as I said, these are my personal observations and hypotheses as someone who has traveled quite a bit, lived overseas, and interacted with people of various nationalities in both my personal and professional life. 1. The United States is massive, so why leave? The first thing that comes to mind is that Americans can basically go on any type of vacation they want without leaving their home country! The US is an ideal geographic location for a nation. You can wander the dramatic coastlines of the Pacific Northwest, traverse the desert out west, go skiing in the mountains, visit any one of America‚Äôs lakes or rivers for watersports, and have a stunning beach vacation in the Gulf of Mexico all without ever leaving the country. 2. Americans don‚Äôt have the same work and career flexibility as other nationalities. Even though this is changing slightly with more remote work opportunities and hybrid work settings becoming more mainstream, generally speaking, Americans do not have the same flexibility related to their work schedule as Europeans, for example. 3. Americans are simply more hesitant to visit other countries. I hate to use the word ‚Äúscared,‚Äù but, I think that in America, we are raised to think that the world is a big, scary, and dangerous place. However, without getting political or anything like that, the US is actually rated 28th for homicide in 2023, which is higher than any other developed country and higher than many developing ones. I recognize that this is just one statistic, but one can‚Äôt deny that America is no longer the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù place it perhaps once was. 4. Many Americans lack exposure to other cultures. This isn‚Äôt anyone's fault, and it‚Äôs not detrimental or anything, it‚Äôs just an observation. Most of the rest of the world has American culture injected into their newsfeeds, music, television, and other forms of entertainment and popular culture. Whereas in America, we view all of our own culture and no one else‚Äôs for the most part. This tends to lower the baseline level of curiosity about the rest of the world for much of the American youth."},{"instruction":"Provide three effective strategies for managing stress in the workplace, considering the well-being of employees and overall productivity.","output":"Sure! Here are some effective strategies for managing workplace stress considering the well-being of employees and overall productivity. 1. Prioritize Workplace Wellness Workplace stress can significantly impact the well-being and productivity of employees. Encourage healthy living and exercise by providing opportunities for employees to take a break and engage in physical activity. Consider subsidizing gym memberships or bringing a yoga instructor into the office. You can also hold a steps contest among teams for those who own fitness trackers and offer healthy snacks in the office. Such initiatives show that you care about your employees' health and well-being. 2. Revamp the Work Environment The physical environment of the workplace can significantly contribute to employee stress levels. Make changes that increase employee enjoyment, such as updating the office with an upbeat color scheme, additional plants, or new silverware. If space permits, consider adding a ping pong or foosball table. Such changes can help employees take their minds off work-related stress for a few minutes. 3. Allow for Flexible Hours and Remote Working Offering flexibility in working hours and remote working options can be an effective strategy to reduce workplace stress. Employees with control over their work schedules can better manage their workload and balance work and personal responsibilities. This approach also shows that you trust your employees to deliver high-quality work regardless of location."},{"instruction":"Sparrow, I am enlisting your help.

He realized that being close to those he cared about was a great, important thing.

It usually occurs in one episode but may reoccur. There is diffuse inflammation in multiple areas including the brainstem, spinal cord, and subcortical cerebellum. Symptoms of ADEM typically include encephalopathy (Including confusion, irritability, and aggressive multiple sclerosis resulting in somnolence to coma) as well as multifocal deficits, fever, and meningismus (Headache, photophobia, and stiff neck). Imaging detecting ADEM will consist of large (Meaning greater than one to two centimeters), multifocal, bilateral, asymmetric, and hyperintense lesions.

Acute Optic Neuritis (AON) is a retrobulbar inflammation of the optic nerve that occurs on an acute basis. It may be associated with various neurologic conditions including MS, ADEM, NMO, or lupus; it can also occur spontaneously. It is usually unilateral and presents with lessened visual acuity, desaturation of red color, visual field deficits, and afferent pupillary defect. Symptoms typically include headache, painful eye movements, dim vision, and central visual blurring, and may produce complete loss of vision. About imaging, an MRI will frequently show gadolinium enhancement of the optic nerve. Transverse Myelitis is another condition that normally presents as a CIS but may be connected with MS or ADEM. It involves spinal cord dysfunction regularly owing to inflammatory lesion(s). It generates unilateral or bilateral sensory and/or motor deficits such as weakness, sphincter dysfunction, and paresthesias. It can sometimes present more severely, including urinary retention and paraplegia. When imaged, it will show gadolinium-enhancing lesions spreading over one or more segments on MRI.

I've never understood what makes a joke work, much less, what a shaggy dog story is. Explain how jokes work and exactly what is a shaggy dog story. It will be helpful if you give examples along with the explanation.","output":"Every joke consists of a set-up which, like the exposition of a play, tells the listener or reader everything necessary to understand the finale called the punch line which, in itself needs to be unexpected based on the set-up. Here is an example. Set-up: A skeleton walks into a bar. The bartender asks, ‚ÄúWhat will you have?‚Äù The skeleton says, Punch line: ‚ÄúA beer and a mop. The set-up puts the image of a skeleton, a bar, and the bartender in the listener‚Äôs mind and presents a question. The listener will try to anticipate how the skeleton will respond, which, unless the listener had heard the joke before, they will be unlikely to guess. This creates tension in the listener. The unexpected answer found in the punchline surprises the listener who laughs because of the surprise that releases the tension. A Shaggy Dog story, named after a famous, oft-told joke, is similar. It has a set-up but then has lots of generally irrelevant information added. During the conveying of the information (the story), the listener tries to figure out how all this information will lead to a punchline and what that punchline will be. The punchline to a Shaggy Dog story is often nonsensical as well as being a surprise. Theoretically, the more tension created by the long story, the greater the laugh and release, but with Shaggy Dog stories (that do not always involve a dog), the response is often a groan. Here is an example. A man and a dog walk into a bar. The man sits on a bar stool and invites the dog to do the same. As soon as the dog jumps onto the stool the bartender says, ‚ÄúGet that dog outta here. We don‚Äôt allow no mangy mutts in here!‚Äù The man says, ‚ÄúBut sir, this is a very special dog. He talks.‚Äù ‚ÄúDogs don‚Äôt talk, mister. Get it and you outta my bar,‚Äù says the bartender. ‚ÄúWell, sir,‚Äù says the man, ‚ÄúI can prove he talks. In fact, I‚Äôd be willing to bet that he does. Whatta ya say, if he talks, you apologize to him and give me a free beer. If he doesn‚Äôt talk, then we will leave.‚Äù The bartender thinks this over a moment and then agrees saying, ‚ÄúThis is against my better judgment, but go ahead. Make him talk.‚Äù The man turns to the dog who has been waiting patiently on the next stool and asks, ‚ÄúWhat is the opposite of smooth?‚Äù The dog says, ‚ÄúRuff!‚Äù ‚ÄúSee,‚Äù says the man, ‚ÄúHe can talk.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, he can‚Äôt,‚Äù says the bartender, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just him barking. Get outta here, both of ya.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk. Wait, wait, wait,‚Äù says the man holding up his hand, ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt the best example. Let me try again, please.‚Äù The bartender growls and looks at the dog who wags his tail. ‚ÄúOK. You get one more chance for the dog to talk.‚Äù The man turns to the dog and asks, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on top of a house?‚Äù The dog says ‚ÄúRuff!‚Äù ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù asks the man. The bartender who is getting angry says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a bark again. You ain‚Äôt foolin‚Äô no one. Get outta here before I call the cops!‚Äù The man says, ‚ÄúI can see your point. Another bad question. Let me ask one more to prove it to you.‚Äù The bartender looks at the man and then at the dog which has but its chin on the bar and stares lovingly at the bartender with its big, dark eyes. ‚ÄúOK. Last time. He better talk or me and my friends are gonna throw you out on the street!‚Äù The man turns to the dog again and asks, with an imploring look in his eyes, ‚ÄúWho is the greatest baseball player of all time?‚Äù The dog says, ‚ÄúRuff!‚Äù The bartender comes around the bar and calls over his friends who pick up the man and the dog, carry them to the door, and toss them onto the sidewalk. The man, sits against the building stunned, rubbing a new bump on his head. The dog walks over to the man, gives the bump on his head three licks and says ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou think, maybe, I should have said DiMaggio?‚Äù"},{"instruction":"I need all the percentages mentioned in the following text and what each one stands for.

Here is the source that I am using. Many cattle producers spend a large amount of money each year to control undesired plants (weeds and brush). Producers incur the primary cost by purchasing herbicides and hiring equipment and operators to clear brush and reclaim lands that have become unable to support cattle at an acceptable production level. In order for today's producers to have a chance at making an almighty dollar, every acre of ground capable of being productive must be used. Enter goats. Goats possess a unique characteristic that separates them from almost all other types of livestock. They would rather eat brush and weeds than grass because they are browsers, whereas cattle are grazers. Browse makes up approximately 60 percent of a goat's diet but only about 10 to 15 percent of a cow's. My family has a goatherd. I remember the day we first turned 200 goats out into a 30-acre \\"pasture\\" that was 25 percent impenetrable because of thick scrub oak and briars. The remaining 75 percent was overgrazed and had an alarming amount of weeds (forbs). The goats hit that wall of brush at a dead run and stripped every leaf off of every stem and branch. It amazed me. We had estimated that it would take three months for the herd to eat all of the brush, briars, and weeds. Six weeks later, those 30 acres looked like a golf course with a few sticks where the short brush used to be, and not a weed in sight. The goats had made a browse line in the taller brush, too (figure 1). It gets better. During the winter the goats wouldn't eat the hay we put out until they had cleaned up every dead leaf that had fallen off the trees. Simply amazing.","output":"Controlling undesired plants by purchasing herbicides and hiring equipment operators is an expensive endeavor for cattle producers to maintain usable land for their herds. Surprisingly, goats are highly effective at removing these undesired plants because they eat predominantly brush and weeds. In one example, a pasture owner let a herd of 200 goats loose in an overrun and unproductive field. The goats cleared away the wall of brush and stripped leaves and branches at a much quicker rate than anticipated."},{"instruction":"Does Google have a random number generator?","output":"Ablebits' Random Generator, which can be found on the Google Workspace Marketplace website, will add random sets of data to Google Sheets documents.

Use this article to answer the questions: After the departure of head coach Rick Majerus, Ball State responded under new coach Dick Hunsaker by having the best season in the school's history. This group of Cardinals became the first team in the Mid-American Conference history to win two consecutive MAC regular season conference championships as well as back-to-back conference tournament titles. The 1990 Ball State basketball team also became the first team in the MAC to reach the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament in its current format. The Cardinals lost in the Sweet 16 to the eventual national champions UNLV Runnin' Rebels, 69‚Äì67.[6] The team was led by many transfer players and two of Coach Hunsaker‚Äôs key transfers, starting forwards Paris McCurdy and Curtis Kidd, were high school teammates.[7] They both signed to play their college ball at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. However, because of disciplinary reasons, the two had to find a new school. Former coach Rick Majerus gave them a second chance, and they came through. The two became the key assets to Ball States Sweet 16 run.[8] The Cardinals finished the regular season at 26-7 before heading to the NCAA tournament. The Cardinals were a 12 seed and began the tournament at the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City. They upset the Oregon State Beavers in what was star point guard Gary Payton‚Äôs last game in college.[9] Ball State then had to play the Louisville Cardinals next. They ended up defeating Louisville late in the game by a final score of 62‚Äì60. Meanwhile, in Muncie, fans stormed the village (the center of Ball State's off campus social scene) after the win. Ball State advanced to face the top-seeded UNLV Runnin' Rebels. Ball State shut down one of the best offenses in college basketball history and had a chance to win it in the final seconds.[10] Down by two, the Cards made a deep pass to tie or take the lead but it was picked off.[11]","output":"1.

Do these techniques require going to see a specialist like a massage therapist?","output":"1. Deep Tissue Massage One of the most popular types of massage therapy, deep tissue massage uses firm pressure and slow movements to knead stress and pain out of muscles. It helps disperse scar tissue, improve blood flow, and promote a healthier immune system. 2. Swedish Massage One of the oldest types of massage therapy, Swedish massage uses a combination of steady, long strokes and friction movements in circular motions to move blood toward the heart for better circulation. 3. Hot Stone Massage Hot stone massage involves using flat stones, heated with hot water, to relieve muscle pain and relax muscle tension. The kneading motions around the stones are similar to Swedish massage. 4. Aromatherapy Massage Studies have shown significant links between human emotions and the olfactory senses, which aromatherapy massage utilizes. This type of massage uses natural essential oils to stimulate the senses and relax the mind while kneading motions relax the muscles. Some popular, relaxing scents employed in a typical aromatherapy massage session include lavender, lemon, peppermint, orange, or eucalyptus. 5. Trigger Point Massage There are pressure points all over your body that, when pressed in the right ways, can relieve pain and chronic health problems. Trigger point massage is the manipulation of your body‚Äôs pressure points to relieve specific issues, such as sinus congestion, stomach pain, and headaches. While it‚Äôs possible to find relief through massage at home, massage therapy is best practiced by specialists with knowledge of human anatomy.

Fancy is the titular character of a series of short stories called Fancy the Forest Cat. I will provide you with some details I have about Fancy already, and then I will ask you what further details I would like to come up with for her based on what I have already come up with. The details I have so far are that Fancy is an adventurous black cat who lives with her owners in a house in the countryside. Her best friend is a Schnauzer named Buddy. Fancy and Buddy have owners who love them very much and they likewise love spending time with their owners. When their owners go to work, Fancy likes to go outside and spend time in the forest. Hence she is called Fancy the Forest Cat. She and Buddy can get into mischief together, and sometimes with other animal characters. Then she returns to the house at the end of each day when her owners come back home. She lives a very fun and nice life. The Fancy the Forest Cat short stories are about Fancy's adventures in the woods. In the world of Fancy the Forest Cat the animal characters have certain anthropomorphic qualities. They can't walk upright or wear clothes or drive cars like humans do, but they can talk out loud to one another (as in the animals understand one another, but the humans don't understand the animals). When communicating with one another, the animal can speak and express their thoughts to one another as humans do. The stories are family-friendly and suitable for children. They can have adventure and excitement but ultimately are meant to be fun and uplifting. Those are all the details have so far. The details/ideas that I would like inspiration from you are three primary things 1. What are two additional qualities that I can add for Fancy, like what are additional things she likes to do, one of which can help establish a theme for the stories overall? 2. What is one idea for something she doesn't like that can cause conflict or trouble in the story when she encounters this thing? 3. Can you make a pitch for a Fancy the Forest Cat short story? A four to five sentence summary would work best here. The purpose of the first two questions is to flesh out Fancy's character a bit more, and the purpose of the third question is to create a story idea for her character based on your answers to the first two questions (your ideas to the first two questions should impact the story idea for question three). Please compose your response in a numbered format to the three questions I have above, and also make sure your ideas will be compatible with the ideas I have for Fancy already. Remember, the stories can be exciting but should have a happy conclusion.","output":"1. Fancy would love to spend time on a sunny day on the lawn of her house and spread out and relax under the sun. Then when she goes into the forest, what she loves to do most is explore and go searching for things due to her curious and adventurous nature. This theme of exploration can add an adventure element to the stories. 2. Like most cats, Fancy is also scared of a hawk that is known for living in the area. When this hawk appears while Fancy is outside, she has to go hide. This can create conflict and excitement in the story since Fancy has to evade the hawk from catching her when it appears. Of course, since it's a family-friendly story suitable for children, Fancy is always able to escape the hawk and she never gets caught. 3. At the start of the story, Fancy is outside enjoying the sun while her owners are home. When her owners go to work, Fancy goes exploring an area of the forest she hasn't visited yet out of curiosity, against Buddy's warnings since the area is unexplored by them. While she's out exploring this new area of the forest, a hawk appears and Fancy has to run and hide from the hawk. Fortunately, Buddy shows up and barks at the hawk to scare it away and rescue Fancy. Buddy and Fancy return to the house when their owners come home and they all continue living happily ever after."},{"instruction":"Give me an idea and a pitch for a reality competition show.","output":"Show: Clued In Pitch: Clued In is a new, exciting, and mysterious show where twelve contestants compete to solve a case, fabricated by a professional investigator.

Participate in Hobbies: Whether you love to cook, adore animals, or are into fitness, there's an appropriate hobby out there for you and it's an excellent way to meet new people. Check out groups in your local area online or neighborhood groups and find the courage to head along to one. There, you'll know you have things in common with the people and it'll be easy to strike up a conversation. 2. Use Apps: Some apps, like Bumble, offer a friendly setting where you can meet people on there and get chatting for a bit before meeting up. Make sure to always meet first in a public place and practice safety. 3. Volunteer: If you're passionate about a cause and have some spare time on your hands, consider volunteering for a local charity. You'll meet like-minded people that way. 4. Take Educational Classes: Educational classes are available in most places for adults, so look up one that appeals to you. You get to learn new skills while also meeting new people. 5. Use Social Media: Facebook usually has groups available for your city, and some forums are also location-specific. Becoming active on these can lead you to meet people in your city, though you should be careful and safe when meeting up, just like you would with apps too. Making friends in a new place can be daunting, but it's doable!"},{"instruction":"Write a simple story for preschool children about a zookeeper named Zane and his best friend at the zoo, a zebra named Zilly.

Talk about the health concerns of nanoparticles and that some studies suggest possible carcinogenic effects. Also mention other health related problems linked to it, and discuss the ingredients they usually have. Keep the response under 400 words.","output":"Nanoparticles ‚Äì used in cosmetics such as toothpaste, lipstick, or deodorant ‚Äì are tiny particles over a thousand times thinner than the diameter of a human hair. For example, the pigments titanium oxide and zinc oxide are used in sunscreens and stay like a film on the skin to reflect sunlight. That all sounds positive at first, but the nanoparticles in cosmetics are controversial. Their effect on humans and the environment has not yet been adequately researched, and many meaningful studies have not been conducted. How tiny nanoparticles used in cosmetic products affect our health is completely unclear. Studies by the Federal Environment Agency on nanoparticles suggest a possible carcinogenic effect of some nanomaterials. These may include carbon nanotubes or titanium dioxide, which should be taken seriously. Many cosmetic products also contain nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles in deodorants have antibacterial properties. Other types of particles in creams and lotions help the skincare products get absorbed into the skin more easily. Toothpaste with nanoparticles fills the finest cracks in the teeth. Kohl pencils and mascaras have a longer shelf life, thanks to nanoparticles. Nanoparticles don't get through the skin if it is healthy. However, they can get into the blood via the respiratory tract. At the beginning of the year, scientists from the Center for Medical Biotechnology shared initial findings on how nanoparticles could influence our stomach and intestinal flora. According to this, nanoparticles can bind to harmful and beneficial bacteria, including probiotic germs. The immune system can recognize pathogenic bacteria more poorly when covered with nanoparticles. It promotes intestinal inflammation. Certain nanoparticles weaken the infectivity of the Helicobacter pylori germ involved in the development of gastric cancer."},{"instruction":"Can you please create a short list of five different cheap items that one should stockpile now before a potential future shortage occurs? Make sure that each item has a short description for it explaining the usefulness of the item; between 1-3 sentences should be enough. The audience is people who are looking to prepare for tougher times and become more resourceful. For the five items, let's do: Superglue, Towels, Ziploc bags, Firewood, and Propane Canisters. No need to number each of the items","output":"Superglue - Beyond its intended function, superglue offers many important uses as well: it can be used to help close open shallow wounds, patch holes in ripped tents or backpacks, or stop fraying rope or cording from unraveling further. Superglue is perhaps one of the most overlooked useful items that you can stock up on. Towels - Ordinary towels will get you dry fast after a bath or shower, or they can be used to help cover broken windows or leaks in your home as well. This is an example of a common household item that might not hurt to stock more of. Ziploc Bags - Ziploc bags will prove their usefulness for storing and organizing food you've just made or leftovers you'd like to save for later. You can use them for storing and organizing other small items as well. Furthermore, Ziploc bags are very cheap in bulk and can be found at most grocery and convenience stores. Firewood - You can sometimes find packs of firewood to buy for cheap at gas stations and convenience stores. It's a more convenient option for collecting firewood than going out to collect your own (in areas where you can legally do so). Propane Canisters - Do you have any items that are powered by propane, such as lamps, heaters, or outdoor cooking stoves? If so, you'll want to make sure you have plenty of propane canisters stockpiled before times get tough.

This should be heavy on adjectives and make the reader feel like they have had an experience at this location.","output":"The Grape Vine has been somewhat of a well-kept secret in Buena Park. It is away from the more congested routes of travel, and its unpretentious, unimposing structure means that it is often missed as foodies flock to the more trendy and glitzy locations closer to the beach. Don't let that stop you from enjoying an authentic Medditarriean dining experience. You can still feel the salty breeze from the ocean air as you sit on the covered patio draped with well-established grape vines to shade the intimate atmosphere. The staff is knowledgeable about which wines to pair with your meals and appetizers. True to the European dining experience, you never feel rushed through your meal to make room for other patrons. It is the perfect way to spend a leisurely afternoon. The grape leaves were bright and tangy, with a fresh lemon flavor that is unparalleled. The same goes for the tazkiki and hummus. There was an abundance of fresh, vibrant herbs that enhanced each dish and tasted as if they had been harvested moments before hitting the plates. Meat eaters will appreciate the tender classics like gyros and kabobs, prepared with grass-fed beef. While vegetarians can't find falafels with sprouted chickpeas and organic parsley anywhere else in this region. Walking into The Grape Vine is like walking into another time and place where you are family, and you are well fed as if attending a feast or celebration. The portions are generous, and the prices are modest. You will leave abundantly satisfied, hoping that the location doesn't become spoiled by tourists or the bar crowds that occupy the Beach Blvd. scene. This gem of a restaurant shines bright among all of the commercial dining options as a true 'Mom and Pop' location. The bread is scratch-made, and nothing is ever prepared from frozen products.

William Congreve (1670-1729) was an English playwright, and one of the most sophisticated exponent of the comedy of manners during the Restoration era. Congreve wrote five plays before he was 30. His first, The Old Bachelor, was an enormous success at Drury Lane in 1693, in a production starring Thomas Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle. According to Congreve he wrote the play to amuse himself during a convalescence. The Double Dealer (1694) was not so well received but in 1695 he produced another hit, Love for Love (again with Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle), to open the new Lincoln's Inns Fields Theatre. Its success secured his reputation and earned him a share in the theatre. His promise to write at least one play a year for the theatre of which he was now a part owner, was unfortunately not fulfilled. Congreve's only tragedy, The Mourning Bride (1697), was his most popular work during his lifetime but is now rarely seen. It starred Mrs Bracegirdle as Almeria, a part that became much coveted by tragic actresses. In 1700 The Way of the World, - a highly sophisticated and complex work now considered his masterpiece - met with a cool reception. This failure, together with his continued discomfort at having been attacked in Jeremy Collier's influential pamphlet A Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage (1698), persuaded him to retire. (Congreve had replied to Collier with little effect in Amendments of Mr Collier's False and Imperfect Citations.) Voltaire later visited him and accused him of wasting his genius. Congreve told him he wished to be visited as a gentleman, not as an author. To this Voltaire replied that if Mr Congreve were only a gentleman, he would not have bothered to call upon him. Congreve was by all accounts a warm man who won the love and respect of his many friends. John Dryden called him the equal of Shakespeare, Alexander Pope dedicated his translation of the Iliad to him in 1715, and John Gay called him an \\"unreproachful man.\\" When he died he left nearly all of his ¬£10,000 estate to his mistress, Henrietta, the second Duchess of Marlborough, who arranged for his burial in Westminster Abbey.","output":"English playwright, William Congreve (1670-1729), was the most sophisticated writer of the comedy of manners.

I realized all my wealth was for naught, An endless void in which I was caught, The glitter and glamour, just a fleeting joy, In my own heart, I was still a little boy.

She was so very glad they were here with her, helping her pave the way toward her throne. Though one had been born into wealth and privilege and the other born into a second-class, pigeonholed status where people with her skin color rarely raised themselves out of struggling mightily every day to meet their basic needs, something bigger brought them to equal footing. It was grief. Loss. A year ago, after a battle with a slow but incurable illness, Naveen's mother lost the man she'd been married to for nearly 40 years. There seemed to be a quiet understanding between the two women, sisters in heartache. Not that is was so dark as all that. Upon learning of his father's illness, Tiana and Naveen did something she'd never imagined. They'd sold the restaurant, packed up their New Orleans home, and asked the nanny that looked after their two daughters to accompany them across the sea. The girls, Lottie and Elodie, were doing fine. They'd barely understood that they were princesses, and all this was a grand adventure. Tiana felt a pinch in her stomach anytime she looked at Lottie. Her oldest, her girl that now would grow to one day be queen. It was better than being barred from half of life in the bayou, but it was far from a normal life. \\"You're worrying, darling,\\" her mother said, pulling Tiana from her misgivings. \\"This is Naveen's birthright dear, and I have a surprise for you,\\" the queen said. \\"Follow me.\\" Tiana followed the queen mother down the winding, tapestried stone walls of the castle. She'd never get used to how sprawling the palace was, how many rooms there were. This walk wasn't comforting her. That was until the queen mother pulled open a door and said, \\"Oh, I hope you like it!\\" \\"Oh,\\" Tiana said at first, words beyond her. There before her was a fully equipped, top-of-the-line kitchen. Every tool she could imagine and some she'd never laid eyes on before gleamed under the bright lights. Rolling pins stood sentinel beside marble slabs meant to evenly cool chocolate.

I'm open to both indoor and outdoor hobbies, but I do want a mix of both - I live in a cold place and will need a hobby during the winter, too!","output":"No problem, here are a few great hobby ideas for you to try that are both affordable and easy to start. 1. Blogging - While there are a lot of people who blog professionally as their main source of income, there are also some who blog just for fun. You can start a blog on any topic you are interested in. You can make it humorous, or write about a serious topic you are passionate about. You are not pressured to follow a particular schedule or format and you may end up connecting with others who share you same interests through your blog. 2. Reading - Grabbing a book and reading for hours may already be a favorite pastime for many people, but if you haven't picked up a book in a while and you are looking for a good way to pass the time, reading is an excellent option. Studies show that just a few minutes of reading something you enjoy can lower your stress levels by as much as 60 percent. 3. Learning a new language - There are a few hobbies out there that can be as useful in today's world as learning a new language. And if you are good enough at it, you could even find ways to use your new skill in your professional life as well. Or you could simply enjoy being able to communicate with locals on your next vacation. 4. Journaling - While keeping a diary or journal may seem like something you would only do in your younger years, journaling has been known to be extremely therapeutic and helpful. Trends such as hand lettering or bullet journaling have made keeping a journal these days a fun and functional work of art and there are many tutorials out there that can show you ways to journal more effectively. 5. Staying Informed on Current Events - Yes, staying up to date on current news and world happenings can be a hobby. If you would like to stay in the know but do not want to get bogged down by negativity, you can choose to have free daily briefs sent to your email or smartphone device. These quick and shortened blurbs of information will provide you with your daily news stories without all the unnecessary drama. 6. Gardening - Few hobbies are as rewarding as gardening. You get to spend time outdoors in the fresh air, care for and nurture your plants and watch them grow into thriving flowers or fruits and vegetables for you to enjoy. All it takes to get started are a few seeds soil, fertilizers, and a few basic gardening tools. If you are new to gardening, growing a few herbs or flowers in a pot is a great way to start. 7. Hiking - Hiking is another great hobby that costs nothing and will benefit you in more ways than one. If you love nature and being outdoors, you will love going out and exploring hiking trails at your local park or other fun destinations. Hiking can help you mentally by reducing stress while helping you physically at the same time. You can find simple, low-impact hiking trails for beginners or expert trails with inclines and rugged terrain if you are up to the challenge. 8. Camping - Another excellent hobby for anyone who loves the great outdoors is camping. You don't have to go to extremes and spend a lot of money to enjoy camping. You can go with the basic supplies and have just as much, if not more, fun than those who go camping in large exquisite tents or RVs."},{"instruction":"Can you please write a short story about Batman and the Joker?

He had supposedly rigged the building with his signature laughing gas. They'd gotten as many civilians out as possible, but there were still far too many at risk. Batman looked down at the building, planning his attack. The Joker would be on one of the top floors so that he could escape via the roof if needed. But Batman didn't plan to give him the chance.

It flew around the building, capturing infrared imaging of each floor. \\"There, the top floor. It has to be him.\\" On the screen, Batman saw four bodies, three of which were sat on their knees as if they were bound with rope or wire.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure: Develop an extensive network of electric vehicle charging stations throughout the city, making it convenient for residents to charge their electric cars. This will encourage the adoption of electric vehicles by addressing range anxiety. Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure: Improve and expand pedestrian infrastructure such as wider sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian bridges. This encourages walking as a viable mode of transportation and promotes physical activity. Public transportation Enhancement: Invest in improving and expanding public transportation options including busses, trams, and trains. This would include frequency of service and improved connectivity. Education and Awareness Campaigns: Launch educational campaigns to raise awareness of the benefits of sustainable transportation and provide resources on how to make the switch. Employer Initiatives: Collaborate with local businesses and organizations to implement workplace initiatives that encourage sustainable commuting, such as offering flexible work hours, telecommuting options, or providing incentives for employees who use public transportation or carpool.

It provides pinpoint accurate information about molecular distributions in biological structures, and analysis with this technique can even provide the absolute number of proteins present in biological systems. It is a powerful high-resolution imagining technique that has been shown to have the potential to be an extremely useful complementary method for experiments, utilizing conventional light and electron microscopy. This technique provides direct experimental feedback for modeling the complexity of biological interactions. Localization microscopy works on the principle that the diffraction barrier (the resolution limit of light waves) can be bypassed by photoswitching, photoactivation, or photoconversion of individual fluorophores, which are attached to the structure of interest.","output":"Localization microscopy is a new technique that helps us understand how cells work at a microscopic level.

Ki is also known as Chinese \\"chi,\\" Hawaiian \\"akua.\\" God, or spiritual essence. Ki is a principal concept in certain schools of Aikido. It is the life force that flows through every living thing, and it comes from the universe in which we live. Imagine electricity coming out of a generator. Turning on the generator starts the engine, which, in turn, creates the electricity needed to power electrical items or appliances. Like the generator, humans act as generators for Ki, but the only way to properly allow the human body to conduct the universal electricity is to follow a set of principles that will prime the body to receive Ki. These principles are designed to unify the mind and body so they become one. Here are the principles to ensure the mind and body are connected, and Ki can flow through you: 1. Keep One Point 2. Relax completely 3. Keep weight underside 4. Extend Ki The second and third principles are of the body, while the first and fourth principles are of the mind. Keeping One Point is done by putting your mind (your concentration) on a point two inches below your navel, where the body's center of gravity resides. Relaxing completely entails relaxing the entire body until there is no tension within, but not falling into \\"dead\\" relaxation - it should be a feeling of calm readiness. Keeping weight underside means that when you relax your body, the weight of your body naturally goes underside; when you stand, your weight goes downward toward your legs so that you are rooted firmly and calmly to the ground. Extending Ki entails imagining that water is springing forth from your One Point through your body like a powerful water hose, and the water shooting out from your entire body toward infinity. These concepts can help in daily life by grounding you and making you more receptive to the energy of the universe."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this poem into a short story of at least 3 paragraphs.

She ran through the woods, up the hillside and down into the valley. Then she stopped. The deer was so happy to finally be free again and able to move. She had been in the rescue center for so long while her leg healed from the trap she had fallen into. Now she could explore her new habitat and that's just what she was intent on doing. Eventually, the deer slowed down again and after a while, she found herself in a beautiful place. There were trees, and there was a lake where she stopped for a refreshing drink.

Can you explain this ‚Äú720 rule‚Äù I keep hearing about?","output":"The 720 rule for anodization is most often used as a quick way to estimate the time it will take to create an anodized layer of the thickness you want. It‚Äôs an algebra formula, so you can also rearrange it to tell you how thick your layer will be after a specified time. To use this formula you need to know two of the three variables listed here: - Desired anodization layer thickness - Current density - Anodization time The current density can itself be determined by dividing the anodization machine‚Äôs current output by your part‚Äôs surface area. It should come out in units of Amps per square foot. The desired thickness of the anodized layer is measured in mils (one mil is equal to 1/1000 inch or 0.001 inches) Most users employ the 720 rule to decide how long to leave their part in the anodization bath. If that‚Äôs your goal, the equation will look like: - Time (minutes) = 720 * desired thickness (mils) / current density (A/sq ft) The 720 value in this equation is a known constant, so it‚Äôs the same each time you use the equation. There are limitations to this equation. It only applies to parts made of aluminum (and a few exotic aluminum alloys have enough other elements that the rule doesn‚Äôt work). It also assumes that your anodization setup is a so-called constant-current style. A constant-current device must ramp up the voltage as the anodization layer gets thicker so that the electrical current that reaches the underlying surface remains constant. Constant-current devices are the most common in the industry. If those qualifications are met, the 720 rule should give you good estimations of how much time parts need to spend in the anodization bath."},{"instruction":"You are a wizard who has been invited to a magical tournament that tests your skills and knowledge.

The causes of conduct disorder. There has been much research on the role of both genetics and environment in conduct disorder. In a 2018 article published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, the authors review research on gene-environment interactions. They conclude that there are a number of genes that have been linked to conduct disorder, but the effects of these genes aren't always clear.

Organization comes in many forms, but you'll be sure to find the following items invaluable: * Command hooks: They are removable and can be relocated to a position that works best in the cab; they're useful for hanging caps, belts, and towels to dry. * Over-the-door shoe storage: The pockets are perfect for toiletries, spare water bottles or soda cans, and all types of snack storage. * Plastic storage containers: These take the place of your house bedroom's dresser drawers. You can also get appropriately sized containers for extra supplies, such as paper and pens. * Shower caddies: Not only can these be used for grabbing quickly to take to the showers, but they can hold your eating utensils, spices, and a variety of kitchen items. * Spring-tension curtain or shower curtain rods: There is usually some unused vertical space in a semi, so these can create extra space for hanging clothes and jackets, or you can even use them to hang a curtain to hide what's being stored on an unused upper bunk. * Back-of-the-seat organizers: You really can't go wrong with extra pockets everywhere! * Sticker labels: Be sure to label everything so that you're not constantly searching for what you need. Be sure that you're taking a piece of home with you on the road. A cell phone and a laptop are musts. Use comfortable bedding, and even invest in a good mattress to ensure you stay well-rested.

How could i be more mindful and would it be helpful?","output":"Being mindful is to be fully engaged and present in the moment. This can be very hard for some but there are quite a few things you can do to gradually improve. Living in the moment is an expression commonly used, but people often brush off the real meaning. Living in the moment is to enjoy the things you are doing, to actively know what you are doing, and to take it all in. You may find yourself spacing out sometimes, but try your best to focus on the things around you. The best exercise to practice mindfulness is meditation. Meditation is not only sitting down with your legs crossed as often thought, but meditation is the practice of focus. Calming yourself, and controlling your thoughts and breathing, allows you to become more aware. You can also do this while walking. This will help you to become more focused on the things you are doing. Overall, being mindful does not just happen. You have to actively do things in order to feel the effects.

It doesn‚Äôt make financial sense to buy them all uniforms for a short term pop-up, but I do want a cohesive look for the staff so that customers know who to ask For help. The restaurant is neither formal nor super casual, and I need a uniform that works for the full gender spectrum.","output":"I can help with that! Here are some basic dress code ideas that could work to give your employees a cohesive look: -Basic black: Wear black from head to toe. -Black and white: Wear black pants or shorts with a white top. -Canadian tuxedo: Though people sometimes mock this as a civilian fashion choice, pairing a denim top with blue jeans can be a stylish look. -Primary colors: Pair blue jeans with red, yellow, or blue tee shirts. -Head-to-toe color: Maybe your restaurant‚Äôs interior prominently features a color that isn‚Äôt black, white, or primary, like teal or orange. You can have your employees wear a top in this color or dress in it from head to toe. -Business casual: Your employees could all wear polo shirts and khaki bottoms for a unified but diverse look. -Standardized pattern: Your employees could all wear plaid flannel tops, gingham prints, tie-dye, stripes, polka dots, paisley, or floral patterns. They could also wear more whimsical patterns if they‚Äôre on brand for your restaurant, such as Hawaiian shirts for tropical island cuisine or ugly holiday sweaters for an eatery serving comfort food in the last months of the year. -Signature aprons: It may not be sensible to purchase full uniforms for your staff, but custom aprons could make a less expensive and more practical alternative. They would not need to be tailored to each employee‚Äôs individual size, so the staff members could share from a collective pool of clean aprons in much the same way they‚Äôd share resources like napkins and trays. You'd just need to pay to have the aprons laundered in bulk every few days. -Standardized accessory: You could allow employees to wear whatever they‚Äôre most comfortable in, but have everyone wear the same accessory to make them easy for patrons to pick out of a crowd. This accessory could be a colorful hat, scarf, or necktie, among other options, but for visibility to customers, it‚Äôs a good idea to choose something worn above waist level. -Theme costume: If your restaurant‚Äôs menu lends itself to a specific theme‚Äîfor example, a prohibition-era speakeasy, a Mexican cantina, or a 1950s-style diner‚Äîyou could ask your staff to dress in relevant costumes of their own choosing. Bear in mind that this does place a burden of responsibility on staff that could be quite costly; on the other hand, your employees might really enjoy putting their own costumes together and view it as a perk of the job."},{"instruction":"Write a short story about an old man named Fred, he is very grumpy.

Put your hand on the horse's leg, and run your hand down until you reach the tendon above the ankle. When the horse feels this, it will shift its weight to the other three legs. Once you have the foot raised, try resting it between your knees, with the sole facing up toward you. - Remove the existing shoe - Use a clinch cutter to straighten the nails holding the old shoe on, then use a pair of metal pull-offs to remove the shoe from the hoof. This can also be done with a flat screwdriver. Wiggle the tool in a rocking motion until it is loose enough to pull off by hand. - Clean the hoof - Make sure to clean away any dirt and debris to prevent it from being trapped between the hoof and the new shoe. Use a hoof pick to remove dirt or manure, using downward strokes from heel to toe. Follow up with a wire brush to remove any remaining debris. Be careful of the fleshy area here because it is very sensitive. - Remove the excess hoof - Use a hoof knife to remove the excess flaky part of the bottom of the hoof. The outer layer will be hard and dark, and once cut, the hoof underneath will be softer and whiter, similar to a human's toenail. Make sure not to cut too deep, and not to cut yourself. - Trim excess hoof wall - The hoof wall is the edge of the hoof. It should only extend about 3 inches from the hairline of the hoof. If it is longer than this, trim it back and make sure to cut it straight and level so it will sit flush with the ground when standing. - Use a rasp for leveling - This is the last step before applying a new shoe. Use a rasp and gently file any uneven areas so that the hoof is smooth and level. Use a knife to cut away a slight bevel away from the hoof wall to prevent the sole of the shoe from coming in contact with the soft part of the foot."},{"instruction":"Turn this paragraph into a bulleted list of questions with answers.

The man, Stanlee Fazi, 41, of Louisa, Va., pleaded guilty in federal court to trafficking turtles from July 2017 to June 2020. During that time, he collected Eastern box turtles ‚Äî which have bright yellow or orange markings on their cocoa-colored shells ‚Äî and shipped them to buyers in the United States. Many of the animals were then sold to people in Hong Kong and China, where the illegal pet turtle trade is booming, prosecutors said. Turtle populations there are in decline because of their use in the pet trade, in Asian folk medicines and as food. Mr. Fazi admitted that he had bound the turtles in socks and shipped them via FedEx from Fredericksburg, Va., making about 12,700 in the scheme, the Justice Department said in a news release. He will be sentenced in July and faces up to five years in prison and a 250,000 fine. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Mr. Fazi‚Äôs lawyer, Edward J.

Conservationists have described the phenomenon as the ‚ÄúAsian turtle crisis.‚Äù But the shipments of Eastern box turtles to Asia have contributed to the species‚Äô decline in the United States. The Eastern box turtles are also an invasive species in Asia and may spread disease there. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigation found that at least 1,500 native turtles ‚Äî including wood turtles, spotted turtles and Eastern box turtles ‚Äî were illegally smuggled to Asia between June 2017 and December 2018. The illegal pet trade in the United States has led some to believe that the underground market is an easy way to make money, said Crawford Allan of the World Wildlife Fund, an expert on international wildlife trafficking and trade. The premise, he said, seems simple: You find turtles outside, collect them and sell them online.

Message me and let me know what you have.‚Äù Such open queries are typical in the illegal turtle trade, Mr. Allan said, because people ‚Äúcan avoid detection‚Äù easily.

As you become more comfortable with this style of breathing, you can try closing your mouth and inhaling and exhaling through your nose. - Sama Vritti Pranayama, or box breathing, involves inhaling for a count of 4, holding for 4, exhaling for 4, and again holding for 4. This cycle can be repeated for a few minutes. It should help you feel calm and relaxed. - Dirgha pranayama, commonly referred to as three-part breath, involves quickly stopping your inhalations and exhalations with short pauses.

Here is the article I am referencing: Warren Buffett, chairman, and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, praised the government's intervention in recent bank failures, saying on Saturday it averted what could have become an even bigger crisis. Yet he said the U.S. banking system had become overly complicated ‚Äî and that he was not surprised that the banks had failed. He said he'd been selling bank stocks, first at the start of the pandemic and more recently over the past six months as banks increasingly face mismanagement and respond to bad incentives. \\"The American public doesn‚Äôt understand their banking system ‚Äî and some people in Congress don‚Äôt understand it anymore than I understand it,\\" Buffett said. Speaking during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, about the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Buffett said he thought the government did the right thing in stepping in to guarantee bank deposits above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantee of 250,000. ‚ÄúIt would have been catastrophic,‚Äù Buffett said of a situation in which the government didn‚Äôt act. He added that refusing to guarantee all SVB deposits risked a ‚Äúrun on every bank in the country‚Äù and, by extension, a threat to the global financial system. Berkshire Hathaway, the Omaha-based conglomerate that owns and invests in companies ranging from Dairy Queen to Geico, has substantial investments in the largest banks in the country. As of the end of 2022, Buffett‚Äôs investments included a 13% stake in Bank of America, 3.2% stake in Bank of New York Mellon, 2.8% stake in Citigroup and 0.5% stake in U.S. Bancorp. The banking industry has been rattled by higher interest rates, which squeezed banks unprepared for the sharp drop in the value of its interest rate-sensitive assets. Buffett said he was worried about how easy bank runs had become. \\"If people think deposits aren‚Äôt sticky anymore, you‚Äôre living in a different era,\\" he said, adding technology has made it so that \\"you could have a run in a few seconds.\\" A new poll from Gallup found that nearly half of Americans say they are now worried about the safety of their deposits, the highest share since the global financial crisis of 2008. Yet even as he worried about the ease with which additional bank runs could occur ‚Äî and recounted how his father lost his job in 1931 as the result of a bank run ‚Äî Buffett said the U.S. government actions should have demonstrated that concerns about deposit safety were unfounded. ‚ÄúHere we are in 2023, and we actually see the FDIC pay off 100 cents on the dollar to everybody, or making it available to all demand deposits,‚Äù Buffett said. The banking crisis episode has led to heightened scrutiny on the commercial real estate sector, where telework arrangements and soaring borrowing costs are raising concerns about banks that lend to the sector. ‚ÄúThe hollowing out of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant,‚Äù said Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who added that Berkshire itself is not actively exposed to commercial real estate.","output":"1.

On the island was a group of citizens who were once members of large cities and countries, but came here to practice solitude from the increasing craziness of the outside world. Here, on this little island, the population of 100 souls could live out their lives in relative peace. Self-sufficiency is always the main concern in a closed-off society. Considering this society was also an island that was both physically and intentionally cut off from civilization, the people of this community needed to become (if they were not already) proficient in live-savings skills: first-aid, food hunting and gathering, and making shelters and clothing. The members of the island came here as a group almost 30 years ago with just the proverbial shirts on their backs, but those items of clothing were long gone to the elements. Now, they wore a mixture of leaf-based and animal hide tunics and trousers, and footwear made from the rubber of nearby trees. An article published in Time Magazine caused a lot of controversy in the town; specifically, outsiders began flocking to the remote island to become members of this small society. As for the community members, they saw nothing but trouble and hassle and began feeling society's grasp wrapping around them again. They escaped the problems of the outside world, but the outside world decided to follow them to the remotest parts of it. In retaliation, the community members began closing up their businesses, removing signage and retreating into their hand-built shelters. They would not welcome these newcomers, opting instead for an icy reception. The unofficial mayor of the community, Sal Hardwick, greeted visitors with the following phrase designed to make them rethink their choice: \\"Leave now. No one will come to your aid, and nothing here belongs to you.\\" While some individuals heeded the warning, others were made to understand via the village bouncers physically removing them by force, usually into the ocean, where some remain to this day for lack of swimming skills."},{"instruction":"I would like to try making homemade cat food.

Here are some arts and crafts you can do with leftover tubes from your paper products: - Stylish gauntlets.

Decorate a small cardboard box like a castle, and use the tubes to make its towers. - Quiet windchimes. Decorate a few tubes, tie them onto pieces of string of slightly varying lengths, and then tie the other ends of the string together in a single knot. Hang it on your patio and watch it flutter in the wind. - Bat wings. For some Halloween decor, unroll two tubes at their seam into diamond shapes, and paint them both black. Then, attach them at the sharpest corners, and attach a line of black pompoms to the middle. Hang these from a bare tree for a spooky look.

The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May 28 without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups.[44] Following the conquest of the Low Countries, Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on April 9, 1940. Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine. Norway held on for a few crucial weeks, but Denmark surrendered after only four days.[45][46] Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war, with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of both Germany and the Western Allies.[47]","output":"9, 10, 28, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 88, 600, 1939, 1940"},{"instruction":"Write an acrostic poem using the word \\"seashells.\\" Keep it related to shells and beach-themed.","output":"Sun-baked totems of the ocean Each one is unique and beautiful Adorning sandy shores, a delightful treasure Sandy secret-keepers Homes for under-sea creatures, providing protection and comfort Even the broken ones are special Left behind by the tides Lovely colors and endless patterns Special keepsakes that store memories"},{"instruction":"What are some fun games to play at a bachelor party that don't involve drinking?","output":"Try out these ideas! 1.

The 172 has come in a few different variants over the years, but all told, well over 44,000 of them have been sold. There are a few appealing characteristics that have made the Skyhawk popular. One of the biggest factors is its simplicity. Compared to many aircraft, the Cessna 172 is simple to fly and maintain. It is regularly used by pilot training schools specifically for that reason. Compared to many of its competitors, the Cessna's high wing can be advantageous. Most competing aircraft like the Piper Cherokee have low-mounted wings which limit visibility below the cockpit and make the cabin harder to get into and out of. The Skyhawk's high wing limits upward visibility but makes it easier for pilots to see the ground and runway. Until recent years, the 172 was also among the most affordable planes to buy. Unfortunately for Cessna, a downturn in demand has meant fewer Skyhawks are coming off the line now and their per-airframe price is rising accordingly. However, they‚Äôre still relatively affordable to keep and maintain."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a raccoon getting stuck in someone's house. Make it funny.

Write an email to Kentucky Fried Chicken requesting in a logical fashion that they switch to selling a different meat.","output":"To whom it may concern: I am writing in protest of decades of your company's sole focus on one protein group: chicken. When Colonel Sanders started your company, he clearly had a bias against fowl. What else could explain his decision to single out chicken protein while overlooking valuable other meats like beef and pork from his restaurant's menu? Seafood is also an excellent protein source. Some consider snails a delicacy! The truth of the matter is that the public perception of chickens has been changing in recent years. You can now find beautiful specimens of my species adorning dishtowels, metal signs, and wall decor. Some clearly enlightened people adopt chickens as part of their families, even dressing them in trendy outfits and accessories. Elaborate coop designs are available online for owners who want to keep their highly-esteemed chickens living a life of luxury. When making decisions about which species to feature on your menu, KFC is not taking into account the generous contributions cows make to the proper fertilization of the soil. Protecting the environment is a top-of-mind issue for many consumers, and just imagine the goodwill it could garner from your company switching to farming cows! And let's take a look at pork. Pigs will eat almost any kind of food waste you provide. They aren't particular. You could give them the prior day's leftover mashed potatoes and coleslaw and they'd be, well, as happy as pigs! Pork lends itself to some tasty menu variations, like pickled pigs' feet and pig snouts. In fact, doesn't \\"Kentucky Fried Pig Snouts\\" have a ring to it? Plus, there's an added benefit to switching to pig protein: dogs love to eat pigs' ears, and that would offer you an avenue into a completely new market. Other proteins have positive selling points, too. Fish can be farmed in ponds capable of containing many fish in a relatively small footprint of real estate. Dig the pond as deep as you'd like. And think about how little space it would take to raise snails! In closing, I believe Kentucky Fried Chicken needs to revisit its antiquated business practice of selling chicken. There are other wonderful protein substitutes available that are more earth-friendly, offer added revenue streams, and offer a more efficient use of space.

While these specializations were advantageous during the Ice Age, they are thought to have caused Neanderthals to be unfit for the warming environment that they began to face about 45,000 years ago. Homo Sapiens, on the other hand, had much more adaptability to these changes and were fierce competition for vital resources at the time. This is considered to be the main theory behind Neanderthal extinction. However, scientists have offered more ideas on the subject. Our understanding of the topic may change as scientists continue to study human evolution and discover more information."},{"instruction":"When did George Washington die?","output":"George Washington, the First President of the United States, died due to a throat infection on December 14, 1799."},{"instruction":"Tell me three fun date ideas that are low-budget for a young married couple.

While I enjoy those places, other people do as well, and that means it gets so crowded, and I don't like crowds. So, I'd appreciate it if you could help me brainstorm places that are similar to popular destinations while being a little more off the beaten path. Since this is a family vacation with two 10 year olds, make sure you pick places that have plenty for everyone to do, and list some of those things for each place. My kids love exploring outdoor places.","output":"That sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Here are some places that I think you will like as well as what popular places they are similar to: - Fruita, Colorado - This site is very similar to Moab, one of the most popular places to visit in the US, and is actually less than two hours away from that site. As such, it has many of the same attractions, including mountain biking, water rafting, camping, hiking, rock climbing, and more. - Downieville, California - This site is comparable to Lake Tahoe, another place in the US that is very popular. It is a former mining town that nearly went extinct before switching to being an outdoor recreation site. It has mountain biking trails complete with bike shuttles for your convenience and perfect for snowboarding in the winter, and the two rivers that connect nearby give plenty of opportunities for swimming, white water rafting, and paddling. - Tucson, Arizona - This site is similar to the crowded Sedona mountains and has over a thousand trails for hiking, mountain biking, and climbing. The nearby town also has plenty of restaurants, shops, and museums. - Naples, Florida - Key West is a very popular place to visit in Florida for those who want to have a marine adventure, but you can do some of the same things in Naples. This includes plenty of beaches, paddling opportunities, dolphins, manatee sightings, lagoons to explore, and more. - Sheridan, Wyoming - This site is less than four hours away from the well-known Yellowstone National Park. Though the park here doesn't look identical to Yellowstone, it is pretty close and far less crowded. I hope that you find one of these that interests you!"},{"instruction":"Write a short romantic story about a girl named Olivia Miller who trips over her shoelace while walking and falls into the arms of her future husband, Josh Hammond.

Poppy seeds don‚Äôt have nearly enough opiates to intoxicate you. But because drug tests are exquisitely sensitive, consuming certain poppy seed food products can lead to positive urine drug test results for opiates ‚Äì specifically for morphine, codeine or both. Under most circumstances, opiate concentrations in the urine are too low to produce a positive test result. But certain food products ‚Äì and it‚Äôs generally impossible to know which ones, because opiate content does not appear on food labels ‚Äì contain enough opiates to produce positive test results. Moreover, because of overlap in opiate concentrations and morphine-to-codeine ratios, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish test results that are due to the consumption of poppy seeds from those that are due to the use of opiate drugs. This is not a problem with most workplace drug testing. Test results are reviewed by a specially trained physician called a medical review officer. Unless the physician finds evidence of unauthorized opiate use, such as needle marks or signs of opiate intoxication or withdrawal, even relatively high concentrations of opiates in the urine that produce positive test results are generally ruled to be negative. It turns out, though, that drug testing in the military is different, and poppy seeds pose potential problems. One such problem, as highlighted in recent news reports, concerns service members who test positive for codeine and assert a ‚Äúpoppy seed defense.‚Äù They are still regarded as having taken codeine, sometimes with serious consequences, such as a disciplinary action or discharge from the service.","output":"Drug tests are extremely sensitive and consuming certain poppy seed foods can actually lead to positive urine drug tests. Other foods can set off a drug test, but it's nearly impossible to tell which ones will. During most workplace drug tests, a trained physician will list the results as negative unless they see other evidence of opiate use such as needle marks, intoxication, or very high concentrations of opiates in the system. The military on the other hand may take serious disciplinary action if they find any opioids in a drug test, even if the culprit is only poppy seed foods. To answer the question, Yes, poppy seeds can set off a drug test, but it generally does not result in a positive test unless they are being ultra strict."},{"instruction":"I need an ahk script that accepts a user inputted integer, multiplies it by 42, subtracts 8, and checks if the result is even.

Ability to pay on credit. Sometimes you don't have enough money to pay for something, but you really need it. A credit card lets you purchase a product as soon as you want and then pay off the balance over time. Certain situations can be highly beneficial, such as expensive emergencies or wanting to spread the costs of a large purchase over time. 2. Most accepted payment method. Retailers almost universally accept credit cards. This means you can carry one card around instead of constantly withdrawing cash. Visa and Mastercard are the largest payment processors for credit cards, and you will find that they are accepted almost everywhere in the world. This is an excellent benefit if you travel a lot and don't want to keep track of currencies. 3. Interest-free cash withdrawals. Some credit cards allow users to withdraw large amounts of cash without paying interest for up to 45 days. This can be extremely useful in emergencies. 4. Reward points. Credit cards often give users reward points for using their cards. This means you get extra value on your purchases simply by using a credit card. Certain credit cards offer specific rewards for specific spending categories giving users a bonus for spending money, for example, on travel. These rewards are often limitless, which gives customers an excellent opportunity to get maximum value from the card. 5. Insurance. Credit cards offer significant security measures such as insurance. Having personal accident coverage and travel insurance just for having a credit card is a massive benefit that entices credit card users. As well as this, credit cards also offer a sense of security as users are often able to get refunds on transactions that they did not receive a product or in instances where the product was not as described. 6. Make travel easy. Some credit cards give you great travel benefits. As well as not worrying about organizing local currency, some credit cards offer discounts on flights, dining out, and hotels. Credit cards sometimes offer reward bonuses for money spent on travel. Sometimes, your credit card can give you priority access to airport lounges and other areas. 7. Discount and cashback. Similar to rewards, credit cards offer users exceptional discounts for spending at preferred stores and sometimes offer money back as cashback. Money for free is a great benefit of using a credit card. 8. Improve your credit score. If you want to buy a house or secure a loan, you must have a strong credit history and rating. A credit card improves your credit score by showing you can be trusted to repay your borrowed money. Along with smaller bills like phone and tv subscriptions, this is the best way to build a credit history. 9. Safety. Not having to carry cash around can make you feel a lot safer. A credit card allows you to carry just one card and have far more money than cash. 10. Keep track of expenses. If you regularly use cash to pay for things, tracking your expenses can be difficult without much effort. Using a credit card will mean receiving monthly statements outlining every transaction. This makes it much easier to see where your money is spent and make informed decisions regarding your spending."},{"instruction":"I need you to help me write a hard letter to my dad, asking him for a 600 loan until I pay him back next Friday, to help with tuition and food.

Give me five ideas for what the kids and I can do on this dreary day.","output":"Ok, here are some fun ideas to try for a rainy day: - Board or card games. Just about every household has a small stack of board games, or a deck of cards around. These games can be a fun and mentally stimulating way to pass the time, and a good deal of these games can be played with many age groups. Sorry, Monopoly, and Chutes and Ladders are classics, while UNO and Yahtzee provide a little something different. Don‚Äôt forget about tabletop role-playing games for older family members! - Arts and crafts. There are lots of things that can be made with regular household objects. Get some paper, school glue, and some scissors and make collages. Or get some pipe cleaners and make stick figures. Find some googly eyes and glue them to a clothespin. Use your imagination; you are bound to find some old items that can be repurposed for a fun piece of art. - Build a blanket and pillow fort. This is great for the little ones - they seem to love places to play hide and seek and you can get creative with bed pillows, couch throw pillows, blankets, sheets, and whatever else you can find. You can make this into a fun way to watch a movie or binge some family TV shows. - Have a talent show. Sing a song, make up a silly dance, or tell some dad jokes. Take turns and see who can come up with the craziest character or most original dance. Add some music and turn it into a fun karaoke party! - Make some tasty treats. Nothing beats rainy fun than eating some treats that you made for yourself. Cookies and brownies are easy staples that the kids can help with, while older folk may experiment with more decadent treats like chocolate mousse or a no-bake cheesecake. There‚Äôs a little something for everyone here, and you can be as healthy or indulgent as you like."},{"instruction":"Extract and list the top five ranked countries in order from the following table: Medal table Rank Nation Gold Silver Bronze Total 1 East Germany (GDR) 11 7 9 27 2 United States (USA) 6 8 8 22 3 Soviet Union (URS) 4 4 10 18 4 Poland (POL) 3 2 0 5 5 Finland (FIN) 2 2 0 4 6 Cuba (CUB) 2 1 0 3 7 West Germany (FRG) 1 4 4 9 8 Bulgaria (BUL) 1 2 1 4 9 Jamaica (JAM) 1 1 0 2 New Zealand (NZL) 1 1 0 2 11 France (FRA) 1 0 0 1 Hungary (HUN) 1 0 0 1 Mexico (MEX) 1 0 0 1 Sweden (SWE) 1 0 0 1 Trinidad and Tobago (TRI) 1 0 0 1 16 Belgium (BEL) 0 2 1 3 17 Canada (CAN) 0 1 0 1 Italy (ITA) 0 1 0 1 Portugal (POR) 0 1 0 1 20 Brazil (BRA) 0 0 1 1 Czechoslovakia (TCH) 0 0 1 1 Great Britain (GBR) 0 0 1 1 Romania (ROU)","output":"1) East Germany 2) United States 3) Soviet Union 4) Poland 5) Finland"},{"instruction":"Create a function that, when given a coefficient matrix of an Ordinary Differential Equation, finds the Eigen vector and Eigen value.","output":"Absolutely!

The Owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird \\"hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo\\" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat. Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window. \\"Get away from here, sir,\\" she said to the Grasshopper. \\"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\\" But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him. \\"Well sir,\\" she said, \\"if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.\\" The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words.

Here is the article I am talking about: Official weather bureau of the United States, founded on February 9, 1870, and charged with providing weather, hydrologic, and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its possessions, and its marine and freshwater approaches. Such weather forecasts and warnings are produced to help safeguard the lives and property of American citizens from the dangers of severe weather, as well as to protect the national economy from weather-related disruptions. The NWS, which is a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is considered the official source of the United States concerning life-threatening weather, complementing local and regional reports made by television and radio broadcasting stations and Internet sources. The NWS maintains an integrated network of more than 100 regional and field offices across the United States and its possessions. Forecasts are derived from weather and climate data collected from a multitude of sources, including satellites, aircraft, weather balloons, and ground-level remote sensing equipment (such as Doppler weather radar). Traditional instrumentation (such as thermometers, barometers, and rain gauges), however, is also used to collect weather data in the vicinity of each office. The NWS began with the Signal Service Corps of the U.S. Army. In 1870 U.S. Pres. Ulysses S. Grant signed a resolution allowing the secretary of war to set up a national weather warning service. The original purpose of the service was to facilitate the collection of weather data from military installations located across the country and warn locations along the Great Lakes and marine coasts of the approach of storms. In the early days of the service, weather information was relayed by telegraph to Washington, D.C. This office later sent forecast information out to local Signal Service offices, which were subsequently distributed to rural post offices, railroad stations, and newspaper offices for dissemination to the general public. As part of the Organic Act of 1890, which was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by Pres. Benjamin Harrison, the weather service was renamed the United States Weather Bureau (USWB) and was placed under civilian control within the Department of Agriculture. The responsibilities of weather forecasting, warning, and observation were officially transferred from the Signal Service Corps to the USWB on July 1, 1891. The USWB was made part of the Department of Commerce in 1940, and it became part of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) within the Department of Commerce in 1965. ESSA and several other offices were restructured into the newly created NOAA on October 3, 1970, and the USWB became the National Weather Service on October 9.","output":"The United States Weather Bureau became the National Weather Service and part of NOAA on October 9, 1970."},{"instruction":"Write a story plot about a younger and older sister.","output":"1.

I am so nervous about doing something wrong to harm the pup! Give me the tip and then elaborate with 2-4 sentences.","output":"- Research the breed of your pup. Regardless of whether you choose a breeder or get your dog through adoption from an animal shelter, each breed of dog has its own set of personality traits and needs. The breed you choose should match your time, financial situation, and lifestyle. In cases of adoption from animal shelters, dogs will be mixed breeds, but they have a dominant breed in their DNA. Genetic tests can help you discover more about that pup‚Äôs breed and its specific needs. - Your home should be dog proofed! Just like you would if there were children in your home, you need to proof your home against accidents and curious explorations. In a new home, most dogs will find things to break or chew on because they haven‚Äôt learned your boundaries. Electrical cords, shoes, books, and children‚Äôs toys should be put away to avoid having broken or chewed belongings. - Be patient with your dog when they come home for the first time. Your dog isn‚Äôt used to your home yet, so give them space and patience. Show them their bed, toys, food, and water bowls, then give them a little space to become acquainted with their surroundings. - Schedule a veterinarian appointment for vaccinations and the good health of your canine. Up-to-date vaccines and routine vet appointments help keep your pup healthy throughout its life. Schedule their first veterinarian appointment within a week or two of bringing them home. You must get them on the right track to wellness as soon as possible, while also establishing trust between them and a regular veterinarian."},{"instruction":"Make me a packing list for a week-long trip to the Canary Islands in May.

There is no shame in saying you are happy with what you have because, in one way, growth also means making peace with your destiny, accepting it, and owning it entirely.

No matter how big of a star you are or a CEO of a big organization, if you are meant to lose everything one day, you will. You cannot put barriers in the way of destiny because it never asks for permission. ‚ÄúPatience is not the ability to wait.

But because we have arrived in this world with a destiny already written for us, it is in our best interests to have faith and not become selfish. Ask yourself one more time why you must tire yourself by thinking of all the buts and ifs. Why not just do your job by trying hard enough and then leave everything to your fate?

If you give up now, you don't know what could happen. Who knows how many people in human history gave up right when they were about to succeed? Every second you spend creating art is a success story because it means you didn't give up. A final word: picking up another job in the meantime doesn't make you a failure.

This will be concerning my pay.","output":"Here are five tips to use when negotiating your pay. 1. Know your worth. Before entering negotiations regarding your pay, you must know what you are worth. Knowing what you are worth to a company will give you a base for negotiations. It can be tough to see what you are worth to your company, but luckily, you can use sites like glassdoor.com and payscale.com to get a better idea of what people in similar roles and companies to you do earn. This knowledge will mean you can confidently suggest a number in line with the market rate. Offering a rate identical to others in your field will allow you to have confidence that the company will not be able to find someone better without at least paying an equal rate. Hiring new staff is often tedious and not cost-effective, so forcing your employer into this decision can work in your favor. 2. Use good timing. Timing is everything in negotiations, which is never more true than in salary negotiations. Utilizing good timing can be the difference between a successful salary negotiation and an awkward conversation with your boss. Try to initiate salary negotiations while the company is doing well and you are being seen to impact that success substantially. A salesman who isn't hitting targets regularly would be ill-advised to open negotiations regarding salary. It may be that they can get a higher wage but unlikely to be sufficient if they don't have the data to back up their claimed performances. If you've just completed a profitable project and been a key player, it's probably a great time to strike while the iron is hot and ask for a pay rise. 3. Be realistic. It is necessary to know your worth and understand your value to a company, but remaining realistic is also pivotal. If you aim for the stars and ask for 50% more than you are worth, you can expect your employer to grow frustrated and unsympathetic to your request. The better tactic is to have a number in mind you would like, then add a small % to it so that you can work down to your ideal number. This will allow your employer some wiggle room to negotiate and feel they are not being played. It is essential to back your realistic request up with why you deserve it and what others are getting. 4. Don't ask too often. As stated above, alienating and frustrating your employer is not a good idea. If you do this, you risk no negotiations and just a simple no. This will leave you in no better position than you were before. That is precisely why it is essential not to ask too frequently for a pay rise. Think of a similar situation in the car when a child asks the parents are we there yet over and over. The parents become frustrated and eventually will stop answering. The same will happen with your employer. They will revert to a standard no answer if you continuously ask for something. Instead, be sure to research what you are worth and strike while the iron is hot, as we described in point 2. 5. Don't be afraid to ask. It seems silly to put this point straight after point 4. However, the fact is valid and should be discussed. While asking too often is not advised, not asking at all will probably get you nowhere. While this can't be said for all companies, most are reluctant to hand out pay raises regularly and will wait until they are asked or forced. That's why it is crucial that if you feel you deserve a pay rise and the circumstances dictate one, you stand up for yourself and ask. The worst thing they can say is no. If you don't think you deserve a pay raise, that's fine. Don't ask till you do. But if you have been stuck at the same rate for years and are integral to our company's operations, then speak up and ask for your worth."},{"instruction":"I need an ahk script that will search three inputs to see if the word sphinx is it.

No one gets hurt, and it shouldn't be scary or violent but it can be kind of gross.","output":"Evan loved to play in the ocean. He would make sandcastles, splash in the water, and paddle on his boogey board until he could ride the waves back to shore. One day, he swam far out to sea. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge fin in the water. Shark! he thought. No, it was bigger than a shark-- this was a megalodon! Before he could swim away, the shark's head popped out of the water. \\"Excuse me,\\" the megalodon said. \\"I have something stuck in my teeth. Could you help me?\\" The shark opened his enormous jaw, and Evan saw seaweed tangled around one of the shark's teeth. The shark seemed friendly enough, so Evan paddled over and crawled into its mouth to remove the seaweed. \\"Pweas be cahfuh,\\" the megalodon told him, unable to speak properly with a boy in his mouth. \\"I'm vewy tickwish.\\" Evan couldn't understand what the shark was saying as he crawled along a massive tongue that was rough like sandpaper. He yanked the seaweed out, but suddenly the shark erupted in laughter and Evan tumbled toward his throat and down into his belly. \\"I'm sorry!\\" exclaimed the shark. \\"I didn't mean to eat you. I'm just very ticklish.\\" That's what the megalodon was trying to say, Evan thought. \\"How do I get out of here?\\" he asked. \\"I don't know,\\" said the megalodon. \\"This has never happened before.\\" Evan looked around him at the walls of the megalodon's belly. After he ate something, it either came out in one of two directions, and he didn't want that to go any farther. He had to find a way back up the shark's throat. Then, he got an idea. Evan ticked the sides of the megalodon's stomach harder and harder. The walls shook as the shark laughed. A wave of vomit crashed over Evan, carried him up the megalodon's throat, and tossed him into the ocean. He looked at his sticky arms, covered in throw-up. \\"Yuck,\\" he said. \\"Sorry about that,\\" said the shark. \\"That's OK,\\" replied Evan. \\"Hope you feel better.\\" The shark nodded. \\"Next time, I'll try to get the seaweed out on my own, though.

Can you go through a list of some other kinds of cryptocurrency that aren't bitcoin?","output":"Absolutely! Here is the list of some cryptocurrencies that aren't bitcoin. 1. Litecoin (LTC) - Litecoin is a bitcoin alternative that's gotten quite popular. Litecoin has a Bitcoin-compatible API and a quick-running blockchain. You can mine Litecoin using the Scrypt algorithm which is memory and compute-intensive. It also can't be mined by Bitcoin's API chips. 2. Ethereum (ETH) - Russian-founded Ethereum is an application platform that puts storage resources across the internet, and it's similar to peer-to-peer streaming services. The resources on Ethereum are paid by Ether, which is the cryptocurrency the platform is named after. Ethereum allows for contracts built into its software DNA, and the currency pays out when conditions are met. You can mine Ether with Ethereum's resources, and it is possible for the cryptocurrency to go through inflation. 3. Ripple (XRP) - The Ripple cryptocurrency is controlled by Ripple Labs Inc, which is connected to the banking industry. Ripple has been taken on by large banking companies such as Bank of America and UPS, and it's used in securing transactions internationally. Ripple comes with low transaction fees and a high speed. 4. Zcash (Zec) - Bitcoin transactions are on public record, but Zcash is a private currency. It has a \\"zero-knowledge\\" security implementation, which makes it a safe option. It also works with a blockchain mechanism that doesn't link old and current transactions. Zcash can be mined with a gaming GPU. 5. Dash (DASH) - The name dash comes from the words digital and cash, and it used to be called Xcoin and then Darkcoin. This litecoin works with almost instant transaction speeds, and its money transfers are private. Dash isn't actually governed by humans, and its contract is actually encoded into its program."},{"instruction":"Give me 7 tips for writing an awesome CV.","output":"Of course. Below, I have written seven tips for writing a standout CV. 1. Start strong. Start your CV by listing your best achievements to date. Highlight your skills and experience, and just champion yourself. The goal of a CV is to convince a potential employer you are the right fit for them, so don't be shy and tell them exactly why your skills and experience will assist their company. If you don't get this bit right, it is unlikely recruiters will get much further into your CV. 2. Emphasize past results rather than responsibilities. When detailing your work history, try to avoid discussing what you were responsible for and instead highlight your actual results. It is far more meaningful for someone to see results rather than try to infer what you have achieved through roles and responsibilities. It sounds better to say, \\"I ensured the completion of 5 major projects within my time at the company,\\" rather than, \\"In my role, I was responsible for major projects.\\" 3. Customise. One CV does not fit all jobs. Try to tailor your CV to the job you are applying for, and bring to the fore the experiences that suit the role and company you are applying to. Research the company to understand who they are, then tailor your CV to match its ethos and culture. 4. Highlight growth and change. Change is good, and growth is even better. If you have been promoted or changed roles at a previous company, mention that. Recruiters will take that as you are versatile and willing to learn. This will give them affirmation from the actions of your previous employer that you were both competent and proactive. 5. Demonstrate your network. Showcase that if you have a large network and are well connected. Employers will see that as an opportunity to hire you and get the added bonus of your well-established network as a resource. If you are hired, they get two for the price of one. 6. Show industry insight. It doesn't hurt to give a small opinion if you are applying to an industry that's currently topical or experiencing changes. Doing this shows you are current, in the know, and committed to your career in this industry. You don't have to give an opinion. You could forecast a change you foresee and mention how you see this impacting a role. 7. Use powerful words. A CV is extremely important in grabbing a recruiter's attention. Using powerful words like implemented and adaptable will help you stand out from the crowd and keep your CV in the prospects' file. Consider the difference in the sentences \\"I am willing to change\\" and \\"I am very adaptable\\" one seems weak, and one seems far stronger. You can research topical power words online or use the thesaurus feature in Microsoft word to make your language stand out."},{"instruction":"Categorize this poem as free verse, sonnet, haiku, or ballad.

But man, the rush of being fueled is like nothing else! Let's start with the basics and move up from there. Hahah. I get giddy thinking about all the forms of caffeine. Let me make another pot, and we'll get started! ‚Ä¢ Trace amounts (0-10mg): decaffeinated coffee or tea. These will still have a tiny bit, but maybe 5% of the caffeine of a cup's worth. I never drink this stuff! ‚Ä¢ Baby mode (10-20mg): chocolate and tea. Both of them contain some morsels of caffeine, it's true. Those sensitive to the stuff should probably stay away. Who knew a Hershey's bar could give you a buzz? ‚Ä¢ Startin' to feel it (20-60mg): black teas, chai, and a few others. Not as strong as the old bean juice, but might do something for ya! This is the kind of stuff I drink when winding down for the day. Haha! ‚Ä¢ The real stuff (70-150mg): coffee! Pretty much a baseline of measurement for caffeine with 80-120mg of caffeine per cup. It's about the same in serving amounts for espresso, iced coffee, Americanos, and lattes. ‚Ä¢ Harder. Stronger (150-230mg): stronger coffee! Coffee, such as the way Starbucks brews it, is made with less water and will have more caffeine. Also, cold brews (the ones you sit in the fridge overnight) will be around this range too. Yum! ‚Ä¢ Kickin' and Screamin'! (250-400mg): the strongest energy drinks will reach this. For example, a 24 oz big can of Monster will have 240mg! A 16 oz can of Bang Energy is 300mg as well! Now that'll be a rush! ‚Ä¢ Carl's Choice (400-500mg+): Kaffn8 Liquified Caffeine contains 300 mg in only 1 oz of drink! Take 1-2 of these and you'll be livin' fast!

Show Jumping: Show jumping requires a lot of precision, agility, speed, and athleticism. With a clear goal, the rider takes the hours through multiple obstacles in a specific pattern. Faults are considered when a pole is dismantled, the rider goes off from the way, or if the rider takes too much time on the course than the required allocated time. 2. Eventing: This particular form of English riding consists of three different event types. The first is Dressage to show how well the horse has received discipline. The second is Jumping, to prove the performance of precision and speed. While the third is cross-country, which demonstrates the agility and endurance of the horse and rider. 3. Dressage: Dressage is a specific form of English riding that trains the horse to learn discipline. This discipline shows how well the horse responds to the rider's commands and how much control the rider has over the horse's movements. This is a highly communicative type of riding between the rider and horse to ensure a tight connection. 4. Saddle Seat: Saddle Seat is meant to showcase a horse's various gaits, with focused high-stepping abilities.

I own a tech company and am trying to get more brand awareness.","output":"Here are eight things to consider when identifying your target audience. 1. Analyze current customers. If you are in a position where you have existing customers, then a good first step is to identify traits and characteristics among them. Think about the demographic they belong to and why they may be purchasing products or services from you already. You may already have data regarding your current customer's ages, locations, and vocations. These are all valuable metrics to track and interpret when defining your target audience. 2. Market research. Conducting market research is a valuable process. By conducting market research, you can identify areas in which you may be able to grow an audience or a blind spot where your services could be of real value. Looking into your competitors can provide great insights into what works and doesn't and where services like yours perform well. Knowing what others offer gives you an advantage when creating a unique selling point that sets you apart. 3. Industry trends. Keeping your finger on the pulse and identifying what changes are occurring within your industry allows you to tailor content and services in a way that provides real value. This leads on from market research slightly and is another way of ensuring you stay informed concerning your customers' expectations and desires. This will allow you to provide them with a constant value. 4. Distinguish benefits from features. Benefits and features are fundamentally different things. It is important to clarify this to your target audience. It is excellent that you have a feature or product that can help them in some way, but it's even better if you can explain the practical benefit of the feature. Take, for example, a product that improves productivity. Emphasizing productivity improvement and what that means is more important than highlighting the actual feature that does the work. People are more interested in what you will enable them to do rather than how you will do it. 5. Spy on your competition. Just as important as your customers are your competitors. Keep an eye on what they are doing and the content they are producing. What could be working for them, and what could you do to improve what they have? This is an easy way to gain inspiration and see what's not being offered. This will allow you to fill in the gaps and potentially convert customers to you and your services. If your competition produces content about something you are not, this may mean they have researched and identified a weak spot. Now you can do your own research and improve on what they have done. 6. Who isn't your target audience? Knowing who your target audience is made much easier if you can identify exactly who it isn't. Who won't benefit from what you are offering or take an interest in what you are saying? By analyzing these questions, you can reduce your audience to specifics and tailor your services to those likely to benefit from and purchase them. Doing this will give you more time to concentrate on those that matter. 7. Be objective. Making assumptions can lead to alienating some of your customer base. This can be avoided by posting content that leads by facts more than anything else. By being objective, you show your customers you can be trusted and only care about black and white. This should help to foster a sense of trust in you and your products. 8. Go niche. It may seem like going to a niche would limit your customers, and while that may be true to an extent, you shouldn't underestimate how many people are in the world. And also how being a leading figure in a super niche topic can grow your audience quickly and lead you to be the go-to person in said niche. Also, it is worth remembering that while your niche may mean fewer customers or audiences, it also means less competition."},{"instruction":"Should this home improvement task be classified as painting or paving?

You no longer have to spend more than 500 to get a video card using NVIDIA's current Ada Lovelace architecture. The company is launching the GeForce RTX 4060 series, which will start at 299. The flagship RTX 4060 Ti will start at 399 with 8GB of RAM when it arrives on May 24th ‚Äî a full 200 less than the base 4070. It's pitched as a direct successor to the similarly-priced RTX 3060 Ti and 2060 Super, and aimed at gamers who are more interested in high frame rates at 1080p than a high resolution. The RTX 4060 Ti is a noticeable step down from the 4070 with 4,352 CUDA cores (versus 5,888) and a 128-bit memory interface (versus 192-bit). It's a mixed bag versus its predecessor. While the 3060 Ti has more cores and a much wider 256-bit interface, Ada, DLSS 3 upscaling and a clock speed boost (2.3GHz base compared to the old card's 1.4GHz) theoretically help the 4060 Ti deliver more actual computing power, particularly for ray tracing and tensor-based tasks. It uses less power, too, with an \\"average gaming power\\" of 140W instead of the 3060 Ti's 197W. NVIDIA claims a roughly 15 percent average performance increase at 1080p over the 3060 Ti in games that don't use DLSS 3's frame generation, and 70 percent for those that do. You'll unsurprisingly get high 1080p frame rates in competitive titles like Counter-Strike 2 (330FPS) and Overwatch 2 (260FPS).","output":"NVIDIA is releasing video cards using the newest technologies and priced under 500. There are many different models in the GeForce RTX 4060 series, like the 4060 Ti which is the strongest one in the lineup. These graphic cards improve on older models and are very useful for video game enthusiasts looking for better performance. When looking at the RTX 4060 Ti model it is clear that it isn't as good as the 4070 since it has fewer cores and a worse interface for memory. But it is still a small improvement over the 3060 Ti which is the older model. The technological features between models can be very different on paper, but in gaming use the 4060 Ti should still pull out ahead. One of the best parts of the new model is that it uses less power. Additionally, the 4060 Ti increases gaming performance in 1080p fairly significantly, especially if the DLSS 3 feature is used. Many games can benefit from this like Counter-Strike 2 and Overwatch 2."},{"instruction":"When did Italy become a republic?","output":"Italy became a republic in 1946.

The evolution of plant life on Earth is fundamental to the history of our planet. It has provided resources and habitats for animals and influenced climate on a global scale. We know that plant life on land is ancient, but exactly how old is widely debated. Now, Museum scientists are part of a multi-institutional team transforming our understanding of this most formative episode in Earth's history. Dr Harald Schneider, Dr Paul Kenrick, Dr Silvia Pressel and Dr Mark Puttick were part of a team of ten scientists researching the evolution of plant life. Their latest findings, published in the journals Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Current Biology, show that land plants evolved about 100 million years earlier than previously thought. New data and analysis show that plant life began colonising land 500 million years ago, during the Cambrian Period, around the same time as the emergence of the first land animals.","output":"Plant life began colonizing land 500 million years ago during the Cambrian Period."},{"instruction":"Write a short story about a heist in which the recipe for a hamburger is stolen.

Becoming a new mother is extremely challenging, so we have made a list of 10 simple don‚Äôts to make your transition into motherhood just a little easier. 1. Don‚Äôt Do It Alone! Call for help, whether it's a friend, a partner, or a family member; you don‚Äôt need to do it all by yourself. 2. Don‚Äôt Cry When They Cry. Babies are going to cry, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a bad mother. Don‚Äôt get down if your baby is crying; it‚Äôs perfectly normal. 3. Don‚Äôt Neglect YOU. So many mothers forget to take time for self-care! You can‚Äôt care for your baby if you‚Äôre not taking care of yourself. 4. Don‚Äôt Believe Everything You Hear. There is almost too much motherly advice available these days. And focusing on all of it will drive you insane! Find the tips and tricks that work for you, and leave the rest behind. 5. Don‚Äôt Get Impatient. It takes time to ease into motherhood. Don‚Äôt forget to be patient with yourself and the process. 6. Don‚Äôt Forget Your Baby is Unique. Not all babies are the same! What worked for another baby simply might not work for yours, and that‚Äôs okay! You‚Äôll get to know your baby‚Äôs unique needs and personality in no time. 7. Don‚Äôt Forget It‚Äôs All a Phase. At the end of the day, everything is a phase when you have a baby. So if you‚Äôre in a particularly challenging one, just remember, it will pass. 8. Don‚Äôt Have Specific Expectations. You may think you know exactly how you‚Äôre going to respond to motherhood or even how your baby is going to act. And it‚Äôs just not true! Having specific expectations leads to frustrations and disappointment. Don‚Äôt forget to go with the flow! 9. Don‚Äôt Worry! Alright, this one is certainly easier said than done.
