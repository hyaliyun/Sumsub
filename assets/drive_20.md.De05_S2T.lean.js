But these statutes also represent a significant cost to society because they create protected monopolies. In many countries, copyright statutes grant copyright protection for the life of the author plus several decades. This is too long, since the societal benefit from the additional years of copyright is more than offset by the societal cost. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most strongly supports the reasoning in the argument? A: A statute should not limit rights unless it can be shown that it thereby enhances other rights. B: A statute should be written in a way that eliminates any appearance of its being inconsistent in its aims. C: If a statute is to be justified by its benefit to society, it should be designed so that its societal benefit always exceeds its societal cost.

Yet paradoxically, for people who signed such agreements when working for competing firms, many firms are unwilling to consider hiring them during the period covered by the agreement. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the paradox? A: Many companies will not risk having to become involved in lawsuits, even suits that they expect to have a favorable outcome, because of the associated costs and publicity.

Which one of the following, if true, contributes most to an explanation of the archaeologists' success in using annual rings to establish the relative ages of the tombs at the Pazyryk site? A: The Pazyryk Valley, surrounded by extremely high mountains, has a distinctive yearly pattern of rainfall, and so trees growing in the Pazyryk Valley have annual rings that are quite distinct from trees growing in nearby valleys. B: The archaeologists determined that the youngest tree used in any of the tombs was 90 years old and that the oldest tree was 450 years old. C: Each log in the Pazyryk tombs has among its rings a distinctive sequence of twelve annual rings representing six drought years followed by three rainy years and three more drought years.

Although I admit I used passages from Myers' book without attribution, Myers gave me permission in private correspondence to do so. Millie: Myers cannot give you permission to plagiarize. Plagiarism is wrong, not only because it violates authors' rights to their own words, but also because it misleads readers: it is fundamentally a type of lie. A lie is no less a lie if another person agrees to the deception. Which one of the following principles, if established, would justify Oscar's judgment? A: An author is entitled to quote freely without attribution the work of a writer if that writer relinquishes his or her exclusive right to the material. B: Authors are entitled to quote without attribution passages that they themselves have written and published in other books or articles. C: The writer of an article must cite the source of all passages that were not written by that writer if those passages are more than a few sentences long. D: Plagiarism is never justified, but writers are justified in occasionally quoting without attribution the work of other writers if the work quoted has not been published.

The shrimp get this pigment from tiny red algae that they filter through their leg bristles. In the Jurassic period (about 200 million years ago), both algae and shrimp were an excellent source of food for any larger animal equipped to sieve them out of the water through an anatomical strainer. The Argentine pterodactyl possessed a row of thin, bristlelike teeth through which it pumped water, straining out any tiny food particles in the process. Thus, because it was able to filter both algae and shrimp, it is reasonable to conclude that the pterodactyl acquired a pink coloration. Which one of the following statements, if true, strengthens the argument for the existence of a pink pterodactyl? A: The Argentine pterodactyl's habitat included shallow seas that were particularly rich in red algae and shrimp. B: If the Argentine pterodactyl did not eat a diet containing red algae, its color was determined by factors other than diet.

During the nineteenth century, recordings of poetry were not made for wide commercial sale. Rather, they were made either as rare private souvenirs of the voices of famous poets or else as publicity stunts, in which actors recorded poems that were familiar to the public. Since the Whitman poem in the recording was never even published, it is likely that the voice in the recording is actually Whitman' s. The argument proceeds by A: explaining the historical context of an incident in order to demonstrate that each of the two possible scenarios involving that incident is as likely as the other B: distinguishing a phenomenon into two subtypes and then for a particular case eliminating one of those subtypes C: showing that two apparently mutually exclusive alternatives are actually compatible with one another D: offering a general principle and then demonstrating that the general principle is violated in a particular case Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"B"},{"instruction":"Electric bug zappers, which work by attracting insects to light, are a very effective means of ridding an area of flying insects.

The conclusion can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? A: Most people seek out critical reviews of particular artworks before viewing those works. B: Most people lack the confidence necessary for making their own evaluations of art. C: The merit of an artistic work is determined by the amount of pleasure it elicits.

Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: It is very difficult, without genetic testing, to differentiate the wild form of emmer wheat from a closely related wild wheat that also grows in southwest Asia. B: Modern experiments show that wild emmer wheat can easily be domesticated so as to yield nearly as well as traditionally domestic strains. C: In the region containing the strip where wild emmer wheat has been found, climatic conditions have changed very little since before the development of agriculture.

After all, beauticians suggest that their customers have their hair cut twice a month, and they do this as a way of generating more business for themselves. B: One should not borrow even small amounts of money unless it is absolutely necessary. Once one borrows a few dollars, the interest starts to accumulate.

In the promotion , any customer who made a purchase of ten or more gallons of gasoline was entitled to a free car wash . For the month of August , XT experienced a ten percent increase in gasoline sales as compared to sales in August the previous year so evidently the promotion was successful as a means of boosting sales. In evaluating the argument , it would be most helpful to answer which of the following ? A: Did XT or any of its gasoline stations have to pay other businesses to provide the car washes that customers were offered in the promotion? B: Are XT's gasoline sales in August usually significantly higher than one twelfth of XT's annual gasoline sales ? C: In the areas in which XT's gasoline stations operate , how did total combined gasoline sales for all gasoline stations last August compare with sales for the previous August? D: Was the money that XT earned from the increase in gasoline sales enough to offset the cost of providing free car washes during the promotion?

Yet to deny anyone the unrestricted freedom to speak is to threaten everyone' s right to free expression. Hence, the dean' s decision has threatened everyone' s right to free expression. The pattern of reasoning displayed above is most closely paralleled in which one of the following? A: In order to rescue a drowning child, Isabel jumped into a freezing river. Such acts of heroism performed to save the life of one enrich the lives of all. Hence, Isabel's action enriched the lives of all. B: Fire fighters are often expected to perform heroically under harsh conditions. But no one is ever required to act heroically. Hence, fire fighters are often expected to perform actions they are not required to perform. C: Because anyone who performs an act of heroism acts altruistically rather than selfishly, a society that rewards heroism encourages altruism rather than pure selfinterest. D: Dr. Pacheco saved a child's life by performing emergency surgery. But surgery rarely involves any risk to the surgeon. Ttherefore, if an act is not heroic unless it requires the actor to take some risk, Dr. Pacheco's surgery was not heroic.

Since more funds were ultimately donated than were used for the repairs, the directors plan to donate the surplus funds to other animal shelters. But before doing so, the directors should obtain permission from those who made the donations. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the position advocated above and yet places the least restriction on the allocation of funds by directors of charitable organizations? A: People who contribute money to charitable organizations should be considered to be placing their trust in the directors of those organizations to use the money wisely according to whatever circumstance might arise. B: People who solicit charitable donations from the public for a specific cause should spend the funds only on that cause, or, if that becomes impossible, should dispose of the funds according to the express wishes of the donors. C: The directors of charitable organizations cannot allocate publicly solicited funds to any purposes for which the directors had not specifically earmarked the funds in advance.

These two officers actually shared their cells with the Portuguese soldiers who identified the king' s body to Moroccan officials. The omissions ttherefore had to have had a psychological cause: the Portuguese evidently found Sebastian' s death so humiliating that they could not bring themselves to write about it. The discussion about the two Portuguese officers advances the argument by A: providing grounds for eliminating an alternative explanation B: supplying indirect evidence that a disputed death actually occurred C: giving evidence supporting a general psychological principle on which the main conclusion is explicitly based D: offering grounds for doubting the reliability of historical reports that conflict with the argument's main conclusion Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"A"},{"instruction":"Spreading iron particles over the surface of the earth' s oceans would lead to an increase in phytoplankton, decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and thereby counteracting the greenhouse effect.

One particular layer of sedimentary rock that contains an unusual amount of the element iridium has been presented as support for a theory that a meteorite collided with the earth some sixty million years ago. Meteorites are rich in iridium compared to the earth' s crust, and geologists theorize that a meteorite' s collision with the earth raised a huge cloud of iridiumladen dust. The dust, they say, eventually settled to earth where it combined with other matter, and as new layers accumulated above it, it formed a layer of iridiumrich rock.

The channels do show physical evidence of having been formed quickly, but the flood theory was originally rejected because scientists knew of no natural process that could melt so much ice so quickly. Paradoxically, today the scientific community accepts the flood theory even though scientists still do not know of a process that can melt so much ice so quickly.

Scientists think the skeleton is about 3. 2 million years old. For six years, Lucy' s remains were part of an exhibition called Lucy' s Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia. However, there was much opposition to the exhibition for fear that Lucy' s fossils would be damaged. It' s a good thing that they started using casts instead; the preservation of these fossils should be the number one concern of excavators and scientists. Which of the following would be used in opposition to the passage? A: Lucy's fossils, if they are kept in exhibition for too long, are certainly at risk for damage. Even if you can't see it with the naked eye, the constant handling of fossils will cause wear and tear that time could never recover. B: Some scientists think that Lucy died from falling out of a tree, although they are not sure. There is also a tooth mark on top of a left pubic bone. What's even more curious is Lucy's age. Although she was considered fully mature, Lucy only lived for about twelve years. C: The exhibition of Lucy is an important step in raising an awareness of where humans originated and the studies thereof. Keeping the fossils isolated from the public will certainly preserve the remains; however, we might risk the deterrence of public knowledge. D: The controversy over the exhibition of Lucy's bones is irrelevant. Even if the bones are damaged, we have preserved the memory with scans, photographs, as well as accurate castings of the fossils.

But suppose, instead, I borrow a car, and when I go to return it, the neighbor from whom I borrowed it is very drunk and wants to drive the car; then the obligation to return the car immediately is much less clear. So not all cases of borrowing are equivalent. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the argument? A: There is an obligation to refrain from acting in a manner that could result in harm to people, and this obligation overrides lesser obligations when they conflict with it. B: Though some cases may seem to be exceptions, the rule that one ought to return to others what one borrowed from them is an exceptionless rule. C: When someone that we know is likely to injure someone else, it is not altogether clear whether we have an obligation to intervene.

There is good reason to regard their hypothesis as false, however, for they merely offer empirical arguments against the view that life evolved on Earth; neither they nor anyone else has provided positive support for the extraterrestrialspore theory of the origin of terrestrial life. The reasoning in the astronomer's argument is flawed because the argument A: attempts to derive a conclusion from premises that contradict it B: concludes, simply because there is no evidence in favor of a hypothesis, that there is evidence against that hypothesis C: grants the truth of claims that are made by the advocates of the hypothesis but that do nothing to strengthen the astronomer's own argument D: reasons that a hypothesis is false simply because there is another hypothesis that is equally likely to be true Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"B"},{"instruction":"City leader: If our city adopts the new tourism plan, the amount of money that tourists spend here annually will increase by at least 2 billion, creating as many jobs as a new automobile manufacturing plant would.

The main purpose of this social grooming is the maintenance of social cohesion. Furthermore, group size among primates tends to increase proportionally with the size of the neocortex, the seat of higher thought in the brain. Extrapolating upon the relationship between group size and neocortex size, we can infer that early human groups were quite large. But unexpectedly, there is strong evidence that, apart from parents grooming their children, these humans spent virtually no time grooming one another. Which one of the following, if true, would do most to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above? A: Many types of primates other than humans have fairly large neocortex regions and display frequent social grooming. B: Early humans were not as extensively covered with hair as are other primates, and consequently they had less need for social grooming.

In contrast, efforts to curb cigarette smoking, which have emphasized the dangers of smoking rather than the positive health effects of quitting, have been highly successful. Thus, efforts to get the public to exercise regularly would be more successful if they emphasized the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle rather than the positive health effects of exercise. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? A: The health risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle are as great as those associated with smoking. B: Efforts to curb cigarette smoking would not be more successful if they emphasized the positive health effects of quitting rather than the dangers of smoking.

Since carbon dioxide levels are increased by the burning of fossil fuels and by other human industrial activities, it is obvious that these industrial activities are purely beneficial to agriculture and those of us who depend upon it. The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following? A: Consistently consuming more calories than one expends inevitably leads to excessive weight gain, so if one wishes to avoid the health problems associated with this condition, one ought to fast periodically. B: Because a high fiber diet has been shown to be more healthful than a low fiber diet, a diet in which foods with a low fiber content have been entirely replaced by foods with a high fiber content is bound to be even more healthful. C: It has been shown that one can obtain more vitamins and minerals from fresh fruits and vegetables than from processed fruits and vegetables. One ought, ttherefore, to completely abandon consumption of the latter in favor of the former.

Critics have charged that the proposal poses health risks to people who might eat the meat of treated deer and thereby ingest unsafe quantities of the hormone. The biologist has responded to these critics by pointing out that humans can ingest up to 10 milligrams of the hormone a day without any adverse effects, and since no one would eat even one entire deer a day, the treatment would be safe. The biologist's response to critics of the proposal is based on which one of the following assumptions? A: Most people do not consider deer meat to be part of their daily diet and eat it only on rare occasions. B: The hormone in question does not occur naturally in the female deer that would be injected. C: Hunting season for deer could be scheduled so that it would not coincide with breeding season.

Unless strict environmental regulations are maintained, endangered species of plants and animals will become extinct. And since a large majority of new medicines are derived from plants and animals, a general deregulatory approach could actually undermine the original intent of the relaxation of regulations governing the manufacture and sale of new medicines. The statement that a large majority of new medicines are derived from plants and animals plays which one of the following roles in the argument? A: support for the hypothesis that only very narrowly focused efforts at deregulation of industrial activity actually have beneficial results B: evidence for a point of view that the argument is designed to undermine C: a link between the extinction of species and the potentially decreased availability of new medicines D: an illustration of the potential disaster that could result from continued overregulation of industrial activity Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"A chimp who displays feelings of affection toward the other members of its social group is more likely to be defended by these group members from raiders outside of the group even at the risk of harm to these defenders than are those chimps who rarely or never display feelings of affection toward their associates. This shows that, from a sociological perspective, affection plays the same role in chimp communities as in human communities, since humans are more willing to face risks to protect those toward whom they have feelings of affection. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: Expression of affection in chimps is limited to members of the social group to which they belong. B: Feelings of affection are the only reason humans protect each other. C: Chimps express their emotions behaviorally whenever they feel them.

The tests revealed that the hyperactive adults had much less brain activity in the premotor cortex, a region of the brain believed to control action, than did the nonhyperactive adults. The experimenters concluded that diminished activity in the premotor cortex is one cause of hyperactivity. Which one of the following, if true, most undermines the conclusion drawn by the experimenters? A: All of the hyperactive adults in the study had been treated for hyperactivity with a medication that is known to depress activity in some regions of the brain, while none of the nonhyperactive adults had been so treated. B: The test was performed only on adults because even though the method by which the test measured brain activity is harmless to adults, it does require the use of radiation, which could be harmful to children.

Both diets contained the same number of calories, and each volunteer' s diet prior to the experiment had contained moderate levels of proteins and carbohydrates. After ten days, those on the lowcarbohydrate diet had lost more weight than those on the highcarbohydrate diet. Thus, the most effective way to lose body fat is to eat much protein and shun carbohydrates. Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument above? A: A lowprotein, highcarbohydrate diet causes the human body to retain water, the added weight of which largely compensates for the weight of any body fat lost, whereas a highprotein, lowcarbohydrate diet does not. B: In the experiment, the volunteers on the high carbohydrate diet engaged in regular exercise of a kind known to produce weight loss, and those on the lowcarbohydrate diet did not. C: Many of the volunteers who had been on the lowcarbohydrate diet eventually regained much of the weight they had lost on the diet after returning to their normal diets. GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.

Of the following, which one best illustrates the principle illustrated by the stated advantage of using albumin as a substitute for plasma? A: A newspaper can increase advertising revenue without increasing its bulk or weight if it is printed in a smaller format. B: Hardbound books can be a better choice than paperbacks despite their extra bulk if the books need to be more durable than paperbacks. C: An advantage that compact discs have over vinyl records is that they are also used for storing information for computers, so advances in computer disc technology will probably apply to compact discs used for music.

Alligators prey heavily on a species of freshwater fish that is highly valued as food by Parlanders, who had hoped that the decline in the alligator population would lead to an increase in the numbers of these fish available for human consumption. Yet the population of this fish species has also declined, even though the annual number caught for human consumption has not increased. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the decline in the population of the fish species? A: In several neighboring countries through which Parland's rivers also flow, alligators are at risk of extinction as a result of extensive hunting. B: Over the last few years, Parland's commercial fishing enterprises have increased the number of fishing boats they use. C: The decline in the alligator population has meant that fishers can work in some parts of lakes and rivers that were formerly too dangerous.

The young kokanee are starving to death. So eradicating the shrimp is preferable to allowing trout fishing. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most strongly supports Lopez's conclusion? A: When seeking to increase the population of a given species, it is most important that one preserve the members of the species who are in the prime reproductive stage of their lives.

The roots of melon plants perform less efficiently under the lowoxygen conditions present in rainsoaked soil. When the efficiency of melon roots is impaired, the roots do not supply sufficient amounts of the proper nutrients for the plants to perform photosynthesis at their usual levels. It follows that melon plants have a lowerthanusual rate of photosynthesis when their roots are in rainsoaked soil. When the photosynthesis of the plants slows, sugar stored in the fruits is drawn off to supply the plants with energy. Ttherefore, ripe melons harvested after a prolonged period of heavy rain should be less sweet than other ripe melons. In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles? A: The first provides support for the conclusion of the argument as a whole; the second provides evidence that supports an objection to that conclusion. B: The first provides support for an intermediate conclusion that supports a further conclusion stated in the argument; the second states that intermediate conclusion. C: The first serves as an intermediate conclusion that supports a further conclusion stated in the argument; the second states the position that the argument as a whole opposes.

Our audience is not the students, but the administration committee that approves space and funding for the project. We should instead appeal directly to the administrators to act in the name of progress and technology. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most justifies Myers stance? A: Appealing to students will in turn appeal to the proposal's committee. Students are the lifeblood of the university and it's critical that the committee determine whether or not students are on board. B: Proposals should appeal to the project's recipients, or those who the project will directly affect. This way, the project will gain support from its followers.

The writers will choose to maximize their audience, so the characters will not be developed in a more realistic manner. Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above? A: If a company's failure is due to a broader economic collapse, then it is not fair to blame the company's executives for the failure. There was a broader economic collapse when ViqCo went bankrupt. So it is probably not fair to blame ViqCo's executives for the failure. B: Since ViqCo's failure was due to a broader economic collapse, it is not fair to blame the company's executives for the failure. But that means that when ViqCo was succeeding because the broader economy was growing, the executives did not deserve the credit. C: If ViqCo's executives were responsible for the company's losses, then ViqCo's losses would have been greater than those of its competitors. But ViqCo's losses were less than those of its competitors. So ViqCo's executives were not responsible for the company's losses. D: If ViqCo's executives were responsible for the company's failure, then it must be possible to say what they should have done differently.

Yet this is not because the crime rate has increased, but rather because the public is now more interested in reading and hearing about crime. After all, a crucial factor in the media' s decisions about what issues to cover and to what extent to cover them is the interests of their audiences. The proposition that the public is now more interested in reading and hearing about crime plays which one of the following roles in the argument? A: It is a generalization based on the claim that the crime rate has increased over the past ten years. B: It is presented as evidence that the media decide what to cover and to what extent to cover it depending on the interests of the public. C: It is offered as an alternative explanation of why the media devote more coverage to crime now than they did ten years ago.

The modified system, however, caused the humidity in the school air to decrease by 18 percent. Twentyfour hours after the decrease in air humidity, a 25 percent increase in the number of visits to the school nurse was reported. This shows that a decrease in humidity can make people ill. The argument depends on assuming which one of the following? A: Most of the students at the high school suffered from the decrease in air humidity. B: Modifying the airconditioning system proved to be an ineffective way to cut costs. C: It takes 24 hours after a person is infected with a virus for that person to exhibit symptoms.

Currently, some executives try to increase corporate profits and their own salaries by cutting the pay and benefits of their corporations' employees. A maximum wage law would remove this incentive for these executives to cut the wages of their lowestpaid employees. Which one of the following is an assumption the economist's argument requires? A: All of the lowestpaid corporate employees in the economist's country are employed at corporations at which the executives earn more than 50 times what the corporations' lowestpaid employees in the economist's country earn. B: If such a maximum wage law were enacted in the economist's country, one or more corporate executives would not cut the pay and benefits of their corporations' lowestpaid employees in the economist's country. C: If corporate executives could not increase their own salaries by cutting the pay and benefits of their corporations' lowestpaid employees in the economist's country, they would never change the wages of those employees.

Drug Z' s manufacturer, which has engaged in questionable marketing practices such as offering stock options to doctors who participate in clinical trials of drug Z, does not contest the results of the studies but claims that they do not reveal drug Z' s advantages. However, since drug Z does not clearly treat the problem more effectively than drug Y, there is no established medical reason for doctors to use drug Z rather than drug Y on their heartattack victims. A major flaw in the argument is that the argument A: fails to recognize that there may be medical criteria relevant to the choice between the two drugs other than their effectiveness as a treatment B: neglects to compare the marketing practices of drug Y's manufacturer with those of drug Z's manufacturer C: confuses economic reasons for selecting a treatment with medical reasons D: does not consider drugs or treatments other than drug Y and drug Z that may be used to prevent blood clotting in heartattack patients Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"A"},{"instruction":"Commentator: Unfortunately, Roehmer' s opinion column has a polarizing effect on national politics.

A: The plaintiff accuses the defendant of violating campaign laws, but the accusations are ill founded. While the defendant's actions may violate certain laws, they are not immoral, because the laws in question are unjust. B: The plaintiff accuses the defendant of voting only for campaign laws that would favor the defendant's party. This accusation is ill founded, however, because it attacks the defendant's motivations instead of addressing the arguments the defendant has put forth justifying these votes. C: The plaintiff accuses the defendant of violating campaign laws, but these accusations show the plaintiff to be hypocritical, because the plaintiff has engaged in similar conduct. D: The plaintiff accuses the defendant of violating campaign laws, and, in the past, courts have declared such violations illegal.

The argument is flawed primarily because the author A: does not supply information about homeowners in age groups other than 40 to 50 B: does not specify the precise amount of ice cream purchased by any demographic group C: fails to distinguish between purchasing and consuming D: discusses ice cream rather than more nutritious and healthful foods Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"Economist: In free market systems, the primary responsibility of corporate executives is to determine a nation' s industrial technology, the pattern of work organization, location of industry, and resource allocation. They also are the decision makers, though subject to significant consumer control, on what is to be produced and in what quantities. In short, a large category of major decisions is turned over to business executives. Thus, business executives have become public officials. Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the economist's argument? A: What a country produces and in what quantities is not always completely controlled by corporate executives. B: Making decisions about patterns of work organization, resource allocation, and location of industry is not the core of a public official's job.

The wetter the laundry, the more energy required to dry it in an automatic dryer. Thus using these new types of washing machines could result in an overall increase in the energy needed to wash and dry a load of laundry. In which one of the following is the pattern of reasoning most parallel to that in the argument above? A: The more weights added to an exercise machine, the greater the muscle strength needed to work out on the machine. Up to a point, using more muscle strength can make a person stronger. Thus an exercise machine with more weights can, but does not necessarily, make a person stronger. B: Pine is a less expensive wood than cedar but is more susceptible to rot. Outdoor furniture made from wood susceptible to rot must be painted with more expensive paint. Ttherefore, building outdoor furniture from pine rather than cedar could increase the total cost of building and painting the furniture. C: The more skill required to operate a machine, the harder it is to find people able to do it, and thus the more those people must be paid. Ttherefore, if a factory installs machines that require highly skilled operators, it must be prepared to pay higher wages. D: The more people who work in the library's reading room, the noisier the room becomes; and the noisier the working environment, the less efficiently people work. Ttherefore, when many people are working in the reading room, those people are working less efficiently.

Yet the annual number of deaths and injuries resulting from automobile accidents has not increased significantly. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain why deaths and injuries resulting from automobile accidents have not increased significantly? A: Because of a vigorous market in used cars, the average age of cars on the road has actually increased throughout the years of steady growth in automobile ownership. B: The increases in traffic volume have been most dramatic on Sabresia's highways, where speeds are well above those of other roads.

Teachers rightly observe that in some cases calculators enable students to focus on general principles rather than the tedious, largely rote calculations that constitute the application of these principles. But principles are more likely to be remembered when knowledge of them is grounded in habits ingrained by painstaking applications of those principles. The very fact that calculators make calculation easier, ttherefore, makes it reasonable to restrict their use. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: Some students who know how to use calculators also thoroughly understand the mathematical principles that calculators obey. B: Slide rules, which are less technologically sophisticated analogues of calculators, were widely used in the learning of mathematics several decades ago.

Each of the following, if true, helps to reconcile the statements above EXCEPT: A: The tree frog's croak is highpitched and clearly identifiable while the croaks of most other frogs are lowpitched and indistinguishable. B: While many varieties of jungle amphibian will frequently move from plant to plant, the tree frog will often stay on the same tree for hours at a time without moving. C: Most amphibians in the Tropicalico jungle exhibit some sort of communal behavior and often gather around common water sources, but the tree frog takes in water through its skin so it has no need to congregate near a water source.

When chickens on a local farm were let out in the spring to forage for food, their egg production dropped noticeably. So the food found and eaten by the chickens is undeniably low in calcium. B: The bacteria that cause tetanus live in the digestive tract of horses. Tetanus is a highly infectious disease. Consequently it must be that horses contract tetanus more frequently than do most other animals. C: Animals that are undernourished are very susceptible to infection. Animals in the largest metropolitan zoos are not undernourished, so they surely must not be very susceptible to disease.

It was originally concluded from this that playing bridge can help older people to retain and develop their memory. However, it may well be that bridge is simply a more enjoyable game for people who already have good shortterm memory and who are thus more inclined to play. In countering the original conclusion the reasoning above uses which one of the following techniques? A: conceding the suggested relationship between playing bridge and shortterm memory, but questioning whether any conclusion about appropriate therapy can be drawn B: arguing that the original conclusion relied on an inaccurate understanding of the motives that the people surveyed have for playing bridge C: providing an alternative hypothesis to explain the data on which the original conclusion was based D: challenging the representativeness of the sample surveyed Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"Editorial: In order to encourage personal responsibility in adults, society should not restrict the performance of any of the actions of adults or interfere with the likely results except to prevent negative effects on others.

For drivers who speed do not risk only their own lives; such drivers often injure or kill other people. Moreover, speed limits have been shown to significantly reduce highway accident and fatality rates. B: Even though public smoking may lead to indirect harm to others, it should not be banned. There are several other ways to eliminate this harm that do not restrict the conduct of smokers and hence are preferable to a complete ban on public smoking.

This shows that the barriers to communication between scientists and the public are not impermeable. Thus recent scientific research, most of which also can be described only in language that seems esoteric to most contemporary readers, may also become part of everyone' s intellectual heritage. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the scientist's argument by the claim that recent scientific research can often be described only in language that seems esoteric to most contemporary readers? A: It is a premise that supports the argument's main conclusion by suggesting that the results of recent scientific research are only superficially different from claims made in Newton's Principia. B: It is a claim that serves mainly to help establish the relevance of the preceding statements to the argument's final conclusion. C: It serves to cast doubt on an alleged similarity between Newton's Principia and recent scientific research.

Workers who lose their jobs in a recession usually cannot find new jobs. The result is an increase in the number of people who are jobless. Recovery from a recession is defined by an increase in consumer spending and an expansion of business activity that creates a need for additional workers. But businesspeople generally have little confidence in the economy after a recession and ttherefore delay hiring additional workers as long as possible. The statements above, if true, provide most support for which one of the following conclusions? A: Sometimes recovery from a recession does not promptly result in a decrease in the number of people who are jobless. B: Governmental intervention is required in order for an economy to recover from a recession. C: Employees of businesses that close during a recession make up the majority of the workers who lose their jobs during that recession.

Thus, although there is no harm in paying for status if that is what one wants, one should know that one is paying for prestige, not quality. Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above? A: Many theatrical actors cannot enjoy watching a play because when they watch others, they yearn to be on stage themselves. Thus, although there is no harm in yearning to perform, such performers should, for their own sakes, learn to suppress that yearning. B: Those beginning a new hobby sometimes quit it because of the frustrations involved in learning a new skill. Thus, although it is fine to try to learn a skill quickly, one is more likely to learn a skill if one first learns to enjoy the process of acquiring it. C: Personal charm is often confused with virtue. Thus, while there is nothing wrong with befriending a charming person, anyone who does so should realize that a charming friend is not necessarily a good and loyal friend.

If these snakes ate more righthanded snails over time, this would have given lefthanded snails an evolutionary advantage over righthanded snails, with the left handed snails eventually becoming a new species. Thus, the snakes' asymmetrical jaws probably helped drive the emergence of the lefthanded snail species. Which of the following would, if true, most strengthen the argument that asymmetrical snake jaws helped drive lefthanded snail evolution? A: Anatomical differences prevent lefthanded snails from mating easily with righthanded snails.

The government of Suwathia argues that the one means of application of metarhiziafrom an airplanewill require a great amount of the fungus, which is difficult to acquire. Given that the locusts propagate rapidly, the government maintains that only a complete annihilation of a locust swarm will have the desired effect. Which of the following, if true, best argues in favor of the multinational company's plan to drop metarhizium over locust swarms? A: Some swarms of locust can cover over 100, 000 square miles. B: If all of the locusts are not destroyed, Suwathia will lose millions of acres of crops. C: Only one metarhiziainfected locust is necessary to lead to the demise of an entire swarm, since metarhizia can easily spread within a swarm.

Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above? A: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff 's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.
