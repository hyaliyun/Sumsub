Ground pepper is produced from the dried berries of the Piper nigrum plant, native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. Although Vietnam is the largest producer, other countries like India, Brazil, and Indonesia also contribute to the global pepper market. After harvesting, the berries are dried and then ground to create the ground pepper we use in our everyday cooking.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.  Kevin and his cousin Darlene both enjoy jogging for exercise. One day, Kevin goes out for a jog in his local neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is quite high, and he begins to sweat a lot and starts to feel a bit dizzy. On the same day, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low and she feels perfectly normal as she continues to jog.  Who is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency? Answer:","output":"Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency. This conclusion is based on a number of factors detailed in the scenario. Firstly, jogging in hot conditions can lead to increased perspiration as the body tries to cool itself down. This particularly applies to Kevin, who is said to be sweating a lot due to his jog in high heat. Sweating is the body's way of cooling down, but it also leads to the loss of water and electrolytes from the body. Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electrical charge, and they are vital for several bodily functions such as maintaining water balance, nerve function, muscle contractions, and pH balance. They include minerals such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. When these electrolytes are lost through sweat and not adequately replaced, that can lead to electrolyte deficiency or imbalance. Excessive electrolyte loss due to sweating can be potentially life-threatening as stated in the scenario, leading to symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, dizziness, muscle weakness, and increased heart rate. The fact that Kevin starts to feel dizzy might be an early symptom of electrolyte deficiency, as dizziness is commonly associated with such a condition. On the other hand, Darlene is jogging in a cooler environment where the heat outside is low. This means that her body is likely sweating less and therefore losing fewer electrolytes compared to Kevin. She doesn't exhibit any symptoms of electrolyte deficiency and feels perfectly normal, suggesting she's maintaining an adequate balance of electrolytes. It's worth noting though, even if the odds are lower, Darlene isn't immune from experiencing electrolyte deficiency. In many respects, the likelihood of experiencing electrolyte deficiency depends on factors like the intensity and duration of the exercise, the specific individual's health condition, and the adequacy of hydration and electrolyte replenishment.  But based on the provided information, it can be concluded that Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency due to excessive sweating caused by jogging in high heat. He should stop exercising immediately, seek shade, hydrate, and consider consuming a sports drink that can quickly restore electrolytes. If his dizziness or other potential symptoms persist, he should seek medical attention.  This can serve as a reminder of the importance of staying adequately hydrated and maintaining electrolyte balance while exercising, especially in hot conditions. Precautionary steps such as adjusting the workout time to cooler parts of the day, wearing appropriate clothing, gradually acclimating to the heat, and proper hydration can be effective ways to prevent electrolyte deficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of the word \\"flabbergasting\\" suggests that the young actors' performance in the movie \\"E.T.\\" are impressive, extraordinary, and quite unexpected considering their young age. This implies an admiration towards the young principal actors - Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Thomas - for their outstanding contributions to the film. 2.

Which team had fewer runners with muscle weakness? Answer:","output":"The Green team had fewer runners with muscle weakness. They ran the same distance as the Red team, but they did so in the cool morning weather. Cooler temperatures are generally more favorable for exercise, because they reduce the risk of excessive sweating and the subsequent loss of electrolytes. Lower rates of electrolyte deficiency can result in fewer incidences of health problems such as muscle weakness, as compared to the Red team who ran in the heat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: It is common for a person who feels fearful to be anxious about uncertain outcomes. This is a struggle because no situation can promise 100% certainty. Therefore, you must learn to become more comfortable with it. Uncertainty is an unavoidable part of your day-to-day life. How you respond to it is where you can make a change.  One method would be to act “as if” you are comfortable with uncertainty. First, examine the things you do to avoid uncertainty just to feel more certain. Write down your answers to the following questions: Do you double and triple-check most of the things you do? Do you avoid events or procrastinate a lot? Do you need excessive amounts of reassurance from others? Do you need an abundance of information before making even small decisions? Next, identify the situations in which you feel anxious about uncertainty, and what you do to feel less anxious. Rank the situations on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest level of anxiety, and 1 being the lowest. Next, start with the least anxiety-provoking activity and practice acting “as if” you were tolerant of uncertainty. For example, you could go to a movie without checking the crime rate in the area. Finally, keep a written record of your results. Ask yourself what you did, whether it was harder or easier than anticipated, whether everything turned out well, and how you adapted if it didn’t turn out as you had planned. Writing these things down will help you see the improvements you make and the way to change your behavior. You are stronger than you think. You will continue to improve your coping skills as you successfully deal with challenges. For example, take notice of the way you effectively cope with another type of fear in your life and apply the same technique. Also, observe how someone you admire copes with difficult situations. Ask them for suggestions that you can implement.  Following a problem solving model will provide you a structure for creating change. You have identified your fear and associated emotions and now you must determine clear objectives, implement them, make adjustments as needed and monitor your progress.  One objective may be that you set a schedule and keep a log of how much time you spend worrying about making it safely to school, work or the store. Self-monitoring leads to real change. You can examine your behaviors and develop ways to change them. It is important to keep the information you hear from others and the media in perspective. If you inundate yourself with negative thoughts and information, it will skew your perception of reality.  Pause and think clearly and you will realize that the chances of the same crime happening again or even at all, are minuscule. When you're tempted to believe that the chances of getting murdered are increasing, stop and ask yourself something like: Are they really? And why do I think that? Are those facts credible? Taking the time to question your thoughts can break the cycle of being obsessed with them. Personal struggles can leave you feeling bad about yourself. Unfortunately, since feeling fearful involves worrying, you may be worrying that you are worrying too much. Anxiety and worry are a natural part of life, and you can learn to manage it rather than try to eliminate it or feel bad about yourself because of it. The cognitive behavior therapy you may be participating in will help you examine your thoughts and develop new, more effective ways of thinking about yourself as well as helping you manage anxiety and worry. Inhibitions are feelings that make you self-conscious and unable to act in a relaxed and natural way. In order to let go of what is holding you back you must feel safe with yourself, your surroundings and the people around you.  Let go by rediscovering your playful side. As they say: laughter is the best medicine. When you play and laugh it increases feelings of freedom, which allows you to feel less anxious and worried. Play and laughter will help you remain positive and optimistic through difficult situations and has been shown to be healing.  Schedule regular sessions of play on the calendar: meet with friends; play with children; host events that you enjoy; go with a friend to play golf, or bowl or sing karaoke. Most importantly, surround yourself with playful people.

Do any other animals feel empathy? Scientists recently found that rats  do, too. Most people don't like rats. In many people's eyes, rats are only bad. But Jean Decety and his partners at the University of Chicago did an experiment. It showed that rats are kind, warm-hearted animals. They can feel each other's pain. Scientists placed pairs of rats in plastic cages  for two weeks. During this time they got to know each other. Then they put one of the rats from each pair into a small container  in the cages. The small container had a door. It was so designed as to fall to the side when the free rat touched it. Many of the trapped  rats squeaked  to show their discomfort. The other rats of the pairs could see their suffering  friends clearly. In most pairs, the free rats would become very worried about their friends. They kept trying to save their friends again and again throughout the month. Scientists put the rats' favorite chocolate in the cages, but the rats didn't eat it until they had saved their friends successfully. Scientists also found that female rats seemed to act more empathetic than male rats. \\"The results are the first to show that rats take action in response to another's trouble,\\" Decety said. \\"Monkeys and chimpanzees have similar behavior. But unlike those animals, rats can be ready used in laboratory studies. They will help us to learn which parts of the brain lead to empathy and helping behavior and whether empathy is natural.\\" Question: What does the passage mainly tell us? - Rats can feel other animals' pain. - Chocolate is rats' favorite food. - Rats are empathetic and can feel each other's pain. - Female rats are more empathetic than male rats.

Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &...

During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.  Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.","output":"The full names of the people who wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear are U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews and Sergeant Allen Isaac."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An aristocrat is fighting her neighbour's plans to build a vast cinema and games room underneath their £3.6m home in an exclusive street in north London. Pamela, Countess Listowel, 77, says rows over people digging 'mega-basements' beneath their homes are dividing the usually friendly community in a conservation area in Hampstead, where dozens have signed a petition against the application. She is one of 58 people to have objected to Camden council over the application by Iyabode Abiola to undertake extensive excavations beneath her Victorian house. Lady Listowel is one of dozens of locals objecting to a proposed basement in the smart north London street (file picture) Architects' plans submitted to Camden Council show the scale of the planned basement at Mrs Abiola's house. Lady Listowel, the widow of the 5th Earl of Listowel, William Francis Hare, said: 'It is sad that there is a row over the application as everyone usually gets on around here. 'These sorts of basements are being built all over Hampstead, but it's a conservation area and it's not in keeping with the street.' Mrs Abiola bought the house, which is close to Hampstead Heath, three years ago.  Neighbours said the owners, whom they believed to be Nigerian, owned several properties in the UK and were not often at the house. An initial application featured plans to build a swimming pool under the house but was rejected by Camden Council in 2011.  The new plans incorporate a basement that would extend under the house and into the garden. Neighbour Oliver Froment, 63, said he was concerned his house might collapse if Mrs Abiola's basement were built, and said it had happened in several similar cases in Hampstead. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'People are just trying to show off by building bigger and deeper, with no consideration for the character of the area or the people who live there.' Mrs Abiola's £3.6m house is in an expensive street in a conservation area near Hampstead Heath, pictured. Mr Froment, who works in financial services, has hired an independent expert who said he was concerned about the impact of the proposed works. Camden Council's Valerie Leach said: 'It is essential that the views of residents are taken into account and at present we have received a number of objections and reports that are being reviewed to ensure that planning officers can make a recommendation on the application.' Rows over vast basements are becoming increasingly common in London, where space is at a premium. Last month it emerged that a Labour peer was suing his neighbour for 'trespass' over his newly-dug basement, claiming that it went underneath his own property. Lord Mitchell claimed his Hampstead neighbour Daphne Gillian Singer had undertaken 'hidden' works by digging up a courtyard next to both of their homes.  He and his wife have lodged a writ at the High Court and are seeking up to £200,000 in damages after Ms Singer allegedly built walls beneath his property without consent. Russian tycoon Leonard Blavatnik boasts London's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool under his Kensington home. Earlier this year a Russian businessman renovated his mansion in London's Kensington to include a pool in the basement which is believed to be the capital's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool. Leonard Blavatnik, who is Britain's second-richest man, built the 25m pool underneath his home in Kensington Palace Gardens, which is London's most expensive street.  His basement also boasts a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine-cellar, and 'multi-storey' underground car park. Estate agents said Mr Blavatnik's property, which is yards from Kensington Palace, could be worth £200m after the tycoon undertook a massive renovation on the 13-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article focuses on a dispute in north London, involving Pamela, the Countess Listowel, and her neighbour's plans to build an extensive basement beneath their £3.6 million home. The Countess, one of 58 objectors to the scheme, has raised concerns over the impact of the proposed 'mega-basement' in the conservation area of Hampstead, warning that this and similar excavations are causing significant discord in what she describes as an otherwise friendly community.  The plans, pitched to Camden council by the house's owner, Iyabode Abiola, entail vast excavations to create a cinema and games room under her Victorian residence. Abiola had previously proposed an underground swimming pool, but that was declined by the council back in 2011. The present plans include an extension under the house and into the garden, which has fuelled anxieties over potential structural damage to neighbouring houses. One such neighbour, Oliver Froment, has hired an independent expert to investigate these concerns.  The property, near Hampstead Heath, was bought by Mrs. Abiola three years ago. Neighbours have commented that the primary owners, thought to be Nigerian, have several UK properties and are rarely at this specific house. Proposals for 'mega-basements' have become increasingly common in London, due to the lack of space combined with the desire for larger and more indulgent homes.  The article also highlights that this is not an isolated incident, pointing out a complaint made by Lord Mitchell against his Hampstead neighbour for 'trespass,' as a new basement intruded under his property. Writs have been lodged in the High Court for over £200,000 in damages in this case.  The piece concludes with the story of Russian tycoon Leonard Blavatnik's unique basement renovation, which included London's only known indoor/outdoor swimming pool in his Kensington Palace Gardens home. The posh property also features a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine cellar, and a 'multi-storey' underground car park. The renovation is estimated to have increased the property's value to approximately £200m.  In summation, the dispute in Hampstead signifies a wider concern over the trend of 'mega-basements' in London's upscale neighbourhoods, with many residents seeing them as a threat to architectural integrity and community peace. The local authorities stress the importance of considering residents' objections and keeping the historical and aesthetic value of the conservation area intact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies? , can you please find it?   Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

What is the proper response to having your butt slapped by a stranger in public? How can I make my father stop slapping my butt? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The proper response to having your butt slapped by a stranger in public: Step 1: Regain composure and assess the situation without escalating it. It's important not to overreact but to remain calm and collected. Step 2: Clearly and firmly tell the person that their behavior is inappropriate and unwanted. This might be enough to put an end to the behavior and make them think twice before doing it to someone else. Step 3: If the person continues to be a threat or harass you, consider calling for help or alerting someone nearby. Your safety is the top priority. Step 4: After the situation has been resolved or you have left the vicinity, consider reporting the incident to law enforcement or the establishment's management, depending on the location. How can I make my father stop slapping my butt? Step 1: Find an appropriate time and place to discuss the issue privately with your father. Avoid addressing this in public or when either of you is upset or emotional. Step 2: Clearly and calmly express your feelings, and explain why you don't want your father to continue this behavior. Be honest and share any discomfort or negative emotions it causes you. Step 3: Offer alternatives for ways your father can show affection, support, or playful interaction without invading your personal boundaries. Step 4: Be prepared to maintain your stance, even if your father initially resists or dismisses your concerns. Remain calm and assertive, and reiterate your request as needed. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, the two questions do not have the same meaning.

Steak at the Heart of Capitalism The Wall Street Journal published an article with the words \\"Meat Casino\\" in the headline this week, so at first I just naturally assumed it was a profile of one of Chipotle's suppliers.But it's really about price volatility in the live-cattle futures market. As far as literary criticism, the only gripe I have with this piece on the Meat Casino is that the phrase \\"high-steaks bets\\" is nowhere to be found. It makes one wonder if they left their brains in their other cargo shorts over at the Journal. Anyway, as you can see below, volatility in futures markets makes the Meat Casino as wild as it was during the financial crisis: Price swings in the cattle futures market have some calling it the Meat Casino Note: Historical volatility shows annualized standard deviation of price changes for the 20 and 100 most recent trading days. Compared, for example, with a stock market, where the current volatility makes the action look less like a casino and more like bingo night at the retirement home: Suppressed volatility in the S&P 500 has some worried of a calm before the storm Note: Historical volatility shows annualized standard deviation of price changes for the 20 and 100 most recent trading days. And a spike in prices over recent years should catch the attention of beef eaters everywhere: Front-month live cattle futures are almost 36 percent below their peak two years ago If you've read anything about markets in the past few years, you probably already know where people who have a beef with these price swings are pointing fingers: those flashy boys in the electronic trading world. The Meat Casino is entirely an electronic affair now. CME Group closed all the remaining pits last year, severely limiting the available opportunities for traders to wear cool cowhide print sportcoats. But the machines had taken over almost all the trading long before that. In addition to all the big banks, the list of the electronic casino's blackjack dealers is dotted with the legends of the electronic pits, from Jump Trading to Dorman to KCG to Timber Hill.Yet it's hard to picture the Chicago pits as some sort of victim of the shift to electronic trading because they were also some of the main spawning grounds of the new breed of data-center outcriers, as chronicled in this great Matt Leising obit of the pits from last year. In fact, Jump was named in honor of the jumping around that traders did in the open outcry pits.Anyway, if there's one thing I love, it's a story about \\"the pits,\\" even if they are now just a bunch of stacks of computer servers in a data center, not the mosh pits of capitalism made famous in movies like \\"Trading Places.\\" Mainly, for some reason, I like stories about trading in commodities I can eat. (Another recent such article was Whitney McFerron's scoop that the U.S. was sitting on a \\"mountain of cheese.\\" Maybe it's just the suburban Philadelphian in me, but I can't help but think that if we moved the Meat Casino next to Cheese Mountain, we'd only be some Amoroso's rolls and fried onions away from the Promised Land.)So with price swings this meaty, the Trade of the Week obviously is doubling down on the steak at the heart of capitalism in the Meat Casino. The runner-up award goes to Eve Plum, aka Jan Brady, who USA Today tells us sold the 55,000 Malibu dream house she bought during the great Brady Bunch bubble of 1969 for a cool 3.9 million. On the back of my envelope, that gives her a compounded annual growth rate of about 9.5 percent, and that's just the sort of middle-sister index-like return that's trendy these days.

Question: Given the following context:  Since 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, intended as a call to action against discrimination against women.  A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London, Ontario, in the wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing \\"the idea of men giving up their arms.\\" Commemorative demonstrations are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built. The Place du 6-Décembre-1989 in the Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation Nef pour quatorze reines (Nave for Fourteen Queens) by Rose-Marie Goulet. It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6.A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to \\"all women murdered by men\\", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers. As a result, women involved in the project ironically received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might \\"antagonize\\" other groups.The event has also been commemorated through references in television, theatre, and popular music.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the goal of the partition?\\" is in \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948.

Brett does not believe in owning guns, while Eric does, so","output":"their conversations about gun control have always been impassioned and thought-provoking. Both Brett and Eric grew up in rural areas and were exposed to firearms at a young age. However, their experiences and beliefs regarding gun ownership have diverged significantly over the years.  Brett, a firm believer in non-violence, had negative experiences involving guns in his youth that fostered a deep dislike for firearms. When he was twelve, a close friend was accidentally shot during a hunting trip, leaving a lasting impression upon him. As he grew older, his conviction only strengthened that guns should not be in the hands of civilians. Brett advocates for stricter gun control laws, mandatory background checks, and comprehensive regulations on firearm sales. He believes that reducing the number of guns in circulation will create safer communities overall. Eric, on the other hand, grew up in a family that embraced gun ownership and the Second Amendment. His parents taught him responsible firearm use and safety practice from a young age. Eric believes that owning a gun is a fundamental right, as long as individuals can demonstrate responsible use and understanding of firearm safety. He also thinks that gun ownership provides protection against potential threats and contributes to self-sufficiency. To Eric, responsible law-abiding citizens should not have to sacrifice their rights due to the actions of criminals and those who misuse firearms. Despite their stark differences in opinion, Brett and Eric maintain a respectful dialogue on the topic of gun control. They both understand that open communication and exchange of ideas are essential for reaching a common ground. One day, they decided to organize a public forum in their local community center, inviting other residents to join the discussion. This platform allowed them to engage with various perspectives, deepening their understanding of the complexities surrounding gun control. During the forum, they invited experts and representatives from both sides of the debate. Some shared personal anecdotes illustrating the dangers of unregulated gun ownership, while others explained how firearms have saved lives during emergencies. The event highlighted the importance of mental health support, those who might be prone to violence, and the need for effective law enforcement. As the forum progressed, both Brett and Eric recognized that the issue of gun control is not a one-dimensional problem. They acknowledged that any solution to this multifaceted issue must consider several factors, including the culture, geography, socio-economic environment, and personal experiences of those involved. The forum marked a significant moment for them as they began to empathize with each other's perspectives. While Brett and Eric remain staunch in their initial beliefs, their conversations have evolved over time. Now, they focus on exploring potential avenues to achieve the same goal: ensuring that their communities are safe and secure. Both agree that although they may continue to disagree on aspects of gun control, it is crucial to work together as they strive to find common ground in the best interest of everyone. Their journey reflects the importance of keeping an open mind and engaging in constructive conversation when dealing with divisive issues. Brett and Eric may not have changed each other's core beliefs regarding gun ownership, but they have fostered an environment where opposing views can be shared and understood. Their story reminds us that despite our differences, civil discourse and mutual respect are the bedrock of a healthy and functioning society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery - They process it with millions of tiny nephrons - Remove all the waste - The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery - Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more teenagers become adults happens, how will it affect more urine is passed to the bladder.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned is based on the assumption that a higher number of teenagers becoming adults would potentially lead to an increase in urine production and transfer to the bladder. It's important to first understand the factors affecting urine production to determine if the proposed perturbation has any direct or indirect influence on the kidney's processes. Urine production and its transfer to the bladder are primarily influenced by factors such as fluid intake, diet, overall health, and kidney function, rather than age transition from teenage to adulthood. While it's possible that certain lifestyle changes may accompany the transition from adolescence to adulthood, these changes may not directly affect urine production or the process of urine being passed to the bladder. That being said, it is important to highlight that in general, as teenagers become adults, they may experience changes in their bodies due to growth and development. This may lead to an increase in total body mass, which could require the kidneys to filter a larger volume of blood per unit time. However, this increase would not be solely driven by the transition but other factors like growth, diet, and lifestyle. Additionally, it's worth noting that any effect on urine production due to life-stage transitions would occur on an individual basis. Since personal habits, lifestyle, and health conditions may vary across different individuals, it may not be appropriate to make generalizations about urine production as teenagers become adults.  In conclusion, the proposed perturbation hypothesis does not have a clear direct or indirect effect on urine production and its transfer to the bladder. Factors like fluid intake, diet, overall health, and kidney function play a more significant role in determining urine production and transfer than the age transition from teenage to adulthood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Iterate through each inner list in the input list.     For example, the first inner list is [1, 27, -50, 12]. Step 3: Initialize a variable \\"product\\" with the value of 1 for each inner list. This variable will store the multiplications of odd integers. Step 4: Check if the length of the inner list is 0 or contains only even numbers. If yes, append 0 to the \\"output\\" list and move on to the next inner list.     In our example, the first inner list has odd numbers, so we won't append 0. Step 5: Iterate through each integer in the inner list. Check if the integer is odd or not. If it's odd, multiply \\"product\\" by the integer.     In our example, the odd integers are 1 and 27, so the \\"product\\" will be 1*1*27 = 27. Step 6: After iterating through all integers in the inner list, append the \\"product\\" to the \\"output\\" list.     Our \\"output\\" list starts with [27] as a result of the first inner list.

Ocular melanoma is an extremely rare form of cancer, usually found in just six of every one million people. But it has been identified in a group of 18 patients in Huntersville, North Carolina, and in a second group in Auburn, Alabama, some of whom were friends who'd attended Auburn University together.      Juleigh Green was diagnosed first: at age 27, she saw odd flashes of light.      Juleigh Green was diagnosed with ocular melanoma. Subsequently, two of her friends from Auburn University were diagnosed with the same rare cancer. CBS News      \\"He said, 'There's a mass there, there's something there, I don't know what it is, but it looks like it could be, you know, a tumor,'\\" Green said. \\"It's like you had the breath knocked out of you, you know?\\"      In 2001, it was her college friend Allison Allred, 31 at the time. \\"I was just seeing some mild flashes of light for, say, 7 to 10 days,\\" Allred said.      A doctor told her she had a detached retina, but then, \\"He said, 'Well, it's detached because there's a 10-millimeter melanoma sitting on it.'\\"      Both women had to have an eye removed. Then their friend Ashley McCrary found black spots in her iris. It was the same rare cancer.      \\"What's crazy is literally standing there, I was like, 'Well, I know two people who've had this cancer,\\" said McCrary.      \\"And did you understand then how strange that was?\\" asked CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.      \\"No. No, I didn't.\\"      Ocular melanoma, usually found in just six of every one million people, has been identified in patients from Huntersville, N.C., and in a group of former Auburn University students. CBS News      Strange enough that she mentioned it to Dr. Marlana Orloff, the oncologist treating her at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.      \\"Most people don't know anyone with this disease,\\" said Dr. Orloff. \\"We said, 'OK, these girls were in this location, they were all definitively diagnosed with this very rare cancer – what's going on?'\\"      Dr. Orloff and her colleagues are now studying these patients, many of whom travel to Philadelphia for treatment. Another Auburn grad, Lori Lee, kept her eye, but the cancer metastasized to her liver. She now travels from Alabama to Philadelphia every six weeks, to be treated in a clinical trial.      Dr. Marlana Orloff examines Lori Lee at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. CBS News      \\"This is a rare cancer, so it's not like you can just go anywhere and have anybody know anything really about it,\\" Lee said.      There is no known cure. Allison Allred's cancer has recurred nine times in six places in her body.      \\"Two days ago found out that it's come back to my brain,\\" Allred said, \\"So, I'm actually gonna have radiation on my brain tomorrow.\\"      Werner asked, \\"How do you sit there with a smile, given everything that you've been through?\\"      \\"It's totally the Lord – totally the Lord that has carried us through, every step of it.\\"      Werner said, \\"The other thing that's kind of touchy is that people think of what happened to the three of you as a disfiguring injury.\\"      \\"That was very hard for me,\\" McCrary replied. \\"Growing up, the one thing that I liked about myself was my eyes.\\"      But their own struggles motivated them to help find other cancer victims. McCrary started a Facebook page. So far, she says, 36 people have responded saying they, too, attended Auburn University and have been diagnosed with ocular melanoma.      \\"We believe that when we're looking at what's going on in Huntersville, North Carolina, and what's going on here, there is something that potentially links us together,\\" she said.      \\"Until we get more research into this, then we're not gonna get anywhere. We've got to have it so that we can start linking all of them together to try to find a cause, and then one day, hopefully, a cure,\\" said Lee.      Auburn University officials say they are hopeful that research and awareness will advance the prevention and treatment of this cancer. The Alabama Department of Health believes \\"it would be premature to determine that a cancer cluster exists in the area.\\"      If you would like more information visit the Auburn Ocular Melanoma Facebook page. ||||| Researchers still don’t know what is causing cases of a rare eye cancer in Huntersville. This comes after a year-long study tracking where 23 patients in northern Mecklenburg County lived, worked and went to school.      Uveal melanoma patients aren’t just students at Hopewell High School or residents of Huntersville. A geospatial study of the eyes of cancer patients in a northern part of Mecklenburg County found that a group of patients lived close to the border of Huntersville and Cornelius. Beyond this, scientist John Cassels didn’t find other patterns.      “Nothing directly attributed to the cause of Uveal melanoma at this time,\\" he said.      Huntersville commissioned Cassels to compare environmental issues like water, air and sites with chemicals near where the patients lived to see if there were any risk factors. Over the last several years, 23 people who at one time lived in Mecklenburg County have been diagnosed with the disease. Many of them young women. The disease affects about 2,500 people a year in the U.S. - many of them are older.      >>Stay informed: Sign up for The Frequency newsletter and get WFAE headlines in your inbox every weekday.<<      In 2015, the state looked into the Mecklenburg County cases and found the incidence of uveal melanoma wasn’t higher than expected. But that hasn’t deterred Kenny Colbert from trying to figure out what is going on. His daughter Kenan fought the disease for five years, but died at the age of 28 in 2014. He said that even though he's disappointed in the results, he's not surprised.      “This just means we need to regroup and I don’t know what Plan B is,\\" Colbert said. \\"But this means we need to go to Plan B and Plan C and Plan D because the answer is out there somewhere if we keep digging.\\"      Genetic testing ruled out a familial link. Doctors at Columbia University will be testing tumors of diagnosed patients. Huntersville town commissioners suggested starting a committee to continue researching the unusual cancer cases. Multiple cases of the same type of rare eye cancer were found in Auburn, Alabama, and Colbert thinks the two towns should work together to see if there are any links. ||||| Ocular melanoma, an extremely rare form of eye cancer, is being disproportionately diagnosed among young women in two Southern towns. Doctors do not know why these cases are confined to these cities, and efforts to raise funding to better study the mystery have so far been unsuccessful.      In Auburn, Alabama, with about 60,000 residents, the only common trend between the 33 known cases of ocular melanoma is that every individual either lived or worked in the city between 1980 and the early 1990s, Healthline reported Monday. Of these, 31 were former students at Auburn University, a Facebook page on the phenomena reported.      In Huntersville, North Carolina, with about 54,000 residents, the only connection in another 18 cases is having lived, worked or spent a large amount of time in the town since 2000.      There are more cases of ocular melanoma in Alabama than any other U.S. state, WLTZ reported. Doctors do not believe the cases are a coincidence.      Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images      According to the National Institute of Health, ocular melanoma is a type of cancer that affects eye cells, beginning in the middle layer of the eye called the uvea. It is more common in older individuals and those with fairer skin tones and blue or green eyes. Signs of the condition include blurred vision, seeing floaters in your eyes or developing dark spots on the iris. The condition is also more common in men than women.      Related: Why elephants don’t get cancer—and what that means for humans      See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows      But in the Southern cases, most of the patients are women, and they are typically younger in age.      In February, Alabama Senator Larry Stutts attempted to get 100,000 in state funding to back research into the eye cancer cluster. The proposal was denied. Auburn University, the alma mater of many of the current patients, also refused to fund research into the cluster, WLTZ reported. The university, however, will lead a committee to find out why so many people associated with Auburn have been diagnosed with the cancer.      Despite the recent setbacks in funding, there are other measures being taken to help identify why this problem is affecting so many Alabama and North Carolina residents. An ongoing study at Columbia University in New York is analyzing tissue from patients who have died or lost an eye to the cancer, The Charlotte Observer reported. Meanwhile, a state backed analysis is mapping patients’ entire lives in an attempt to find similarities.      Carolinas HealthCare Systems has also offered free genetic counseling to residents in Huntersville to see if there is a genetic predisposition to the disease. ||||| Ocular melanoma, also known as uveal melanoma, is a very rare type of cancer. Each year, only 2,500 people — or about 5 in 1 million — receive a diagnosis with this type of eye cancer.      That statistic is exactly why two small towns — Huntersville, North Carolina, and Auburn, Alabama — are such anomalies. Both towns are associated with a high number of ocular melanoma (OM) cases. Researchers want to know why.      “We see patients from all over the country and some patients from outside of the country. Certainly if we have patients who know each other or who lived and grew up in the same town, that has been kind of a red flag for us in trying to figure out if there’s something else going on,” said Dr. Marlana Orloff, an oncologist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia who specializes in the treatment and study of OM.      Take Auburn, for example. The town of 63,000 people is in a state of just under 5 million people. It’s home to one of Alabama’s largest universities, Auburn University.      Thirty-three people with connections to the town or university have received diagnoses of OM. The main common thread between them seems to be that they all lived or worked in the town between 1980 and the early 1990s.      Huntersville, a small town north of Charlotte, is slightly smaller, with a population of almost 55,000. But 18 people who lived, worked, or spent substantial amounts of time in the town since 2000 have received diagnoses of OM.      As the number of cases continues to grow in these areas, so does the interest in people who’ve developed the cancer — and, perhaps more importantly, what they all have in common.      What is ocular melanoma?      According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, OM is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults. The cancer develops in the cells that produce the eye’s pigment. It can also develop on the conjunctiva, the mucus membrane that cover the eye and line the eyelid.      Most eye melanomas develop in a part of the eye you can’t see. The early stages of the cancer rarely cause any signs or symptoms. That’s why you might not be able to spot this type of melanoma the way you might a freckle or unusual mole on your skin.      However, people may spot warning signs of the cancer as it grows. Symptoms of OM include blurry or distorted vision, a blind spot in your vision, seeing “flashing” lights, or a dark spot in your field of vision.      As the cancer progresses, you may notice that the shape of your pupil changes. A dark spot or “freckle” may develop on the iris.      “Sometimes it will get picked up on a routine eye exam. Other times, patients will be having symptoms, often symptoms of a retinal detachment,” Orloff said. “They go to an eye doctor, they get referred to a retinal specialist, and then ultimately to an ocular oncologist who makes the diagnosis.”      Ocular Melanoma Foundation statistics identify 55 years of age as the median age for an OM diagnosis.      Those two facts alone make the cases in Huntersville and Auburn even more unique.      In both towns, women have received diagnoses more frequently, Orloff says, and all of the individuals with OM have been younger, well below the median age of a typical diagnosis.      Social networks spread awareness      In 2001, Allyson Allred, an Auburn University graduate living in Hoover, Alabama, received an OM diagnosis. A year earlier, she told AL.com, Allred was sent a prayer request for an Auburn alum — and a woman who had lived in the same dorm as she during their freshman and sophomore years at the school — who had been diagnosed with this same rare cancer.      When Allred received her diagnosis, she reached out to the woman, and they connected over the shared diagnosis.      Eleven years later, in 2012, another woman with connections to Auburn and the same dorm joined their circle.      While these three women bonded and helped one another through the ups and downs of the disease, across town and unbeknownst to them, another Auburn alum was fighting his own OM battle.      Mark McWilliams, a 1994 and 1995 graduate of Auburn University, received a diagnosis of OM in 2011 at the age of 38. The Birmingham, Alabama, architect started experiencing vision problems in his right eye and went for an exam. That’s when his doctors discovered the cancer.      “He had some sort of wave or distortion in his vision,” said Susan McWilliams, Mark McWilliams’ wife. The couple, who met as part of a supper club, started dating after his initial diagnosis. “He knew there was something weird about the vision in the right eye. We were all just stunned.”      McWilliams was referred to Wills Eye Hospital and Dr. Takami Sato, director of the metastatic uveal melanoma program at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, both in Philadelphia. Orloff joined Sato after McWilliams was a patient.      Under Sato’s treatment, McWilliams received plaque radiation, the standard treatment for this type of cancer.      A few short months later, doctors told him the cancer was gone. However, they also warned him — and genetic tests confirmed — the likelihood of recurrence was high.      “Most of the treatments are very effective at preventing the tumor from coming back in the eye,” Orloff said. “But what we see is there’s a good portion for patients who may recur with disease notably in their liver at some point down the line.”      According to research from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, half of all people with OM ultimately develop metastatic cancer and find new lesions in their body outside of the eye.      Indeed, McWilliams found new cancerous spots on his liver, a year and a half after his first diagnosis.      “We were going along, fighting it, and the whole family was doing research on it,” Susan said. “If we hadn’t had the doctors in Philadelphia, he might not have lived six months. We fought very hard for a few more years of life.”      McWilliams died due to OM in 2014. Since his death, Mark’s parents, as well as Susan, have been involved with OM awareness groups. They hope to help patients and families learn about the cancer, including meeting with people from Auburn who may be impacted by the same disease that took Mark.      “It seems like this is the thing they have in common,” Susan said. “It seems like that very much, but of course, they all came from different places, have now gone to different places. The higher the numbers get, really, it seems uncanny.”      Orloff understands that concern. “If you have a bunch of people who went to the same university over a relatively short period of time, it would be abnormal for a lot of leukemia cases,” she said. “When you’re talking about more common cancers like breast cancer or lung cancer, they’re certainly more common, but when you’re talking about a rare cancer, it certainly raises a red flag.”      Research holds the keys to understanding      Orloff says Auburn and Huntersville are the only two towns or locations where researchers have found an increased incidence, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t more.      “Just because of the rare nature of the disease, you wouldn’t expect people to know five or six people within their small group of friends who have this disease,” she said.      That’s in part why she and other OM organizations are working to raise awareness — and funds — for research.      Last April, Huntersville received a 100,000 grant from the North Carolina state legislature to begin studying possible causes of OM. Dr. Michael Brennan, a retired ophthalmologist in nearby Burlington, is helping spearhead the group. He works closely with the University of North Carolina, Duke University, and both Orloff and Sato at Jefferson in Philadelphia, according to The Charlotte Observer.      The group’s first target for research was environmental exposures and genetic traits. Findings from these studies are set to be released this summer.      As word about the Auburn University-related group spread north, some of these researchers also ventured down to meet with concerned former alumni, parents, and others.      At their first meeting in February of this year, the researchers recorded information for people they met. They cast a wide net to hopefully discover more people who may have been impacted by this cancer but left the city or school years ago.      “These cases aren’t always picked up accurately [by a cancer registry], especially because people are often diagnosed outside of the state,” Orloff said. “In Auburn and in North Carolina, it was a lot of younger women. They went to high school or college there. They could now be living somewhere else. For the sake of the cancer registry, although these people lived in the state for that narrow window of time, they weren’t diagnosed there, so they’d fall out of the calculation.”      That, Orloff says, is a big target they’re aiming to correct. It begins with getting the word out about the rare cancer and the possible connections to these two small towns.      Last month, an Alabama state senator requested 100,000 so research could begin for the Auburn-related cases, but the funding was denied.      However, that’s not stopping Dr. Fred Kam, the executive medical director of Auburn University Medical Clinic. Kam was instrumental in bringing researchers from North Carolina and Philadelphia to the town. He’s also helping establish a committee to investigate and lobby for funding.      “The committee’s initial goal will be to lobby for and apply to reputable national entities, such as the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], NIH [National Institutes of Health], or National Cancer Institute, to fund and be involved in a study looking for a cause if we have an increased incidence,” Kam said.      “We also hope to bring knowledge and expertise in scientifically approaching and helping obtain answers to questions this cohort of people may have, from genetics to environment, causation, treatment, and prevention,” he said.      Both groups have a presence on social media, which has helped several new cases come to their attention. In fact, the Auburn Ocular Melanoma Page on Facebook helped the group connect to more than a dozen individuals with the rare cancer just after going live in early 2018.      The Huntersville Ocular Melanoma Cancer Cluster page on Facebook also shares updates and relevant information for people with OM and those interested in learning more.      For now, Kam says, people with a connection to the university or anyone worried about their potential risk for OM should continue to have routine eye exams. ||||| Efforts Underway to Find Research Funding for Auburn University Ocular Melanoma Cases      Share This Story:      Twitter      Facebook      Linkedin      More      1/1 Courtesy: Auburn Ocular Melanoma FB page      We shared the story of Ashley McCrary. An Auburn University graduate who was diagnosed with a rare eye cancer, Ocular Melanoma.      Doctors from Philadelphia and North Carolina came to Auburn in February to see if there’s a connection.      Since then, 31 people have come forward, who attended or worked at Auburn University, from 1980 to the early 1990s, diagnosed with Ocular Melanoma.      There are also more cases of Ocular Melanoma in Alabama than any other state in the United States.      Now, they are trying to find some funding to do research on the rare eye cancer.      It first started at the state level. Alabama State Senator Larry Stutts tried to pass 100,000 through the education budget.      The legislature failed to approve the money.      They suggested Auburn University to take it on. They will not be funding it as well.      Senator Stutts said he’s not going to give up on this and make sure the University follows through.      “My efforts in the State Senate is to make sure the issue doesn’t get pushed to the back burner and legitimate research is conducted and there will be the funding to do so. I met with representatives from Auburn University last week and I’m confident they will step up and ensure this goes through,” said Sen. Stutts.      Dr. Frederick Kam, Executive Medical Director of Auburn University’s Medical Clinic, said he’ll lead a committee to find out why so many people in Auburn were diagnosed.      “This is not a good type of cancer for a person to have. There’s no known cause, which makes it more challenging. So, I strongly believe and Auburn University strongly believes we need to be involved and help with the process because it’s the right thing to do and we will continue to pursue those efforts,” said Dr. Kam.      They are in the process of forming a committee of physicians interested and knowledgeable about this cancer from UAB, to Philadelphia, even doctors at the state level, to North Carolina and here locally.      “Then they are going to see when were these people here, what did they major in, where did they live, where did the work and then go forward from there,” said McCrary, who was diagnosed with Ocular Melanoma in 2012.      McCrary will also be on this committee.      “I think it’s gonna save lives and I hope we can find out information for treatment or a cure. It’s humbling to be a part of this and make a difference,” said McCrary.      McCrary adds they are also working with Justin George, Alabama’s Director of Cancer Epidemiology.      From there, they are going to see if the State Health Department, the Governor’s office, the CDC, National Cancer Institute or another entity will fund this research.      “There’s no reason to cause any fear because we don’t know. We don’t know if there’s any causal factor for this type of cancer from the number of people that went to Auburn University, we don’t know. But, we want to help find out and if something did cause it let’s fix it. Let’s do something to make sure this doesn’t affect anyone else,” said McCrary.      They are confident that the information they gather and the committee working on this, will finally bring some answers and the money they need to start the research.      “I have a lot of confidence in the people who will join this committee and that it won’t fall through the cracks. We will get the funding we need. We just need to find out who it’s going to come from,” said McCrary.      There are also studies going on in Huntersville, North Carolina and Albany, New York. Two other areas with high numbers of Ocular Melanoma. North Carolina has dedicated 100,000 to research the cases there. ||||| Jasmine H. Francis, MD, FACS*      Alexander N. Shoushtari, MD**      Christopher A. Barker, MD***      David H. Abramson, MD, FACS*      *Ophthalmic Oncology Service      **Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service      ***Radiation Oncology      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center      New York, NY      Uveal melanoma, the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, represents approximately 5 percent of all melanomas recorded in the United States. The incidence of uveal melanoma has remained relatively constant, between five and six cases per million people in the United States and Europe.1 These melanomas vary in frequency depending on their location in the uveal tract: Approximately 5 percent occur in the iris, 5 percent in the ciliary body and at least 90 percent in the choroid. Choroidal, also called ciliochoroidal, melanoma, is the predominant form of the disease in the uveal tract, and the themes to be discussed here primarily concern that form of the disease.      Uveal melanoma is most common among middle-aged Caucasians of European descent. Unlike cutaneous melanomas, uveal melanomas have no known association with ultraviolet (UV) light; nor is smoking believed to be a risk factor. However, we do know several obscure and controversial risk factors for the disease, including exposure to welding and use of L-dopa. Furthermore, the literature documents possible associations with melanosis oculi, neurofibromatosis, dysplastic nevus syndrome, myotonic dystrophy and BRCA-associated protein-1 (BAP-1) hereditary cancer syndrome.2      Females are typically diagnosed on routine ophthalmic exam, while males commonly present with visual symptoms and are subsequently found to have uveal melanoma. We can diagnose the disease clinically with a high degree of accuracy, so it does not warrant biopsy for diagnosis. Nonetheless, many centers perform biopsies to help determine prognosis based on molecular analysis of the tumor.      Prognosis and Genetics      Although 97 to 98 percent of patients with uveal melanoma have no evidence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and though the success rate for local treatment surpasses 90 percent, half of all patients ultimately develop metastatic disease. For this reason, there is great interest in narrowing in on prognosis for primary intraocular melanoma in patients with different risk profiles. This can be achieved with a limited degree of certainty. For instance, older and male patients are considered at higher risk for metastases. Uveal melanomas can also be divided by size, e.g., into small, medium and large, as was done by the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study; increasing size portends a higher risk for developing metastases. Finally, tumors occurring in the ciliary body or with extraocular extension have a poorer prognosis.      For tumors with adequate specimen (typically those that are enucleated), metastatic risk can be established with histopathological findings. For instance, epithelioid versus spindle cells are considered poorer prognosis. High mitotic index, increased lymphatic invasion and a diffuse infiltrating pattern are also considered higher-risk. Furthermore, microvascular networks or vasculogenic mimicry patterns have been identified in tumors with higher metastatic potential.3      Cytogenetics can further refine risk assessment for uveal melanoma.4 Many chromosomal and copy number alterations have been determined, including those on chromosomes 1, 6 and 8. Perhaps the most profound chromosomal alteration associated with poor prognosis in uveal melanoma is either a partial or complete loss of chromosome 3. This was confirmed with the discovery of somatic BAP1 mutations on the short arm of chromosome 3, which are present in the majority of higher-risk uveal melanomas.5      It has been theorized that BAP1 is essential for the preservation of melanocyte identity in uveal melanoma, and that depletion of BAP1 results in uveal melanomas assuming a stem-like cell phenotype. Unlike with cutaneous melanoma, the genetic aberrations in uveal melanoma are comparatively bland. Other mutations besides BAP1 mutations do exist and confer either a neutral or a relatively better prognosis. For instance, guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Q polypeptide (GNAQ) or alpha 11 (GNA11) encodes a G-protein alpha-subunit that mediates signals from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.6 Somatic mutations, most often mutually exclusive in either codon 183 or 209 of GNAQ or GNA11, have been revealed in a number of melanocytic neoplasms, including over 85 percent of uveal melanomas.      Finally, about 15 percent of uveal melanomas are believed to have somatic mutations in SF3B1 and EIF1AX.7,8 An overwhelming majority of these mutations occur in disomy 3 tumors compared to monosomy 3 tumors and with a male patient predominance; these are associated with favorable prognostic features and better diagnosis. At the level of ribonucleic acids, a gene expression profile generated from only a few tumor cells can differentiate uveal melanoma into three classes: class Ia with a low risk of metastasis, class Ib with a risk of late metastasis and class II with a higher risk of metastasis.9 mRNA expression of PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) may be a prognostic biomarker for seemingly lower-risk tumors (class 1 or disomy 3).      Regardless of the prognostication method, the dichotomous theory of risk we have outlined here has its limitations and does not fully consider clonal heterogeneity nor clonal evolution of an individual tumor.      Treatment of Primary Uveal Melanoma      The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) was a multicenter randomized clinical trial with patient accrual spanning over a decade (1987 to 1998), and it has guided our present management of primary uveal melanoma.10 It revealed that small melanomas (<2.5/3.0 mm height, <16 mm diameter) could be managed with observation and were associated with a 5-year melanoma-specific mortality of 1 percent. Medium melanomas (2.5/3.0-10 mm height, <16 mm diameter) had equivalent melanoma-specific mortality if treated with either plaque brachytherapy or enucleation (complete removal of the eye), thus making either treatment option reasonable.11 Large melanomas (>10 mm height, >16 mm diameter) had equivalent melanoma-specific mortality if treated with enucleation either with or without preoperative external beam radiation (EBR); thus, preoperative EBR has since fallen out of favor.12      Our group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was the largest center in the COMS, and we led the trial of selumetinib (a targeted oral MEK inhibitor), the first study ever to demonstrate a benefit (in progression-free survival) for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma.17 Our center and others offer integrated programs utilizing the following treatments:      Radiation Therapy      Radiation therapy (RT) has been used to treat uveal melanoma since 1930.13 Today, approximately 75 to 85 percent of uveal melanomas are treated with radiotherapy, primarily in two forms: plaque brachytherapy and proton beam radiotherapy (teletherapy). Brachytherapy is more common, and refers to the application of a radioactive source near the tumor: The advantage is that the radiation is physically brought directly to the melanoma, and does not traverse healthy tissues and organs, thus enabling delivery of high-dose radiation to the tumor while limiting side effects. We attach the radioactive source to a shielding device (“plaque”) and secure it to the sclera during a surgical procedure; this stays in place for several days (3 to 7) while we deliver the desired dose of radiation (70-100 Gy). Teletherapy refers to the projection of radiation through space as a beam. Multiple photon beams produced by a linear accelerator or fixed radioactive sources can be directed to converge at the tumor in a procedure called “stereotactic radiosurgery.” Alternatively, a charged particle beam (particle teletherapy) can be directed at the tumor. The advantage of teletherapy is that tumors of any size or location are accessible. The total dose of radiation delivered during teletherapy may be divided into several “fractions” (usually 4 to 10) to maximize the therapeutic index of treatment.      Several important randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effect of RT for uveal melanoma. A study of 1,317 patients comparing enucleation of the eye to plaque brachytherapy in patients with medium-sized uveal melanoma found no difference in metastasis-free or overall survival.11 Local tumor recurrence occurred in 10 percent of the RT patients. Another study compared particle teletherapy to plaque brachytherapy, and reported higher rates of local control with the former, but found no difference in cause-specific or overall survival.14 In another study, based on the hypothesis that surgical manipulation of “large” uveal melanomas at the time of enucleation fostered metastatic spread, researchers undertook a controlled trial of 1,003 patients randomized to either neoadjuvant pre-enucleation teletherapy or no preoperative treatment. This study found no difference in metastasis-free or overall survival in patients receiving RT before surgery.12      In many instances, and using a variety of techniques, RT allows for effective destruction of the primary tumor, while preserving the eye and vision. Nevertheless, eye damage after RT is common, and important efforts are under way or planned to mitigate these effects through technique refinement and biologic modulation. A randomized study of two different radiation doses of teletherapy suggested that lower doses may produce fewer side effects and comparable cancer control rates.15 We need similar prospective studies of brachytherapy. As most long-term side effects of radiation are related to vascular and immunologic effects, we need to study the use of agents that modulate these processes. Early and ongoing studies suggest that agents such as bevacizumab and corticosteroids may be beneficial, but further study is necessary.      Enucleation      Enucleation had been the standard of care for uveal melanoma since the latter part of the 19th century. Following the results of COMS, this treatment method is now predominantly performed on large melanomas, while patients with medium tumors have a choice of two treatments that are identical for patient survival. An enucleation involves removing the globe (or eye) and optic nerve and retaining the surrounding orbital adnexal tissue (extraocular muscles, orbital fat, periosteum, cranial nerves, etc.). During the surgery, the six extraocular muscles are detached from the globe and the optic nerve is severed near its exit at the optic foramen. Once the eye is removed, a spherical orbital implant replaces it (various materials are available), and the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule are closed over this. Based on the surgical technique used, we may attach the extraocular muscles to the implant. A conformer, similar to a thick contact lens, is placed in the intrapalpebral fissure (the space between the eyelids) during the immediate postoperative period. Approximately four weeks after the surgery, we replace the conformer with a custom-made prosthesis, which is designed to cosmetically emulate the fellow normal eye. The prosthesis has optimal cosmesis in primary gaze, but may not move to the same degree as the fellow eye, particularly in extreme gazes.      Other Treatments      Less commonly used treatments for primary intraocular melanoma include local resection of the tumor, often combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. Lasers can also be used, possibly with dye or agent-enhancement, but this treatment is restricted by tumor size and location.      Current Treatment of Metastatic Uveal Melanoma      Historically, median overall survival (OS) for metastatic uveal melanoma has been estimated to be 6 to 12 months. More recent analyses have reported longer median OS of 17 to 20 months.16 In contrast to the recent OS benefits achieved with therapies for metastatic cutaneous melanoma, no prospective randomized trial of therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma has ever demonstrated an improvement in OS. The increases in reported median OS may be due to lead-time bias from active surveillance programs utilizing modern radiographic techniques.      The recommended frontline approach for treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma remains clinical trial participation. The only systemic therapy to date that has shown efficacy in a randomized trial was the MEK inhibitor selumetinib, which improved PFS compared to investigator’s choice chemotherapy (HR: 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.71; p < .001).17 The phase 3 registration trial randomized patients to dacarbazine with or without selumetinib. Unfortunately, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of improved PFS by blinded central radiology review.18 Given that there was no pure selumetinib arm, this trial could not confirm that MEK inhibition alone improves outcomes in metastatic UM, and it did not appear to improve PFS in conjunction with chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the trial serves as a model for future collaboration and proves that the timely completion of randomized, multinational trials is possible with this rare disease.

The world's most famous social media company's plummeting share price (from 38 on its first trading day to 19 today) is an indicator that we are not in a bubble, as investors refuse to buy into the temptation to blow tech offerings out of proportion. You know you are in a bubble when stocks soar regardless of intrinsic quality. Far from it, the current market is one of Dickensian realism: the best of times and the worst of times. Apple's value has soared because it has a clear and wildly profitable strategy. Facebook, Groupon and Zynga sank because their strategies are unconvincing. Put another way, companies with solid revenue models are richly rewarded while companies foolish enough to go public before proving their model are punished. There is a difference between using Facebook and loving","output":"Facebook – and this distinction is becoming increasingly important as investors and users alike begin to recognize the inherent strengths and weaknesses of various tech companies. Facebook as a service has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we connect, communicate, and share information, but its significant user base does not automatically equate to a successful, sustainable business model. The challenges faced by Facebook in recent years, coupled with the scrutiny it has attracted, reveal some much-needed lessons for the tech industry. Primarily, the focus must shift from simply acquiring users to transforming these users into a reliable revenue stream. With over 2.7 billion active users, Facebook is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. However, its numerous controversies surrounding privacy issues, data breaches, and political manipulation have contributed to a growing sense of distrust among users, questioning the very foundation on which the platform relies. While advertising has been Facebook's primary source of income, recent global policy changes and user backlash against intrusive advertising methods have shaken the company's ability to rely solely on this revenue model. In light of these challenges, Facebook, as well as other tech companies, needs to reassess its strategy and consider innovative alternatives for generating income. For instance, the increasing popularity of e-commerce and digital transactions could provide opportunities for social media platforms to further monetize their services. Furthermore, the contrasting trajectories of Apple and Facebook are indicative of the need for businesses to continually invest in research and development. Apple has managed to stay ahead of the curve, with a suite of innovative products and a clear vision of customer needs. Facebook's struggle to redefine itself reflects the harsh reality that companies rooted in social interactions have a harder time adapting to a rapidly changing landscape. The fluctuating fortunes of tech giants like Facebook clearly demonstrate that a company cannot rely on its past achievements or popularity to guarantee future success. To maintain investor confidence and market relevance, a strong, adaptable, and well-defined business strategy is essential. Moreover, the stark consequences of failing to provide a substantive revenue model serve as a warning to young tech firms aspiring to go public: do not underestimate the importance of solid financial foundations and a proven track record. In an era of extreme market volatility and skepticism, Facebook's woes serve as a reminder that the tech industry is no longer a playground for reckless, unprofitable ventures. To succeed in this age of Dickensian realism, companies must reevaluate their strategies, prioritize innovation, and embrace adaptability. Only then can they hope to navigate the precarious balance between public sentiment and shareholder expectations and emerge victorious in the ever-evolving technological landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The dietary alphabet is a way of referring to the various diets, eating habits, and nutritional approaches that are popular and prevalent in today's society, particularly among health-conscious individuals. These diets are often categorized by the first letter of their name or the primary food categories they focus on. Some examples of these diets are: A - Atkins Diet: A low-carbohydrate diet that emphasizes high protein and fat intake while limiting carbohydrates, especially from sugar, bread, and pasta. The main goal of the Atkins diet is to allow the body to burn stored fat for energy instead of relying on carbohydrates. B - Blood Type Diet: This diet suggests that individuals should eat foods and engage in exercise that are compatible with their blood type to achieve better health and weight management. For example, Type O individuals are encouraged to consume lean meats, fish, and vegetables and avoid grains, legumes, and dairy products. C - Clean Eating: Clean eating is not a specific diet plan but a general approach to choosing minimally processed, whole foods, and focusing on consuming fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. The goal is to improve overall health, energy levels, and maintain a healthy weight. D - DASH Diet: The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is a balanced eating plan that aims to help lower high blood pressure and promote heart health. It emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products while minimizing processed foods, saturated fat, and sodium intake. E - Elimination Diet: An elimination diet involves removing specific foods from your diet for a certain period to identify food sensitivities, allergies, or intolerances. This process helps you understand how your body reacts to certain ingredients and can lead you to make informed dietary choices to support better health and overall well-being. F - FODMAP Diet: The FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet is designed for individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or other digestive disorders. It involves limiting foods that contain fermentable carbohydrates known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, and other IBS symptoms. G - Gluten-Free Diet: A gluten-free diet is essential for people diagnosed with celiac disease or those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. This diet eliminates gluten-containing foods, including wheat, barley, and rye, and usually replaces them with gluten-free alternatives made from rice, potato, or other gluten-free grains. H - High-Protein Diet: A high-protein diet focuses on consuming more protein to increase metabolism, build strength, and support muscle growth. Such diets include lean meats, fish, dairy products, legumes, and protein powders as staple components. I - Intermittent Fasting: Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that involves alternating periods of fasting and eating. This can be done in various ways, such as the 16/8 method (fasting for 16 hours and eating in an 8-hour window) or alternate-day fasting. The goal of intermittent fasting is generally improved metabolic health, weight loss, and cellular regeneration. These are just some examples of the dietary alphabet, which includes a wide range of diets and eating patterns to cater to different people's preferences and health needs. Each diet has its own set of guidelines, advantages, and disadvantages, making it crucial to understand them fully and consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or specific nutritional requirements. Whichever diet you choose, a healthy, balanced approach to nutrition, combined with regular physical activity, is the key to achieving and maintaining optimal health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: CINCINNATI (AP) — The family of a drunken man picked up by Ohio police officers and dropped off at a Taco Bell before he was fatally struck by a car has sued over his death, accusing authorities of racial discrimination and putting their loved one in danger as part of a \\"perverse joke\\" about his Mexican heritage.      The family of 22-year-old Uriel Juarez-Popoca filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Delaware County Sheriff's Office, several of the agency's deputies and an officer with the Ohio State Highway Patrol on Jan. 8. It seeks unspecified damages.      An attorney for the patrolman said the discrimination allegations are ludicrous and that the officers gave Juarez-Popoca \\"a major break\\" by letting him go, especially considering that his legal status in the country was in question.      The Cincinnati lawyer representing Juarez-Popoca's family, prominent civil-rights attorney Al Gerhardstein, said that proceeds from any settlement in the lawsuit or a jury trial would go to the wife, two children and parents of Juarez-Popoca, who live just south of Mexico City and had become financially dependent on remittance checks they received from Juarez-Popoca, who worked various jobs.      Gerhardstein declined to comment on whether Juarez-Popoca was living legally in the U.S.      It's undisputed that on the night of July 28, 2012, Juarez-Popoca was driving drunk on Interstate 71 in Sunbury, about 25 miles north of Columbus, when he pulled over in a grass median.      Deputies responding to calls about a possible drunk driver found Juarez-Popoca, who spoke very little English, sitting inside his truck, clearly intoxicated.      At that point, the lawsuit says that the deputies should have followed standard protocol and given Juarez-Popoca a blood-alcohol test, and then either detained him or turned him over to a family member or friend pending charges.      Instead, they dropped him off at a Taco Bell restaurant about 5 miles away.      Soon after, Juarez-Popoca was killed by a car while walking along a nearby four-lane highway.      \\"This stands out as a truly outrageous failure by local law enforcement to do their basic duty of holding people safely,\\" Gerhardstein told The Associated Press. \\"It's just a really sick joke. A tragic joke.\\"      Police said at the time that they dropped Juarez-Popoca off at the Taco Bell expecting him to call for a ride.      The lawsuit says that deputies placed Juarez-Popoca in obvious danger by leaving him at the fast-food restaurant along a highway and failed to take proper action after receiving numerous calls about him from the store manager and drivers along the highway during a 50-minute period.      Sam Shamansky, the attorney representing the Ohio state patrolman named in the lawsuit, said that Juarez-Popoca's death was a tragedy but that authorities were not discriminating against him.      \\"There's no discrimination here,\\" he said. \\"If you ask me, it could just as easily be said that deputies were giving him a major break by not taking him to jail, maybe in order to not have discriminatory actions taken against him, vis-a-vis deportation. As an observer trying to be independent, I would suggest that's way more plausible than that they were discriminating against him because he's Hispanic.\\"      Two deputies, Christopher Hughes and Derek Beggs, were fired over the matter. Patrolman Sean Carpenter also was fired but won an appeal of that decision and was reinstated.      All three were charged criminally in the matter, with various outcomes.      A jury found Beggs guilty of dereliction of duty and he was fined 500. A jury also found Carpenter guilty of dereliction of duty but that was overturned by an appeals court, which found that \\"no rational trier of fact could have found that (he) acted negligently.\\"      Hughes pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of failure to assist a law enforcement officer and was ordered to pay 20.      An attorney for Hughes and Beggs did not return a call for comment.      In letters firing the two deputies, Delaware County Sheriff Russ Martin wrote that they had showed \\"a lack of maturity and professionalism.\\"      \\"A fundamental duty as a law enforcement officer should be the preservation of life and inherent in that is the obligation to put a citizen in a better place than where he or she was found — even if that place is in custody for their own safety or the safety of others,\\" Martin wrote.      ___      Follow Amanda Lee Myers on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AmandaLeeAP ||||| DELAWARE, Ohio — A State Highway Patrol trooper who was fired after failing to arrest a drunken driver during a stop on I-71 will get his job back, an arbitrator has ruled.      The trooper, Sean Carpenter, also will be paid for part of the time he was out of work.      Carpenter, 39, was fired in April for conduct unbecoming an officer and for failing to perform his duty after a July 2012 incident involving a drunken driver in Delaware County.      Carpenter and two Delaware County deputy sheriffs found the driver, Uriel Juarez Popoca, on July 28 on an I-71 median near the Rts. 36/37 interchange. Popoca, 22, spoke Spanish and understood little English. The officers can be heard making fun of his speech in footage from their dashboard cameras.      The officers took Popoca to a Taco Bell on Rts. 36/37, joking that someone there would understand him. Popoca left the restaurant shortly after being dropped there and was struck and killed by a passing driver.      Carpenter was convicted of being derelict in his duty because he did not arrest the man; an appellate court threw out his conviction in August, ruling that Carpenter was not responsible for Popoca because the two deputies were in charge of the scene.      Staff Lt. Anne Ralston said the patrol has not determined when Carpenter will return to work. According to the arbitration award, Carpenter will lose six months’ pay but will be paid for at least two of the months that he was out of work. Carpenter, who had been assigned to the Delaware post, earned 56,403 a year before he was fired.      The two deputies involved in Popoca’s case — Derek Beggs and Christopher Hughes — were fired from the Delaware County sheriff’s office in February. Beggs also was convicted of dereliction of duty; Hughes was convicted of failing to aid a law-enforcement officer. The same appellate court upheld Beggs’ conviction.      Tracy Whited, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office, said the office is finishing negotiations with the two former deputies but that neither will get his job back.

Can we infer the following? Perón would have been elected a third time if not for the coup.","output":"It is difficult to definitively infer that Juan Domingo Perón would have been elected a third time if not for the coup that overthrew him in September 1955. While it is true that Perón had significant popular support and had previously been elected twice to the presidency, there are numerous factors that could have influenced the outcome of a hypothetical third election. To make an informed inference, let's explore Perón's political career, the context of his second term, and the circumstances surrounding the 1955 coup. Juan Domingo Perón was a charismatic and influential figure in Argentine politics. As a leader, he focused on social justice, labor rights, and nationalization of industries, which gained him the support of the working class. His policies and political ideology became known as \\"Peronism,\\" which remains an important political force in Argentina to this day. During his first two terms as president (1946-1955), Perón implemented numerous social and economic reforms, which further consolidated his power and popularity. Some of these policies included the nationalization of railways, the central bank, and public utilities, as well as the expansion of social welfare programs and workers' rights. These measures garnered significant support from the working class, who saw Perón as a champion of their interests. However, Perón's second term was met with increasing opposition and economic challenges. His administration faced accusations of authoritarianism, censorship, and persecution of political opponents. Additionally, the economy began to falter due to high inflation, a growing fiscal deficit, and a deteriorating balance of payments. These factors contributed to a loss of confidence in Perón's government among various sectors of society. The coup that ousted Perón in September 1955 was led by a coalition of military and civil factions, which included both conservative and liberal elements who opposed Perón's policies and his perceived authoritarianism. This opposition was strong enough to overthrow his government, suggesting that the political climate in Argentina was quite different from the environment that had previously facilitated his electoral victories. Given this context, it would be speculative to assume that Perón would have been elected for a third term had the coup not occurred. While his previous electoral successes and popularity among the working class indicate that he could have potentially mounted a successful campaign, the significant opposition he faced during his second term and the factors contributing to his ousting suggest that a third victory would not have been guaranteed. Ultimately, the hypothetical outcome of a third election involving Perón can only be speculated upon, as the complex interplay of political, social, and economic factors at the time makes it impossible to confidently infer that Perón would have won in the absence of the coup."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Brad and Kate  for the following movie plot:  The movie opens in a bar near Christmas, where a geeky Brad (Vince Vaughn) tries to hit on a confident and bitchy Kate (Reese Witherspoon), who blows him off...until she's called a bitch.

The armed group, considered terrorists by many, has led a campaign for Basque independence that resulted in more than 820 deaths over the past 40 years. After previous statements by the Spanish government that it will not negotiate with the group unless it renounces violence, ETA issued a video declaring its intent \\"to put in motion a democratic process.\\" The group will no longer \\"carry out armed actions\\" as it campaigns for independence, three representatives say in the video. Leading members of the group have been arrested recently as more Basque political parties have called for a ceasefire. This is ETA's third ceasefire; the previous two were eventually abandoned. The BBC has excerpts from the video here. Article:","output":"Title: Basque Separatist Group ETA Announces Historic Ceasefire Introduction The Basque separatist group ETA has announced a ceasefire, according to a report by the BBC. The group, which has been trying to achieve Basque independence for four decades, has been linked with more than 820 deaths and is widely considered a terrorist organization. Following prior statements by the Spanish government that it would not negotiate with ETA unless it renounced violence, the group has now issued a video in which it declares its intent \\"to put in motion a democratic process.\\" ETA's new commitment entails that it will no longer \\"carry out armed actions\\" while it campaigns for independence. This announcement follows a wave of recent arrests of leading ETA members and increased calls for a ceasefire by other Basque political parties. Although this is ETA's third ceasefire, the previous two were abandoned over time. Background of ETA The Basque separatist group ETA, which stands for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna or Basque Country and Freedom, was founded in 1959 and has been linked to numerous bombings and assassinations, including assassinations of politicians and members of the Spanish police force. The group's primary goal is to create an independent Basque state in the northern regions of Spain and France, which have distinct cultural and linguistic identities. Over the years, ETA's attacks have been met with widespread condemnation and retaliatory action by Spanish and French security forces. Previous Ceasefires This is not the first time the ETA has announced a ceasefire. In 1998, the group declared a ceasefire that lasted for 14 months but broke down after negotiations with the Spanish government failed to reach any conclusive agreements. The second ceasefire came in 2006, when ETA announced it would stop carrying out \\"armed actions\\" but resumed attacks just months later, following the collapse of peace talks with the Spanish government. The Current Ceasefire The latest ETA ceasefire announcement comes in a video featuring three unnamed representatives of the group, at least one of whom is wearing a traditional Basque beret. In the video, the group states that it intends \\"to put in motion a democratic process\\" and will no longer \\"carry out armed actions\\" as it campaigns for independence. The timing of the announcement is significant, as it follows increased domestic and international pressure on ETA, as well as a series of successful law enforcement operations that have resulted in the arrest of many of its leading members. In addition, more Basque political parties have called for a ceasefire, effectively isolating ETA's reliance on violence as a means to achieve its goals. Reactions and Implications The Spanish government has not yet officially reacted to the latest ETA ceasefire announcement, but previous statements have reaffirmed the government's position that it will not negotiate with the group unless it renounces violence. If the Spanish government perceives the current ceasefire as a genuine commitment to peace, it could potentially lead to new negotiations between ETA and the Spanish authorities, although the prospects of any such talks remain uncertain. Conclusion The current ceasefire announcement by ETA represents a potentially significant development in the long and bloody history of the Basque independence struggle. However, given the abandonment of the two previous ceasefires and the fact that the most recent announcement does not include any details regarding disarmament or a definitive end to the group's activities, many observers are likely to remain cautious in their assessment of the situation. Regardless, the current development may serve as a small step towards a more peaceful and democratic approach to achieving Basque independence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:We demonstrated previously that striatal adenosine modulates ethanol-induced motor incoordination (EIMI) via adenosine A1 receptors coupled to pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive G protein and adenylyl cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Additionally, intrastriatal (IST) PT antagonizes EIMI and its potentiation by the adenosine A1 agonist N-cyclohexyladenosine; it also inhibits cAMP concentration.', 'Guide cannulas were stereotaxically implanted for IST pretreatment with PT followed 5 days later by IST of N-cyclohexyladenosine and intraperitoneal ethanol. The adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation reaction involved PT-catalyzed [P]nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) labeling of rat striatal membranes. Antagonism of EIMI (Rotorod method) after IST microinfusion of PT was investigated to determine whether it was due to a decrease in the functional activity of G proteins due to ADP ribosylation of the Gialpha subunit caused it.', 'Striatal membranes from IST PT (0.5 microg)-treated animals exhibited significantly attenuated (up to 90%) in vitro ADP ribosylation with [P]NAD. Striatal membranes from animals injected with ethanol (1.5 g/kg intraperitoneally) exhibited statistically significant increase (11%) in in vitro ADP ribosylation. Similarly, ethanol (50 mM) added to striatal membranes from untreated animals produced significant stimulation of in vitro ADP ribosylation. The decrease in the functional activity of G proteins due to ADP ribosylation of the Gialpha subunit after IST PT was functionally correlated with marked attenuation in EIMI, as observed previously. This finding suggests a blockade of functional activity of PT-sensitive striatal Gi/Go proteins (i.e., fewer available sites for labeled NAD incorporation). The in vivo ethanol results indicate that it must have caused an increase in the ribosylation capacity of Gialpha in vivo (i.e., increased Gi activity). Increased ADP ribosylation by in vitro ethanol increases Gi/Go activity, consistent with EIMI, as previously reported. Solution:","output":"Question: What was the observed effect of intrastriatal pertussis toxin treatment on adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation in rat striatal membranes and its correlation to ethanol-induced motor incoordination (EIMI)?

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the attack that Terry Nichols helped plan, and for which he is serving life in prison without parole? from the following article ?  Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish.  Question: suppose more conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more global warming occurs.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"Conservation efforts, if implemented more, can indeed help in reducing global warming to some extent.  1. Carbon Dioxide reduction: Conservation practices such as reducing fossil fuel usage (like coal, oil, gasoline), can decrease the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat in earth's atmosphere and contributes to global warming. 2. Restoring the Carbon Cycle: By conserving forests which act as carbon sinks (they absorb more carbon dioxide than they emit), we can help restore the balance of the carbon cycle. Trees absorb CO2 and release oxygen during photosynthesis, thus reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. 3. Protection of Ozone Layer: In terms of conservation, reducing the usage of harmful chemicals like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) in aerosol products, air conditioning systems, and refrigeration can reduce damage to the ozone layer as these chemicals are known to break ozone molecules. A healthier ozone layer means less harmful solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, contributing to less warming. 4. Decrease in Acid Rain: Conservation practices such as reducing the burning of coal and oil, which release sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (precursors to acid rain), can decrease the incidence of acid rain. This helps keep the pH level of rainwater closer to a natural level, reducing harm to forests and aquatic life. Therefore, we can say that such conservation efforts can have a substantial effect in mitigating global warming and its effects. There may still be some degree of warming due to existing levels of greenhouse gases, but the rate and severity of future warming can be lessened with strong global conservation practices.

Please write a short summary for the following article: What happens when your pregnant sister-in-law is paralyzed in an accident - and has no insurance. MIT political scientist Andrea Campbell is known for her research on Social Security, Medicare, and other safety-net policies. Yet when Campbell’s pregnant sister-in-law suffered a spinal cord injury, their family’s on-the-ground experience was more bewildering and difficult than Campbell expected. Her new book describes these experiences. Below is an edited and condensed transcript of our conversation. Harold Pollack: Let’s start with the accident at the core of this book. Andrea Campbell: My sister-in-law Marcella Wagner married my brother, Dave Campbell, in 2010. In 2012, she entered nursing school. That February, she was on the highway and got cut off by another driver who swerved in front of her. Her car rolled over, crushing the roof. She had a spinal cord injury, and is paralyzed from the chest down. She has to use a wheelchair. She needs round-the-clock medical help. For example, she has to be catheterized every four or five hours or so. Fortunately, she didn't have any brain damage. She can speak perfectly fine, but she has very little use of her hands, no fine-motor control. She can control her arms to some extent, but that's the extent of her physical capabilities at this time. My nephew was born by emergency c-section. He seems to have been unscathed by the accident, even though he was born a bit premature. HP: She was uninsured when she had this accident. AC: That's right. My brother works for a very small metal fabrication firm that makes parts for small airplanes and houseboats. That firm's never offered health insurance. She did have insurance coverage for the pregnancy. In California, a program called AIM--Access for Infants and Mothers--provides health insurance to pregnant women whose incomes are too high for Medi-Cal—California’s Medicaid program--and who don't have access to employer-provided insurance. It would cover the pregnancy and 60 days postpartum. She and my brother knew that the baby would be covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), as well. They knew that my brother would continue to lack coverage, under any circumstance really. She knew that after the AIM ran out, she could enroll in [her nursing school’s student health plan]. She had already filled out the paperwork when the accident happened. She and the baby would both have insurance. HP: If she had been insured, how do you think the story would be different? AC: That's a very good question. Let's say she had had insurance through the student health plan. That plan has a 20% co-payment. She was in the intensive care unit for a month and then in a rehabilitation hospital for 3 more months. It's likely they would have had to declare bankruptcy. There's also the issue of long-term supports and services. Beyond doctor and hospital visits, she needs help with personal care. Health insurance, whether it's private or public, doesn't cover long-term care. The main source for that is Medicaid, which is really the only public source of long-term care or long-term supports and services. HP: Your book notes that Medicaid is actually several different programs—programs that also operate quite differently across the fifty states… AC: In the process of writing the book, I would talk to disability activists in other states, and they would say: “Thank God they're in California. California is nirvana.” California's a progressive state that's really tried to do a lot, but its programs turn out to have significant limitations. About half the states, including California, have an asset cap for Medicaid eligibility. To be eligible for Marcella’s disability-related Medi-Cal benefits, David, Marcella, and their baby can only have assets that total 3,150, excluding their home and one vehicle. They had to liquidate all their assets after the accident to qualify for Medicaid. HP: How does it change her life that she can only have 3,150? AC: It's pretty scary. After the accident, she and my brother bought a used wheelchair van so that counts as their exempt vehicle, but my brother still needs another car to drive to work. The value of that car counts against the 3,150. He used to have a hobby of working on old cars. He had to sell all the old cars, but he kept a 1968 Datsun pickup. I learned how to drive in high school on a 1968 Datsun pickup. It was an old car thirty years ago. Now Dave is driving this old vehicle with no modern safety features – and he’s the only able-bodied adult in the household. It's also very hard to meet emergencies. At one point, the ramp mechanism on the wheelchair van stopped working. It had to be repaired. The labor and parts came to a few thousand dollars. That's nearly the sum of their asset limit. As it happened, their tax refund had come in from the previous year and they just sent it right back out again to pay for the wheelchair van repair. That's an example of the kind of emergency they might not be able to meet because of this asset limit. If they were to try to save for college using a 529 account, which is the main tax-favored fund available to parents, California would count that against their asset limit. So they're barred from doing that. HP: Can they have a 401(k) account for her retirement, or for his? AC: Marcella had previously worked at a bank, where she’d opened a 401(k). Such accounts count against the asset limit. So she had to liquidate it. She's under 59½. So she had to pay an early enrollment penalty, as well. HP: Many people, including me, hope that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will protect people who experience catastrophic illness or injury. ACA has done much good. It hasn't helped Marcella as much as we hoped. AC: That's right. Let's imagine ACA had been in place so she and my brother had permanent health insurance. Much of her care in the ICU and then the rehabilitation hospital probably would have been covered. But then there's her need for long-term supports and services. ACA, [aside from the ill-fated and now-repealed CLASS Act], left that whole set of needs largely untouched…. Medicaid does cover many things Marcella needs that private health insurance typically wouldn’t cover, like catheters, even a wheelchair. Medicaid covers things that Medicare won’t, or that Medicare will cover only with a 20% copay. HP: People can’t do without Medicaid; it is the safety net for every other kind of insurance. Hopefully the harm imposed on Marcella and others by these asset tests will be politically generative. Have you gotten any reaction from policy makers about these issues? AC: I've been talking to folks at the New America Foundation who have been working on trying to get rid of asset limits, not only in Medicaid, but also in other means-tested programs. Some lawmakers may make new proposals on this after the election. A number of states have dropped Medicaid asset limits. The new ACA eligibility categories don't have asset limits. Policy seems to be headed in this direction. I would really like to see social insurance for long-term care and long-term supports and services, but that's a more difficult political goal. If you think about modest, achievable goals, eliminating asset tests is one. HP: There are some programs in California that might help Marcella. What's the state of things now? AC: There's one very attractive program, if we can figure out a way to get her into it. It’s called the California Working Disabled Program. A number of policies have been passed around the country to allow disabled people to earn income without losing their Medicaid eligibility. Right now, if you start to earn income, you could lose your eligibility and you probably don't have the type of health insurance you need on the other side. CWD allow you to work, and you can buy into Medi-Cal on a sliding scale. You pay a monthly premium which starts at 25 and can’t exceed 250. Any income the disabled person earns can be put aside in a savings account that does not count against the asset limit. That would be a way to build up an emergency fund. Earned income can also be saved in a retirement account, which doesn't count against the asset limit. HP: How do we know whether she can enter that program? AC: That's what's difficult. As I started researching CWD, I was very excited and told my brother about it. He said: “We've heard about it as well. A social worker already told us that she's not eligible.” At first, I thought that was just a mistake by the local social worker. It's not a very large or well-known program. Only 1% of all Medi-Cal patients are in CWD. Later on when I was talking to some state level officials who run CWD, they said: Yes, indeed, she is not eligible because she's in a “free” version of Medicaid that doesn’t charge a monthly premium. Program officials are barred from making her worse off. They're barred from shifting her from free Medicaid into a version of Medicaid that she has to pay for. The way she would have to get into CWD would be to leave free Medicaid, get a job, and then try to re-enter Medicaid and hope that there is no gap in coverage and that this all goes smoothly. My brother and sister-in-law are just petrified by the prospect of doing that. If something were to go wrong, and if she were to be left without insurance coverage even for a month, it could be devastating for them. HP: Your brother faces dramatic constraints on how much he can work or save because Marcella is on Medicaid. Strategically speaking, they’d be much better off if they got divorced or moved to a more generous state. AC: Sadly, the most logical move they could make is to get divorced. I don't know what would happen if they continued to live together (would a social worker look the other way? It’s unclear). There is the question of moving to a state with better policies. The difficulty there is no state will pay for home wheelchair renovations. Now, their home has been renovated to be accessible to her. It took friends and family two years to do the renovations, volunteering nights and weekends. They just finished this spring. Much of her care is performed by family members. She has a large family. No state funds 24-hour personal care assistance. If they were to move to another state, they would be leaving behind this network of friends and family that is very important to their everyday lives. Friends pick up my nephew from daycare several times a week when my sister-in-law is at rehab. They have relatives who do her care at certain times when Dave can't. It would be very difficult to pick up and leave all that behind. HP: Are there other countries that handle these problems better? AC: There are. Some countries provide long-term care, supports and services on a social insurance basis, rather than a means-tested basis. One difficulty with means-testing is that family members can't help. There's no way to top off public benefits. We see this, for example, with older people who go into nursing homes funded by Medicaid. A family might be able to chip in a bit more to move that parent or grandparent to a nicer nursing home, if they could just chip in a thousand or two more a month. They can't afford the whole bill but they could put that relative in a better situation. Medicaid rules prevent you from doing that. The advantage of social insurance is that families can help without penalty, and without the person losing their benefits. HP: How are you thinking differently about social and health policy, now that you and your family have lived through such a profound challenge? AC: I guess I never realized the limitations these programs place on people, how they trap people. If you think about how people who rely upon means-tested programs might better themselves, you realize the dilemma. People face closed doors or negative incentives at every turn. The American impulse to better oneself is really undercut for these folks. I didn't fully comprehend what that meant to people's everyday lives until this accident happened.

Death toll estimates based on confidential U.N. documents, U.N. sources. Sri Lankan government declared victory over Tamil separatists May 19. Article:","output":"Title: Civilian Death Toll Reaches Over 20,000 in Final Months of Sri Lanka Conflict, According to UK Paper The bloody conclusion to the Sri Lankan civil war saw more than 20,000 deaths in its final months, as revealed by a recent UK paper. The source claims that from April to May, over 1,000 civilians were killed each day as the Sri Lankan government fought to regain control from Tamil separatists. The staggering death toll estimates are based on confidential United Nations (U.N.) documents and information provided by U.N. sources. The 26-year-long civil war in Sri Lanka, which began in 1983, finally reached its climax on May 19, 2009, as the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the Tamil separatists. Throughout the conflict, the Tamil Tigers fought for an independent Tamil state in the northern and eastern parts of the island nation, while the government sought to maintain its rule over the entire country. As the battle raged in the final months, scores of civilians were caught in the crossfire. The chilling report from the UK paper indicates the extent of human suffering endured during this time. With more than 1,000 deaths occurring daily from April to May, the harrowing toll tragically demonstrates the heavy price many civilians had to pay in the final push to end the nearly three-decade conflict. In the aftermath of the war, questions remain as to how accurate the provided information is and whether the final death toll could be even higher. As the details are based on confidential U.N. documents and U.N. sources, it calls for further investigation and clarity on the situation. The end of the conflict undoubtedly brought a measure of relief and stability for the island nation. However, the startling revelations about the civilian death toll cast a long shadow over the victory and offer a somber reminder of the human cost of war."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: Both the FRAX and Garvan calculators are used to estimate absolute risk of fracture, but they sometimes produce different estimates. We sought to determine which patient characteristics contribute to these discrepancies.', 'Ten-year hip fracture risk was estimated for 122 women, using both FRAX and Garvan with bone mineral density (BMD).', 'Differences in estimates of hip fracture were assessed, both in absolute terms and with respect to a treatment threshold of 3%.', 'Garvan estimates were higher than FRAX estimates across the range of ages and BMDs studied. A history of falls or of multiple fractures increased risk calculated by Garvan 3-6-fold, but did not account for all differences between calculators. Discrepancies around a 3% treatment threshold occurred in 31/122 (25%). Women aged 70-74 years, and women with osteopenia were most likely to have discordant estimates. Most discordant estimates (29/31) had a Garvan estimate ≥ 3% and FRAXu2009<3%. Falls, multiple fractures, ethnicity and a history of parental hip fracture contributed to some discordant estimates.Question: Does reasons for discrepancies in hip fracture risk estimate using FRAX and Garvan calculators? Output:","output":"Yes, there are reasons for discrepancies in hip fracture risk estimates using FRAX and Garvan calculators. Some factors contributing to these discrepancies include a history of falls or multiple fractures, age (particularly women aged 70-74 years), women with osteopenia, ethnicity, and a history of parental hip fracture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Happy Gilmore Context: Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is an aspiring ice hockey player who possesses a powerful and dangerous slapshot that his father (Louis O'Donoghue) taught him as a child (Donnie MacMillan) before he was apparently struck and killed by a wayward hockey puck, though his over aggressive streak (which once resulted in him trying to stab a guy to death with an ice skate) and lack of skating talent consistently preclude him from joining a hockey team. His girlfriend Terry (Nancy McClure), a schoolteacher, leaves him because of his hockey obsession. His grandmother (Frances Bay) has not paid her taxes for many years. As such, she owes the IRS 270,000 in back taxes, and the house is about to be seized. Gilmore has only 90 days to come up with the money or else the house will be auctioned off. Grandma Gilmore is forced to temporarily move into a retirement home, run by a sadistic manager named Hal (Ben Stiller in an uncredited role). While repossessing Grandma's furniture, a pair of movers challenge Happy to hit golf balls. With his unorthodox, hockey slapshot-style swing, Happy hits the ball 400 yards three times, winning 40 as a result and starts hustling golfers with his swing at the driving range, leading former golf star and current club pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) to convince Happy to enter a local tournament for a chance to win \\"big bucks\\". Peterson is known for losing his right hand to an alligator during his career. Happy wins the tournament and earns a spot on the Pro Golf Tour, though Chubbs advises him to wait 6 months so he can improve Happy's performance. On the tour, Happy encounters Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who sees Happy as both a detriment to golf and a threat to his career. Although Happy has a powerful drive, his putting is terrible with violent outbursts and lack of golf etiquette.

A:","output":"It seems like you are referring to a hypothetical or fictional situation involving two characters named Casey and Ash, with Casey being Ash's mom. Since this is not based on any particular show, movie, or book, the circumstances and the outcome would depend on the narrative or storyline created around these characters. Given the situation you've described, it's clear that Casey cares for Ash, as she has fixed Ash's car for them. This action would enable Ash to have a mode of transportation available for daily use, traveling, exploring, or even pursuing goals and hobbies. As for what will happen to Ash, we can't predict the future or the actual narrative, but here are a few plausible scenarios, depending on the context: 1. If this narrative is part of a coming-of-age story, having a car could help Ash gain independence, learn responsibility, and develop a sense of maturity. 2. If it's a story of adventure, the car could be a catalyst for Ash to embark on a series of exciting travels and meet new people, leading to personal growth and learning new life skills. 3. If the story revolves around a family theme, the car could serve as a bonding element between Ash and Casey, reflecting their love and support for each other. It may also encourage Ash to value family relationships and work towards growing together as a family.

I don't know what he means by direction. Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"To answer these questions, I will first analyze and explain the meaning of each question separately. Question 1: \\"What does it mean when someone says 'you don't know what you are talking about'?\\" Step 1: Identify the context of the question The context of this question is to understand the meaning behind a common phrase used in conversations when someone is told they don't know what they are talking about. Step 2: Provide an explanation When someone says \\"you don't know what you are talking about,\\" it means they believe the other person lacks knowledge or understanding of the topic being discussed. This might be said due to incorrect or illogical arguments presented by the other person or because the speaker believes they have more accurate or comprehensive knowledge about the given subject. Question 2: \\"What does it mean when the mixing engineer wants to talk about a song's direction? I don't know what he means by direction.\\" Step 1: Identify the context of the question The context of this question is the music production process, specifically involving communication between a mixing engineer and other team members (musicians, producers, etc.) about the creative vision for a song. Step 2: Provide an explanation When a mixing engineer wants to talk about a song's \\"direction,\\" they are referring to the overall style, theme, mood, or feel of the song. This can include decisions about the musical arrangement, instrumentation, and production techniques. The \\"direction\\" helps guide the musicians and production team toward a cohesive end product that aligns with their artistic vision. Now, to analyze if these questions have the same meaning: Step 1: Compare the meanings of both questions The first question is about understanding a commonly used phrase in a conversation, while the second question is related to a specific term used in the music production process. Step 2: Determine if the questions have the same meaning Although both questions are inquiries about the meaning behind certain words or phrases, they have different subjects and contexts. Therefore, they do not have the same meaning. In conclusion, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is related to an expression used during discussions, while the second question is about a specific aspect of music production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer based on context: In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa. How many areas did they take north of the Republic of Ragusa?","output":"The Venetian forces took seven areas north of the Republic of Ragusa. These areas were Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk, and Metković."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Bees go out during the day and gather food - Then while gathering of their food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive - Bees make food called honey - They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together - Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more food available happens, how will it affect more wax will be created.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis mentioned can have an effect on the process. If there is more food available for the bees, it will likely result in several direct and indirect effects on the process: 1. Direct effect: More food, specifically nectar and pollen, enables the bees to have more energy. As bees consume nectar, they can efficiently produce more wax, which is the building block of their hive. Thus, with more food available, there is potential for increased wax production. 2. Indirect effects:     a) Increased food availability may lead to a larger bee population, as they can find adequate sustenance for growth and reproduction. A larger population will require a larger hive, which in turn demands more wax for construction.        b) Abundant food resources could also contribute to healthier bees that can effectively collect food, produce wax, honey, and propolis, and contribute toward hive building and maintenance. So, the supposed perturbation of more food available can directly affect more wax production and have indirect effects on the overall hive construction and bee population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. According to Milton Friedman, before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture. During the Industrial Revolution many of these children moved from farm work to factory work. Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation. Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went \\"voluntarily and gladly\\" to work in factories. What did parents do when the wages were finally raised?","output":"When the wages were raised during the Industrial Revolution, parents started to have more money. This meant that they didn't need their children to work in factories or on farms to help support the family. Instead, parents could now afford to send their children to school to learn new things and have a better future. So as the wages grew, more kids stopped working in factories and went to school, which helped them improve their lives and have better opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In spite of regular health and fitness checks, firefighters have been shown to be prone to cardiac arrest. The British Heart Foundation has provided Â£200,000 to support the new study. Scientists from Edinburgh University will monitor 50 firefighters over a two-year period. One of those who agreed to take part is Watch Commander Stevie Young of Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service (LBFRS). He said: \\"My father passed away in his 50s with heart trouble and he started getting heart trouble in his 40s. \\"I'm 48 now so I think it's beneficial to find out especially with the job I'm in, quite an active job, so it's beneficial for me to find out more about it.\\" A heart attack is the leading cause of death on duty for firefighters. They also tend to suffer cardiac arrest at a younger age than the general population. Dr Nick Mills, the consultant cardiologist leading the research at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, said: \\"The risk of having a heart attack whilst you're in service as a firefighter is highest during fire suppression activity, compared to any other emergency activity. \\"A cigarette smoker might have a two-fold risk of having a heart attack - but there's a 30-fold increased risk of having a heart attack during fire suppression activity.\\" Initial findings of researchers have suggested that even simple measures such as drinking water more frequently could reduce the level of risk. LBFRS Group Safety Commander David Mackie said: \\"There's obviously a huge amount of variables in this and so there hasn't been a huge amount of research in this country. \\"It's really important that we bottom this out and get the facts about it and try and do as much as we can to prevent any ill-health among our staff.\\"","output":"Edinburgh University scientists will monitor 50 firefighters' heart health over two years, funded by the British Heart Foundation, as cardiac arrest remains the leading cause of death on duty for firefighters despite regular health checks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He hardly ever wears a necktie. \\"I'm working harder than ever,\\" David says, \\"and I need to feel comfortable.\\" More and more companies are allowing their office workers to wear casual clothes to work. In the United States, the change from formal to casual office wear has been gradual. In the early 1990s, many companies allowed their employees to wear casual clothes on Friday, but only on Friday. This became known as \\"dress-down Friday\\" or \\"casual Friday\\". \\"What started out as an extra one-day-a-week benefit for employees has really become an everyday thing.\\" said business consultant Maisly Jones. Why have so many companies started allowing their employees to wear casual clothes? One reason is that it's easier for a company to attract new employees if it has a casual dress code. \\"A lot of young people don't want to dress up for work,\\" says the owner of a software company, \\"so it's hard to hire people if you have a conservative dress code.\\" Another reason is that people seem happier and more productive when they are wearing comfortable clothes. In a study conducted by Levi Strauss Company, 85 percent of employers said that they believe that casual dress improves employee morale . Only 4 percent of employers said that casual dress has a negative effect on productivity. Supporters of casual office wear also argue that a casual dress code helps them save money. \\"Suits are expensive, if you have to wear one every day,\\" one person said. \\"For the same amount of money, you can buy a lot more casual clothes.\\" Question: David Smith refers to himself as having been \\"a clothes addict,\\" because   _  .

Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo.  and a hint : The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism.

Coming to prominence in the 1950s as a progressive dixieland musician, Lacy went on to a long and prolific career. He worked extensively in experimental jazz and to a lesser extent in free improvisation, but Lacy's music was typically melodic and tightly-structured. Lacy also became a highly distinctive composer, with compositions often built out of little more than a single questioning phrase, repeated several times.  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Steve Potts ( born January 21 , 1943 in Columbus , Ohio ) is an American jazz saxophonist . Playing mainly alto sax and occasionally soprano , Potts is best known for his 30 - year partnership with fellow saxophonist Steve Lacy . A cousin of tenor saxophonist Buddy Tate , Potts studied architecture in Los Angeles and took lessons from saxophonist Charles Lloyd . Afterwards he went to New York where he was student of Eric Dolphy and performed with Roy Ayers , Richard Davis , Joe Henderson , Reggie Workman , and Chico Hamilton . 1970 he moved to Europe to live in Paris . He performed with Dexter Gordon , Johnny Griffin , Slide Hampton , Mal Waldron , Ben Webster , Hal Singer , Christian Escoudé , Boulou Ferré , and Oliver Johnson . Around 1973 he met Steve Lacy and played in his groups for 30 years . Potts produced also film scores .  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.  - The soprano saxophone is a higher-register variety of the saxophone, a woodwind instrument, invented in the 1840s. The soprano is the third smallest member of the saxophone family, which consists (from smallest to largest) of the soprillo, sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, bass, contrabass saxophone and tubax.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".

I will defend that property with the necessary force to repel invaders.\\" According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Shelly Island—so named for the thousands of shells found by tourists who visited it—formed off Cape Hatteras National Seashore in spring 2017 and grew to a mile long and 450 feet wide. Barlow paid 26 and filed a Quit Claim Deed for Shelly Island in August, mostly to keep it out of the hands of the \\"incompetent\\" National Park Service, which he's mad at for restricting seashore access to protect wildlife. Barlow's claim was immediately contested. North Carolina law states ownership of any island in navigable waters \\"shall vest in the state.\\" Barlow says he disagrees with that law. \\"I own it. It is clear. The story is over,\\" Barlow told WAVY in September. It may be a moot point. Later that month, multiple hurricanes battered Shelly Island, sinking it below the water. The disappearance of Shelly Island was confirmed by NASA satellite photos and announced by Barlow's hated National Park Service on Tuesday. Barlow says at least part of his Shelly Island merged with nearby Cape Point.

From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains.

Write highlights for this article: On a cold Monday in February 2012, 46-year-old Merseyside police officer Mike Cawson became a tragic statistic — one of hundreds of NHS patients injured or killed each year when medical devices fail. PC Cawson, who was suffering from heart failure, was being rushed by ambulance from Royal Liverpool University Hospital for life-saving surgery in a specialist cardiac unit at Manchester’s Wythenshawe Hospital. He never made it. His failing heart was relying on a special pump — a portable version of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inserted into his main artery. In 2013, there were 13,600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) — these were linked to 309 deaths and 5,000 serious injuries. Such pumps, which inflate and deflate a balloon in the artery, are used as temporary support for the heart in patients who are awaiting urgent cardiac surgery. But half-way through the 40-mile drive to the hospital where the specialist team was on standby to perform an emergency operation, the battery powering his pump failed. Internal hospital documents obtained by Good Health reveal that the battery, which had been fully charged before the ambulance journey, was faulty. With no spare battery on board, the transfer team from the Royal Liverpool were helpless and the ambulance was forced to divert to nearby Warrington Hospital, where the balloon had to be removed (an inactive balloon can quickly cause blood clots to form). Later that day PC Cawson was sent on to his original destination, but died the following day. An inquest into his death heard from a consultant cardiologist from the Wythenshawe who said it was ‘highly unlikely’ that the failure of the pump had contributed to PC Cawson’s death. The Royal Liverpool also reiterated to Good Health that its patient had experienced ‘no clinical adverse effects’ but had ‘sadly died after a sudden deterioration in his condition’. There is no doubt, however, that the failure of the pump did mean that PC Cawson was not able to have the life-saving surgery he was meant to have. Furthermore, after his death, the trust issued advice to all teams transferring patients with intra-aortic balloon pumps to carry a spare battery. It can be of no consolation to PC Cawson’s loved ones to learn that many other families’ lives have also been shattered when medical equipment failed patients. The official figures for the number of NHS patients injured or killed each year by faulty medical equipment are shocking. In 2013, there were 13,600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) — these were linked to 309 deaths and 5,000 serious injuries. The numbers are rising: over the past decade there have been almost 100,000 reports of failed devices, involving 2,300 deaths and 22,000 injuries. It's difficult to shake the impression that medical devices are being rushed onto the market. But these official figures could be just a fraction of the true human cost of unreliable medical equipment. For in a stunning admission to Good Health, the MHRA says it fears the true toll could be more than five times as bad. Its experts have told us that, based on global research and work carried out following the scandal over the PIP breast implants (which were made using industrial silicone with a high risk of rupture), they believe reporting of such incidents to be less than 20 per cent of the real figure —and possibly as low as 10 per cent. If this is true, this would mean in 2013 there were actually a shocking 68,000 adverse incidents, with 25,000 injuries and 1,545 deaths. Applied to the past decade, this produces a shocking tally that almost beggars belief: almost 500,000 incidents, 11,500 deaths and 110,000 serious injuries. Asked if it would be reasonable to extrapolate the figures in this way, Tony Sant, the watchdog’s manager responsible for adverse incident reporting and medical devices, said: ‘There’s nothing new with that kind of analysis. The question is, of those incidents: were the serious ones reported?’ There was, he adds, no way of knowing. One of the reasons for this is an extraordinary culture of secrecy embedded in EU law. Under Article 20 of the 1993 Medical Devices Directive, ‘all the parties involved in the application of this Directive are bound to observe confidentiality with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks’. In other words, the MHRA can’t breathe a word. ‘We can’t give you which trusts and which medical device manufacturers were involved,’ explains Mr Sant. ‘We are prohibited.’ That’s why the MHRA never named the manufacturer in an earlier death linked to a failed battery in an intra-aortic balloon pump. Yet these two incidents were neither the first nor the last time this type of device has failed. On March 24 last year, Maquet, a division of Swedish medical technology giant Getinge, urgently recalled more than 12,000 of its intra-aortic balloon pumps. It had received more than 100 reports that a simple design fault — a misshapen ring — was causing the device to shut down ‘without any visual or audible warning’. This could result in a sudden and potentially fatal loss of blood pressure. A patient died as a result. Getinge issued a previous urgent recall for the same device in 2010 when it discovered the screens indicating the pump’s performance tended to go blank. Kornelia Rasmussen, the communications manager for Getinge, told the Mail: ‘Our products, by their very nature, are used in life-threatening and critical care environments countless times each day. 'If we believe that any are not safe, or do not meet our specifications, we institute immediate corrective action and we will continue to do so.’ Getinge is not alone: each year the MHRA receives approximately 1,000 safety notices from manufacturers alerting the watchdog to problems with their products. Yet while the MHRA is not allowed to name the manufacturers, it was able to reveal that the most frequent failures have been in expensive, high‑tech equipment being used in critical situations, such as operations and in intensive care. The MHRA is also allowed to name names and products when a reported failing could have widespread safety implications, issuing a Medical Device Alert. The MHRA has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients. But here, too, the figures are far from reassuring. In 2014, 49 such alerts were issued. The most recent was on December 18, warning of a risk of serious injury to babies in an infant warmer made by Fisher & Paykel Healthcare. A faulty retaining nut meant the heater unit ‘may partially detach’. In the past year, device manufacturers, including some of the biggest names, have issued close to 1,000 so-called field safety notices. They make for hair-raising reading. At one end of the scale was a wheelchair that might suddenly tip its seat backwards and an instrument for orthopaedic surgery so badly designed that it couldn’t be cleaned properly, exposing patients to the risk of infection. More obviously life-threatening were faulty defibrillators, which are increasingly in the hands of inexperienced community volunteers. Last year, the MHRA issued an alert for one ‘smart’ defibrillator which advised life-savers to use too slow a rate of chest compression. Another defibrillator incorrectly displayed a ‘Do not touch the patient’ icon — which, according to the MHRA’s masterful understatement, ‘could affect patient outcome’. Grave faults were also highlighted in pumps that automatically administer drugs to patients, a ventilator used to aid breathing during surgery and a software program for analysing CT scans. The number of European patent applications for medical devices doubled between 2002 and 2012, outstripping applications from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors (there are already 500,000 different types of medical devices being used in the NHS). And it’s difficult to shake the impression that these devices are being rushed onto the market insufficiently tried and tested. This is reinforced by the shocking number of times the MHRA has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients. In 2013 alone, manufacturers were ordered to give 1,129 ‘undertakings to improve designs, manufacturing processes and quality systems’. And between 2011 and 2013, production ceased on 143 products, said a spokesman, ‘partly or wholly because of MHRA intervention or because a company felt it didn’t want to make the necessary changes for commercial reasons’. The MHRA is prevented from telling us which ones. A spokesman for the Association of British Healthcare Industries (ABHI) rejected any suggestion products were being rushed out, saying they were ‘put onto the market with processes backing them up to ensure they meet the correct standards’. Furthermore, monitoring the products after they’ve been launched ‘enables manufacturers to learn lessons from any field reports — if there is a situation identified by MHRA or others where improvements need to be made, then manufacturers will respond to that’. The number of reports of faulty medical devices involving new joints. And this is perhaps the most shocking thing of all. For the regulation of medical devices is a bit like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. Under EU law, private companies, known as ‘notified bodies’, ‘assess medical devices for quality, safety and [check] that they work’. They then hand out the CE mark allowing these devices to be marketed in Europe. Thereafter, ‘post-market surveillance’ — essentially, waiting to see if something goes wrong — is used to identify any problems. In other words, everyone from the manufacturers to the MHRA and the notified bodies seems to accept that device failures are inevitable — with patients serving as guinea pigs. The MHRA says it is working urgently with NHS England to eradicate the problem of under-reporting. In the meantime, following the MHRA experts’ revelations to Good Health, the watchdog now says that its investigations have whittled down the number of deaths associated with device failures in its most recent official report from 309 to just 86. It is an extraordinary U-turn on its own published official figures. There is no doubt that the system is fundamentally — and potentially dangerously — flawed. ‘Two things are certain,’ says Peter Walsh, chief executive of the patient charity Action against Medical Accidents. ‘Far too many people are needlessly dying or being harmed as a result of faulty devices or poor use of devices, and the reported incidents are still an understatement of how big the problem is.’ What we do know is clearly just the tip of the iceberg. Highlights:","output":"A police officer named Mike Cawson had a heart problem and needed a special surgery but on the way to the hospital, a medical device called a pump stopped working because its battery was broken. Because the battery failed, Mike couldn't have his important surgery and passed away the next day.  This is an example of people getting injured or even dying because of medical devices not working correctly. In 2013, a group that watches over medicines and healthcare products received 13,600 reports of devices failing. These reports were linked to 309 deaths and 5,000 serious injuries. Experts believe that the real numbers could be even higher, maybe up to five times as much. One reason we don't know the true numbers is because the group that gets these reports can't say anything about the hospitals and medical device makers involved. Because of this, it's like some patients are being used as guinea pigs to find problems with these devices after they are already being used. Many families have faced difficulties because of these medical devices failing. The problem could be worse than we know, but it's important that companies and hospitals do their best to find and fix these problems to keep people safe and healthy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Curious glances and whispered speculations filled the air, as the tension in the room gradually shifted from impatience to anticipation. The stage was quickly transformed by the event staff, revealing an elegantly set dining area. A team of waiters appeared, gracefully serving everyone a delicious delicacy that was said to be a family heirloom recipe. Step 5: Concluding the text To wrap up the text, it’s necessary to show the result of the couple's surprise and how it impacts the guests and the atmosphere of the ceremony. The guests were visibly delighted, savoring every bite of the exquisite dish and forgetting their earlier frustrations. The atmosphere was now one of joy and contentment. The couple stepped forward to exchange their vows, and the love and happiness shared between them was a sight to behold. The ceremony concluded with a perfect mix of tradition and surprise, leaving the guests with memories that would last a lifetime. Overall, the continued text highlights the challenges faced during the ceremony and how the couple managed to satisfy the guests and make the event a memorable one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Invincible Movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people...

Article: A new study gives us the warning that about thirty percent of the world's people may not have enough water by the year 2025. A private American organization called Population Action International did the new study. It says more than three-hundred-thirty-five-million people lack enough water now. The people live in twenty-eight countries. Most of the countries are in Africa or the Middle East. P-A-I researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three-thousand-million people may lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have severe water problems. The demand for water keeps increasing. Yet the amount of water on Earth stays the same. Mr. Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing faster than in other parts of the world. He says population growth in these countries will continue to increase. The report says lack of water in the future may result in several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking waters not safe. Mr. Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases, such as cholera, which are carried in water. Lack of water may also result in more international conflict. Countries may have to compete for water in the future. Some countries now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. This is true of Egypt, the Netherlands, Cambodia, Syria, Sudan, and Iraq. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability of developing to improve their economies. This is because new industries often need a large amount of water when they are beginning. The Population Action International study gives several solutions to the water problem. One way, it says, is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third way is to use less water of agriculture. The report also says long-term solutions to the water problem must include controls on population growth. It says countries cannot provide clean water unless they slow...

Help as much as you can. Information:  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\".  - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.  - A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity.  - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.  - Maple Valley is a city in King County, Washington, United States.

Problem:Pax6, a highly conserved multifunctional transcription factor, has been critical for neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity. It is presumed that if level of Pax6 approaches either low or null, critical genes responsible for maintaining functional status of neurons or glia would be modulated.', 'Therefore, it has been intended to explore possibility of either direct or indirect influence of Pax6 in neurodegeneration.', 'The cell lines having origin of murine embryonic fibroblast (Pax6-non expressing, NIH3T3-cell line), murine neuroblastoma (Pax6-expressing brain-derived, Neuro-2a-cell line), and human glioblastoma-astrocytoma (U87MG) were cultured and maintained in a CO2 incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The knockdown of endogenous Pax6 in Neuro-2a cells was achieved through siRNA based gene knock-down approach. The efficiency and validation of knock-down was done by real time PCR. The knock-down of Pax6 was successfully achieved.', 'The levels of expression of transcripts of some of the proposed putative markers of neurodegeneration like Pax6, S100β, GFAP, BDNF, NGN2, p73α, p73δ, LDH, SOD, and Catalase were analyzed in Pax6 knockdown condition for analysis of role of Pax6 in neurodegeneration. Since the Pax6 has been proposed to bind to promoter sequences of catalase, and catalase suppresses TGFβ, relative lower levels of catalase in Neuro-2a and U-87MG as compared to NIH-3T3 indicates a possible progressive dominant negative impact of Pax6. However, presence of SOD and LDH indicates alternative protective mechanism.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In order to examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not, it's important to first break down the key components of the premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"but we have like a lot like my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too\\" In the premise, there are three main points to note: 1. The speaker is saying that they have a lot of something. 2. The speaker's mother likes flowers. 3. Due to the speaker's mother liking flowers, they have a lot of flowers too. Hypothesis: \\"We have a lot of flowers because my mother likes them.\\" The hypothesis proposes that: 1. The speaker's household has a lot of flowers. 2. The reason for having a lot of flowers is due to the mother's preference for them. Now, let's analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must necessarily follow, and it's impossible for the premise to be true while the hypothesis is false. In this case, it can be observed that the hypothesis follows from the combined points in the premise. The premise states that the mother likes flowers and, as a direct consequence, the family has a lot of flowers. The hypothesis simply reiterates the same idea: the speaker's family has an abundance of flowers because the mother likes them. So, yes, the premise entails the hypothesis, since the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise.

Given these facts, oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for what among the following options: - Man  - Energy.  - humans  - plants  - animals  - Energy  - health  - fungi The answer is:","output":"Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for several of the mentioned options, as they contain aerobic organisms that rely on oxygen for generating energy through cellular respiration. These options include: 1. Man (Humans): Oxygen is crucial for human beings as they are aerobic organisms. In humans, oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor during the process of cellular respiration in the mitochondria, where the breakdown of nutrients results in the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is the primary source of energy for various cellular processes, ultimately supporting human growth, development, and overall health. 2. Plants: While plants generate oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, they are also aerobic organisms that require oxygen for cellular respiration. During the night, when photosynthesis is not occurring actively, plants consume oxygen to produce energy through cellular respiration. Like other aerobic organisms, this process generates ATP, supporting various physiological and metabolic activities in plants. 3. Animals: Animals, including both vertebrates and invertebrates, are aerobic organisms that rely on oxygen for cellular respiration. The oxygen they consume enables the process of converting nutrients into ATP within their cells. This energy is vital for their survival, growth, and reproduction. 4. Fungi: As the initial question states, fungi are aerobic organisms, which means they require oxygen for cellular respiration. Fungi obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter and, through cellular respiration, convert these nutrients into energy (ATP), which supports fungi's growth, reproduction, and various metabolic processes. Although options like \\"Energy,\\" \\"Health,\\" and the repeated \\"Energy\\" are not directly related to aerobic organisms, they are indirectly connected to the concept of cellular respiration in the sense that: Energy - Cellular respiration is the process through which energy is created in the form of ATP for aerobic organisms, including humans, plants, animals, and fungi. This energy supports their growth, reproduction, and various physiological processes. Health - Cellular respiration and oxygen consumption play a central role in maintaining the overall health of aerobic organisms. Without proper oxygen levels, numerous health problems can arise, such as hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), affecting the essential biological processes within an organism. In summary, the answer to the given question is that oxygen is essential for cellular respiration among humans (man), plants, animals, and fungi, as these are all aerobic organisms. Oxygen consumption facilitates the production of energy in the form of ATP, which is vital for their growth, reproduction, and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters, lots of laughs, and some great music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion. One by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl, a horny fat guy, the high school beauty, the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool.

They wanted to hurt many people by attacking public transport systems in Europe. Public transport systems are places like buses and trains where people go to travel from one place to another. A very brave person, called an informant, knew about these bad people's plans and decided to tell the important officials in Spain. This brave informant wanted to keep everyone safe from harm. El Pais, a famous newspaper, was able to read what the informant told the Spanish officials, and wanted to let everyone know about it. The brave informant said that there were 10 suspects, or people who could be the bad guys trying to cause harm. These suspects were planning the mean attacks on the public transport systems. The group of bad people was made up of six very dangerous people called suicide bombers. Suicide bombers are people who hurt others, and themselves too, by carrying and using dangerous things like bombs. Thankfully, due to the brave informant's help, the Spanish officials caught all 10 suspects and stopped them from hurting anyone. Because of this, many people can feel safe when they travel on public transport systems in Europe. So, the lesson we learn from this story is, sometimes there are bad people who want to hurt others, but there are also brave people who fight to protect the innocent and keep them safe.

Article: An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities in the 12th century. The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily, and during the Reconquista and the Crusades, allowed Europeans access to scientific Greek and Arabic texts, including the works of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Jābir ibn Hayyān, al-Khwarizmi, Alhazen, Avicenna, and Averroes. European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo, who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin. Later translators like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum, with the result that the \\"medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent.\\" Question: At the Toledo School of Translators, what language was Arabic text translated into?","output":"The Arabic text at the Toledo School of Translators was translated into Latin.

Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed colorful vulgarities and profanity, as well as racial epithets. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians of all time: Jerry Seinfeld called Pryor \\"The Picasso of our profession\\" and Bob Newhart heralded Pryor as \\"the seminal comedian of the last 50 years\\". Dave Chappelle said of Pryor, \\"You know those, like, evolution charts of man? He was the dude walking upright. Richard was the highest evolution of comedy.\\" This legacy can be attributed, in part, to the unusual degree of intimacy Pryor brought to bear on his comedy. As Bill Cosby reportedly once said, \\"Richard Pryor drew the line between comedy and tragedy as thin as one could possibly paint it.\\"  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Max Wertheimer, one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, defined this phenomenon in 1912. The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision together formed the foundation of Hugo Münsterberg's theory of film and are part of the process of motion perception.  - Blazing Saddles is a 1974 American satirical Western comedy film directed by Mel Brooks. Starring Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder, the film was written by Brooks, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, Norman Steinberg, and Al Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, and was nominated for three Academy Awards, and is ranked No. 6 on the American Film Institute's \\"100 Years...100 Laughs\\" list.  - Robyn Hilton is an American film and television actress and model . Hilton was active in the 1970s and 1980s following her debut supporting role as Miss Stein , the secretary to Governor William J. Le Petomane , in Mel Brooks ' 1974 comedy film Blazing Saddles .  - Andrew Bergman (born February 20, 1945) is an American screenwriter, film director, and novelist.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Cleavon Jake Little (June 1, 1939  October 22, 1992) was an American stage, film, and television actor. He began his career in the late 1960s on the stage. In 1970, he starred in the Broadway production of \\"Purlie\\", for which he earned both a Drama Desk and a Tony Award. In 1972, he starred as the irreverent Dr. Jerry Noland on the ABC sitcom \\"Temperatures Rising.\\" Two years later, Little starred in the role for which he is best known, as Sheriff Bart in the 1974 Mel Brooks comedy \\"Blazing Saddles\\".  - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays.

For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US.

At the window, he tells the attendant, Sally Jackson, that his wife knows about their affair. She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be an attack helicopter, which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack. Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers.

The statement \\"seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece\\" implies that the reviewer believes the film falls short in some way, and is not worthy of being labeled as a masterpiece.

It is clear from the wording that the reviewer's opinion is not positive, as they seem to be expressing disappointment or dissatisfaction with the movie. This assessment contrasts with a positive review, in which a reviewer may praise a movie's story, acting, visuals, or other aspects, and expresses their enjoyment or admiration.

Write a title for this article: Borders has struggled to remain relevant - Wikipedia Finally descending to the depths of bankruptcy, Borders Group filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, with debts of 1.29 billion compared with assets of 1.27 billion. While the filing comes as no surprise, Borders’ bankruptcy opens the door to speculation over the future of the self proclaimed world’s biggest bookseller. At a bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York, Borders’ executives finally threw in the towel and accepted that they don’t “have the capital resources [the group] needs to be a viable competitor and which are essential for it to move forward with its business strategy to reposition itself successfully for the long term.” More detail can be found at www.bordersreorganization.com. (Read Borders Group Was On The Forbes Risk List). Mike Edwards, Borders’ president, explained that the company had secured 505 million in debtor-in-possession financing from GE Capital and would continue to operate throw the court proceedings. But its operations would be diminished by about 30%, as Borders would be closing 193 of its 642 stores. The company, whose major shareholders include William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management with a 31% stake and Border’s current chairman and CEO Bennett LeBow with 15.4%, had announced in December that it would stop paying its creditors in order to save up cash. Most of its major debts are with publishers, such as Penguin Putnam (owed 41.1 million), Hachette (owed 36.9 million, Simon & Schuster (owed 33.9 million), and Random House (owed 33.5 million). The company also owes Twentieth Century Fox and Bank of America 6.5 million, Sony Music Entertainment 4.3 million, and Rosetta Stone 2.2 million, among others. Borders failed to remain relevant in the face of increased competition from online retailers like Amazon and its Kindle eReader, Apple’s iPad, discount retailers like Wal-Mart, and rivals like Barnes & Noble with the NOOK e-reader. The company’s stock has tanked along with the economy in 2008 and never managed to recover, going from over 20 in mid-2007 to slightly more than a dollar for most of 2010. Ackman tried to convince Borders’ board to merge with rivals Barnes & Noble last year, pledging up to 960 in financing, according to DealBook. As the company delayed another round of payments in January 2011, bankruptcy seemed inevitable. The Borders Group noted that bankruptcy would give it time to gain proper financing to consolidate themselves in a stronger position than before. ”For decades, Borders has been a beacon of engagement – a highly frequented destination for consumers and a significant venue for authors and vendors to showcase new books and merchandise. We have the ability, based on our brick and mortar presence nationally; the on-line capabilities we have in place; the loyalty of, and access to, our customers; and the products and services we offer to be an important and easy access destination of exploration and purchase for readers across the country,” commented Mr. Edwards. The company, which recently received notice from the NYSE that their stock wasn’t meeting the minimum requirement of at least a 30-day trading average of 1.00, didn’t trade on Wednesday.","output":"Big Bookstore Faces Trouble: Borders Struggles and Enters Bankruptcy"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"The novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", published in the year 1925, was written by the renowned British author Virginia Woolf.  Born Adeline Virginia Stephen in 1882, Virginia Woolf was a central figure in the modernist movement in English literature throughout the first half of the 20th century. She was an educational reformer, feminist, and one of London's most prominent intellectuals, which can be seen echoed in her extensive array of essays, short stories, novels, and other works dealing with a variety of themes such as class and society, war, feminism, and mental health. She was a member of the Bloomsbury Group, an influential group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers, and artists. Mrs. Dalloway is important because it is one of Woolf's best known works, and it was groundbreaking because of its stream of consciousness narrative method—also used by contemporaries like James Joyce—that discarded traditional plot structures in favor of depicting the interior lives and perspectives of its characters. This style provided a detailed examination of the characters' thoughts and feelings while creating a fluid narrative that moved seamlessly between descriptions of external events and characters' mental reactions. The story follows a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a high-society woman in post-World War I England, preparing to host a party, while reflecting on her past, her relationships, her age, and the society in which she lives. Interwoven with her story is the tale of Septimus Warren Smith, a World War I veteran suffering from shell shock. These two main characters never meet, but Woolf draws artistic and thematic connections between them, creating a complex narrative about personal perceptions, memory, and the profound effects of war on a society. In several ways, the novel embodies many of the literary transformations that marked the modernist movement, delivering a unique perspective on personal identity and the passage of time, the likes of which was a major departure from the straightforward, chronological plotting of 19th-century fiction. Unfortunately, like many of her characters, Woolf's life was also marked by mental illness, and she died by suicide in 1941. Despite her tragic end, she left behind a rich and varied body of work which continues to be studied and celebrated today. Her works, among which \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is a shining example, have had a profound influence on the development of feminist and modernist literature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: NUEVO LAREDO, MEXICO — Minutes after he was deported from the U.S., Francisco Narciso walked into a bus station to purchase a ticket home.      As he paid his fare, a stranger approached.      \\"Do you know how things work here in Nuevo Laredo?” the middle-aged man asked.      “Come with me. We can do things the hard way, or the easy way.”      Narciso refused. The man raised his shirt and Narciso saw a gun in his waistband.      \\"If you make a move, I will blow your head off right here, and no one will say a damn thing,” the stranger said. “We own this place.\\"      Narciso was kidnapped, beaten and threatened with death. He was released five days later, only after his girlfriend in Ohio paid nearly 4,000 in multiple ransom payments. Over two recent days in Mexico, he gave his account of his ordeal to The Dallas Morning News and The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. Fearing for his safety, he asked that his location be kept secret.      His kidnapping is an increasingly common occurrence along the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly the Texas-Tamaulipas region, immigrants rights groups say. Narciso and other immigrants deported by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement have become easy prey for violent criminal groups desperate for money. The gangs hold the deportees until their relatives in the U.S. pay thousands of dollars for their release.      Between January and June 2017, the U.S. deported more than 31,000 Mexicans through the states of Tamaulipas and Coahuila, according to Mexico’s immigration service. The states are considered the most dangerous crossing points into Mexico, so perilous that the U.S. State Department regularly issues travel alerts and warnings for Americans. ||||| (CNN) Manuel Antonio Cano Pacheco came to America as a little boy and had a full life in Des Moines, Iowa, his mother said. He had acquired DACA status, attended high school and had family -- three siblings and a 1-year-old son, she said.      \\"He was really happy in Iowa. It was the only home he knew,\\" she said. \\"He loved school and loved soccer. On his days off from school he would work as a mechanic.\\"      But Cano Pacheco ran afoul of the United States' changing immigration laws. On April 24, the 19-year-old was sent back to Mexico because of misdemeanor convictions, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Customs said.      Three weeks later, he died in a country he barely knew.      He was murdered in Zacatecas, the section of north-central Mexico where he'd gone to live, because \\"he was in the wrong place at the wrong time,\\" his Iowa friend Juan Verduzco told The Des Moines Register. One of his acquaintances also was slain, Verduzco said.      Cano Pacheco was buried in Mexico, but his family didn't attend the funeral.      \\"The entire family is devastated,\\" said his mother, who asked that her name not be used because she is undocumented and fears deportation. \\"I almost wanted to return to Mexico but my other children don't have passports and I would risk not being able to come back. We've never left the country before.\\"      Manuel Antonio Cano Pacheco in an undated photograph.      Not a deportation      Cano Pacheco was granted DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) status and employment authorization in May 2015, ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer said in a statement.      DACA protects undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children from deportation. They can obtain valid driver's licenses, enroll in college and legally secure jobs. But the program doesn't give them a path to become US citizens or even legal permanent residents.      In April 2017, Cano Pacheco was arrested on a misdemeanor drug charge and was convicted about the same time on a second misdemeanor, ICE said. ICE didn't provide details about the nature of the second case.      His DACA status was terminated, making deportation a possibility, ICE said. He was released from ICE custody after posting bond, ICE said.      While waiting on an immigration hearing, Cano Pacheco was convicted of driving under the influence and another misdemeanor, ICE said.      Neudauer said that Cano Pacheco was not deported.      He opted for voluntary departure, which means he would not suffer the penalties of a formal deportation, such as being banned from legally returning to the United States for a period of years, Neudauer said.      He requested and was granted voluntary departure on April 10, ICE said, and was returned to Mexico at the border in Laredo, Texas, on April 24.      Cano Pacheco's mother said his lawyer advised him to take voluntary departure \\"because it didn't carry the same penalties. He was unsure. He didn't want to leave but the lawyer put that in his head. We all feared that he could be killed if he went back.\\"      The attorney, Joseph Lopez-Wilson, confirmed that he requested the voluntary departure in open court. He declined further comment to CNN.      'He didn't know anyone in Mexico'      Cano Pacheco's mother told CNN she brought her oldest son to the United States when he was 3 years old.      They traveled to Iowa because his father was already there, she said. Her other children, a 13-year-old girl and two boys, 10 and 12, were born in the United States.      Cano Pacheco's father, now deceased, ran an auto repair shop where Cano-Pacheco spent a lot of time. He started attending Des Moines Public Schools in 2006, when he was a third grader, schools spokesman Phil Roeder said.      He was in the 12th grade at East High School when he transferred to Scavo High, an alternative high school, Roeder said.      He fathered a son, Danian, now 1 year old, Cano Pacheco's mother said.      \\"His girlfriend doesn't want attention,\\" she said. \\"She's distraught and detached doesn't want to be in the spotlight.\\"      Details are sketchy about how Cano Pacheco died.      \\"He didn't have any problems,\\" his mother said. \\"I don't see a reason why he would have been targeted. He didn't know anyone in Mexico. He didn't even know our family until he got there. ...      \\"He went to the store at 5 p.m. on a Friday. Then he went missing.\\"      Cano Pacheco was found dead May 18, said Pastor Alejandro Alfaro Santiz, who presided over a memorial service for Cano Pacheco in Des Moines.      A mother's anger      In the days since the death, the city of Des Moines has felt grief and anger.      Roeder, the school system spokesman, said city school educate students from more than 100 nations.      \\"This is a tragic reminder that immigration policy is not limited to the halls of power in Washington, DC, but impacts lives from one end of the country to the other, including here in Iowa,\\" he said.      Santiz said his church operates like a community center, especially during times like these, when changing Trump administration policies create stress for immigrants.      \\"It is really hard for the mental health of a person to live every single day with the fear of not seeing their loved ones again because of deportation,\\" he said. \\"Could you even imagine every time you drop your kids at school that might be the last time you hug and kiss them?\\"      Cano Pacheco's mother says her son had to leave the United States because of the President's immigration policies. Asked what she'd say to President Trump, she said:      \\"I'd tell him (Trump) to stop what he's doing,\\" she said. \\"To stop deporting people to Mexico. We don't have papers but we work really hard to care for our families. If we get deported our families have to fend for themselves.      \\"Yes, some people don't have papers, but if they get deported, they leave their families hungry. They are sometimes the sole bread winners.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Deportees from the US, such as Francisco Narciso, are increasingly becoming targets for kidnapping, ransom, and violence by criminal groups along the US-Mexico border, particularly in the Texas-Tamaulipas region.

Information:  - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE.  - Tomb KV10, located in the Valley of the Kings near the modern-day Egyptian city of Luxor, was cut and decorated for the burial of Pharaoh Amenmesse of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. However, there is no proof that he was actually buried here. Later, the decoration was replaced with scenes for Takhat and Baketwerneltwo royal women dating to the late 20th dynasty.  - The University of Memphis, also called The U of M, is an American public research university located in the Normal Station neighborhood of Memphis, Tennessee. Founded in 1912, the University has an enrollment of more than 22,000 students. With twenty-five Chairs of Excellence and five state-approved Centers of Excellence, the school is the flagship institution of The Tennessee Board of Regents system.  - Otto John Schaden (August 26, 1937  November 23, 2015) was an American Egyptologist. He was the Field Director of the Amenmesse Tomb Project of the University of Memphis (Tennessee). In addition to his work on the tomb of Amenmesse (KV10) in the main arm of the Valley of the Kings, he has also cleared and reinvestigated tombs WV23, WV24, and WV25 in the Western Valley.  - Tomb WV25 in the West Valley of the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, is clearly the beginnings of a Royal Tomb, but was never finished or decorated. It is thought to be the start of Akhenaten's Theban Tomb.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - Tomb WV23, located at the end of the Western Valley of the Kings near modern-day Luxor, was the final resting place of Pharaoh Ay of the 18th Dynasty.  - A tomb (from \\"tumbos\\") is a repository for the remains of the dead. It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes.  - Amenmesse (also Amenmesses or Amenmose) was the fifth ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt, possibly the son of Merneptah and Queen Takhat. Others consider him to be one of the innumerable sons of Ramesses II. Very little is known about this king, who ruled Egypt for only three to four years. Various Egyptologists date his reign between 1202 BC1199 BC or 1203 BC1200 BC with others giving an accession date of 1200 BC. Amenmesse means \\"born of or fashioned by Amun\\" in Egyptian. Additionally, his nomen can be found with the epithet Heqa-waset, which means \\"Ruler of Thebes\\". His royal name was Menmire Setepenre.  - KV62 is the standard Egyptological designation for the tomb of the young pharaoh Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings, now renowned for the wealth of valuable antiquities it contained. The tomb was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter, underneath the remains of workmen's huts built during the Ramesside Period; this explains why it was largely spared from desecration and from the tomb clearances at the end of the 20th Dynasty, although the tomb was robbed and resealed twice in the period after its completion.  - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it.  - Tomb WV24 is an Ancient Egyptian tomb located in the western arm of the Valley of the Kings . It was reported by Robert Hay and John Wilkinson in the 1820s and visited by Howard Carter ; however , it was not fully explored until Otto Schaden 's excavations in 1991 .  - The Valley of the Kings, the \\"Valley of the Gates of the Kings\\", is a valley in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the 16th to 11th century BC, tombs were constructed for the Pharaohs and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom (the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties of Ancient Egypt).  - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - Howard Carter (9 May 18742 March 1939) was an English archaeologist and Egyptologist who became world-famous after discovering the intact tomb (designated KV62) of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh, Tutankhamun (colloquially known as \\"King Tut\\" and \\"the boy king\\") in November 1922.  - Tutankhamun (alternatively spelled with \\"Tutenkh-\\", \\"-amen\\", \\"-amon\\") was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th dynasty (ruled c. 13321323 BC in the conventional chronology), during the period of Egyptian history known as the New Kingdom or sometimes the New Empire Period. He has since his discovery been colloquially referred to as King Tut. His original name, Tutankhaten, means \\"Living Image of Aten\\", while Tutankhamun means \\"Living Image of Amun\\". In hieroglyphs, the name Tutankhamun was typically written Amen-tut-ankh, because of a scribal custom that placed a divine name at the beginning of a phrase to show appropriate reverence. He is possibly also the \\"Nibhurrereya\\" of the Amarna letters, and likely the 18th dynasty king Rathotis who, according to Manetho, an ancient historian, had reigned for nine yearsa figure that conforms with Flavius Josephus's version of Manetho's \\"Epitome\\".

PUBLISHED:. 04:33 EST, 11 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:17 EST, 11 December 2013. Uruguay has become the first country in the world to legalise marijuana after passing a law which allows the production, sale and use of the drug. Last night hundreds of cannabis-smoking supporters cheered and set off fireworks as they celebrated the new legislation in the centre of the capital, Montevideo. The law permits both the large-scale distribution of marijuana and the growing of small amounts by individuals - although it will be tightly controlled by the country's Left-wing government. Scroll down for video. Celebration: Campaigners in Uruguay during a vote to legalise the sale and production of marijuana. March: Demonstrators on a parade through the streets of Montevideo supporting the new law. International groups have warned that Uruguay's legislation violates global treaties which state that narcotics should remain illegal in every country. Senator Roberto Conde, of the ruling Broad Front, said that 'the war against drugs has failed' as he presented the bill, which was passed in the Senate by 16 votes out of 29. Another senator, Alberto Couriel, added: 'It is an historic day. Uruguay is now on the international forefront of this issue.' President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla fighter, has described the legalisation plan as an experiment, saying: 'There are a lot of doubts and the doubts are legitimate. 'But doubts shouldn't paralyse us in trying new paths to deal with this problem that has gripped us.' Legal: Uruguay is the first country in the world to create a regulated market for cannabis. Joyful: Another marijuana fan wearing a hat which trumpets his support for the government's measure. Uruguay is the first country fully to legalise the production, distribution of sale of marijuana, but several other countries have relaxed their laws against the drug in recent years. The Netherlands is well-known for its liberal policy on cannabis, and the capital Amsterdam is full of 'coffee shops' where residents and tourists can smoke weed, although production is still illegal. Switzerland, Spain and Canada are among the many other states where the drug has been decriminalised for personal use, with official efforts directed against dealers and producers instead. Last year the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington both voted to make the sale and use of marijuana legal - however, as it is still banned under federal law, the long-term functioning of the states' laws are uncertain. In addition, 18 other American states allow the use of medical marijuana, and in some of those states it is so easy to obtain a licence for this that the drug is effectively decriminalised. The law is much more liberal than in other places which have legalised aspects of marijuana use, such as the Netherlands or the American states of Colorado and Washington. Anyone over 18 will be allowed to grow up to six marijuana plants each, join a cannabis club or buy up to 40 grams per month from a pharmacy, as long as they have registered with the government. Valeria Rubino, an activist who has taken part in marches supporting the law, described it as 'another blow against social hypocrisy'. However, opposition parties have opposed the measure, while pharmacists are angry that they will have to sell marijuana. A poll taken in September suggested that 61 per cent of Uruguayans disapprove of the law. Legalising cannabis will 'diminish the perception of risk and foster consumption, especially among children and adolescents,' said Alfredo Solari, a senator from the opposition Colorado Party. 'Neither our government nor the rest of the world should experiment with Uruguayans.' Even some drug users oppose the measure, because they argue that the government controls on marijuana are overly restrictive. Pioneer: The production of marijuana is currently illegal worldwide, although some countries have relaxed their anti-drug laws in recent years. 'It's invasive, because it is not up to the government to determine how much marijuana can be consumed and the quality,' said Alicia Castilla, the author of a book on 'Cannabis Culture'. The International Narcotics Control Board, which oversees international treaties on drugs, has warned that the law violates the Single Convention of Narcotic Drugs, adopted in 1961 by Uruguay and 185 other countries. But following decades of drug-related violence throughout Latin America, a number of former leaders from the region have endorsed the plan. Mr Conde insisted that the law will do nothing more than recognise what is already happening around the country. 'Marijuana is the illegal drug that is most consumed, fundamentally by young people, one that is perceived as extremely low risk and is easily obtained,' he said. The government has accompanied the law with a publicity campaign featuring the slogan, 'All drug consumption has risks.' Highlights:","output":"1. Uruguay becomes the first country to fully legalize marijuana, allowing the production, sale, and use of the drug. 2. The new legislation, passed with 16 out of 29 votes in the Senate, permits large-scale distribution as well as individual growth of small amounts, under government control. 3. Senator Roberto Conde announces that the \\"war against drugs has failed,\\" with Uruguay now leading international efforts to tackle the issue. 4. Uruguay's legalization is distinct from the Netherlands and the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington, where certain aspects of marijuana use are legalized. 5. Despite warnings that the legislation violates international treaties, several former regional leaders have endorsed the plan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? Which is probably true of the author? - not enough information - The author is physically fit - They author is an accountability coach - The author is controlling","output":"The diet cycle mentality can be a harmful and never-ending loop for many individuals. People continue to search for that \\"magic cure\\" – the perfect diet plan tailored to their individual needs that ensures permanent weight loss. However, this mindset might actually prevent them from achieving their goals as they never fully commit to a plan. They believe that their inability to lose weight and maintain it is because they haven't found the right diet, but the fact is that there might not be a single perfect plan suited to everyone. Numerous diet books, magazines, and online resources promise the best results, but often fall short in providing long-lasting solutions. In an attempt to escape from this cycle, some individuals turn to the mentality of \\"one last diet,\\" convincing themselves that if they just stick to a particular plan, they will eventually be able to transition into mindful eating. Unfortunately, this belief usually brings disappointment when they invariably regain the weight they had lost. Additionally, the obsession with health and fitness can be harmful, as people may become overly focused on controlling their food intake and exercise routines. Planning, tracking, and constantly searching for information on how to effectively lose weight can consume an individual's life, leading to an unhealthy relationship with food and fitness. To truly break free from the diet cycle mentality, it's crucial to stop searching for that elusive magic solution. Instead, focus on cultivating a more balanced perspective on health, fitness, and food. True success comes from developing a sustainable and realistic lifestyle that incorporates moderate exercise and a nutritious diet, while still allowing for enjoyment and occasional indulgences. It's also essential to recognize when repeated attempts at dieting may indicate an unhealthy relationship with food and one's body. In such cases, seeking help from a mental health professional or support group can provide guidance toward a healthier mindset. In conclusion, breaking free from the diet cycle mentality requires acknowledging that there is no magic cure. Instead, focus on developing a holistic approach to health and fitness, which involves being kind to yourself and prioritizing your overall well-being. And remember, progress takes time and effort, but it's ultimately worth it for lasting change."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.  - Guy Berkeley \`\` Berke '' Breathed ( / brðd / BREDH - d ; born June 21 , 1957 ) is an American cartoonist , children 's book author / illustrator , director and screenwriter , best known for Bloom County , a 1980s cartoon - comic strip that dealt with sociopolitical issues as understood by fanciful characters ( e.g. , Bill the Cat and Opus the Penguin ) and through humorous analogies . Bloom County earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1987 .  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States.

The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.   - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Bloom County is an American comic strip by Berkeley Breathed which originally ran from December 8, 1980, until August 6, 1989. It examined events in politics and culture through the viewpoint of a fanciful small town in Middle America, where children often have adult personalities and vocabularies and where animals can talk. It originated from a comic strip known as \\"The Academia Waltz\\", which Breathed produced for the student newspaper, \\"The Daily Texan\\", while attending the University of Texas.  - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847  October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\".

Angela wanted to educate kids.;","output":"Amy was in school to be a teacher, while Angela was in school to be a programmer, because Amy wanted to educate kids.  The sentence ends with the option (a) - Amy wanted to educate kids. This choice aligns cohesively with the information presented in the sentence, wherein Amy is pursuing a career in teaching, which is fundamentally centered around the educational development and growth of children. In contrast, Angela's interest lies in the field of programming, a discipline that is primarily focused on the development and creation of software, applications, and other digital technologies. This line of work, while occasionally involving educational aspects such as providing instruction to others about programming concepts, is generally not directly linked to the primary education of children as teaching is. To better understand why this sentence ends with option (a), let’s delve deeper into the motivations and aspirations of each individual: 1. Amy: Intent on becoming a teacher, Amy is driven by her innate passion for enriching the lives of children through the dissemination of vital knowledge and life skills instrumental to their educational journeys. As a teacher, she will have the transformative power to guide, support, and mentor young minds, grooming them to become influential contributors to society in various capacities. Her role will also enable her to foster a nurturing and inclusive environment, wherein children will be encouraged to explore myriad topics and develop critical thinking, which are essential steps in their holistic growth. 2. Angela: As a prospective programmer, Angela aims to harness her analytical, problem-solving, and technical prowess to create cutting-edge digital solutions that cater to diverse needs, streamline existing processes, and optimize productivity. This career affords her a range of opportunities to work in different sectors, including software development, game design, application creation, or even to contribute to technological advancements within the realm of education. However, her primary role will usually not be centered around the direct instruction of children in a traditional educational setting, as teaching careers generally are. In conclusion, given the distinct career paths and goals of the two individuals mentioned in the sentence, it is evident that the sentence ends with option (a) – Amy wanted to educate kids. This assertion underscores Amy's pursuit of a career in teaching, a vocation synonymous with the noble and rewarding mission of shaping and nurturing the future generations through the power of education."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To begin, let's break down what a file extension is. A file extension is a short sequence of characters, usually three or four letters, that follows the main file name, separated by a period (e.g., \\".txt\\" for a text file, \\".jpg\\" for an image, or \\".doc\\" for a Microsoft Word document). The purpose of a file extension is to inform the operating system and various software programs about the format and content of a given file, enabling them to open and properly interact with the file type in question. With this understanding, let's now focus on decoding the \\"GBAP\\" file extension: 1. Research: First and foremost, you need to investigate the various file types associated with the GBAP extension. A simple online search using the keywords \\"GBAP file extension\\" should yield some helpful results for you to examine. 2. Identification: After researching, you may find that the GBAP file extension is associated with the \\"Game Boy Advance Palette\\" file type. A GBAP file stores color palettes or color schemes used by Game Boy Advance games, which were developed for a handheld gaming console created by Nintendo. These color palettes are primarily used by game developers and designers to maintain a consistent color theme throughout the game. 3. Appropriate software: To open a GBAP file, you will need to download and install a compatible software program. Some popular options for working with GBAP files include Tile Molester and GBATA (Game Boy Advance Tool). These tools can be found through a simple online search as well. 4.

A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned, which involves mines drying up, does not have a direct effect on the process of a star's lifecycle and the increase in pressure and gravity. The processes occurring within a star are driven by nuclear reactions and the balance between gravity and pressure, which are independent of external factors like mines on a separate celestial body, such as Earth. However, if we interpret this perturbation as a metaphor for the depletion of resources within the star itself, the process remains the same. As the star consumes its fuel and runs out of resources, it can no longer support its weight. This leads to the core shrinking under pressure, causing gravity to become stronger until eventually, it reaches the state where even light cannot escape.

He  was soon performing around 120 concerts a year, generally to great critical acclaim, and in  April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger  commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian. In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period.   He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration  which enabled works to be  performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups  up to full orchestral strength.In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York.

Today, we are going to talk about two amazing football players, Shaun Suisham and Rian Lindell. They are both kickers, which means they kick the football to help their team score points. We will find out how many more yards (that's the distance a football travels across the field) Shaun Suisham made than Rian Lindell. Let's start with finding out how many field goal yards Shaun Suisham had. He made 1,148 points in his career and his total combined field goal yards were 5,754. To help you understand, imagine Shaun kicking the ball across the field and making it fly so far that it covers 5,754 yards. That's a lot, huh? Now, let's talk about Rian Lindell. Rian scored 1,350 points and his total combined field goal yards were 5,425. So, Rian made the ball go far too, but just not as far as Shaun did. Time to find out how many more yards Shaun had than Rian. To do this, we need to subtract Rian's yards (5,425) from Shaun's yards (5,754). You ready? Let's do the math! 5,754 - 5,425 = 329 There you have it! Shaun Suisham had 329 more combined field goal yards than Rian Lindell. That means Shaun managed to kick the ball a little bit farther than Rian. But they're both still amazing athletes and we can appreciate their talents in playing football. So the next time someone asks you about these two great kickers, you can tell them how Shaun kicked the ball a bit more than Rian during their exciting football careers.

First, identify the common term, which is the \\"b\\" term multiplied by the coefficients. In this case, we have 75691520*b and 75691378*b as the terms with b. We want to isolate the variable b to find its value, so we need to eliminate the common term from both sides of the equation.

Subtract the smaller term, which is 75691378*b, from both sides of the equation: 75691520*b - 75691378*b = 75691378*b - 75691378*b + 7952 Step 3: Simplify the equation. Now, simplify the equation: 142*b = 7952 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of b. To find the value of b, divide both sides of the equation by 142: b = 7952 / 142 Step 5: Calculate the value of b.

Summarize: Asante spurned the first real chance of the match when he prodded meekly at visiting goalkeeper Rory Watson while Kyle Wootton fired wide when well placed at the other end. Dutch striker Asante also missed the target but then made amends shortly afterwards, following up to net the rebound after Jamey Osborne's low drive had been parried into his path. Solihull were grateful for Daniel Lewis' fine low save to keep out Wootton's drive shortly after half-time while the ever-dangerous Asante's effort came back off the bar. The hosts survived a few nervy moments before Asante made the result safe, slamming into the roof of the net from the edge of the area before Curtis Bateson was dismissed late on to compound the woes of North Ferriby, who slipped to the foot of the table following the loss.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What would someone in an affirmative action program likely to experience?\\"  Context: \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Someone in an affirmative action program is likely to experience certain benefits, such as preferential treatment in educational or professional opportunities. However, they may also face some potential drawbacks. These can include feelings of self-doubt and entitlement, as mentioned by Terry Eastland, as well as the possibility of being negatively perceived by others due to the perceived advantage stemming from their participation in affirmative action. Additionally, as pointed out by Thomas Sowell, affirmative action might lead to a reduction in overall incentives for both preferred and non-preferred groups to perform at their best and could foster animosity towards the preferred groups. Thus, the experiences of someone in an affirmative action program can be quite complex, with a combination of advantages and potential challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

App-alled: Mom gets hit with 3K bill after twin sons mistakenly purchase apps on iTunes Canadian mom Paula Marner was stunned to see that her twin sons had gone on a spending spree for app-related purchases on iTunes. The final tally: 3,000. The 7-year-olds were playing the game “Clash of Clans” on the iPad during a trip to England when they unwittingly agreed to buy items used in the game — at a cost ranging from 99 cents to 99 per purchase. “I think it’s very deceptive,” Marner, of Newfoundland, told CBC News about the way so-called “bait apps” are placed into kids’ games that are billed as being free. “I accused them of a little bit worse, but it’s just greed.” In “Clash of Clans” and other similar games, little messages pop up alerting players to buy in-app add-ons to upgrade their gaming experience. To do so, they have to put in their iTunes passwords and agree. But Marner said her sons, Elias and Malachy, didn’t realize they were consenting to pay real money. “So that kept coming up consistently and they kept tapping it, because it's just tap purchase, tap purchase, tap purchase,” she said. The mom complained to Apple about the misunderstanding, and she expects to get her money back, CBC News said. But she’s not the only appalled parent. RELATED: OREGON TODDLER BUYS CAR ON EBAY WITH DAD’S SMARTPHONE A British dad had to go after Apple when his 8-year-old daughter mistakenly bought the equivalent of about 6,120 worth of in-app purchases. Lee Neale, an aerospace designer, said he only noticed what she had done when his bank account was suddenly frozen, according to Britain’s The Sun. In six days, his daughter completed 74 costly transactions. “She is only 8 years old. Even when I sat her down and explained that what she was doing had cost dad money, I still don’t think she really understood,” Neale said. “These in-app purchases are terrible and people need to be aware,” he added. Apple, he said, has refunded the money. A class-action lawsuit was filed two years ago in California against the tech giant claiming false marketing of bait apps. A new settlement has been proposed offering those who were affected to receive an iTunes credit. A cash refund would only be given to those who no longer have an active iTunes account or whose purchase exceeded 30, reported TechSpot.com. RELATED: BRITISH BOY RACKS UP 2K PLAYING ‘FREE’ IPAD GAME The deadline to submit a claim is Jan. 13, 2014. One app developer told CBC News that targeting kids’ games with confusing in-app purchases is wrong. “There are a lot of in-app or app developers who are taking advantage of in-app purchases, banking on the fact that kids are going to be given an iPad and the parental permissions won’t be set out correctly,” said Levin Mejia. How to protect from in-app purchases on the iPhone and iPad: - Go to Settings, then General, then Restrictions, and then change the “require password” setting to “immediately.” Your child would have to specifically enter in a password before they can agree to purchase something. - To turn off in-app purchases completely, go to the Restrictions menu and slide the “in-app purchases” setting to “off.” ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Very Hard Choices is a science - fiction / suspense - mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson , released in June 2008 . The novel , set in British Columbia , is a sequel to Very Bad Deaths and continues the story of the reclusive telepath known as Smelly .  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds.  - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Spider Robinson (born November 24, 1948) is an American-born Canadian Hugo Award- and Nebula Award-winning science fiction author.  - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.  - Very Bad Deaths (Baen Books, 2004, ISBN 0-7434-8861-X), is a science-fiction/suspense-mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson. The book was followed in 2008 by a sequel, \\"Very Hard Choices\\". It explores the personal implications of uncontrolled telepathy, social responsibility, and the idea of evolutionary, biological evil, while, as usual, expounds on Spider's own political and social views.  - Baen Books is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy. In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen. After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The song written by Max Martin and Shellback that has been compared to the song \\"Yodel It!\\" is \\"I Love It\\" by Icona Pop featuring Charli XCX. \\"I Love It\\" was released in 2012 and became a major hit across various countries. Although there isn't a direct reference to yodeling in the lyrics or melody of \\"I Love It,\\" the comparison made with \\"Yodel It!\\" could be due to several reasons. \\"Yodel It!\\" is a song performed by Romanian artists Ilinca Băcilă and Alex Florea and was Romania's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2017. The song gained attention for its unconventional mix of pop-rock and traditional yodeling. Meanwhile, \\"I Love It\\" features a catchy upbeat tempo and a defiant, memorable chorus, which is what might have led to some drawing parallels between the two songs. Max Martin and Shellback are renowned for producing chart-topping pop hits, which often incorporate memorable hooks and catchy melodies. In \\"I Love It\\", they managed to craft an infectious synth-driven hook that is easy to sing along with. Similarly, \\"Yodel It!\\" incorporates an unforgettable yodeling section that attracted listeners and became popular in various countries. The connection between the two songs could also be attributed to their anthemic and cheerful nature. Both \\"I Love It\\" and \\"Yodel It!\\" feature catchy choruses and a sense of fun that make listeners want to join in on the singing. The songs are characterized by their unapologetic and bold approach, which is a common trait among many of Max Martin and Shellback's productions. Another possible reason for the comparison could be the use of the human voice as a primary instrument. In \\"I Love It,\\" Icona Pop and Charli XCX's vocals play a significant role in conveying the song's rebellious and exuberant spirit. Similarly, in \\"Yodel It!,\\" Ilinca's impressive yodeling skills take center stage, which is not a typical choice for a contemporary pop song and yet managed to garner significant popularity. In conclusion, while \\"I Love It\\" by Icona Pop featuring Charli XCX might not share an explicit connection with \\"Yodel It!,\\" the two songs could be compared due to their catchy hooks, anthemic nature, vocal-centric approach, and sense of fun. Both songs are emblematic of Max Martin and Shellback's knack for producing memorable, chart-topping anthems that resonate with listeners worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Yes, \\"join the club\\" can be considered a valid answer to the question \\"What will Robin want to do next?\\" based on the provided information. Tracy, who is in a BMX biking club and loves it, believes that Robin would also enjoy being a part of the club. Since Tracy has urged Robin to join the club, it can be reasonably assumed that she has shared her positive experiences and enthusiasm for the club with Robin. However, it is essential to keep in mind that this answer is based on the assumption that Robin trusts or values Tracy's opinion, and that they have similar interests that prompted Tracy's recommendation. Additionally, one should consider that people's preferences may differ; just because Tracy loves the BMX biking club does not guarantee that Robin will share the same level of enthusiasm or interest. Therefore, \\"join the club\\" is a valid answer, but it is essential to recognize that there might be variations in individual preferences and decisions.

In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (; 11 December 1918 - 3 August 2008) was a Russian novelist, historian, and short story writer. He was an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and communism and helped to raise global awareness of its Gulag forced labor camp system. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962), in the periodical Novy Mir. During the war, Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a sound-ranging battery in the Red Army, was involved in major action at the front, and was twice decorated. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 8 July 1944 for sound-ranging two German artillery batteries and adjusting counterbattery fire onto them, resulting in their destruction.  A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel Love the Revolution!, chronicles his wartime experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime.  While serving as an artillery officer in East Prussia, Solzhenitsyn witnessed war crimes against local German civilians by Soviet military personnel. The noncombatants and the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and women and girls were gang-raped to death. A few years later, in the forced labor camp, he memorized a poem titled \\"Prussian Nights\\" about these incidents. In this poem, which describes the gang-rape of a Polish woman whom the Red Army soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German, the first-person narrator comments on the events with sarcasm and refers to the responsibility of official Soviet writers like Ilya Ehrenburg.  In The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn wrote, \\"There is nothing that so assists the awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about one's own transgressions, errors, mistakes. After the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I remember myself in my Captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Where did he serve during the war?","output":"In the above article, it states that during the war, Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a sound-ranging battery in the Red Army.

Ben does so in full view of the man's workers, knowing his reputation will protect him. Often called \\"Bugsy\\" but hating the nickname (and willing to beat or kill someone for using it), Siegel is being sent to Los Angeles to broker a deal with another gangster, Jack Dragna, in an effort to expand their operations.Siegel boards a train after saying goodbye to his wife Esta and their two girls. He's visited by Harry Greenberg, an old friend who is irresponsible with his end of Siegel's organization and asks Siegel for money. Disgusted, Siegel gives Greenberg a large sum and dismisses him to sit under a UV lamp and work on his tan.Arriving in Los Angeles, Siegel is met by another old friend, the actor George Raft, who takes Ben to a studio where the movie Manpower is being shot. On the set, Ben notices a woman, Virginia Hill, who has a job as an extra. Ben is attracted to her immediately and talks to her briefly before she walks off, seemingly uninterested and insulting his ego. George drives Ben back to his hotel through Beverly Hills, pointing out the houses of famous Hollywood people. When George mentions opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, Ben asks George to leave him there. Ben meets with Tibbett himself and mildly coerces Tibbett into selling his house, offering straight cash and settling on an amount several thousand dollars more than Tibbett paid for the house. Tibbett agrees. A few scenes later, Siegel buys a luxury car from a random person on the street.Siegel meets with Dragna and his associates at Dragna's office. Dragna isn't interested in Siegel's offer to expand his own business, much less aid Siegel & his associates.

What Murray does land for Bobby is a full week headlining the grand opening of the world's first Glatt Kosher hotel-casino, Mazel Hotel. As it turns out, the real force behind Bobby Starr's curious invitation to this \\"Orthodox otherworld\\" is the hotel owner's persuasive daughter Rebekka Hershenfeld (Amy Davidson), who has harbored a huge crush on Bobby since childhood.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  I am facing a new situation today: John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","output":"Test C would see a lower concentration of reactants than Test D.  This is because, according to Le Châtelier's principle, when a chemical system at equilibrium is subjected to stress, it will attempt to counteract that stress and establish a new equilibrium. In Test C, a forward reaction is favored, which means the system is responding to the stress by trying to consume the reactants and generate more products. Thus, the concentration of reactants would decrease in Test C. On the other hand, in Test D, the reverse reaction is favored. This means the system is responding to the stress by trying to consume the products and generate more reactants. As a result, the concentration of reactants would increase in Test D. Comparing Tests C and D, the concentration of reactants would be lower in Test C than in Test D due to the response of the chemical system to the applied stress according to Le Châtelier's principle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Frank and Jamie McCourt reach divorce settlement Frank and Jamie McCourt have reached a settlement in their ownership squabble over the Dodgers, at least for now. The settlement sets up a one-day trial Aug. 4 to determine if the Dodgers are property of Frank McCourt or community property. If Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon rules that the Dodgers are community property, the McCourts would split the Dodgers 50-50 and would appear to be forced to sell the team. However, if Gordon rules they are property of Frank McCourt, then Jamie McCourt gets 100 million and retains control of the couple's homes. According to the Associated Press, the agreement states that should Jamie McCourt prevail in the one-day trial, the team, Dodger Stadium and the surrounding property would be split between the former couple and \\"be sold by the parties in an orderly manner under the court's supervision.\\" Said Frank McCourt, according to the Los Angeles Times: \\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\\" The agreement requires Major League Baseball's approval of a 17-year television contract between the Dodgers and Fox, Frank McCourt said. According to the Times, which first reported the divorce settlement, if Commissioner Bud Selig rejects the Fox agreement, the McCourts' settlement would be voided and the parties would continue proceedings in divorce court. MLB spokesman Pat Courtney declined comment but Dennis Wasser, an attorney for Jamie McCourt, hopes the Fox deal will be finalized early next week. Frank McCourt has said the Fox deal could be worth around 3 billion. The Times cites unnamed people familiar with the situation, who say, according to the paper, that without the deal, Frank McCourt has \\"no chance\\" to meet the Dodgers' June 30 payroll. In comments published on the Times' website Friday, Frank McCourt said he was pleased to have put this matter behind him. However, Jamie McCourt said, according to the Times: \\"I'm just hoping for resolution. I hope this is a step toward that resolution. I'll be happy when there is final resolution.\\" There won't be until MLB rules on the Fox deal and determines whom it sees fit to run the Dodgers. \\"I fully expect MLB to approve the Fox transaction,\\" Frank McCourt said. \\"MLB has taken the position that, before they approved the transaction, they wanted to see either a settlement of the divorce, or Jamie's consent, or an order from the judge. Today, they received all three. I fully expect that they will be good to their word, and they'll approve the transaction in a timely way.\\" Selig seized control of the Dodgers in April, citing their financial problems. MLB has said it won't rule on a deal like the Fox one until its overview of the Dodgers is resolved, a process that is nearing its end, according to the Times. Selig appointed former Rangers president Tom Schieffer to run the team for MLB. Late last year, Gordon declared a postnuptial marital agreement giving Frank McCourt sole ownership of the Dodgers invalid. Jamie McCourt then sought half the team under California's community property law, leading up to Friday's settlement.

They were fighting over who owns the Dodgers, a baseball team. Now, they will have a one-day trial on August 4th to decide if the Dodgers belong to Frank or if they have to share it 50-50.

The given equation is: 0 = -1011*t + 508*t + 514*t + 121 First, we can simplify the equation by combining the terms containing the variable t. To do so, we can add the coefficients (-1011 + 508 + 514): -1011*t + 508*t + 514*t = (-1011 + 508 + 514)*t = 11*t So, this simplifies our equation to: 0 = 11*t + 121 Now, in order to solve for t, we will isolate the term with the variable t on one side of the equation.

Here is a hypothesis: Until renovations are finished, there are cultural sites and museums to visit. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis convey the idea that, until restoration work is completed, cultural sites and museums are the main attractions for visitors to the area. To break it down further: - The premise states that \\"until restoration is complete,\\" implying there is ongoing work in the area. - It also mentions that \\"the main reason to hit the area is to check out cultural sites, including museums,\\" suggesting these are the primary attractions during this restore and renovation process. Similarly: - The hypothesis acknowledges the ongoing restoration by stating \\"until renovations are finished.\\" - It goes on to say \\"there are cultural sites and museums to visit,\\" which echoes the premise's claim that these are the main attractions for now until the restoration is completed. While the premise and hypothesis use slightly different wording, they share the same underlying meaning. If the premise – that cultural sites and museums are the main attractions until restoration is complete – is true, then it naturally follows that the hypothesis, which also claims cultural sites and museums are attractions to visit during the renovation, is also true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In Africa, Christmas day begins with groups of carolers   walking to and fro through the village, along the roadway, by the houses of the churchmen, singing the lovely carols known the world around. Often people may be awakened by a group of carolers beginning to gather at the church. They return home to make final preparation as to the clothes one must wear and also as to his offering for the Christmas service. The most important part of their Christmas service is the love offering. This is the gift in honor of Jesus. At about 8 or 9 o'clock, everyone makes their way to the celebration of the birthday of Jesus. Everyone who attends the service goes forward to lay down their gift upon the raised platform near the Communion table. Not one person will attend the service without giving a gift. Christmas in South Africa is a summer holiday. There is no snow, but it has many flowers, many beautiful varieties of wild flowers being in their full pride. In Ghana, most churches announce the coming of Christmas by decorating the church and homes beginning with the first week in Advent, four weeks before Christmas. This season happens to be the cocoa harvest time, so it is a time of wealth. Everyone returns home from wherever they might be, such as farms or mines. In Africa, it is the traditional dinner of turkey, roast beef, mince pies, suckling pig, yellow rice with raisins, vegetables, and plum pudding, or crackers. In the afternoon, families go out into the country and usually there are games or bathing in the warm sunshine, and then home in the cool of the evening. Boxing Day is also a public holiday of real relaxation usually spent in the open air, which falls on December 26. Question: The writer of this passage mainly wants to   _  .

I read this background article the other day: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  I am facing a new situation today: Space explorers, that launched from Earth, just encountered a new planet several light years away. This planet is almost an exact copy of Earth, but it is currently uninhabited by intelligent life. Upon landing, the explorers name the planet Caprica and begin learning as much as they can. They discover that the species on this Caprica are nearly all the same as on Earth, and even most of the topography looks the same. However, the main difference is that humans never evolved here. For this reason, there are no cities or cars or factories to burn up fossil fuels.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does Earth have more or less greenhouse gases than Caprica? The answer to this question is:","output":"Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica. Step 1: Understand the differences between Earth and Caprica. In the given situation, Earth and Caprica are nearly identical, except that Caprica does not have human civilization, which means there are no human activities such as fossil fuel burning and industrial operations. Step 2: Compare the contributions to greenhouse gases on Earth and Caprica. On Earth, human activities release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels. According to the background article, this leads to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming or climate change. Caprica, however, does not have human civilization and thus does not have any human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Step 3: Determine which planet has more greenhouse gases. Since it is the human-induced emissions that have caused an increase in greenhouse gases on Earth, and Caprica does not have any human activities causing such emissions, it is safe to conclude that Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the premise and hypothesis statements. 2. Analyze the content of the statements. 3. Assess the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Step 1: Identify the premise and hypothesis statements. Premise: \\"see I've only been here four\\" Hypothesis: \\"See I have been here for seven\\" Step 2: Analyze the content of the statements. The premise implies that someone has been in a location for four units of time (although the units of time are not specified). The hypothesis implies that someone has been in a location for seven units of time. Step 3: Assess the logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis are referring to the duration someone has been in a particular location. However, the durations mentioned in both statements are different (four units vs. seven units). Since the durations are different, we have no logical basis to directly deduce the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Both statements provide different information about the duration someone has been in a particular location and accepting one as true doesn't necessarily make the other true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: who  is forced to sever his bitten right hand? Movie plot title: Evil Dead II Movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him.

Plot title: Sanjuro Movie plot: Nine young samurai, including his nephew, believe that the lord chamberlain, Mutsuta, is corrupt after he tore up their petition against organised crime and argued that maybe he himself was behind the crimes. One of them tells the superintendent of this and he agrees to intervene. As the nine meet secretly at a shrine and discuss their problem, a ronin (Mifune) emerges from another room where he has been resting. The ronin has overheard their plans, and suggests that the superintendent is in fact the real corrupt official. While at first the samurai are insulted by his claims, they soon find themselves surrounded by the superintendent's men, proving that he was correct. Initially, the samurai want to fight, but the odds are overwhelming, so the ronin hides the samurai, confronts and hits a few of the attackers and bluffs their leader into leaving. The grateful samurai ask what they can do for the ronin and he asks for only a small amount of money to buy food because he is starving; however, after realizing that Mutsuta and his family must now be in danger, he decides to help the samurai bring down the corrupt officials. When the samurai go to Mutsuta's house, they find that he has been abducted and his wife (played by Takako Irie) and daughter (Reiko Dan) are imprisoned in the house. Following the ronin's suggestion, a servant from the house gets the guards drunk, allowing the samurai to free the women. The group hide in a house next door to the superintendent's compound, which contains a large number of (camellia) trees.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Question: Where did the president go on to greener fields?

This is a correct answer to the following question about Hydraulic fluid. Yes or no? Answer: Common hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil or water. Question: What is and where is hydraulic fluid found and used for","output":"Hydraulic fluid is a crucial component in hydraulic systems, which are widely employed in a variety of industrial, automotive, aviation, and marine applications to transmit power. It is a medium that is capable of efficient transmission of forces through its incompressible nature, allowing for smooth and precise control of various equipment. Beyond being based on mineral oil or water, as mentioned earlier, hydraulic fluids can also be synthetics or made from other organic compounds. Hydraulic fluid performs several important roles in hydraulic systems: 1. Power transmission: The primary purpose of hydraulic fluid is to convey energy from one location to another within the system, enabling an operator to exert precise control over various mechanical components. 2. Lubrication: The fluid also acts as a lubricant, reducing friction between the moving parts of components such as pumps, valves, and cylinders. This results in reduced wear and tear, ultimately prolonging the life of the system. 3. Heat dissipation: As hydraulic systems generate heat during operation, the fluid helps to absorb and distribute this heat away from critical components, which prevents overheating and potential equipment failure. 4. Sealing: When used in conjunction with sealing components, hydraulic fluids help to seal gaps between moving parts, further reducing fluid leakage and ensuring efficient energy transmission. Hydraulic fluids can be found in a wide range of applications, some of which include: 1. Industrial equipment: In factories, hydraulic systems are frequently responsible for controlling and powering various heavy machinery, such as presses, lifts, and conveyor systems. 2. Construction and heavy equipment: Hydraulic systems are commonly found in construction machinery, such as excavators, backhoes, and bulldozers, allowing for precise control of functions like swinging, lifting, and digging. 3.

To further analyze this assertion thoroughly, we can dissect the premise and hypothesis: Premise: 1. There are local leaders. 2. The local leaders belong to their respective ethnic groups. 3. The statement \\"most\\" suggests that the relationship between local leaders and their respective ethnic groups is true for the majority but not all cases. Hypothesis: 1. They (referring to the local leaders and members) are all members of different groups. To conclude that the hypothesis is true, we need concrete evidence that suggests each local leader and their respective group members belong to separate, unique groups. The given premise, however, doesn't provide such proof, and the use of \\"most\\" implies the existence of some exceptions.  Let's look at two potential scenarios based on the premise: Scenario 1: The leaders and members in question represent separate ethnic groups, and no overlap exists between these groups. In this case, the hypothesis would be true. Scenario 2: Multiple leaders and members belong to the same ethnic group, causing overlaps between these respective groups. In this scenario, the hypothesis would be false.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do earthworms do to soil?\\" is \\"damages them\\", given that  earthworms change the chemistry of the soil? Answer:","output":"No, I do not think the right answer to the question \\"what do earthworms do to soil?\\" is \\"damages them\\" simply because they change the chemistry of the soil. Earthworms, in fact, play a significant role in maintaining soil health and fertility. They contribute to various ecological processes that are vital for the growth of plants and the proper functioning of natural ecosystems. While it is correct that earthworms change the chemistry of the soil, it is essential to understand that these changes mostly have positive effects. Here are some of the ways earthworms contribute to soil health: 1. Organic matter decomposition: Earthworms consume organic matter such as dead plants, leaves, and other organic debris present in the soil. They break down the complex organic compounds into simpler forms, making it more accessible for plants and various microorganisms in the soil. 2. Soil aeration: As earthworms burrow through the soil, they create tunnels that allow air to enter the soil. This enhances the availability of oxygen for other soil organisms and plants, promoting healthy root growth and efficient nutrient uptake. 3. Mixing and improvement of soil structure: Earthworms physically mix different soil layers as they move through the ground. This action helps in the redistribution of nutrients and improves soil structure by creating stable aggregates, which reduces soil compaction and erosion. 4. Nutrient cycling: Earthworms play a crucial role in nutrient cycling through the process of mineralization. By consuming organic matter, they release essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in their waste called \\"casts.\\" These nutrients enrich the soil around plant roots, aiding in plant growth and overall soil fertility. 5. Enhancing the microbial population: The gut of an earthworm is home to a diverse range of microorganisms. As earthworms move through the soil, they transport these microbes, thereby promoting the growth of beneficial bacterial and fungal communities. This not only aids in releasing bound nutrients in the soil but also helps suppress various plant pathogens. 6. Water infiltration and retention: The tunnels created by earthworms improve the ability of soil to capture and retain water. They help in the better absorption and distribution of water, reducing runoff and nutrient loss while promoting better water management. In conclusion, while earthworms do change the chemistry of the soil, their overall impact on soil health is beneficial rather than detrimental. They contribute to the improvement of soil structure, fertility, water retention, and microbial activity, making them an essential component of a healthy and functioning ecosystem. Thus, rather than \\"damaging\\" the soil, earthworms significantly enhance and maintain its quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

James had some oil spilled on the floor, and he then put a mat over it because the","output":"cleaning supplies were not within immediate reach, and he wanted to prevent anyone from accidentally slipping on the slick surface, potentially causing injuries and further mess. As the day progressed, James couldn't get the image of the oil spill out of his mind. He knew it was not only a hazard to the safety of people in the household, but it could also damage the floor's surface if left unattended for an extended period of time. Deciding it was high time he acted, James looked for an effective way to break down and absorb the spilled oil before it caused any more issues. After he searched his home for cleaning supplies, James discovered that he was out of commercial oil-removing products. Knowing that postponing the cleanup any longer could lead to severe consequences, he had to think quickly and improvise using the items available at hand. He recalled reading an article about using household items as cleaning solutions, and that's when it struck him: he could use a combination of baking soda and dish soap to tackle the problem. James started by carefully lifting the mat off the oily patch, ensuring that the oil didn't spread to the surrounding area. Once the mat was safely out of the way, he sprinkled a generous amount of baking soda over the spill. The baking soda served as an absorbent, effectively soaking up most of the oil from the floor's surface. After allowing it to sit for a few minutes, James used a stiff brush to scrub the oil and baking soda mixture, breaking down the remaining oil particles. Next, he applied a squirt of dish soap to the affected area, adding just enough water to create a soapy solution. As dish soap is a powerful degreaser, it helped in breaking down the remaining oil that had adhered to the floor. With a sponge in hand, James vigorously scrubbed the area until it was completely free of any residue. After ensuring that the area was thoroughly cleaned, James proceeded to dry it, using a clean cloth to absorb any remaining moisture. Once the floor was dry, he inspected the surface, relieved to find no signs of damage or remaining oil. The cleaning process had been successful, and James couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment in tackling the issue using an unconventional yet effective approach. Having learned his lesson, James decided that it was important to keep a better check on oil containers in order to avoid spills in the future. He made a mental note to store them more securely and to invest in quality cleaning products that could quickly and effectively tackle any accidental spills. Ultimately, the experience taught James the importance of being proactive in addressing potential hazards and of using household items as a resourceful alternative for when commercial cleaners were unavailable. This simple oil spill inadvertently turned into an experience that enriched James's understanding of household cleaning and resourcefulness, making him more prepared to tackle issues that might arise in the future."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

However, I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. However, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they indeed made a full movie, and a rather weak one at that. What is the sentiment of this review?

What is the title of this article: In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element. The operation satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.","output":"The title of the article isn't given in the text you provided. However, based on the content, it seems like it could be something like \\"Understanding Groups in Mathematics\\". This is because the text talks about what a group is in mathematics, and describes the group axioms - closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. It's like when we play with blocks: if we have a set of blocks (or numbers in math) and follow certain rules when we play (or do the operation in math), it becomes a specific type of game or system (in this case, a group).

This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With. Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent, stayed up late to do so, was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance,4% everything else, 1% history if that. It's what I call a bait and switch movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment, this movie is almost an insult to those who served. The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes, they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter's character. Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls, an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days, it would have either been the stockade or the infantry.

Movie title: Il Paese del Sesso Selvaggio Context: John Bradley is a British journalist and photographer on vacation in Bangkok, Thailand. He is first seen taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a kickboxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native Thai tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, Luhanà, is told that the group has captured a large fish-man.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a new robot explicitly designed to cater to the needs of elderly individuals by providing them affection through long-distance hugs. The primary goal of this invention entails offering comfort, emotional support, and enhancing social connectivity for seniors who may be facing isolation, loneliness, or living far from their loved ones. This innovative technology could alleviate the emotional and physical challenges endured by the elderly population, taking into account the therapeutic power of physical touch and the positive impacts it has on their overall well-being. The concept of long-distance hugs refers to the robot's ability to imitate the sensation of a hug for the user without the direct involvement of a human being. This may be achieved using interactive features, specialized mechanisms, or responsive materials that simulate the feeling of a warm embrace when activated. The goal is to create an experience as close to a real hug as possible, ensuring both physical and emotional benefits. One notable aspect of this robot is its dedication to catering specifically to the elderly population, which identifies a potential target market and demonstrates a recognition of a significant societal issue. As people grow older, situations like the loss of a spouse, children moving away, or health limitations may lead to increased feelings of loneliness and isolation. These feelings can have detrimental effects on an individual's physical and mental health, especially among the elderly who may be more vulnerable due to age-related factors. Developing a robot that provides affection in the form of long-distance hugs addresses these challenges by offering an innovative solution to reducing isolation and promoting overall well-being. The robot would be designed to bridge the gap between technology and human touch, providing warmth and comfort to the elderly users in the absence of their loved ones. Several research studies and user feedback would be instrumental in determining the factors that contribute to the perfect \\"hug\\" simulation. These factors may include force, pressure, warmth, positioning, and adaptability to the individual's physical condition. Additionally, considering the unique preferences and accessibility requirements of elderly users, this robot should be user-friendly, safe, and require minimal technical knowledge to operate. Alongside the physical aspects, the robot can also integrate features that help create an emotional bond by personalizing the user's experience. For example, it could be equipped with voice recognition technology, allowing for communication or playing pre-recorded messages from loved ones. Moreover, incorporating artificial intelligence could allow the robot to learn the user's preferences, understand their emotional needs, and adapt accordingly over time, making the robot a valuable companion. In conclusion, the text is about a new robot specifically designed to serve the elderly population by dispensing affection in the form of long-distance hugs. This invention aims to tackle the issue of loneliness and isolation among seniors, offering them a source of emotional support and physical comfort. By merging technology with human touch, this innovative robot has the potential to improve the quality of life and overall well-being of elderly individuals who may be distanced from their loved ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Hanja is the Korean name for Chinese characters. More specifically, it refers to those Chinese characters borrowed from Chinese and incorporated into the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. \\"Hanja-mal\\" or \\"hanja-eo\\" refers to words that can be written with hanja, and \\"hanmun\\" refers to Classical Chinese writing, although \\"hanja\\" is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts. Because hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to traditional Chinese and \\"kyjitai\\" characters. Only a small number of hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan and Mainland China have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding hanja characters.  - Chinese historiography is the study of the techniques and sources used by historians to develop the recorded history of China.  - The Song dynasty (9601279) was an era of Chinese history that began in 960 and continued until 1279. It succeeded the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, coincided with the Liao and Western Xia dynasties, and was followed by the Yuan dynasty. It was the first government in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy. This dynasty also saw the first known use of gunpowder, as well as the first discernment of true north using a compass.  - The Zizhi Tongjian ( Tzu - chih Tung - chien ; simplified Chinese :  ; traditional Chinese :  ; pinyin : Zzhì Tngjiàn ; Wade -- Giles : Tzu1 - chih4 T'ung1 - chien4 ; literally : \`\` Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance '' ) is a pioneering reference work in Chinese historiography , published in 1084 AD , in the form of a chronicle . In 1065 AD , Emperor Yingzong of Song ordered the great historian Sima Guang ( 1019 -- 1086 AD ) to lead with other scholars such as his chief assistants Liu Shu , Liu Ban and Fan Zuyu , the compilation of a universal history of China . The task took 19 years to be completed , and , in 1084 AD , it was presented to his successor Emperor Shenzong of Song . The Zizhi Tongjian records Chinese history from 403 BC to 959 AD , covering 16 dynasties and spanning across almost 1,400 years , and contains 294 volumes (  ) and about 3 million Chinese characters .  - Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With an estimated 90.5 million inhabitants , it is the world's 14th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976.  - Written records of the history of China can be found from as early as 1500 BC under the Shang dynasty (c. 16001046 BC). Ancient historical texts such as the \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\" (ca. 100 BC) and the \\"Bamboo Annals\\" describe a Xia dynasty (c. 20701600 BC), which had no system of writing on a durable medium, before the Shang. The Yellow River is said to be the cradle of Chinese civilization, although cultures originated at various regional centers along both the Yellow River and the Yangtze River valleys millennia ago in the Neolithic era. With thousands of years of continuous history, China is one of the world's oldest civilizations, and is regarded as one of the cradles of civilization.  - The Records of the Grand Historian, now usually known as the Shjì (\\"The Scribe's Records\\"), is a monumental history of ancient China and the world finished around 94 BC by the Han dynasty official Sima Qian after having been started by his father, Sima Tan, Grand Astrologer to the imperial court. The work covers the world as it was then known to the Chinese and a 2500-year period from the age of the legendary Yellow Emperor to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han in the author's own time.  - Wang Anshi (December 8, 1021  May 21, 1086) was a Chinese economist, statesman, chancellor and poet of the Song Dynasty who attempted major and controversial socioeconomic reforms known as the New Policies. These reforms constituted the core concepts of the Song-Dynasty Reformists, in contrast to their rivals, the Conservatives, led by the Chancellor Sima Guang.  - Sima Guang (17 November 1019  11 October 1086), courtesy name Junshi, was a high-ranking Song dynasty scholar-official and historian who authored the monumental history book \\"Zizhi Tongjian\\". Sima was a political conservative who opposed Wang Anshi's reforms.  - Kanji, or \\"kan'ji\\", are the adopted logographic Chinese characters (') that are used in the modern Japanese writing system along with hiragana and katakana.

Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.  - Chinese characters are logograms used in the writing of Chinese and some other Asian languages. In Standard Chinese, and sometimes also in English, they are called hànzì. They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as \\"kanji\\", Korean, where they are known as \\"hanja\\", and Vietnamese in a system known as \\"ch Nôm\\". Collectively, they are known as CJK characters. In English, they are sometimes called Han characters. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the Sinosphere, Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world by number of users.  - Emperor Yingzong of Song (16 February 1032  25 January 1067), personal name Zhao Shu, was the fifth emperor of the Song dynasty in China. His original personal name was Zhao Zongshi but it was changed to \\"Zhao Shu\\" in 1062 by imperial decree. He reigned from 1063 to his death in 1067. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Emperor Shenzong.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.  - In internationalization, CJK is a collective term for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, all of which use Chinese characters and derivatives (collectively, CJK characters) in their writing systems. Occasionally, Vietnamese is included, making the abbreviation CJKV, since Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters as well.  - In written language, a logogram or logograph is a written character that represents a word or phrase. Chinese characters and Japanese kanji are logograms; some Egyptian hieroglyphs and some graphemes in cuneiform script are also logograms. The use of logograms in writing is called \\"logography\\". A writing system that is based on logograms is called a \\"logographic system\\".  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - The Xia dynasty (c. 2070  c. 1600 BCE) is the first dynasty in traditional Chinese history. It is described in ancient historical chronicles such as the \\"Bamboo Annals\\", the \\"Classic of History\\" and the \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\". According to tradition, the dynasty was established by the legendary Yu the Great after Shun, the last of the Five Emperors gave his throne to him. The Xia was later succeeded by the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 c. 1046 BCE).

In 1993, the Breeders released their second album, Last Splash. At this time, the group's lineup  consisted of sisters Kim and Kelley Deal on guitar and vocals, Josephine Wiggs on bass and vocals, and Jim Macpherson on drums. Last Splash was successful in various countries worldwide, and the group toured extensively and played at Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs left to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, and then in the 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' lineups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.On December 31, 2013, the Breeders performed their final concert on the 60-date tour in Austin, Texas. The group enjoyed the LSXX concerts, and decided they would like to record new music together.

The first step we took was to clear out all the items that were stored in the refrigerator. We carefully placed the perishable items in a cooler filled with ice packs, making sure they would stay fresh and cool during the moving process. Non-perishable items were set aside on the kitchen counter, as they could be easily organized later. The next step was to unplug the refrigerator and wrap the electrical cord securely so it wouldn't get caught on anything during the move. We made sure to use a cable tie to keep the cord organized and compact. After completing this, we inspected the refrigerator for any loose parts, and we tightened any screws or bolts that seemed loose in order to prevent any accidents. Before starting the moving process, we planned our path from the kitchen to the hallway, identifying any potential obstacles, such as door frames, furniture, or other household items that might be in the way. We also decided to lay down some protective material, like cardboard or moving blankets, on the floor to protect it from any scratches that could be caused by the refrigerator's wheels or legs. Once everything was in place, we enlisted the help of a few friends to assist us in moving the refrigerator. Proper lifting techniques were crucial in order to avoid injury, so we bent our knees and kept our backs straight as we lifted the heavy appliance off the ground. We managed to maneuver the refrigerator through the narrow kitchen doorway and carefully rolled it alongside the planned path. Upon reaching the hallway, we had to ensure that the refrigerator was positioned in such a way that it's still easily accessible and wouldn't obstruct the walking path. We also made sure to leave enough space around the refrigerator for proper ventilation, as it helps avoid overheating and keeps the appliance running efficiently. After the refrigerator was set in its new place, we reconnected the power and allowed it to settle for some time before putting the items back in. Following the manufacturer's recommendations, we let the refrigerator run for about an hour before we began restocking the items. This was done in order to ensure that the appliance was working properly and the temperature inside was constant and stable. Once we were confident in the refrigerator's performance, we carefully placed the perishable items back inside, followed by the non-perishable items. Then, we took some time to organize the refrigerator so that it was easier to access and locate the items we needed.

Q: Question: A place with a _____ water table means wells can be dug at deeper depths.   Answer: low A:","output":"A place with a low water table means wells can be dug at deeper depths. Explanation: The water table is the upper surface of the zone of saturation in the ground, where the soil, rock, or sediment is fully saturated with water. When a water table is high, it means that the depth at which water can be found is relatively shallow, whereas in areas where the water table is low, the water is found at greater depths below the surface. In areas with a low water table, wells must be dug deeper in order to reach the saturated zone and access water. This is because the water is not readily available close to the surface, and to obtain it, one has to dig into the ground further than in areas with a high water table. Low water table areas may result from various factors, such as: 1. Climate: In arid and semi-arid regions, low precipitation rates and high evaporation rates contribute to lower water tables. 2. Geology: The type of soil or underlying rock can influence the water table; some layers of rock may impede the flow of water, resulting in lower water tables in certain areas. 3. Human activities: Over-pumping of groundwater resources in some regions can cause water tables to drop, making it necessary to dig deeper wells to access water. In summary, a place with a low water table requires wells to be dug at deeper depths to access the necessary groundwater, due to factors such as climate, geology, and human activities affecting the water table levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction or discontent with the subject of the review, which could be a restaurant, a dish, or a product. When they say, \\"Not my favorite,\\" they are subtly implying that they didn't particularly enjoy whatever they are discussing.

This isolation also reflects in the fauna species and in the water salinity, which is lower than in the ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia.

OPTIONS: (1). yes (2). no","output":"To determine whether \\"Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms.\\" is the correct answer or not, let's review the context and compare it to other potential defenses. Step 1: Understanding the context The spread of unwanted organisms can lead to infections and diseases. It can be crucial to minimize the spread of these organisms to maintain personal and public health. Step 2: Comparing with other potential defenses There are multiple defenses to prevent the spread of unwanted organisms: - Vaccination - Quarantine and isolation - Proper food handling and storage - Disinfection and sterilization - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - Hygiene and cleanliness practices, including hand washing Step 3: Evaluating the defenses While vaccination and other measures like isolation are crucial to prevent the spread of specific unwanted organisms, hand washing is a measure that applies to a broader range of circumstances. Additionally, proper food handling and storage helps prevent foodborne illnesses caused by unwanted organisms. Likewise, disinfection and sterilization are vital in healthcare settings and PPE usage is essential in specific scenarios.

Read this: The members of The Beatles were made MBEs in 1965. John Lennon justified the comparative merits of his investiture by comparing military membership in the Order: \\"Lots of people who complained about us receiving the MBE [status] received theirs for heroism in the war – for killing people… We received ours for entertaining other people. I'd say we deserve ours more.\\" Lennon later returned his MBE insignia on 25 November 1969 as part of his ongoing peace protests. Other criticism centres on the claim that many recipients of the Order are being rewarded with honours for simply doing their jobs; critics claim that the civil service and judiciary receive far more orders and honours than leaders of other professions. Who were MBE'S? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"MBEs, or Members of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, are individuals who have been recognized for their contributions to society in various fields, including the arts, sciences, education, public service, and charitable work. This designation is part of the British honors system, which acknowledges the achievements and service of people both within the United Kingdom and across the British Empire. The Order of the British Empire was established in 1917 by King George V and has several ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GBE), Knight Commander (KBE), Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE), and Member (MBE). In 1965, the members of The Beatles, a famous British rock band, were made MBEs for their contributions to music and entertainment. John Lennon, one of the band members, defended their investiture by comparing it to military membership in the Order, where individuals received MBE status for acts of heroism, which often involved killing people during a war. Lennon argued that The Beatles deserved their MBEs for providing entertainment to others, which he viewed as a more positive contribution to society. However, some criticisms of the British honors system argue that many people receive MBEs and other honors simply for doing their jobs, rather than for exceptional achievements. Some critics believe that certain professions, such as the civil service and judiciary, receive a disproportionately high number of orders and honors compared to other fields, which may be perceived as unfair or biased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Larger species of bamboo, such as moso, grow especially fast and become healthiest when they're exposed to full sunlight after the germination process.  Try to avoid planting your moso bamboo in an area where there are surrounding trees or buildings that will minimize sunlight.   (1). If you're in a shaded area, try to wait until the sun is at its highest. Instead, keep the plant in another, non-shaded area.  (2). While other types of bamboo and plants in general can thrive while being exposed to three or so hours of sunlight a day, moso bamboo needs six or more. Make sure the area has a water source.  (3). For most moso bamboo, the ideal location is sheltered from direct sunlight. Avoid planting moso bamboo anywhere other than on a patio, in a well-lit field, or anywhere near a body of water, such as an irrigation system.  (4). This could become a problem for the plants trying to grow. Some places where moso varieties are grown naturally are also likely to have patches of tropical vegetation, such as coral or mangroves, that provide shade and warmth.","output":"(2).

Select the topic that this about: MacCentral - Analysts from Prudential Equity Group and UBS have warned over the past two days that longer than expected G5 delays from IBM Corp. is the near-term \\"key risk\\" for Apple Computer Inc. Both firms are concerned the delays could be longer than originally expected.","output":"This topic is about the potential impact of longer than expected G5 delays from IBM Corp on Apple Computer Inc., as well as the concerns expressed by analysts from Prudential Equity Group and UBS. IBM Corp., a multinational technology company, is the provider of G5 processors which were used in some models of Apple's computers, specifically the Power Mac G5 and iMac G5. The G5 processor is a high-performance, power-efficient chip that allows computers to run faster and more efficiently. In this situation, analysts from Prudential Equity Group and UBS have issued warnings that longer than expected delays in the production and delivery of the G5 processors from IBM could pose a significant near-term risk for Apple Computer Inc. Both firms are concerned that the delays could be more extended than initially anticipated due to possible supply chain issues, production problems, or other unforeseen circumstances. These delays could have a substantial impact on Apple, possibly affecting its product launches, sales, and overall market position. There are several potential consequences of these G5 delays for Apple Computer Inc., which are of concern to these analysts: 1. Impact on product launches: Apple relies heavily on the timely availability of essential components like the G5 processor to launch new computer models or update existing ones. Delays in receiving these processors could significantly impact Apple's planned product release schedule, potentially postponing or disrupting product launches. 2. Impact on sales: If there are extended delays in the availability of G5 processors, Apple may face difficulties in meeting the demand for its G5-based products. This could lead to a decrease in sales and revenue for the company, as well as dissatisfied customers who may turn to competitors. 3. Impact on customer trust and brand loyalty: Prolonged delays in the availability of crucial components, leading to disrupted product launches or shortages, could erode customer trust and affect Apple's brand loyalty. As a result, customers may consider alternative brands or hold off on purchasing Apple's products, impacting its market share and profitability. 4. Increased competition: If Apple faces delays in obtaining the G5 processors, it could allow competitors to gain an edge in the market. Other companies could seize the opportunity to introduce new products or promote their existing offerings to customers who may be seeking alternatives to G5-based Apple products. Addressing the concerns raised by the analysts from Prudential Equity Group and UBS, Apple may need to take the following steps to minimize the impact of these delays: 1. Develop contingency plans: Apple should develop contingency plans for mitigating the effects of extended G5 delays. This may include alternative sourcing strategies, emergency stockpiling of inventory, or adjusting production timelines to adapt to the delays. 2. Strengthen communication with IBM: Apple should ensure regular communication with IBM to stay updated on the status of G5 processor production and deliveries. This information would help Apple respond proactively to any potential changes in the supply chain and better manage risks. 3. Enhance customer engagement: Apple would need to communicate transparently and proactively with its customers regarding product availability and any potential delays. This communication could help manage customer expectations, maintain trust, and minimize the negative impact on brand loyalty. In conclusion, the potential impact of extended G5 delays from IBM Corp. is a significant near-term risk for Apple Computer Inc., as expressed by the analysts from Prudential Equity Group and UBS. By proactively addressing these risks – through contingency planning, improved communication with suppliers, and enhanced customer engagement – Apple can minimize the negative effects on its sales, brand loyalty, and market position."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis \\"Training employees is a key factor enabling employee involvement\\" can be concluded as true based on the given premise \\"Employees' capabilities also play an important role in achieving performance improvements, and training is a key factor enabling employee involvement.\\" The premise suggests that for an organization to achieve performance improvements, the capabilities of its employees are significant. Employee capabilities are the skills, knowledge, and abilities that allow them to perform their jobs and contribute positively to the organization. One way to enhance these capabilities is through training. Training employees helps them develop new skills and improve their existing ones. It equips them with the necessary tools and knowledge to handle their tasks confidently and efficiently. A well-trained employee is more likely to be engaged in their role, as they feel empowered to contribute their best efforts to their job and help the organization achieve its goals. Moreover, when employees receive adequate training, they become more involved in their work and are often more committed to the organization. Training provides them with a sense of ownership of their responsibilities and a higher understanding of the importance of their roles. As a result, they are more motivated to participate actively in organizational activities inside and outside of their job scope, leading to increased involvement. Training not only enhances employees' technical and professional skills but also helps them develop personal skills that can positively impact their relationships with their colleagues, managers, and other stakeholders. Effective training focuses on communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, and other soft skills that are essential for a harmonious work environment. As employees enhance their interpersonal skills, they are more likely to collaborate, support each other, and contribute to a better organizational atmosphere. In conclusion, based on the premise given, we can assert that the hypothesis \\"Training employees is a key factor enabling employee involvement\\" is true. Providing adequate training opportunities for employees leads to increased involvement by improving their capabilities, empowering them to excel in their roles, and fostering a healthy work environment where they feel motivated to collaborate and contribute to the success of the organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ihmiset ovat nykyään entistä tietoisempia erilaisista terveyskysymyksistä ja niiden vaikutuksista yleiseen hyvinvointiin. Tämä on johtanut lisääntyneeseen keskusteluun aiheista kuten antibiootit, salmonella ja lisäaineet. Antibiootit ovat tärkeä osa nykyaikaista lääketiedettä. Ne auttavat meitä torjumaan bakteeri-infektioita ja suojaavat elimistöämme monilta vakavilta sairauksilta. Viime vuosina ihmiset ovat kuitenkin alkaneet ymmärtää antibioottiresistenssin vaarat. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että bakteerit kehittyvät vastustuskykyisiksi antibiooteille, minkä seurauksena lääkkeet menettävät tehonsa. Tämän vuoksi on tärkeää käyttää antibiootteja vain silloin, kun ne ovat todella tarpeen. Toinen terveyteen liittyvä kysymys on salmonella. Tämä bakteeri voi aiheuttaa vakavia vatsa- ja suolistosairauksia, jotka aiheuttavat oireita kuten ripulia, kuumetta ja vatsakipuja. Salmonellan saastuttamat elintarvikkeet ovat yleinen syy tällaisiin sairauksiin. Tästä syystä on erittäin tärkeää huolehtia hygieniasta ja ruuanlaiton turvallisuudesta sekä valita huolellisesti, mistä ostamme elintarvikkeita, kuten lihaa ja kananmunia. Lisäksi keskusteluun nousee yhä useammin myös elintarvikkeiden lisäaineet. Nämä aineet lisätään elintarvikkeisiin erilaisten ominaisuuksien, kuten säilyvyyden, maun, rakenteen tai värin parantamiseksi. Vaikka monia lisäaineita pidetään turvallisina, osa niistä on kyseenalaistettu terveysriskeihin liittyen. Tämän takia monet ihmiset pyrkivät välttämään elintarvikkeita, joissa on runsaasti lisäaineita, ja suosimaan sen sijaan luonnollisia ja tuoreita raaka-aineita.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now. Question: Why did the babies have to go to the NICU? Options:  A. because the labor was too long  B. not enough information  C. because they were in a small town  D. because they were born 2 months early The answer is:","output":"D. because they were born 2 months early"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Scotland hero Shaun Maloney thanked coach Stuart McCall for being the architect of the glorious goal that sank the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park. The Wigan man savoured perhaps his finest moment in the dark blue of his country — and an unforgettable career highlight — when he curled home a brilliant shot from the fringe of the area with 15 minutes remaining. It was a sublime finishing touch to the nimblest of moves, with Maloney and Ikechi Anya working a short corner routine before skipper Scott Brown set up his former Celtic team-mate with a back-heel flick. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch. Shaun Maloney (left) celebrates after scoring the winner for Scotland against the Republic of Ireland. Scotland coach Stuart McCall (second left) celebrates on the touchline after Maloney's goal. Maloney revealed it was a routine plotted by former Motherwell manager McCall — Scotland’s third in command — during preparations at their Mar Hall training base. But the 31-year-old revealed it was very much a case of alright on the night after a series of botched attempts at the move in the build-up to the crunch Euro 2016 qualifier. ‘I was confident that we would score but maybe not in the way we did,’ admitted Maloney. ‘It was a slight variation on what we worked on in training. The way Ireland set up made us change it slightly. We worked on something similar this week and the coach has to take credit for this. ‘It was Stuart McCall, he worked on it. It came off slightly differently to what we had been planning. Stuart and Mark McGhee work pretty hard on these set-pieces and they don’t always come off. ‘It went in zero times in training! These things you practise hundreds of times and you just kind of hope that they (the opposition) switch off and it happens in a match like it did tonight. ‘You get an initial reaction when connecting with the ball, but the difference between that going in and hitting the post is millimetres. You know you have a fair chance of scoring, but it was just pure elation at the time when it went in. ‘I’ve been fortunate to score some special goals — but this is right up there and it meant the world to me and the team. It was a special moment to be part of. The Scotland fans go wild as Maloney's goal helps move them up to third in Euro 2016 qualifying Group D. ‘There wasn’t much in the game and it wasn’t overly pretty. We always felt there would be one moment either for us or Ireland that would settle the game.’ On a bruising night at Celtic Park, captain Scott Brown insisted Scotland had defied an Irish plan to knock them out of their stride — by fair means or foul. Martin O’Neill’s side thundered into challenges throughout the match, earning four bookings to the two picked up by Strachan’s side. Seamus Coleman could well have seen red for clattering through goal hero Maloney in the latter stages but Serbian referee Milorad Mazic allowed play to continue and didn’t return with a second yellow card for the Everton right-back. That kind of physical confrontation is meat-and-drink to toughened competitors such as Brown, but he expressed pride in the way the entire Scottish team stood tall. ‘I think Ireland’s gameplan was to try and stop us playing football,’ said Brown. ‘But it didn’t work. ‘We still managed to get the ball down in tight situations and play, knock nice little one-twos and create chances for ourselves. Maloney curls a low strike across goal and into the far bottom corner to clinch victory for the hosts. ‘Were Ireland lucky to finish with 11 men? I don’t know. There were a few rough tackles but I didn’t get a good eye on them. ‘Overall, it was a good night. It wasn’t the best performance in the world but we got the victory. ‘I think Ireland came up with a plan where they tried to play from back to front. They tried to impose their own gameplan but we kept trying to get the ball down and trying to play. ‘Did we deserve to win? Yeah. Definitely. I think we were the better team from start to finish. We tried to play football and I think that is what the fans keep coming along to see.’ The Scotland camp had protested pre-match that last night’s encounter was not a ‘must-win’ occasion, but Brown did not attempt to downplay the importance of the result. Poland’s rout of Georgia merely increased the need for victory, with Strachan’s side now sitting alongside Ireland and world champions Germany on seven points after four games. England visit Parkhead for a high-profile friendly on Tuesday evening before Gibraltar come to Glasgow on Euro 2016 business in March. The return match with O’Neill’s men is in Dublin in June. ‘It is shaping up to be a great group and there is still an awful lot to do,’ said Brown. The ball curls into the net as the Republic of Ireland defenders can only look on. ‘We just want to keep things going when the qualifiers start again. ‘This has been a great result in front of 60,000 people at Celtic Park. It is huge for us. ‘We have got a winning mentality and we want to continue it. We have another big game on Tuesday night against England. ‘Even though it is a friendly we want to keep the winning mentality that the manager has instilled in us. We follow his lead and we try to get the ball down to play football that entertains the fans who come along. ‘None of like to get beat and you could see that tonight in our performance. All 11 men defended at times and then we worked together to create chances. We were putting pressure on their defence and eventually it paid off. ‘We can do both sides to the game. We can defend and we can play football and counter-attack with pace.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Scotland's hero Shaun Maloney thanked coach Stuart McCall for being the architect of the glorious goal that sank the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park.

Write a title for this article: Despite a new sense of vigor in the candidacy of Mrs. Clinton, who had raised questions about Mr. Obama’s experience to guide and protect the nation, his advisers were planning to unveil a new strategy to persuade Democrats to coalesce around him for the good of the party. “We know that there’s not going to be a huge shift in delegates one way or the other, just given the math,” Mr. Obama told reporters earlier in the day as he flew across Texas. That meant, he said, “either way we’ll go on to Mississippi and Wyoming next week.” Democrats are scheduled to hold caucuses on Saturday in Wyoming. The Mississippi primary is next Tuesday. For weeks, the Obama campaign has been organizing in both of those states. And Mr. Obama was hoping for a strong showing in them to help replenish the confidence that sustained his campaign throughout February as he racked up victories in all corners of the country. While Mr. Obama emerged from the four primaries on Tuesday with an advantage in pledged delegates, efforts to persuade Democrats to unite around him were slowed by the strongest performance Mrs. Clinton had registered in a month. “We are going to have to earn this victory,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “We are running against very determined and tough opponents, and I want to make sure we never forget that.” A bruising advertising campaign by Mrs. Clinton appeared to have raised fresh concerns about his candidacy. Democratic voters in Ohio who made up their minds in the final days before the primary favored her, according to exit polls. David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama, said the Clinton campaign had pursued the approach of “attack, attack, attack.” But the defeats in Rhode Island, Ohio and Texas would not greatly affect the state of the race, Mr. Axelrod said, adding, “They promised they would wipe out our delegate lead, but they haven’t put a dent in it.” Mr. Axelrod signaled a fierce fight in the coming weeks. “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” he said. He said voters should consider Mrs. Clinton’s decision not to release her tax returns and papers from former President Bill Clinton’s library. Mr. Axelrod also challenged the press to look closely at her legislative achievements. Still, Mr. Obama’s advisers were poring over the trends that emerged Tuesday, particularly with an eye on Pennsylvania, the next major primary. Mrs. Clinton maintained an edge over Mr. Obama among women, whites, Hispanics, older voters and those with less education. Mr. Obama continued to edge her out among men, blacks, younger voters and those with more education, according to an exit poll conducted statewide by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool. In contrast to a recent trend, Mrs. Clinton was running evenly with Mr. Obama among white men. “No matter what happens tonight,” Mr. Obama told his supporters here, “we have the same delegate lead as we had this morning, and we are on our way to winning this nomination.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Obama Seeks to Rally Backers After Clinton Victories.

Please briefly summarize this news article: California teacher holds secret class Los Angeles (CNN) – On a brisk, spring-like day in March, Diana Rivera walked into a classroom at Centinela Valley Adult School, just like she’d done everyday for nearly the past two months. She was eager to hear a lecture in her “medical assistant” class, a course she believed would be key to successfully starting a career in the medical field. Getting there had been a struggle. “I searched and searched for so long,” she said. “I tried to get in three years ago, but there was a waiting list.” The medical assistant course was started 12 years ago, and over the years, it grew to become one of the most popular on campus. But on that day, just as Rivera was settling into her coursework, everything changed. “They just came in, gave us notice that school was over, and took us out,\\" she said. And just like that, her dreams vanished. The class and its instructor were suddenly eliminated due to cuts in state funding. “It was devastating,” Rivera said. “I was let down.” But as she was escorted off campus that morning, what she didn’t know was that her teacher was also about to become her champion. Educator Cristina Chiappe, who created the course and has taught it since its inception, suddenly found herself unemployed. And while she no longer had a physical location to teach, she never once thought to stop the class. “I didn’t want to leave my students with nothing. They cut the money back. This is not all about money, it’s about education,” she said. So Chiappe came up with an idea – one that her students and onlookers have described as “brave”, “risky” and “heroic.” She decided to continue teaching her group of displaced students, and open her own school. \\"The students wanted to continue their education,\\" she said. \\"I proposed to them, if we can open our own site…we'd be able to buy all the equipment so that they can have hands-on training. So we did it.\\" Her students were thrilled, but nervous at the same time. \\"We knew it was going to be something different. You don’t hear this every day. We were ready for the ride, but also a little scared,\\" Rivera said. Of the 20 students enrolled in the original class, 16 young women pledged to give Chiappe their full support and embark on this adventure. But first, there were some barriers to confront. Chiappe successfully registered her not-for-profit school, South Bay Careers, with the state of California and Los Angeles County. However, her application for a business license from the City of Lawndale was denied due to insufficient parking, she said. “I was pretty shook up,” she said. Thinking about how she didn’t want to see her students let down a second time, Chiappe decided to continue her class in a secret location. She agreed to show CNN her classroom on condition we don’t disclose its whereabouts. Each of her students paid 1,600, which covered rent, liability insurance, utilities, a television, Internet service, and medical supplies. Chiappe herself went without a salary. The doors were open within weeks. “I couldn’t believe it,” student Sally Montenegro said. “The first day we were in class, everybody was laughing. We couldn’t believe she got the place, she had the tables and everything set up.” Many of her students couldn’t afford to pay the tuition upfront. So she bought text books and medical equipment as the money trickled in. “Little by little, she started buying [the instructional materials], and we were always excited when new equipment came in to get the hands-on training,” Montenegro said. The room slowly filled to include exam tables, stethoscopes, an electrocardiogram, baby mannequins and surgical scissors. “It was a team effort,” Chiappe said. “The students and I, we did it together. I can’t take all the credit. They believed in my dream.” But that dream didn’t come without tremendous personal sacrifice. “The rent is due on the first of the month, and if I didn’t have the money, I had to reach into my pocket,” Chiappe said. “When I was laid off from Centinela, my husband and I (who is also a teacher), sat down and we looked at the numbers, and there was no way I could keep my house.” The Chiappe family decided to sell her home and rent. “All the efforts should be in the school, versus paying the mortgage,” she said. Her efforts paid off. Chiappe successfully led her 16 students, who she says she considers to be “family” now, through the course. She also placed them into externships with physician offices in the South Bay community. When they complete 160 hours of service, the young women will receive a course completion certificate and be on their way to starting full-time careers as a medical assistant. Once their class work was complete, the group even staged a small graduation ceremony, complete with the requisite caps and gowns. It was only then, as the students celebrated their success, that Chiappe told them of the missing license, and the need to hold their class in a secret location. “I wanted the students to finish their program. I said from the beginning, ‘I’m going to finish with them, and then everything here will go into storage and I’ll get a proper permit,” Chiappe said. The students were floored when they heard this. “It came as a shock,” Rivera said. “It’s very brave of her to do.” “The risk she has taken for us is just amazing, there are no barriers for her,” said Montenegro. Centinela Valley Adult School has not reinstated their medical assistant course, said Jose Fernandez, superintendent of the Centinela Valley Union High School District. If one of the two state education tax initiatives are approved in the November election, the board will address the possibility of bringing it back. Moving forward, Chiappe plans to focus on cultivating South Bay Careers. Her first step is to ensure she has a city business license. “I will do what I need to get things done, but the law is the law. And I will follow the law, and get the proper permits,\\" she said. She is currently scouring different cities to work in and is applying for business licenses within those communities. “In order for me to apply, they have a fee. Obviously, I don’t have the money to pay, but God will provide. That is my rule,” she said. The risk and the sacrifices she made over the last five months were a small price to pay, she said. “I’m very humble when it comes to what I do. I get emotional about this because this is something I really believe the students need,\\" she said. \\"Many of them don’t have a chance to have a formal education. Some of them are single moms, some of them don’t have jobs, some of them are on welfare. I know them well, because I’m part of them.” Summary:","output":"A California teacher named Cristina Chiappe, who taught a medical assistant class, kept teaching her class even after it was cancelled due to state funding cuts. She opened her own secret school and her students helped pay for it. She made sure they finished their course and got experience in physician offices. Because of her bravery and hard work, her students were able to continue learning and start their careers in the medical field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It’s a sunny and warm day in Los Angeles—a bit of a weather shock to me after 11 years of Seattle’s cold and rain. I’ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment. The Iris logo, and the hair-pulling it was causing for all of us—which is a pretty good representation of the steps that Web projects go through as we move from idea, to execution, to setback, to solution. What does Lanni think of starting a new job? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Lanni is confident in his skills  B. Lanni is only somewhat confident in his skills  C. not enough information  D. Lanni is not confident in his skills","output":"C. Not enough information Let's take a closer look at the situation and the information provided.

While the story shares his background, experience, and the projects he is currently working on, there is no direct statement or indication regarding Lanni's confidence level in his skills when starting his new job at the Getty. As a result, we do not have enough information to determine his level of confidence accurately from the options presented. The focus of this story is more on the process of executing web projects and the challenges that arise during that process, as exemplified by the struggle to perfect The Iris logo.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: People are always talking about \\"the problem of youth\\". If there is one--which I take leave to doubt--then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. Let us get down to something basic and agree that the young are after all human beings--people just like their elders. There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a beautiful future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him and maybe that is where the _ is. When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and unknown--that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking. I find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they have not a dull promise to mean ambitions  or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to important things. All these seem to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It is as if they were in some sense from outside space and lovely contrast with us suburban people. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be ill-mannered, self-confident, but I do not turn for protection to boring cliches  about respect for elders as if the age is a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong. Question: From the text we can see the writer's attitude towards the young is   _  . Answer: Pick from: [-] kind and satisfied; [-] considerate and understanding; [-] angry and unpleased; [-] hopeless and boring; The answer is:","output":"\\"considerate and understanding.\\"  Justification: Throughout the text, the writer exhibits an understanding perspective towards the youth, seeing them not as problems but as human beings similar to their elders but filled with a sense of freedom and ambition. The writer appreciates the excitement and freshness the youth bring, their lack of societal anxiety, and their zeal for life. They also consider themselves to be on the same level with the young, willing to engage in disputes as equals if needed.

Based on the premise \\"A stealthy footstep on the stairs? \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"There is a ninja on the stairs.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"A stealthy footstep on the stairs?\\", we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"There is a ninja on the stairs.\\" is true. While a ninja can indeed produce stealthy footsteps, there are several other factors and possibilities we should consider before jumping to this conclusion. First, let's examine the premise itself: \\"A stealthy footstep on the stairs?\\". This statement is presented as a question, which indicates that there is an element of doubt or uncertainty about whether the detected sound was actually a stealthy footstep. It is possible that the sound could have originated from a different source (e.g., floorboards or stair mechanisms creaking, a family pet, or an object falling). Assuming that the sound was indeed a stealthy footstep, the link to a ninja is just one possibility among several others. Below are a few possibilities to consider: 1. Non-ninja humans: The stealthy footstep could be produced by a non-ninja individual, such as a regular person trying to avoid waking up other occupants in the house. This could be a family member, a friend, or even an uninvited guest. 2. Animals: It is possible that the footstep sound could be produced by an animal, such as a pet, a stray, or even a wild animal that has gained entry to the building. 3. Non-human entities: In stories, films, or games, the source of the stealthy sound could be attributed to non-human entities like ghosts, supernatural beings, or artificially intelligent beings (robots or androids). 4. Misinterpretation: It is human nature to make assumptions based on previous experiences, knowledge, or fears. In some instances, our brains can misinterpret sounds or even \\"create\\" them due to stress, fatigue, or heightened emotions. This is an important psychological factor to consider in determining the relevance of the premise. 5. Practical jokes or experiments: The footstep sound could be the result of a practical joke or an experiment being conducted by someone to gauge the reactions of others within the premises. To conclude, while a stealthy footstep could indeed be produced by a ninja, we cannot assume that this is the only reasonable explanation. The premise \\"A stealthy footstep on the stairs?\\" is not sufficient to conclusively prove the hypothesis \\"There is a ninja on the stairs.\\" is true. A more thorough investigation, accounting for multiple possibilities and depending on further information or confirmation, would be needed to reach a accurate conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Problem:Article: Young children are trusting of commercial advertisements in the media, and advertisers have sometimes been accused of taking advantage of this trusting outlook The Independent Television Commission,regulator of television advertising, has criticized advertisers for \\"misleadingness\\",in an effort to control advertisers,use of techniques that make it difficult for children to judge the true size, action ,performance, or construction of a toy. Fantasy is one of the common techniques in advertising that could mislead young audience.In children's advertising, advertisers are more likely to include fantasy than advertisements aimed at adults.In a content analysis of Canadian television, the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all commercials for character toys featured fantasy play.Children have strong imaginations and the use of fantasy brings their ideas to life, but children may not be adept enough to realize that what they are viewing is unreal Fantasy situations are frequently used to attract children's attention, particularly in food advertising.Advertisements for breakfast have been found to be especially fond of fantasy \\" techniques.Generally, there is uncertainty as to whether very young children can distinguish between fantasy and reality in advertising. The use of pop stars such as singers and movie stars is common in advertising.The intention is for the positive qualities of the popular to be transferred to the advertised product and for the two to become linked in audience's mind.In children's advertising ,the pop stars are often vivid figures from popular cartoons.In recent years- the role of pop stars in advertising to children has often been combined with the concept of host selling.Host selling involves advertisements with regular programming in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other.Host selling occurs ,for example, when a children's show about a cartoon lion contains an advertisement in which the same lion promotes a breakfast.The psychologist Dale Kunkel shows that the practice of host selling has reduced children's ability to distinguish between advertising and the program material.Meanwhile,he also shows some other tricky advertisements.   Question: What can we learn about the fantasy technique from the passage?   Options: (A) It is especially used in advertising toys. (B) Children are likely to mistake it for reality.

I was very impressed by the original John Carpenter's Vampires and when I descovered there was a sequel I went straight out and bought it. This movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first, and it is not quite so dark, but it is close enough and I felt that it built nicely on the original.Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favourite parts was just after he meets Zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems. His comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds.The other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film. It is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way Fright Night II grew out of Fright Night.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose wife Irina was later told he had been blackmailed?  The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"...

However, the journey they had embarked on was proving to be more than just a mere sharing of talents. As they spent more time together, they developed a strong bond, solidifying their newfound friendship. Having known the art of ventriloquism for years, Carrie had become an expert, performing at various events around the city. She possessed a remarkable ability to captivate the audience with her wit, charm, and impressive techniques. When Emily expressed her desire to learn ventriloquism, Carrie was more than happy to mentor her – she recognized the potential in her friend. The two friends spent countless hours in Carrie's living room, practicing and laughing at each other's mistakes and progress. Carrie had her favorite puppet, a charming and mischievous little fox named Titus, which had been her sidekick for years. For Emily, she had just bought a new puppet, a lovely owl named Olivia, which she believed perfectly represented her personality – wise, attentive, and inquisitive. Today, Carrie planned to have a mock performance to evaluate Emily's progress. Emily had been practicing diligently; notwithstanding, she was still a bit nervous about her proficiency. Her mind raced with thoughts, doubts, and anticipation, but Carrie, the ever-supportive friend, encouraged and reassured her that she would do just fine. The audience for the mock performance included some of their close friends and family members, carefully selected to ensure a positive and supportive environment. They gathered in the cozy living room, excited to witness this unique moment of amateur ventriloquism. Carrie opened the show, showcasing her skills with Titus, entertaining the room with witty jokes and flawless ventriloquism. Her performance both impressed the audience and put them at ease, creating the perfect setting for Emily's debut. Finally, the moment arrived for Emily to take center stage, or rather, the center of the living room. Her heart pounded in her chest as she faced her first-ever live audience. Clutching Olivia the owl tightly, she took a deep breath – a gesture that conveyed determination, mixed with the slightest hint of apprehension. As she began her routine, her nerves slowly dissipated. Her lips remained motionless while she masterfully projected her voice through the inquisitive owl. Emily found herself enjoying the thrill of performance, and the audience responded with bursts of laughter and enthusiastic applause. After her skit, she could hardly believe that she had completed her first performance without fumbling. She looked at Carrie, her eyes brimming with gratitude and excitement. Carrie beamed proudly at her protégé, elated by her success. The two friends shared a warm embrace, acknowledging the growth, friendship, and shared passion rooted in their training sessions. Carrie and Emily continued to perform together, traveling to different cities, and even taking their ventriloquism skills to television shows and competitions. With each performance, their skills and confidence grew, but more importantly, their friendship deepened. As the years went by, the two ventriloquists became inseparable, more like sisters than friends. Through hardships and triumphs, they defied expectations and created countless stories that they shared – not only with each other but the world. The journey that began with a simple exchange of teachings grew into a lifelong adventure, one that they would both cherish and continuously nurture in the years to come. Thus, the story of Carrie and Emily serves as an endearing reminder that passions can forge powerful bonds, binding kindred souls in a journey of love, laughter, and growth. In the magical and captivating world of ventriloquism, this tale of friendship and determination will forever hold a special place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It reached the peak of its military, political and economic power under the Spanish Habsburgs, through most of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its greatest territorial extent under the House of Bourbon in the 18th century, when it was the largest empire in the world. The Spanish Empire became the foremost global power of its time and was the first to be called \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\".  - The Philippine Revolution (Filipino: \\"Himagsikang Pilipino\\"), also called the Tagalog War by the Spanish, was a revolution and subsequent conflict fought between the people of the Philippines and the Spanish colonial authorities.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - The phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" has been used with variations to describe certain global empires that were so extensive that there was always at least one part of their territory that was in daylight.  - The Cry of Pugad Lawin ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Pugad Lawin ) , alternately and originally referred to as the Cry of Balintawak ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Balíntawak , Spanish : Grito de Balíntawak ) , was the beginning of the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire . At the close of August 1896 , members of the Katipunan secret society ( Katipuneros ) led by Andrés Bonifacio rose up in revolt somewhere in an area referred to as Kalookan , wider than the jurisdiction of present - day Caloocan City which may have overlapped into present - day Quezon City . Originally the term \`\` Cry '' referred to the first clash between the Katipuneros and the Civil Guards ( Guardia Civil ) . The cry could also refer to the tearing up of community tax certificates ( cédulas personales ) in defiance of their allegiance to Spain . This was literally accompanied by patriotic shouts . Because of competing accounts and ambiguity of the place where this event took place , the exact date and place of the Cry is in contention . From 1908 until 1963 , the official stance was that the Cry occurred on August 26 in Balintawak . In 1963 the Philippine government declared a shift to August 23 in Pugad Lawin , Quezon City .  - The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty.

He was the author of a chronicle or historical synopsis of events from the creation of the world to the end of the reign of Nikephoros Botaneiates ( 1081 ) , sponsored by Irene Komnene , the emperor 's sister - in - law .

Manasses also wrote a short biography of Oppian , and some descriptive pieces ( all except one unpublished ) on artistic and other subjects .  - The Komnenian Restoration is the term used by historians to describe the military, financial, and territorial recovery of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian dynasty, from the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 to the death of Andronikos I Komnenos in 1185. At the onset of the reign of Alexios I, the empire was reeling from its defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The empire was also being threatened by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who were invading the Balkans from their base in southern Italy. All this occurred as the empire's military institution was in disarray and had grown increasingly reliant on mercenaries. Previous emperors had also squandered the large gold deposits of Constantinople, so the defense of the empire had broken down, and there were few troops to fill the gaps.  - Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus \\"Manoul I Komnnos\\"; 28 November 1118  24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean.

Q:Short general knowledge question: what would happen if the new madrid fault had an earthquake? A:","output":"If the New Madrid fault were to experience an earthquake, the consequences would be wide-ranging and could significantly impact the central United States. The New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) stretches from northeastern Arkansas to southern Illinois and is known for its history of powerful earthquakes. The most notable of these events were the series of earthquakes that occurred between 1811 and 1812, with magnitudes estimated between 7.0 and 7.7 on the Richter scale. 1. Ground shaking: The immediate effect of the earthquake would be the ground shaking, which can cause structural damage or collapse to buildings, bridges, roads, and other infrastructure. The severity of the shaking is influenced by factors such as the earthquake's magnitude, distance from the fault, and local soil types. Regions with soft, sediments can experience amplified shaking, making these areas more susceptible to damage. 2. Liquefaction: Areas with loose, water-saturated soils can experience liquefaction during a significant earthquake. This phenomenon occurs when the ground temporarily loses its strength, causing the soil to behave like a liquid. Liquefaction can lead to building collapse, roads becoming impassable, and damage to underground utilities. 3. Landslides: Earthquakes can trigger landslides in hilly or steep terrain. These sudden movements of rock, soil, and debris can cause destruction to structures and pose a serious threat to human life. 4. Infrastructure damage: Earthquakes can lead to significant infrastructure damage, which has both immediate and long-term consequences. Damaged roads and bridges make it difficult for first responders to reach affected areas, and repairing or replacing these structures can take several months or even years. Major transportation hubs, such as airports, can also be disrupted, impacting the movement of goods and people. Utility systems, including water, sewer, and gas lines, are likewise vulnerable to earthquake damage. 5. Economic implications: The economic impact of an earthquake in the New Madrid fault zone would be felt at both local and national levels. Loss of businesses due to structural damage, interruptions in supply chains, and reduced productivity can all contribute to economic difficulties in the affected region. Rebuilding efforts can be costly and take years to complete, further straining the economy. 6. Human casualties and displacement: A significant earthquake along the New Madrid fault could lead to loss of life and injuries, especially in areas with vulnerable populations and older, non-earthquake-resistant buildings. Additionally, displaced residents might face temporary or long-term housing shortages, leading to financial and social hardships. 7. Environmental impact: Earthquakes can have various environmental effects, including changes in groundwater levels, surface water bodies, and soil degradation. Disruption of natural habitats may also have adverse consequences for local ecosystems. In conclusion, should the New Madrid fault experience an earthquake, the potential consequences would include widespread damage to infrastructure, significant economic implications, human casualties and displacement, and environmental impacts. Nevertheless, proactive mitigation efforts, including building codes, public awareness campaigns, and emergency response planning, can help reduce the potential harm caused by an earthquake in this seismic zone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light, as the reviewer points out multiple negative aspects and does not mention any positive features. The reviewer's concerns regarding the product's performance, design, and user experience contribute to this unfavorable portrayal.  Firstly, the reviewer complains that the product \\"doesn't get very warm.\\" This indicates that the product fails to meet one of its primary functions, which is likely to provide warmth. A product that doesn't adequately perform its intended purpose is generally considered to be of poor quality, therefore reflecting negatively on the item. Secondly, the review mentions that \\"the massage is just two little spots.\\" This statement highlights another area in which the product's performance is subpar. Users would expect a massage function to provide widespread relaxation and relief, but in this case, the product appears to have a very limited reach. This issue further undermines the product's value and effectiveness. The reviewer also critiques the product's design by pointing out that \\"the power chord is big and bulky.\\" A large and cumbersome power cord is not only aesthetically unappealing, but it could also create inconvenience and frustration for the user. This design flaw detracts from the product's overall appeal and usability, contributing to the unflattering depiction. Lastly, the reviewer expresses annoyance with the product's use of Velcro, which could be understood as a design preference or a functional problem. In either case, it adds to the list of negative aspects brought up in the review. Whether this refers to discomfort, noise, or some other issue, the use of Velcro is deemed unfavorable by the reviewer, thus further contributing to the unflattering light in which the product is portrayed. In conclusion, the review portrays the product in a decidedly unflattering light due to various concerns related to the product's performance, design, and user experience. Customers reading this review would likely be discouraged from purchasing the product, as it gives the impression of being of low quality and not worth the investment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: (CNN) Jared Kushner, who has worn dueling hats for more than a year as President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, has been stripped of his access to the nation's top secrets, officials said Tuesday after his security clearance was downgraded.      Kushner, along with other White House officials who had been operating on interim clearances, had their access altered last week after chief of staff John Kelly stipulated new changes to the security clearance system.      Aides who previously operated on \\"top secret/sensitive compartmented information\\" interim clearances saw their access changed to \\"secret,\\" a classification for less sensitive material. The lesser \\"secret\\" clearance allows access to far fewer government secrets. It would prevent Kushner from accessing the Presidential Daily Brief, the collection of top secret material prepared for the commander in chief every day.      Dozens of White House officials have operated on interim clearances since Trump took office more than a year ago. Kelly had grown frustrated with the high number of aides without permanent access and has worked to shrink the number of temporary clearances. He issued a memo last week spelling out changes to the system, which gained new scrutiny after domestic abuse allegations against former aide Rob Porter surfaced this month.      In the February 16 memo, Kelly stated that White House officials who have been operating on interim clearances since last June would have their temporary clearances discontinued. That included Kushner, who has taken on a wide portfolio as senior adviser, including sensitive foreign policy matters. Asked on Friday whether he would grant Kushner an exemption from the new mandate, Trump said it would be Kelly's decision.      The White House has refused to detail the status of Kushner's clearance. In a statement, Kushner's attorney Abbe Lowell wrote: \\"Mr. Kushner has done more than what is expected of him in this process.\\"      \\"Those involved in the process again have confirmed that there are dozens of people at Mr. Kushner's level whose process is delayed,\\" Lowell wrote. \\"No concerns were raised about Mr. Kushner's application. As General Kelly himself said, the new clearance policy will not affect Mr. Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the President.\\"      Kushner is accepting the decision about his security clearance and \\"will not ask for special permission\\" from the President, one person familiar with the situation says.      Politico first reported the security clearance downgrade. At the White House on Tuesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders said Kushner's work would continue apace.      \\"He is a valued member of the team and will continue to do the important work he has been doing since he started in the administration,\\" Sanders said.      Kushner-Kelly rift      JUST WATCHED NYT: Kushner resisting restricted access Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NYT: Kushner resisting restricted access 01:55      White House officials have been working over the past week to identify a way for Kushner to continue pursuing his portfolio of issues -- including on the Middle East and China -- that would avoid forcing Trump to personally intervene. Officials have expressed worry that Trump's personal involvement could create problems within the West Wing and with Kelly.      The security clearance issue has caused a rift between Kushner and Kelly, multiple source familiar with the matter say. The President is aware of the tensions between the two men over the matter, a person familiar with his thinking said.      Republican sources close to the White House said the clearance downgrade could undercut Kushner's ability to influence policy decision-making in the West Wing. Without a top-level clearance, Kushner will be unable to attend meetings where the most sensitive national secrets are discussed.      It's not clear how long the diminished security clearance will last. The FBI is expected to wrap up Kushner's background check within a month, a person familiar with the situation said, adding that the FBI would hand the findings to the White House for it to make the ultimate decision on Kushner's clearance.      A \\"surge\\" of FBI agents have been tasked with processing a backlog of background investigations into Trump administration officials seeking security clearances, law enforcement sources said. Agents are \\"churning and burning\\" to complete the required checks, one official with the matter said. \\"We're trying to help the process ASAP.\\"      Meanwhile, White House officials say they've noticed an uptick in the pace of top secret security clearance decisions coming from the White House Personnel Security office. That's the department tasked with taking the FBI background check and determining whether a clearance should be granted.      One law enforcement source said agents in two Washington-based squads tasked with completing background checks are \\"inundated\\" with \\"thousands of people\\" across the government who still require background investigations before receiving permanent security clearances.      \\"We thought we had an adequate number of individuals assigned. We realized we need to up our ante and get this off our plate,\\" the official said. \\"It's an arduous process that they go through. You can only do so much in 24 hours.\\"      After-action      JUST WATCHED Sources: 30-40 WH officials lack full security clearance Replay More Videos ...

He noted that even before the Porter scandal he had directed the Personnel Security office to make \\"better use of existing staff\\" and hire \\"additional staff.\\"      Before Kelly issued his memo, White House and Justice Department officials convened a conference call to see whether some of the outstanding background check investigations for officials on interim clearances could be completed quickly. That included Kushner, according to a person familiar with the call. In his memo, Kelly stated that all interim clearances would be discontinued in a week's time.      A separate conversation took place last week between Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and White House counsel Don McGahn about Kushner's clearance. Rosenstein explained on the call the clearance process for Kushner was still ongoing, according to a source familiar with the matter.      \\"The deputy attorney general has not referenced to the White House any specific concerns relating to this individual's security clearance process,\\" Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said. ||||| Presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner has had his security clearance downgraded — a move that will prevent him from viewing many of the sensitive documents to which he once had unfettered access.      Kushner is not alone. All White House aides working on the highest-level interim clearances — at the Top Secret/SCI-level — were informed in a memo sent Friday that their clearances would be downgraded to the Secret level, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.      Story Continued Below      The SCI acronym stands for sensitive compartmented information, a category of information that comes from sensitive intelligence sources and must be walled off.      The memo was not signed by chief of staff John Kelly, but it comes as the retired Marine general and other top White House aides are grappling with the fallout of a scandal involving former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, which revealed that dozens of White House aides had yet to receive permanent clearances but nonetheless had access to some of the country’s deepest secrets.

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.      The president has the ability to grant Kushner a permanent clearance, but Trump said Friday — the same day the memo was sent — that he was leaving the decision to his chief of staff.      “I will let General Kelly make that decision,” Trump told reporters. “I have no doubt he’ll make the right decision.”      The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the memo.      White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to comment on Kushner’s clearance status at a briefing Tuesday.      “We actually haven’t commented on Jared’s issue indicated, but we have commented on his ability to do his job. Which, he’s a valued member of the team and he will continue to do the important work that he’s been doing since he’s started in the administration.”      Kushner’s attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement that Kushner “has done more than what is expected of him in this process.”      Lowell added that the changes would “not affect Mr. Kushner’s ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president.”      Friday’s decision is the first change to the clearance process instituted in the wake of the Porter debacle that will directly affect Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to Trump and until now has had access to the president’s daily brief, the most highly classified document that Trump sees.      “He cannot see the PDB, not a chance,” said Bradley Moss, a lawyer who specializes in national security law and clearances. “He no longer has access to a range of intelligence information that ordinarily someone in his position and somebody with his responsibilities would normally be privy to in order to perform their functions.”      Moss said Kushner and others will be debriefed by officials in the White House security office, an event scheduled to take place Thursday, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. “They’re going to give him a list, ‘Here’s what you’ve been debriefed from, you’ve been debriefed from this program and that compartment, you no longer have any access to it, and any breach of that would be a serious security violation and a possible criminal issue.’”      Kelly took the rare step last week of issuing a public statement that Kushner would be able to continue his work in the White House unfettered.      “As I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico,” Kelly said in the statement.      It was unclear whether Kushner would need access to top secret information to continue performing those duties — and whether Kelly was personally prepared to enact a policy that could be perceived as a jab at the president’s son-in-law.      The decision to downgrade White House staffers still working on interim clearances, however, indicates that Kelly is prepared to impose the same sort of discipline on the White House clearance process that he has tried to impose on the West Wing staff more broadly.      “The American people deserve a White House staff that meets the highest standards and that has been carefully vetted — especially those who work closely with the president or handle sensitive national security information,” Kelly told colleagues in a memo circulated on Feb. 16. “We should — and in the future, must — do better.”      Earlier this month, director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that people with temporary security clearances should get only limited access to sensitive classified information. Coats did not mention any specific individuals.      “Sometimes it is necessary to have some type of preliminary clearance in order to fill a slot, but … access has to be limited in terms of the kinds of information they can be in a position to receive or not receive,” Coats said. “It needs to be reformed.”      poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201802/2543/1155968404_5741666395001_5741645213001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true      Kushner has seen his once-expansive West Wing role steadily curtailed since Kelly’s arrival last July. The new chief immediately required Kushner and his wife, first daughter Ivanka Trump, to report through him rather than directly to the president.      The pair have also seen their circle of trusted allies shrink in recent weeks. Reed Cordish, who joined the White House early on as part of Kushner’s Office of American Innovation, left the White House earlier this month.      Communications staffer Josh Raffel, who handles requests involving Kushner and Ivanka Trump, also plans to leave in the next two months, according to two people familiar with his decision. Raffel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The news of his departure was first reported by Axios.      Emily Stephenson and Annie Karni contributed to this report.       ||||| Summary:","output":"Jared Kushner, senior adviser and son-in-law to President Donald Trump, has had his security clearance downgraded along with other White House officials who were on interim clearances.

The main complaint seems to center around the book's length, with the reviewer stating that it took 300 pages to tell a story that could've been written in 50. This conveys dissatisfaction in terms of pacing and a perceived lack of storytelling efficiency. 2. The customer clearly states that it is \\"not a good novel.\\" This comment demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the overall presentation of the story, despite the positives they mentioned earlier. In conclusion, based on the review, the customer appears to have both satisfied and dissatisfied sentiments when it comes to the product. While they appreciate certain aspects of the book, such as its historical and educational value, and the engaging plotline, they are largely dissatisfied with its length and storytelling inefficiency. Ultimately, it would be fair to say that their dissatisfaction stands out more prominently than their satisfaction, as they conclude with the statement that it is \\"not a good novel.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer a question about this article: The relative pitches of individual notes in a scale may be determined by one of a number of tuning systems. In the west, the twelve-note chromatic scale is the most common method of organization, with equal temperament now the most widely used method of tuning that scale. In it, the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two (or about 1.05946). In well-tempered systems (as used in the time of Johann Sebastian Bach, for example), different methods of musical tuning were used. Almost all of these systems have one interval in common, the octave, where the pitch of one note is double the frequency of another. For example, if the A above middle C is 440 Hz, the A an octave above that is 880 Hz (info). All these different methods have what in common?","output":"All these different methods of tuning systems, such as equal temperament and well-tempered systems, have one fundamental interval in common: the octave. The octave is a crucial aspect of determining relative pitches in various tuning systems, as it represents the point where one note's frequency is exactly double the frequency of another. This constant ratio helps give a sense of consonance and unity to the musical scale, irrespective of the specific tuning method employed. In the case of equal temperament, each successive note is defined by the ratio of the twelfth root of two. In well-tempered systems, such as those employed by Johann Sebastian Bach, several different tuning methods were used. Despite these differences, the octave consistently remains a foundational aspect across all tuning systems, providing a consistent anchor point for the organization of pitches within a given musical scale. In summary, the commonality amongst all the different tuning methods in both equal temperament and well-tempered systems is the presence and importance of the octave, signifying the relationship between two notes with one having double the frequency of the other. This consistency in the octave serves as a unifying feature across various tuning systems, enabling musicians to create harmonious and coherent musical pieces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program.

A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team. Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria.  The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse.  An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship.

In which American city did The Saint Valentine’s Day massacre take place What is the answer?","output":"The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre took place in the city of Chicago, Illinois, United States, on February 14, 1929. This gruesome event occurred during the era of Prohibition, when the city was under the grip of gangsters and organized crime. The massacre was an infamous part of Chicago's criminal history, as it involved two of the city's most powerful crime syndicates: the South Side Italian gang, led by Al Capone, and the North Side Irish gang, led by George \\"Bugs\\" Moran. The ongoing rivalry between these two gangs escalated into the bloody confrontation that unfolded on that fateful Valentine's Day morning. The incident took place at the S-M-C Cartage Company garage, located at 2122 North Clark Street in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. The location was being used by the North Side gang as a base for illegal activities, such as selling bootlegged alcohol. On the morning of February 14, 1929, seven members or associates of the North Side gang were lined up against the wall inside the garage and brutally gunned down by four men, two of whom wore police uniforms. The perpetrators of the massacre were believed to be members or associates of Al Capone's South Side gang. Although Capone was never directly linked to the crime and was in Florida on the day of the massacre, it is widely believed that he orchestrated the attack in an effort to consolidate his power over the Chicago underworld and eliminate Bugs Moran as a rival. The victims of the massacre included Frank and Pete Gusenberg, Adam Heyer, Albert Kachellek, John May, Reinhardt Schwimmer, and Albert Weinshank. Despite the gruesome nature of the crime and the fact that it received widespread public attention, no one was ever convicted for their involvement in the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. As a result, the event continues to occupy an infamous place in the annals of American criminal history and serves as an enduring symbol of the lawlessness and violence that pervaded Chicago during the Prohibition era."},{"instruction":"Information:  - South Holland is a province in the midwestern Netherlands.

Joan Rivers' 'outraged' daughter will sue throat specialist to the stars Dr Gwen Korovin, friends have revealed. Melissa Rivers is preparing to launch legal action against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, which was blasted yesterday in a damning report by the New York Department of Health and Human Services. And she will not just include the clinic in her legal action - but her mother's personal ENT doctor as well. A source told MailOnline today: 'Melissa is undaunted, she's going after the clinic and the doctors personally involved. These doctors will rue the day they went near Joan.' The DHH report revealed a catalog of errors at the clinic where the legendary comic suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure that led to her death. Scroll down for video. Heartbroken: Melissa Rivers, right, has hired a top NYC law firm to launch legal action against the clinic where her mother Joan suffered cardiac arrest following a routine endoscopy before her death on September 4. Joan's doctors: Dr Gwen Korovin (left)  is Joan's private throat specialist, while Dr Lawrence Cohen was the medical director at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic. Both are believed to have been treating Joan Rivers when she went into cardiac arrest during a routine endoscopy on August 28. Among the series of blunders, it was reported that staff at the Manhattan clinic failed to weigh Joan before sedating her with Propofol - the anesthetic that killed Michael Jackson. The clinic also comes under fire for allowing a doctor without privileges, known to be Dr Korovin, to practice at the medical center. Indeed, Dr Korovin is said to have declared 'I'll go first' as she stepped into the operating room with Dr Cohen, the report says. It also confirms a picture was taken of the star while she was under anesthesia, alongside Dr Korovin. Heartbroken Melissa Rivers, 46, will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville  and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz. In a statement, attorneys Jeffrey B. Bloom and Ben Rubinowitz said: 'Our client, Melissa Rivers, is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the CMS report. 'As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure. Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.' Meanwhile, the friend said that although grief-stricken, Melissa wants to continue to produce her mother's E! show Fashion Police in memory of Joan. The network is looking to replace the venerable Joan, although the star's close friend Kathy Griffin, who has been linked with the spot, told People: 'They did offer it to me. I don't know if the situation is correct or right at this time for me. We'll see.' ​Rivers’ official cause of death is “anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation.” The firm needs to obtain Joan's medical records before filing a case in Manhattan Supreme Court and her will also needs to submitted to court and an executor appointed by the judge. On Monday, the DHH reported that the legendary comic was in excellent health before undergoing what was supposed to be a routine endoscopy. While the doctors who treated Joan are not mentioned by name, they are believed to be her personal throat specialist Dr Gwen Korovin and Yorkville medical director Dr Lawrence Cohen. And most worryingly,  both Dr Korovin and Dr Cohen failed to notice that Joan's vital signs were going down, as the report claims they failed to provide 'timely intervention'. According to the findings, Joan, 81, arrived at Yorkville on the morning of August 28 for tests after suffering chronic reflux. She was in good health and her blood pressure was a normal 118 over 80 when her vital signs were first taken at 8.44am. Her pulse was 62 and regular. The star was set to undergo an EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy), where doctors insert a thin scope and camera into the area between the throat and upper intestine. However, even though Joan had only agreed to only the ONE procedure, the report states she underwent a Nasolaryngoscopy performed by her personal ENT doctor Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to practice at the clinic. This was stopped when Dr Koroway said she did not have a clear view. The EGD then went ahead, carried out by Dr Cohen, and Dr Korovin performed a second Nasolaryngoscopy. Worryingly, a staff member told the DHH investigators that Joan was NOT weighed before Propofol was administered. This is 'critical' according to the report. The records note an 'inconsistent' log of the Propofol dosage. Although it says she was given a total of 300 milligrams, the clinic's anestiologist said this was a mistake and only 120 milligrams was administered. Propofol hit the headlines after the death of superstar Michael Jackson in 2009, when it was revealed he had overdosed on the powerful sedative. BFFs: Distraught Melissa posted a picture of her son Cooper and her mother Joan, writing: 'Connecticut, 2004. Mom + Cooper = BFFs... A perfect day. #TBT' Still working: Dr Gwen Korovin is still working at her Manhattan office. She charges 460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance. She is believed to have been in the room at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest on August 28. Perhaps the most damning criticism of the clinic comes as the report says 'the physicians in charge of Joan failed to identify deteriorating  vital signs and provide timely intervention during the procedure'. Indeed, by 9.30am, Joan's blood pressure had plunged to 85 over 49 and no pulse was recorded. The report, released after interviews with Yorkville staff and others, says there is conflicting information as to the time that Joan was resuscitated and transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital. Last month, it was revealed that Joan's daughter Melissa Rivers has signed up a Manhattan legal powerhouse and will launch a multimillion-dollar law suit against the endoscopy clinic where the comedienne fell into a coma. Today, Dr Korovin's lawyer, Michael Kelton, declined to comment. Dr Korovin is known as the throat specialist to the stars and counts Celine Dion and Ariana Grande as well as a host of Broadway stars among her patients. Previously, Mr Kelton told MailOnline: 'Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who is believed to have been in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her ill-fated procedure, counts Celine Dion as one of her patients. In the singer's 2010 documentary, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords. 'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. 'For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.'

Marty is a high-powered single literary agent in Manhattan. Marie (also Moore) is a widow in Provence with two daughters and a peaceful life. Marty has been seeing a therapist to deal with her vivid dreams of Marie's life; when Marie falls asleep she dreams Marty's life, but is much less disturbed by it. Each woman is convinced that the other is a figment of her imagination. When Marty meets Aaron they become friends and eventually lovers; terrified that her vivid other life means that she's losing her mind, Marty does not want to tell Aaron about it but finally does. Marie, meanwhile, has met William; she too is reluctant to tell William about her dreams, particularly since she (as Marty) is falling in love with Aaron, but realizes that she cannot keep such an important part of her life a secret. The two men react very differently: William is jealous, while Aaron is skeptical but not at all threatened, and wants only for Marty to be happy. Dreams and real life begin to merge when Marie goes on holiday with William to Paris, and Marty wakes up with an ashtray from the hotel on her night stand. Eventually Marty/Marie must come to terms with reality and choose which life is real and which is illusion. Answer:","output":"Marty eventually tells Aaron about her dreams.

Like Out of Time, Monster topped the charts in both the US and UK. The record sold about nine million copies worldwide. The singles \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and \\"Bang and Blame\\" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from Monster reached the Top 30 on the British charts. Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from Automatic for the People for release as Parallel in 1995.In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour.

Today, we're going to talk about an important news story. An oil company called Total faced a problem because there was a gas leak at one of their places called a platform. This happened in 2012 in a big body of water called the North Sea, and BBC Scotland found out about it. Now, you might be wondering, what is an oil company and what do they do? Well, oil companies are like big groups of people and machines that work together to find, take out, and sell a special kind of liquid called oil. This oil is very important because it helps our cars, buses, and many other things move and work! A platform is a big, strong structure, like a giant floating house, where people and machines look for oil under the sea. It's similar to a big boat that does not move, and it helps people do their jobs safely in the middle of the water. But in this story, something went wrong. A gas leak happened at the platform. This means that some harmful gases, which are like invisible air with bad smells, came out from the platform and went into the air and water. Gas leaks can be dangerous because the gases can be harmful to our health and the environment, like how it can make fish and other sea creatures sick. That's why the oil company Total is being charged, which means that someone is saying they did something wrong and they need to fix it so it doesn't happen again. The investigation, or a type of search to find out what happened, tells us that this gas leak should not have happened if the company followed the rules. Now, some people are making sure Total fixes the problem and takes care of the environment. This way, our beautiful sea creatures, the air, and the water stay healthy and clean for everyone to enjoy. In summary, an oil company named Total is in trouble because there was a gas leak at a platform in the North Sea in 2012. People investigated and found out that Total didn't follow the rules, so now they have to fix the problem and take care of the environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as \\"at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive\\". She notes that there is a certain amount of projection of the artist's personality and recalls Théophile Silvestre's description of Ingres;...  answer the following question:  What was critic Félix Tournachon describing when he said \\"antastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\"? Answer:","output":"Critic Félix Tournachon was describing Bertin's hands in the portrait painted by Ingres when he said \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\""},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... According to the above context, answer the following question.

In the first quarter, Indianapolis trailed early as Texans kicker Kris Brown got a 28-yard field goal. The Colts responded with kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 40-yard field goal. Houston would answer with Brown making a 34-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Indy tied the game as Vinatieri got a 39-yard field goal. The Texans retook the lead as RB Ahman Green got a 1-yard TD run. Indianapolis closed out the half as Vinatieri made a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Colts took the lead as QB Peyton Manning completed a 23-yard TD pass to RB Joseph Addai. Houston would reply as RB Steve Slaton got a 71-yard TD run, yet Indy regained the lead as Addai got a 7-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Texans tried to come back as Green got a 2-yard field goal, yet Indianapolis pulled away with Vinatieri nailing a 31-yard field goal. On the Texans' final drive, QB Sage Rosenfels was intercepted by safety Melvin Bullitt (who was filling in again for the injured Bob Sanders).

Options: - let down - better himself - bored - row boat - turn away  Explain why a human would choose \\"let down\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"let down\\" to answer the question above because it best captures the complex emotional response that one experiences when their friends abandon or exclude them. To better understand this choice, let's examine each of the options individually and why \\"let down\\" is the most fitting response. 1. Let down: When friends ditch someone, that person often feels let down because they had certain expectations and trust in their friends. These unmet expectations result in a sense of betrayal and disappointment, as they thought their friends would support them and be loyal in times of need. This feeling of being let down can also stem from a sudden realization that the strength and quality of the friendship might not have been as strong or stable as previously thought. 2. Better himself: While self-improvement might be a result of reevaluating relationships and focusing on personal growth after being ditched by friends, it isn't the immediate emotional response one feels in this situation. The initial emotions are generally more negative, such as hurt and disappointment, rather than a sense of determination to improve oneself. 3. Bored: Although boredom might be a consequence of losing social interaction with friends, it is not the primary emotion one feels when being ditched. Boredom doesn't accurately capture the emotional turmoil and sense of betrayal that people typically experience in such situations. 4. Row boat: This option seems irrelevant to the question, as it is neither an emotion nor an appropriate response to the situation. It has no contextual relevance to the feelings one experiences when their friends abandon them. 5. Turn away: While \\"turn away\\" could potentially convey a sense of disappointment or a desire to distance oneself from the friends who have betrayed them, it doesn't fully capture the depth and complexity of the emotions felt. It doesn't encapsulate the sense of hurt, betrayal, and disappointment as strongly as the option \\"let down.\\" In conclusion, a human would choose \\"let down\\" to answer the question above because it best represents the multifaceted and profound emotional response they feel when their friends betray their trust and abandon them. The sense of disappointment and betrayal that results from such experiences is most accurately summarized by the term \\"let down,\\" which is why it stands out as the most suitable choice among the options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

She spent her days exploring the woods, catching butterflies, and asking questions about everything. One day, while playing in a field of colorful flowers, Hannah came across a big, round stone that seemed to be resting atop a smaller stone. Intrigued, she decided to make it her mission to move the heavy stone. She thought that there might be something fun and exciting hidden underneath it. In her first attempt, she pushed and pushed with all her might but the stone wouldn't budge. Next, she asked her best friend Toby, a clever rabbit, to help her. Together, they tried using a long stick as a lever, but still, the stone didn't move. Hannah was not about to give up. She asked her mom for advice, and her mom told her about teamwork and how, if they all worked together, they might be able to move the stone. So, Hannah enlisted the help of her entire village, including her family and friends. On the big day, everyone gathered around the stone with ropes, sticks, and lots of determination.

With the combined strength of everyone in the village, the stone began to move, slowly but surely.

As a result of this complaint, it is likely that the bakery will take action to address these concerns.  Choice [A] - The bakery will heighten their hygiene standards This choice seems the most appropriate response to the complaint. By heightening their hygiene standards, the bakery can work to ensure that employees are aware of the importance of proper hygiene and cleanliness in the workplace. This may include implementing stricter policies regarding handwashing, providing training on food safety, and monitoring employee practices more closely. Choice [B] - None of the above choices This choice suggests that nothing will change, which is unlikely given the seriousness of the complaint and the potential risks associated with poor hygiene in a food production environment. Choice [C] - The bakery will fire the person's sister Firing the person's sister would not address the underlying issue of poor hygiene practices among the bakery's employees, nor would it create a safer working environment. Choice [D] - The bakery will hire new management While hiring new management may lead to changes in the bakery's operations, it is not a direct response to the concerns raised in the complaint. Improving hygiene standards and ensuring a clean environment should be the primary focus in response to this complaint.

Answer based on context: After being blown out at home, the Steelers traveled to Kansas City to face the undefeated Chiefs. The Steelers scored first in the first quarter when Zach Fulton fumbled the ball into the end zone for a safety giving them a 2-0 lead. The Chiefs took the lead later on in the quarter when Harrison Butker kicked a 46-yard field goal to make it 3-2. The Steelers moved back ahead in the second quarter when Le'Veon Bell ran for a 3-yard touchdown making the score 9-3. This would be followed up by Chris Boswell kicking a 24-yard field goal to put the team up 12-3 at halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, the Chiefs came within 2 as Alex Smith connected with De'Anthony Thomas on a 57-yard pass to make it 12-10 to start the fourth quarter. Later on, the Steelers would move ahead by 9 when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 51-yard pass to make it 19-10. The Chiefs came within 6 when Butker nailed a 33-yard field goal to make it 19-13. The Chiefs later on failed to convert a fourth down, sealing the win for the Steelers. With the win, the Steelers improved to 4-2. Roethlisberger's record against the Chiefs increased to 6-1. How many yards difference was Harrison Butker’s first field goal compared to his second?","output":"Alright, let's talk about Harrison Butker, who kicked two field goals in the game. His first field goal was from 46 yards away, and his second field goal was from 33 yards away. To find out the difference in yards between the two field goals, we can subtract the smaller number (33) from the bigger number (46). Here's the math: 46 - 33 = 13. So, there was a 13-yard difference between Harrison Butker’s first field goal and his second field goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you learn that someone's been spreading nasty rumors about you, your first action should be to consult with your close friends. These should be people you know and trust. Tell them the facts of the situation. If the rumor's not true, they'll be sure to fight the spread of the rumor by shooting it down whenever they hear someone bring it up. If the rumor is true, they can still help stop its spread by sticking up for you and chastising people that spread it. Another great reason to turn to your friends is that they'll make you feel like you're not overwhelmed. When it seems like everyone you know is talking about you behind your back, you can feel absolutely surrounded - good friends will remind you that there are always people who love and respect you. If you know for sure who's responsible for spreading a nasty rumor about you, don't take it lying down. When you have a chance, walk right up to him or her and say that you don't appreciate the mean things s/he has said. Stay calm when you do this - you don't want to resort to the cruel words that this person has. You also don't want to give bystanders the impression that the rumor's true if it's not - if they don't know all the facts, they may assume an especially angry rebuttal means that the rumor's true.  Say something polite yet direct, like: \\"Hey. I want you to know that I don't appreciate the things you've been saying about me. Please stop.\\" Then, just walk away - this person doesn't deserve your time. Ignore any insults you hear as you're walking away. Sometimes, the person who started the rumor didn't do it on purpose. It may, for instance, be a friend who simply let a secret slip by accident. In cases like this, it's OK to express your disappointment, but you should avoid acting in a way that seems vindictive or accusatory (as above.) When you're worried about a piece of gossip changing the way others think about you, it's bad enough. Don't let gossip change the way  you  think about yourself! The worst thing you can do is to allow a piece of gossip to become a self-fulfilling prophecy - to let your anxiety change your attitude or actions. Remember that just because someone's said something about you doesn't mean it's true. If someone's nasty enough to spread gossip about you, they're definitely nasty enough to lie. For instance, if you happen to overhear people talking about how you speak with a slight lisp, don't become silent and withdrawn to avoid having to hear the sound of your own voice. Everyone has small quirks that make them unique - the gossiper's \\"quirk\\" is that s/he is pathetically petty. Gossip is oftentimes best dealt with by  paying no attention to it at all.  Most people don't think very hard about gossip - if they see you react in a way that seems agitated or ashamed, they might assume the rumor's true, even if it's not. A good policy is to react to gossip as if it doesn't bother you. When you hear that there's a rumor going around about you, simply blow it off with a comment like, \\"Heh. You'd have to be pretty dumb to believe that.\\" Don't dwell on it. Other people will take their social cues from you. If you act like the rumor isn't worth your time, there's a good chance they'll follow suit. When you hear gossip about yourself, laugh it off. Act as if it's ridiculous! Share a chuckle about it! Turn the tables by making the person who started the rumor the butt of the joke - how hilarious is it that they actually thought spreading a dumb rumor about you would work? It's true - if you know there's an awful rumor going around about you, it can be hard to show your face in social situations. If someone told the whole football team that you have jock itch, for instance, you're probably not looking forward to the time in the locker room before practice. It's really tough, but  try your hardest  not to shy away from the activities you would normally participate in. Doing so will only make you feel more isolated. Instead, show the world how little you care about the gossip by not altering the way you live in the  slightest. If nasty rumors and gossip are a frequent problem, or if someone's told a rumor that might get you in trouble for something you didn't do, talk to a teacher, counselor, or administrator. These people can help you work through the problem - they can give you advice on how to proceed, make you feel better, and even dole out discipline to people who've started the rumor. Don't be afraid to contact an authority figure for guidance when dealing with especially nasty or persistent rumors. These types of people exist to help you. You should  definitely  talk to an authority figure if the gossip makes you feel like you may retaliate by doing something drastic, like starting a fight. Many schools have zero-tolerance policies for aggressive behavior. Don't get expelled over a stupid rumor (especially not if it's untrue.) Get in touch with an authority figure in your school right away. The single best way to avoid having gossip told about you is to stay away from the kinds of people who tell mean gossip! As popular or cool as they may seem, these people are sad and desperate. They can't have a good time without spreading hurtful rumors about someone else. Don't bother with them. Find friends who don't get enjoyment from hurting people. Remember - a friend who stabs you in the back by telling a nasty rumor isn't much of a friend at all.","output":"This article talks about what to do if someone is spreading mean rumors about you. First, talk to your close friends who you trust and tell them the truth. If the rumor is not true, your friends can help stop it from spreading. If you know who is spreading the rumor, talk to them calmly and ask them to stop. If the rumor was spread by accident, try not to get too angry and forgive them. Don't let the gossip change how you feel about yourself or stop you from doing things you enjoy. If rumors are a big problem, you can talk to a teacher or counselor for help. It's important to stay away from people who like to spread mean rumors and find good friends who care about you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We can do this by washing the turkey with water and then using paper towels to gently pat it dry both inside and outside. 2. Mix the seasonings: We're going to make a special blend of spices that will make our turkey super, duper tasty.

Be sure not to forget the inside cavity too! 4. Marinade time: Allow the turkey to sit and absorb all the flavor from the spices for a few hours, or even overnight, before we start frying. And that's it! Our seasoned turkey is now ready to be deep-fried and enjoyed for a super delicious meal.

The English Premier League have rejected a proposal to bring Celtic and Rangers into English football's top flight. The Glasgow-based sides had hoped to be part of plans submitted by Bolton chairman Phil Gartside. Rangers have also been fined by UEFA for the behavior of their fans during their match against Unirea Urziceni. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Celtic and Rangers' Bid to Join English Premier League Rejected Introduction: The English Premier League has rejected a proposal to incorporate Scottish football giants Celtic and Rangers into its top-flight competition. The Glasgow-based clubs were hopeful of being part of the plans put forward by Bolton chairman Phil Gartside, but their ambitions have been thwarted for the time being. In addition to the decision by the Premier League, Rangers have suffered another setback as they received a fine from UEFA due to the conduct of their fans during a match against Unirea Urziceni. Step 1: Elaborate on the proposal Phil Gartside, the Chairman of Bolton Wanderers, submitted a proposal for the inclusion of Celtic and Rangers in the English Premier League. This move would have seen the two most successful clubs in Scottish football history leave the Scottish Premiership and join their counterparts in England, providing a substantial boost in competition, revenue, and international exposure. Step 2: Discuss the rationale behind the rejection Despite the potential financial benefits of having both Celtic and Rangers in the English Premier League, the proposal was rejected. The primary reason for this decision is the potential disruption it may have caused to the long-standing football traditions and rivalries embedded into both English and Scottish football leagues. Additionally, concerns were raised over whether accommodating these two clubs would necessitate further expansion and potential restructuring of the league system. Step 3: Mention UEFA fine against Rangers In a separate matter, Rangers Football Club have been fined by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) following incidents involving their fans during the club's recent match against Unirea Urziceni. This sanction serves as a reminder for clubs to prioritize the safety and appropriate conduct of their supporters both at home and when traveling abroad. Conclusion: The rejection of the proposal to bring Celtic and Rangers into the English Premier League upholds the existing structure of football competitions in both England and Scotland. While the two Scottish clubs may continue seeking opportunities to expand their reach and success, they will remain part of the Scottish Premiership for the foreseeable future. Both clubs, particularly Rangers, will now be focusing on addressing their respective issues and moving forward in their domestic and international competitions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Context: The film opens with narration over a silhouette of Hill House at night. The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, \\"An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone.\\" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, \\"Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted...\\" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton).Markway visits Mrs. Sanderson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, \\"I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find.\\" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sanderson's lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sanderson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sanderson asks point blank, \\"Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?\\" Markway replies, \\"Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.\\"Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name).Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor's plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, \\"I think you should have a vacation, Nell.\\" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive.Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor   Question: Did either of Crain's wives survive?

Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction.

Hypothesis: Princess Caroline of Gloucester had no siblings","output":"The paragraph provided does not offer enough information to conclusively accept or reject the hypothesis that Princess Caroline of Gloucester had no siblings. The details outlined relay information about her parentage, her status as an infant member of the British royal family, and some of her connections within the royal lineage, including being a great-grandchild of George II, a niece of George III, and the daughter of the 1st Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh and his wife, Maria Walpole. However, there is no direct reference to siblings or lack thereof.  In order to thoroughly confirm or refute the hypothesis, additional research or reference material would be needed to provide confirmation regarding the family dynamics and the presence or absence of any siblings of Princess Caroline of Gloucester.  Information about potential siblings could be found in various resources such as historical documents, records of the British royal family, or scholarly articles focused on the lineage and family tree of British royals, specifically the Gloucester and Edinburgh branches.  To provide a definitive answer to the hypothesis, any siblings of Princess Caroline of Gloucester would need to be identified, including their names, birthdates, and any significant historical or family connections they may have.

Premise: During the HUAC hearings, Congressman Edward Hebert commented, Whichever one of you is lying is the greatest actor that America has ever produced. Hypothesis: Congressman Hebert hates liars. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The process of determining whether a hypothesis is entailed by the given premise involves critically evaluating the information provided and assessing if the conclusion can be logically drawn from the premise. The premise revolves around a HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) hearing wherein Congressman Edward Hebert commented, \\"Whichever one of you is lying is the greatest actor that America has ever produced.\\" HUAC was an investigative committee of the US House of Representatives that was created in 1938 to uncover information regarding disloyalty, subversive activities, or ties to fascist or communist movements. Often, the committee focused on individuals in the entertainment industry. The HUAC hearings were quite controversial and were often laced with allegations of deception. Congressman Hebert's statement suggests that one party involved in the hearings is not telling the truth, and that deception would merit them the title of the \\"greatest actor.\\" This remark is laced with irony, implying the acting skill necessary to deceive so convincingly. His words express disapproval of the alleged dishonesty, construed by the rhetorical comparison to acting. However, the hypothesis suggests that \\"Congressman Hebert hates liars.\\" While Hebert's comment certainly showcases his dissatisfaction with dishonesty, there is not enough information in the premise to support the strong assertion that he 'hates' liars. The term \\"hate\\" suggests an intense or passionate dislike, a much stronger emotion than simple disapproval or criticism. The premise provides evidence that Hebert disapproves of or condemns lying, but it does not necessarily confirm that he 'hates' liars. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be effectively entailed by the premise given as there might be nuances and levels of discontent in Hebert's opinion towards dishonesty that have not been conclusively presented in the premise. The presence of any kind of deception or dishonesty by a person at the hearing does not permit us to infer that he shares an intense resentment or hatred towards liars in general based on that one statement alone.  In conclusion, while Hebert demonstrates a clear disapproval of lying, we cannot conclude decisively from the given premise that Congressman Hebert hates liars. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(2) Republicans lost two seats , one to the Progressive Party and one to the Prohibition Party . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning but with slight differences in structure and phrasing. Both sentences indicate that there were two seats lost by the Republicans, with one seat won by the Progressive Party and the other seat won by the Prohibition Party (or Prohibition, referring to the party). The sentences vary in sentence structure and use of the words \\"Party\\" and \\"Prohibition,\\" but the overall meaning is the same. Let's break down both sentences to gain a better understanding of their structure and meaning: 1. The Republicans lost two seats, one to the Progressive Party and one to Prohibition. In this sentence, \\"The Republicans\\" is the subject, referring to the political party involved. The verb \\"lost\\" indicates the action performed by the subject, and \\"two seats\\" specifies what was lost. The phrase \\"one to the Progressive Party and one to Prohibition\\" clarifies how these losses were distributed among the opposing political groups, with the Progressive Party winning one seat and the Prohibition Party winning the other seat. The usage of \\"Prohibition\\" without the word \\"Party\\" still implies the presence of a political party, and it is generally understood in context. 2. Republicans lost two seats, one to the Progressive Party and one to the Prohibition Party. In this sentence, \\"Republicans\\" is the subject, and its meaning is identical to that of the first sentence. The verb \\"lost\\" and the object \\"two seats\\" have the same function and meaning as in the first sentence. The phrase \\"one to the Progressive Party and one to the Prohibition Party\\" explains the outcome of the lost seats, where one seat went to the Progressive Party, and the other seat went to the Prohibition Party. This sentence uses the full name \\"Prohibition Party\\" for the second political group, making the reference more explicit compared to the first sentence. In summary, both sentences communicate that the Republicans lost two seats, with one seat going to the Progressive Party and the other seat going to the Prohibition Party. Despite the differences in structure and phrasing, the meaning remains consistent in both sentences."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Combine facts and answer this: What American physicist discovered the positron which explained Chinese physicist Chung-Yao Chao's earlier experiments with gamma rays?

My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. Question: What is the average lifespan for someone with cerebral palsy? Options: - twenty years - seventeen years - twenty five years - not enough information Answer:","output":"Not enough information.  The lifespan of someone with cerebral palsy can vary significantly depending on the severity of the condition and the level of care provided. Some people with cerebral palsy can live a normal lifespan, while others may have a shorter life expectancy due to complications or associated health issues. It is important to note that cerebral palsy is a broad term that encompasses a range of conditions with varying degrees of severity. Therefore, it is not possible to determine an average lifespan for someone with cerebral palsy based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a half-life of about 4.468×109 years, roughly the age of the Earth. Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13×108 years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48×105 years. For natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by each of 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What percentage of the gamma rays of natural uranium are emitted by 234U?","output":"The given information does not provide the specific details about gamma-ray emissions for each uranium isotope (U-238, U-235, and U-234).

Article: During the seasons of fine weather, kids can play outside, happy and active. But when winter comes around, it is wet, windy and cold. Since they can't go outside to play, kids get restless and miserable. Fun activities for kids are pretty much necessary at that time of year, and they need to be kept entertained. One way to do this is to have an indoor treasure hunt, where children can look for clues and then get to the treasure. Treasure doesn't even need to be much, because just the activity is fun enough. Art activities are always fun, and if you start off with some paper in different colors they can draws shapes on the back, cut them out and stick them on the white paper to make all sorts of things. Cardboard boxes, stuck together and then painted, can be made into buildings or robots. You can keep all boxes in a bag in the loft. Then you have something you can draw on when the weather is bad and the children need to play indoors. Dressing up is another fun indoor activity. Why not read a book to them and then ask them to act it for you? That can keep them busy and develop their imagination. When you encourage children to use their imagination, you are giving them confidence in themselves, in their own creative abilities; by suggesting they put on a play you are encouraging them to work together and develop teamwork skills. The best way to help your kids have fun when it is rainy outside is to let them come up with some ideas. When you feel that they are old enough, let them write their ideas on a piece of paper and you can pick an idea that you find practical. That way, every day can be fun!

Sharp is planning to start cultivating strawberries on a factory scale basis in the United Arab Emirates in fiscal 2015, by using its technology to artificially control light, temperature and humidity.      The company said Sept. 20 that lab tests got under way in July to cultivate strawberries at a facility within the Sharp Middle East Free Zone Establishment, its subsidiary in Dubai.      It hopes the project will grow into a new line of business that can help rebuild the company.      With a high degree of sweetness, Japanese-grown strawberries are popular with the wealthy in the Middle East, a region that is unfit for farming because it is covered by desert.      But strawberry shipments from Japan to the Middle East have been a big hurdle due to the distance and ease with which the fruit can spoil.      Sharp decided to cultivate strawberries in a controlled environment in Dubai using a light-emitting diode light source to facilitate photosynthesis and Plasmacluster technology for managing air quality and other techniques to monitor room temperature and humidity.      This approach will allow the company to gather data on cultivation techniques to achieve stable production of strawberries.      The project uses seedlings brought from Japan.      The company expects to manage unmanned factories in Dubai through remote control from Japan.      \\"If we can generate results in cultivating strawberries, a plant that is difficult to grow, we can apply the technology to other farm products,\\" a senior Sharp official said.      Sharp has been involved in growing strawberries on a trial basis since 2009.      The company said the quality of such strawberries is comparable to those circulated in the Japanese market. ||||| (Reuters) - Japan's Sharp Corp (6753.T) plans to issue up to 450 million new shares in a public offering as part of a plan to raise 1.7 billion that the company's board will approve this week, two people with knowledge of the discussions said on Tuesday.      The cash injection would further stabilize finances at the company, which a year ago averted failure through a bank bailout.      Investors in the Osaka-based maker of display panels for Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone and iPad worry however, that price-sapping competition from LCD screen makers in China and elsewhere will could still derail Sharp's turnaround.      The latest capital raising will include about 150 billion yen (1.52 billion) through a public share offering and about 20 billion yen from a third-party allotment. The third-party share placement would be made to companies with deep ties to Sharp, including Lixil Group (5938.T), Makita Corp (6586.T) and Denso Corp (6902.T), according to the sources, who spoke on condition they were not identified.      In addition to using the funds to invest in its business, Sharp faces a shortfall in its corporate pension plan, part of which it may need to cover in the near term. Total unfunded liabilities were 120 billion yen at the end of March, Sharp has said.      Sharp officials did not comment on the plan to raise cash.      The company will probably report an operating profit of about 30 billion yen for the six month ending September 30, double what it earlier forecast, after a 168 billion yen loss a year earlier, the Nikkei business daily reported, without saying where it obtained the information.      Sharp last year posted a 545 billion yen net loss, pushing its capital below 6 percent of equity, far short of the 20 percent ratio widely seen as a financial-stability threshold for manufacturers.

Goal: Find inexpensive leather to use for crafts. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"In order to help you accomplish your goal of finding inexpensive leather to use for crafts, I have listed a few methods below that can be considered more reasonable in achieving this goal: 1. Purchase second-hand leather items: One of the best ways to find inexpensive leather is to buy second-hand leather items from thrift stores, garage sales, or online platforms such as eBay, Poshmark, and Depop. These platforms generally have many leather items such as jackets, bags, belts, shoes, or furniture that can be purchased at a fraction of their original cost. You can then repurpose or upcycle the leather from these items to use for your crafts projects. This method not only helps you save money but also contributes to sustainability by giving new life to used items. 2. Source leather remnants or offcuts: Leather remnants or offcuts are another great option to source inexpensive leather for crafts. Many leather supply stores, as well as online retailers such as Etsy and Amazon, offer leather remnants or bundles at discounted rates. These remnants are often leftover or irregular pieces from the production of leather goods, and they can still be useful for smaller crafts and projects. Buying leather remnants in bulk can further lower the cost per piece and provide you with a diverse range of options. 3. Make friends with local leather workers or upholsterers: If you have a local leather workshop, furniture store, or upholsterer in your area, try to establish a connection with them. These businesses often have leftover leather pieces during their production processes, and they might be willing to sell or even give you these scraps for free. They may also be aware of any potential sales or discounts happening within the industry. 4. Keep an eye out for store sales and discounts: A great way to find inexpensive leather for your crafts is to monitor sales and discounts offered by leather supply stores, both online and in-person. Store-wide sales during holidays, end-of-season clearances, and special offers can drastically reduce the cost of leather materials. Following your favorite retailers on social media, subscribing to their newsletters, or creating Google alerts for terms such as \\"leather sale\\" can help you stay updated on upcoming deals. 5. Trade or swap leather materials with fellow crafters: If you are a part of any crafting communities, discussion boards, or social media groups, consider exchanging materials with fellow crafters. Many artisans have leftover materials from their projects that they are willing to trade or sell at a low cost, and this can help you find inexpensive leather for your crafts without much hassle. Overall, combining several of these methods would prove to be the most reasonable and effective approach to finding inexpensive leather for your crafts. By considering multiple avenues for sourcing leather at a discounted rate, you will be able to gather a more diverse range of options while maximizing your savings."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Indo-Guyanese made up 51.9% of the total population in 1980, but by 1991 this had fallen to 48.6%, and then to 43.5% in the 2002 census. Those of African descent increased slightly from 30.8% to 32.3% during the first period (1980 and 1991) before falling to 30.2% in the 2002 census. With small growth in the overall population, the decline in the shares of the two larger groups has resulted in the relative increase of shares of the multiracial and Amerindian groups. The Amerindian population rose by 22,097 people between 1991 and 2002. This represents an increase of 47.3% or annual growth of 3.5%. Similarly, the multiracial population increased by 37,788 persons, representing a 43.0% increase or annual growth rate of 3.2% from the base period of 1991 census. How many percent of people were not Indo-Guyanese in 1980?","output":"To find the percentage of people who were not Indo-Guyanese in 1980, we need to subtract the percentage of Indo-Guyanese people from 100%.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment (Available options:  -- negative  -- positive).","output":"Title: The Lost Potential Although The Lost Potential had the potential to be a redeeming cinematic experience, the finished product proved to be quite disappointing. Despite a promising premise and a talented ensemble cast, the film falls victim to poor directing and a redundant storyline that turns what could have been a thrilling adventure into a tedious and unfulfilling experience. The plot follows a group of friends who, while on a trip, stumble upon an extraordinary artifact with hidden powers. Their discovery leads them to uncover its origin, unraveling the mysterious history along the way. However, the intriguing premise is overshadowed by the film's lack of character development, with the protagonists remaining as flat as cardboard up until the very end. The acting, although far from impeccable, could have raised the bar slightly if not for the unimaginative and clichéd dialogue that offered no engagement or emotional depth for the audience to relate to. The cast members seemed to struggle with the banal lines they were given, leaving their impressive acting prowess largely unutilized. In addition, the film's pacing felt largely uneven. Initially, it tries to hook viewers with a rapid succession of events, only to drag its feet through the subsequent acts, resulting in a final showdown that is as anticlimactic as it is unsatisfying. The visual effects offer little solace, as they appear unpolished and subpar compared to what one would expect from a contemporary movie of its budget. A notable weakness of The Lost Potential is its inability to generate any real sense of danger or thrill. The movie's villain, although menacing in appearance, is poorly fleshed-out and lacks a credible motivation, making it difficult for viewers to be genuinely concerned about the protagonists' predicament. Furthermore, the film's music score, which could have provided a much-needed emotional anchor, is profoundly unremarkable and fails to evoke a connection to the story or its characters. Consequently, it blends into the background without adding any value to the overall experience. In conclusion, The Lost Potential is a regrettably forgettable film that squanders its premise, characters, and cast. The poor direction, clichéd dialogue, and weak storyline leave audiences with a sense of unfulfilled expectations and wasted opportunities. If you're seeking an engaging and satisfying movie night, it would be wise to explore other options instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Matt Roper. and Chris Parsons. PUBLISHED:. 03:52 EST, 23 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 05:57 EST, 23 April 2012. Brazil secretly helped supply weapons to Argentina during the Falklands War, it was revealed today. Brazil was officially neutral in the 1982 conflict, which began 20 years ago this month when Argentine forces occupied the islands. But secret Brazilian government documents revealed today that Argentina's South American neighbour provided logistical support for the supply of arms for use against British forces - and even bought bombs and ammunition for Argentina's military junta. Support: An Argentinian bomb explodes on the Royal Navy frigate HMS Antelope at the height of the Falklands dispute in May 1982. The document claims Recife airport in Brazil was at one point receiving two flights a day from Buenos Aries of planes packed with ammunition and explosives (file picture) A document from Brazil's National Security Council, unearthed by the O Globo newpaper, reported that Argentina regularly contacted the Brazilian government with requests for help in the war effort. They included buying aeroplanes, incendiary bombs, ammunition for rifles, radar systems and aviation fuel. Brazil also allowed planes belonging to Argentina's national airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, but which were secretly carrying weapons from Libya and Cuba, to refuel at the country's airports. At one point Recife aiport in the northwest of Brazil was receiving two flights a day from Libya en route to Buenos Aires, packed with ammunition and explosives, according to another document from the Brazilian Navy. The supply of arms also departed from Israel with stopovers in the Canary Islands and Rio de Janeiro. Planes from Cuba - Brazil's enemy during the Cold War - were also allowed to pass through Brazilian airspace, loaded with guns, the document also reveals. Dispute: Brazil appeared to further back Argentina over the Falklands when new president Dilma Rousseff (above) banned a Royal Navy ship from docking in Rio earlier this year. When confronted about its clandestine support for its neighbour, however, Brazil flatly denied the charge. A. previously unseen letter from the British Embassy in Brazil was also. uncovered, accusing Brazil of allowing the landing of an Argentinian. plan loaded with weapons. In. response the Brazilian government said that in their inspection of the. Aerolineas Argentinas flight they 'didn't find anything of a military. nature.' Despite its claims to being officially neutral, Brazil is thought to have long supported Argentina in the territorial conflict. Both countries refer to the disputed islands as the 'Malvinas', with Brazil backing Argentina in the sovereignty dispute in 2010. The Brazilian government also stated that the UK's offshore oil exploration programme in the Argentinan continental shelf was 'illegal' and 'inconsistent with what determines the United Nations'. The reported. revelations about Brazil's support of Argentina may not come as a. surprise to many, given Brazil's stance when the Falklands dispute. erupted again earlier this year. In January Brazil took sides against Britain by refusing permission for a Royal navy ship to dock in Rio de Janeiro. HMS. Clyde, which patrols the waters around the Falklands, was forced to. switch course to Chile after being rebuffed by the Brazilians. Foreign. policy analysts claimed the new Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was. trying to play the ‘anti-colonial card’ to satisfy the left-wing. factions of her Worker’s Party. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is about how Brazil secretly helped Argentina during the Falklands War in 1982, even though Brazil said they were neutral. Brazil gave support by providing weapons, ammunition, and other supplies to Argentina to use against British forces. They also let planes from Argentina, which had weapons from other countries, refuel at their airports. The Falklands War was a conflict between Argentina and the United Kingdom over islands in the South Atlantic. Brazil's actions surprised some people, but others think it makes sense because Brazil and Argentina have been friends and agree on some things about the islands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dinh Minh Tuan from Vietnamsays rewards are important because they prepare students for the future life. But young children should get things they value more than money, like funny books, pens and film tickets. There was a suggestion from South Korea that if rewards are necessary for learning,they could be gathered like a charity fund. This money could be used for a project designed by the students.

Question: Where do Jimmy and Fletch live? Movie title: Lesbian Vampire Killers Movie plot: Jimmy (Mathew Horne) and Fletch (James Corden) are two friends living in London experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar (Paul McGann) who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer.

Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure.

The loan marks the first time any of the artefacts from the Greek Parthenon have left the UK since they were brought to London by Lord Elgin at the turn of the 19th Century. Shrouded in secrecy, the transfer has raised questions about the statue's security amidst fractious relations between the UK and Russia. The reaction of those campaigning for the return of the Marbles to their original Greek home will also be closely watched. According to the British Museum's Neil MacGregor: \\"The Hermitage had been planning its 250 year anniversary for some time - and they are really the twin of the British Museum - so a couple of years ago the director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, asked if we might make one big loan to mark the fact we are both the great enlightenment museums. \\"The trustees said 'yes' and the Hermitage decided what they wanted more than anything else was a symbol of the great shared European heritage and the greatest one of them is one of the Parthenon sculptures.\\" According to The Times, which followed the journey of the Marbles to Russia, it was carefully boxed up on 20 November after a \\"good dusting\\" and kept in storage until Tuesday. It was then loaded on to a passenger plane bound for St Petersburg. Among the passengers, only its courier was aware of the important artefact stowed in the cargo hold. Neil McGregor said: \\"The British Museum lends great sculptures all around the world. There are lots of sculptures from the British Museum elsewhere in the world. \\"Anyone who has been to the Parthenon gallery in the past week will have seen that it's not on show and we simply said it was being prepared for a display.\\" The British Museum will have ensured the standard procedures for loaning works are in place. It has an official letter from Russia's Ministry of Culture guaranteeing the statue will be under the protection of the Russian Federation. The UK has made similar assurances to Russia in the past. In 2007, parliament implemented a law to protect Russian paintings from being impounded on British soil because of disputes over ownership. The change in legislation was brought forward at the behest of the Russian culture ministry, which had threatened to block the export of the paintings by Van Gogh and Matisse, amongst others, for an exhibition at the Royal Academy. Sir Anthony Brenton, who was British Ambassador to Russia during the time of the law change, says not. Recalling the negotiations, he told the BBC that Russian had given no assurances it would introduce reciprocal legislation for \\"immunity from seizure\\". However, his advice was that Russia is not so law-bound that it would be possible for an artwork to be seized against the wishes of the government. He added that the government had promised to return the Marbles and so that will happen - particularly because it wants other institutions to lend it artworks in the future. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pulled no punches in his reaction to the news. \\"The decision by the British Museum to give out on loan one of the Parthenon sculptures for exhibit in St Petersburg is an affront to the Greek people,\\" he said. \\"The Parthenon and its Marbles have been looted.  The sculptures are priceless.  We Greeks are one with our history and civilization, which cannot be broken up, loaned out, or conceded. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4, the British Museum's Neil McGregor had expressed his hopes for a more positive response. \\"I hope that they will be very pleased that a huge new public can engage with the great achievements of ancient Greece. \\"People who will never be able to come to Athens or London will now, here in Russia, understand something of those great achievements in Greek civilisation.\\" But the chairman of the Marbles Reunited campaign, Liberal Democrat MP Andrew George, said: \\"Neil MacGregor justifies his decision by claiming that these sculptures should be 'shared and enjoyed by as many people... as possible'. \\"But these sculptures have not been 'shared and enjoyed' by the Greeks for over 200 years, since they were purloined in a dodgy deal by Lord Elgin during a period when Greece was occupied by the Ottomans.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the loan of a Parthenon sculpture from the British Museum to the State Hermitage Museum in Russia.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Paul Aurelian ( known in Breton as Paol Aorelian or Saint Pol de Léon and in Latin as Paulinus Aurelianus ) was a 6th - century Welshman who became first bishop of the See of Léon and one of the seven founder saints of Brittany . Paul Aurelian was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years , after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors , which suggests several Pauls have been mixed up . Gilbert Hunter Doble thought he might be the same man as Saint Paulinus of Wales .  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Gilbert Hunter Doble (26 November 1880  15 April 1945) was an Anglican priest and Cornish historian and hagiographer.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England.

It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.  - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet.  - A classical language is a language with a literature that is \\"classical\\".

Q:Information:  - A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.  - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.  - Angina pectoris, commonly known as angina, is the sensation of chest pain, pressure, or squeezing, often due to not enough blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries.  While angina pectoris can occur due to anemia, abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure, its main cause is coronary artery disease, an atherosclerotic process affecting the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the Latin \\"angere\\" (\\"to strangle\\") and \\"pectus\\" (\\"chest\\"), and can therefore be translated as \\"a strangling feeling in the chest\\".  - Tritium (or ; symbol ' or ', also known as hydrogen-3) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with cosmic rays. It is produced by irradiating lithium metal in a nuclear reactor. Tritium is used as a radioactive tracer, in radioluminescent light sources for watches and instruments, and in nuclear weapons. The name of this isotope is formed from the Greek word  (\\"trítos\\") meaning \\"third\\".  - A radioactive tracer, or radioactive label, is a chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope so by virtue of its radioactive decay it can be used to explore the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracing the path that the radioisotope follows from reactants to products. Radiolabeling is thus the radioactive form of isotopic labeling.  - Lithium (from , \\"stone\\") is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.  - AstraZeneca plc is a BritishSwedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to Cambridge, England, and concentrated its R&D in three sites: Cambridge, Gaithersburg, Maryland (location of MedImmune) for work on biopharmaceuticals, and Mölndal (near Gothenburg) in Sweden, for research on traditional chemical drugs. In 2015 it was the eighth largest drug company in the world based on sales revenue.  - Alprenolol, or alfeprol, alpheprol, and alprenololum (Gubernal, Regletin, Yobir, Apllobal, Aptine, Aptol Duriles), is a non-selective beta blocker as well as 5-HT receptor antagonist, used in the treatment of angina pectoris. It is no longer marketed by AstraZeneca, but may still be available from other pharmaceutical companies or generically.  - A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research. Today there are about 450 nuclear power reactors that are used to generate electricity in about 30 countries around the world.  - Dihydroalprenolol ( DHA ) is a hydrogenated alprenolol derivative that acts as a beta - adrenergic blocker . When the extra hydrogen atoms are tritium , it is a radiolabeled form of alprenolol , which is used to label beta - adrenergic receptors for isolation .  - Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation, mainly originating outside the Solar System. Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface. Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin. Data from the \\"Fermi\\" space telescope (2013) have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernovae explosions of stars. Active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays.  - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients.  - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons.  - A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\\"atomic\\") bomb released the same amount of energy as approximately .

Both Beijing and Montreal are expected to experience bouts of acid rain in the upcoming weeks.  But I can use this background: Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases. With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur ( Figure below ). Let’s say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day. It would be hard to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have. Smaller pieces dissolve more easily.  What is an answer for this question: Which area's rocks will have higher rates of chemical weathering caused by the acid rain? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the rocks in Beijing would have higher rates of chemical weathering caused by the acid rain. This is because the rocks in Beijing are often found spread out in smaller pieces compared to the rocks in Montreal. These smaller pieces in Beijing have more surface area exposed, leading to more locations for chemical weathering to occur. The process is similar to that of making hot chocolate: smaller pieces of chocolate (akin to the smaller rocks in Beijing) dissolve more easily in milk or water due to increased surface area.  In contrast, the rocks in Montreal typically remain larger in size and do not break apart as much, which means less surface area is available to interact with the acid rain, hence a lower overall rate of chemical weathering. Just as mechanical weathering can increase the rate of chemical weathering (in this case, by creating smaller pieces with more surface area), the increased presence of acid rain in both cities will accelerate the chemical weathering of the rocks. However, because of the difference in the physical state of the rocks, the process will be more pronounced in Beijing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up clerical child abuse until the mid-1990s, according to a government-commissioned report released Thursday. The Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation's 720-page report said that it has \\"no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up\\" from January 1975 to May 2004, the time covered by the report. \\"The Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets,\\" the report said. \\"The welfare of children, which should have been the first priority, was not even a factor to be considered in the early stages,\\" it said. \\"Instead the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name, status and assets of the institution and of what the institution regarded as its most important members -- the priests.\\" Archbishop Diarmuid Martin apologized Thursday in a news conference. \\"No words of apology can ever be sufficient,\\" he said. And Dermot Ahern, Ireland's justice minister, said he felt a \\"a growing sense of revulsion and anger\\" as he read the report. \\"Bottom line is this: A collar will protect no villain,\\" he said. The commission was set up in March 2006 to look into allegations of child sexual abuse made against clergy in the Irish capital. Its report was completed in July. Although the commission said it was not its place to \\"establish whether or not abuse occurred ... it is abundantly clear ... that child sexual abuse by clerics was widespread throughout the period.\\" One victim, Marie Collins, said those who covered up the abuse were just as guilty as the perpetrators of the crimes. \\"How many people accused of abuse are still sitting in parishes today?\\" she asked in a Thursday news conference. The commission examined the histories of 46 priests, who were picked as a sample from 102 who had had complaints or suspicions of child abuse raised against them. Complaints from more than 320 children were leveled against the 46, the report said. But it said that the number of children abused likely exceeded that. \\"One priest admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children, while another accepted that he had abused on a fortnightly basis during the currency of his ministry which lasted for over 25 years,\\" the report said. \\"The total number of documented complaints recorded against those two priests is only just over 70.\\" In its analysis of the 46 priests, the commission said that all four archbishops -- Archbishops John Charles McQuaid, Dermot Ryan, Kevin McNamara, and Desmond Connell -- who served during the time period covered by the report handled the child sexual abuse complaints \\"badly.\\" \\"Not one of them reported his knowledge of child sexual abuse to the Gardai (the Irish police force) throughout the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s,\\" the report said. The commission did credit Connell, who took over the archdiocese in 1988, with giving Irish authorities in 1995 the names of 17 priests against whom complaints had been made -- although it called the number incomplete, saying that there was \\"knowledge within the Archdiocese of at least 28 priests against whom there had been complaints.\\" They said he was \\"slow to recognize the seriousness of the situation.\\" Connell also gave authorities permission to access the archdiocesan files in 2002. Connell, a cardinal, apologized in a written statement. \\"I wish to express without reservation my bitter regret that failures on my part contributed to the suffering of victims in any form,\\" he said. \\"Although I am all too aware that such apologies and expressions of regret can never be adequate as a response to so much hurt and violation and, in any case, lose their value through repetition, I apologize again now from my heart and ask the forgiveness of those who have been so shamefully harmed.\\" The report named 11 priests who had pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sexual assaults on children. Of the other 35, it gave pseudonyms to 33 of them and redacted the names of two. The report shot down the notion that church leadership was unaware of the problem. \\"The Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities have repeatedly claimed to have been, prior to the late 1990s, 'on a learning curve' in relation to the matter,\\" it said. However, it said McNamara, Ryan and McQuaid had information on complaints against at least 17 priests when the Archdiocese took out insurance in 1987 to cover future compensation claims and lawsuits related to sexual abuse allegations. \\"The taking out of insurance was an act proving knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost to the Archdiocese and is inconsistent with the view that Archdiocesan officials were still 'on a learning curve' at a much later date, or were lacking in an appreciation of the phenomenon of clerical child sex abuse,\\" it said. The report also said church officials perpetuated the problem by ignoring allegations and in some cases simply moved an alleged abuser on to another parish -- leaving him free to abuse another group of children. Thursday's findings follow a report that came out in May, detailing allegations of child abuse in various institutions across Ireland from the 1940s to the present. Though both reports deal with child abuse, they are not related, having been written by two separate commissions investigating two different subjects. The May report looked at child abuse in lay institutions, including reformatories, hospitals, orphanages, children's homes and industrial schools across the country. Some of those institutions were linked to religious orders, but none were strictly religious schools. Speaking last month after the Irish High Court cleared the way for Thursday's report to be made public, Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern said he was pleased the information would not be kept private. \\"I have always made it clear that I have been anxious to put the report into the public domain as quickly as possible, while at the same time not wishing to do anything which would prejudice the chances of any of the people involved in these evil deeds being brought to justice,\\" Ahern said in a statement. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","output":"A long time ago, some priests in Dublin, Ireland, did very bad things to children. They hurt them and made them feel scared. The people in charge of the church knew about these bad actions, but they tried to hide it to protect the church's name and stop people from finding out the truth. Later, an important report came out which showed that these bad things happened from 1975 until 2004. The report said that child abuse by priests was happening a lot in that time period, but the people at the top of the church didn't help the children who needed it. they cared more about keeping the church's secrets. This report helped show the truth and made people very sad and angry. The church and priests involved said they were sorry for what happened, but they know that just saying sorry isn't enough to fix the hurt they caused. Some of the priests who hurt the children were punished for their actions, but others were just moved to different places, where they continued to hurt more children.

There was one very well-off bunny in the village who had a large burrow and lots of food saved up. He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.

A Dallas nurse who recovered from Ebola has been reunited with her dog Bentley, who has spent 21 days in quarantine. The King Charles Cavalier spaniel has undergone twice-daily check-ups by vets in hazmat suits at a secret naval base while his owner, Nina Pham, was treated for the deadly virus. This morning, the pair were reunited privately on Saturday at the secret location near the Texan city where he had been isolated since she fell ill. Scroll down for video. Together again! Nina Pham, 26, clutches Bentley as he is released from quarantine after 21 days. Thankful: The former Ebola patient thanked vets for treating him as their own while she was in hospital. Private reunion: Pham traveled to the naval base this morning to retrieve Bentley from his isolation unit. Smiles: Pham posed excitedly with her 'best friend' Mr Bentley and one of the vets that cared for him. As Pham, 26, underwent blood transfusions and hospital transfers to tackle the deadly virus, Bentley underwent twice-daily check-ups by vets in hazmat suits at the decommissioned naval air base near Dallas. Tearful, Pham said at a news conference Saturday that she was thankful for the thoughts and prayers for 'me and Mr Bentley,' whom she called 'one of my best friends.' Pham was diagnosed with Ebola last month. She contracted the virus while caring for the Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who died on October 8. City spokeswoman Sana Syed said on Thursday that the dog has tested negative for Ebola and that his 21-day quarantine — the Ebola incubation period — ends Saturday. Pham recovered and was released October 24 from a Washington, D.C.-area hospital. Ebola free: Bentley, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel belonging to cured Ebola patient Nina Pham, has been release from quarantine. Pictured above in a snap shared by Dallas Animal Services on Thursday. Where's Nina? Pham had not been allowed to visit her dog as it could have caused Bentley to become anxious. Under observation: Workers in hazmat suits removed Bentley from Pham's home, and took him to a special isolation room at a nearby naval base. He has been treated by veterinarians and other workers every day. On Thursday he tested negative for Ebola for a third time. Pham was one of two nurses to contract Ebola after treating Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Nurse Amber Vinson has also been cured of the deadly disease which has currently claimed nearly 5,000 lives, mainly in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. That leaves only one person currently being treated for Ebola in the U.S. Dr Craig Spencer of New York is currently being treated for the disease in an isolation wing at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital. He came down the disease less than a week after returning from West Africa where he was performing aid work with Doctors Without Borders. Ms Pham was the first Ebola patient in the U.S. to have been in contact with a pet as she came down with the virus. Nurse's best friend: Pham's beloved dog has been in quarantine since just after she admitted herself to the hospital with a high temperature. Happy: Pham contracted the disease after volunteering to treat U.S. Ebola patient-zero Thomas Eric Duncan. She has since recovered from the deadly disease. Pictured above giving a hug to President Barack Obama on October 24. While dogs are not known to be the virus' natural carriers, it's still unclear whether they indeed spread it to humans if they've come into contact with someone who is infected. In Spain, those questions caused officials to put down the dog of nurse there who became infected. Excalibur, who belonged to Spanish nurse and Ebola patient Teresa Romero, was destroyed days after Romero was diagnosed. The move sparked widespread outrage and mass protests in the streets of Madrid - as Romero was later cleared of the virus. Pham's family revealed they pleaded with the district judge to let Bentley survive. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Article: The Friday after the American holiday of Thanksgiving is called Black Friday. It's said that it's the day that store ledgers move into the black and companies become profitable. On that day, retailers slash  prices to get consumers to buy.  It is also a time when many Americans start their Christmas shopping. VOA's Elizabeth Lee tells us how the economy may affect consumers on that bargain day. This day should be a shopper's dream. \\"It's just the deals, the sales and everything you can get for a lesser price,\\" said Sandy Thomas, a shopper. But it's a nightmare for others. \\"I think it's crazy. I've done all of my shopping throughout the week so I don't have to go out on Friday,\\" she said. It's called Black Friday, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season in the United States. Every year it's the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Stores open before sunrise and there are deep discounts everywhere you look. Last year a crowd of bargain-hunters killed a Wal-mart worker in a New York suburb. This year, many stores are increasing security while they slash prices. \\"This is a huge time for the retail stores,\\" said Fred Joutz from George Washington University. \\"This is when they begin making their profits for the year.\\" Economics professor Fred Joutz says how Americans spend the weekend after Thanksgiving is a good indication of how consumers feel about the future. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Joutz says Americans are saving more and spending less. Some retailers are attracting consumers by opening on Thanksgiving Day, when shops are traditionally closed.  Other stores open their doors anywhere from midnight to four in the morning. And shoppers will be lining up in front of the doors in order to be one of the first ones to walk through and get a big discount. Electronics like flat screen TVs are usually the first items to go.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more fossil fuel pollution happens, how will it affect more visible prey.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased fossil fuel pollution can have both direct and indirect effects on the process involving more visible prey.  Direct effects:  1. Fossil fuel pollution can contribute to the intensification of climate change, leading to more extreme weather events, such as droughts and heatwaves, which in turn can increase the risk of forest fires. As a consequence, this would lead to the chain reaction described in the process, making prey more visible to predators. 2. The pollution can also result in the degradation of air and water quality, which can negatively impact the habitats and health of both prey and predators. Indirect effects: 1. Fossil fuel pollution can contribute to changes in the overall ecosystem, including disruptions to the food chain. As a result, more visible prey could face a decrease in their food sources, making them more vulnerable to predators, or, alternatively, more predators may be drawn to the area due to an increase in prey visibility. 2. The pollution can also affect human behavior, such as prompting increased conservation efforts or, conversely, encouraging the exploitation of natural resources. These changes in human behavior can ultimately impact prey and predator populations by altering their habitats.  Overall, the perturbation of increased fossil fuel pollution can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, resulting in a potentially greater impact on more visible prey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.  Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men. contains an answer for the question: Who tries to get information from the paleontologist?, what is it ?

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The Islamic Resistance Movement is also known as Hamas.","output":"Yes, based on the provided paragraph, we can accurately conclude that the sentence \\"The Islamic Resistance Movement is also known as Hamas\\" is true. The paragraph clearly states that \\"Muslim fundamentalists such as the Islamic Resistance Movement, also known as Hamas, and the smaller Islamic Jihad are determined to torpedo the peace process.\\" It suggests that the Islamic Resistance Movement is another name for Hamas and that both are acting as Muslim fundamentalist groups that aim to undermine the peace process. In further detail, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist group founded in 1987. It operates in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are Palestinian territories. Hamas emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist organization founded in Egypt in 1928.  Following the First Intifada – a Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the late 1980s – Hamas' influence grew. It challenged the dominant secular Palestinian nationalist group, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), aiming to replace it as the leading political and military force among Palestinians.  The paragraph also mentions the smaller Islamic Jihad, which is another Palestinian Islamist organization, distinct from Hamas. Formally known as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), it was founded in the late 1970s by two Egyptian radicals, later inspired by Iran's Islamic Revolution, and is primarily focused on militant activity against Israel. Both Hamas and the Islamic Jihad reject the peace process, which implies negotiations and potential compromises between Israel and the Palestinian territories (including Palestinian leadership). They promote the idea that Israel's existence as a state cannot be affirmed under any circumstances. Consequently, they have engaged in violent and non-violent tactics to subvert the peace process and advance their ultimate goal of establishing an Islamic state in the entire area of historical Palestine.  In conclusion, when referring the given paragraph, it is accurate to state that \\"The Islamic Resistance Movement is also known as Hamas.\\" The paragraph highlights the fundamentalist nature of both Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad, emphasizing their opposition to the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as Vorbis and MP3. Compression ratios are around 50–60% of original size, which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of waveforms and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like FLAC, Shorten and TTA use linear prediction to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many of these algorithms use convolution with the filter [-1 1] to slightly whiten or flatten the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently. The process is reversed upon decompression.

We have the equation: -70 * c + 16 = -68 * c 2. We want to find out what number \\"c\\" is. 3. To do this, we should try to get all the \\"c\\" things on one side. So let's first add 68 * c to both sides of the equation to get them together. This will look like this: -70 * c + 16 + 68 * c = -68 * c + 68 * c 4. Now, let's simplify this equation: -2 * c + 16 = 0 5. Our next step is to get \\"c\\" by itself. Let's move the 16 from the left side to the right side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 16 from both sides. This will look like this: -2 * c + 16 - 16 = 0 - 16 6. Let's simplify this equation: -2 * c = -16 7. Now, we only have -2 multiplied by \\"c\\" on the left side. To find out what \\"c\\" is, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -2. This will look like this: (-2 * c) / -2 = -16 / -2 8.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.  After reading the above, is \\"First significant contribution to philosophy\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How does Camus view the absurd?\\"?","output":"No, \\"First significant contribution to philosophy\\" does not directly answer the question \\"How does Camus view the absurd?\\".  To answer the question, we can say that Camus viewed the absurd as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither. The concept of the absurd is central to his philosophy, which he expressed in works like \\"The Myth of Sisyphus,\\" \\"The Stranger,\\" and \\"The Plague.\\" While Camus was often associated with existentialism, and his ideas on the absurd were certainly influential in that domain, he explicitly rejected the label of \\"existentialist\\" in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 29 October , the Russian army opened fire in a meeting on a street market in Tallinn in which about 8 000-10 000 people participated, killing 94 and injuring over 200. The October Manifesto was supported in Estonia and the Estonian flag was displayed publicly for the first time. Jaan Tõnisson used the new political freedoms to widen the rights of Estonians by establishing the first Estonian political party - National Progress Party. Another, more radical political organisation, the Estonian Social Democratic Workers' Union was founded as well. The moderate supporters of Tõnisson and the more radical supporters of Jaan Teemant could not agree about how to continue with the revolution, and only agreed that both wanted to limit the rights of Baltic Germans and to end Russification. The radical views were publicly welcomed and in December 1905, martial law was declared in Tallinn. A total of 160 manors were looted, resulting in ca. 400 workers and peasants being killed by the army. Estonian gains from the revolution were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.","output":"What factors contributed to the divergence in views between the moderate supporters of Jaan Tõnisson and the radical supporters of Jaan Teemant during the 1905 revolution in Estonia, and how did this disagreement impact the progress toward national autonomy and the rights of the Baltic Germans?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her. She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order. Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others. They all seem to be in a kind of trance, behaving in an animalistic way. Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs: a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by something.In a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron.

Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" According to the above context, answer the following question.

During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me?

Please answer this question: when did germany attack the soviet union despite the non aggression pact between the two countries?","output":"Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, in an operation codenamed Operation Barbarossa. This unprovoked and sudden military invasion marked a significant turning point in World War II and came as a surprise to the Soviet Union, especially due to the non-aggression pact between the two countries. The non-aggression pact, formally known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, was signed on August 23, 1939. It was named after the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The pact declared a mutual non-aggression agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union and secretly outlined spheres of influence in Eastern Europe. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact allowed Nazi Germany to focus on its military advances in the western front without worrying about the eastern front. Before attacking the Soviet Union, German forces had already successfully invaded Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France. Hence, Nazi Germany decided to venture further into the European continent by trying to seize control over the Soviet Union. Operation Barbarossa was a massive operation that involved more than 3 million German and Axis troops spread across a 1,800-mile front. The German strategy was focused on rapid and deep advances into the Soviet territory, aiming to destroy the Red Army as quickly as possible. The plan was to take control over major cities like Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev before winter set in. Initially, Germany made rapid gains and advanced deep into Soviet territory, inflicting heavy losses on the Red Army. However, the Soviet Union's vastness, fierce resistance from Soviet forces, logistical difficulties, and harsh winter weather ultimately halted the German offensive. The attack on the Soviet Union marked the beginning of a brutal war on the Eastern Front, which would prove to be extremely catastrophic for both sides. Millions of soldiers and civilians lost their lives in the battles and atrocities that took place in Eastern Europe during World War II. The attack on the Soviet Union also had significant strategic implications, as it shifted the focus of the war and eventually led to the formation of a broader alliance against Nazi Germany. It marked the end of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union and solidified the Soviets as a key member of the Allied forces alongside Britain and the United States, who were already fighting the Axis powers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of the word \\"cold\\" might suggest that the reviewer expected or preferred the ciabatta to be warm or toasted, and its cold state was not to their liking. The fact that the reviewer is considering returning to the establishment to try a different menu item, specifically a panini, implies that despite their disappointment with the ciabatta sandwich bread, they are willing to give the place another chance. This could be due to the positive aspect of fresh ingredients. Overall, while the review does contain negative feedback regarding the ciabatta sandwich bread, it also has a positive aspect in terms of the freshness of the ingredients. The reviewer's willingness to return and try something different suggests that this review leans more towards being neutral, with a mixture of both positive and negative elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: *yes. *it is not possible to tell. *no.","output":"It is not possible to tell. The given premise states that newspapers, magazines, radio, and television are so financially dependent on consumer advertising that they're unlikely to lead the charge against this problem, which refers to the impact of consumer advertising on their content or operations. It does not provide any information on whether or not television would cease to exist without consumer advertising. While it is true that television networks and channels heavily rely on advertising as a primary source of revenue, the premise does not provide enough information to conclude whether or not television would cease to exist if that revenue source were removed. There are other potential sources of income that television networks could explore, including subscription fees, content sales, government support, or alternative advertising models. Moreover, television as a medium could adapt and shift to different platforms and funding models, as has been seen with the emergence of streaming services and premium cable channels. These platforms often rely on subscription fees rather than traditional advertising, showing that it is possible for television-like content to exist without relying solely on consumer advertising. In conclusion, while the premise underscores the significance of consumer advertising to the financial health of television networks, it does not provide enough information to conclusively establish whether television would cease to exist without it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: John landed a job as an IT manager. His boss asked him to figure out problems in two similar programs, program A and program B. John found program A having parallel slowdown, but program B does not have parallel slowdown. He has to weigh the merits of using these programs.  and a hint : Parallel slowdown is a phenomenon in parallel computing where parallelization of a parallel algorithm beyond a certain point causes the program to run slower (take more time to run to completion).[1]  Parallel slowdown is typically the result of a communications bottleneck. As more processor nodes are added, each processing node spends progressively more time doing communication than useful processing. At some point, the communications overhead created by adding another processing node surpasses the increased processing power that node provides, and parallel slowdown occurs.  Please answer this question : Would program B be slower or faster than program A? Answer:","output":"Program B would generally be faster than program A due to the absence of parallel slowdown. However, to evaluate these programs' performance comprehensively, multiple factors should be considered. Before elaborating on these factors, let's restate the primary differences between the two programs. Program A experiences parallel slowdown, which implies that the communication overhead between processing nodes increases as more nodes are implemented. As a result, the nodes spend more time on communication than actual processing, causing the program to run slower exponentially. On the other hand, Program B does not experience parallel slowdown. Consequently, it is better positioned to utilize parallelism without significant communication overhead as processing nodes are added. That said, several factors should be examined when weighing the merits of using these programs: 1. Scalability: Assess the scalability of both programs. Even though program B might be faster initially, it's crucial to identify the possibility of it too running slower as its scale increases over time. Investigate the programs' potential limitations as they are developed further. 2. Complexity: Ensuring that both programs can handle the required complexity is necessary. Additionally, consider if program A's parallelism is overly complicated when compared to its benefits and if program B can effectively manage complex tasks without parallel slowdown. 3. Resource utilization: Determine which of the two programs uses system resources such as CPU, RAM, and network more efficiently. This factor is crucial as resource utilization is directly related to performance. 4. Latency: Analyze the time gap between the initiation of a process and the completion of data transfer within parallel processing systems. 5. Stability: Determine the overall stability and reliability of both programs. A program with better performance but unreliable operations may not be as useful as a slower, stable one. 6. Future improvements: Consider the potential for future optimizations and enhancements to both program A and B. Since neither program is perfect in its current state, choose the one with the most considerable potential for improvement. In summary, while program B would generally be faster than program A, it's important to examine their scalability, complexity, resource utilization, latency, stability, and potential improvements to accurately determine which program is better suited to John's requirements as an IT manager."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full, modern-day name of the house accented with Federalist highlights, such as \\"the fanlights over the doors and the balustrades on the rooftop belvedere and main staircase\\"? from the following article ?  Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the \\"balance and symmetry\\" of the architecture signaled \\"subdued elegance\\".

Plot title: Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus Movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankindâs âcomeuppanceâ. Meanwhile, a U.S. \\"naval destroyer\\"...

Write highlights for this article: It has long been considered the most upmarket of supermarkets, and now Waitrose has cemented its reputation with a range of ‘essential’ items so unnecessary that shoppers have taken to the internet to mock it. Vermicelli nests, baby avocados, kelp soap and cotton flower ironing water are among the unusual products to find themselves branded as ‘essentials’. Limoncello dessert, parmesan and pâté are on the list, too. So are dinner candles, cappuccino mousse, lardons, artichoke hearts and cardamom and black pepper soap. With many British households still feeling the effects of the recession, one critic posted a photo of the ‘essential Waitrose’ pasta product with the sarcastic observation: ‘How does one get through the day without some vermicelli nests?’ Scroll down for video. Critics have taken to the internet to mock Waitrose over the type of food included on their 'essential' range. One wag commented on ‘How does one get through the day without some vermicelli nests?’ ‘What sort of a ponce thinks blueberries are essential?’ asked another baffled commenter. When the essential Waitrose range was first launched, the supermarket promised customers that though prices might be lower than some of its other offerings – such as the free-range goose eggs that sold for £6.99 each – the range would still offer ‘the reassurance of Waitrose values’. Since then, it has expanded to 2,100 items, including many that might seem more at home in a delicatessen or a niche cosmetics store. The attack on Waitrose is far from the first time the supermarket and its clientele have been mocked. In July, the Overheard In Waitrose Facebook page attracted headlines by revealing shoppers’ exchanges including ‘Sebastian, supper is in the tagine’ and ‘Lucas, put that falafel down, you already chose olives with manchego as your treat’. Last night a defiant Waitrose spokeswoman said that rather than removing products from the essential Waitrose range, the supermarket has plans ‘in the pipeline’ to add 500 items to it. She said: ‘Put simply, if it’s essential to our customers, it’s essential to us. ‘Nearly eight out of ten baskets at our supermarket now contain at least one essential Waitrose item.’ A spokeswoman for Waitrose defended their essential range claiming 80 per cent of shoppers choose it.","output":"1.

Given the question: Given the background: Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena.  Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.  and the situation: In Steve's kitchen, there are two burners.

Answer the following question: Which burner has a higher surface air pressure? The answer is:","output":"Burner A has a higher surface air pressure.  In the given situation, Burner B is set to \\"medium,\\" meaning it is producing heat. This heat warms the air above Burner B, causing it to expand and lower its density. As a result, the surface air pressure above Burner B is lower. On the other hand, Burner A is not turned on, so it is not producing any heat.

Input: Passage: Charles II, who promoted a number of Roman Catholics at court, granted Wright a measure of royal art patronage. In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a formalised portrait of the monarch, seated in front of a tapestry representing the Judgement of Solomon, wearing St. Edward's Crown, the robes of the Garter, and carrying the orb and sceptre. Wright was also commissioned to paint an allegorical ceiling for the King's bedchamber at Whitehall Palace, and he was further appointed in 1673 to the office of \\"picture drawer in ordinary\\", allowing him to exercise his right to sign his pictures \\"Pictor Regis\\". However, to his disappointment, he did not receive the coveted office of King's Painter, which was held in the 1660s by Sir Peter Lely alone. In contrast to Wright's sympathetic realism, and carefully observed landscape backgrounds, Lely had a more glamorous style, favoured by the court, and based on Van Dyck's pre-Civil War style. This prompted the diarist Samuel Pepys to remark, after an enjoyable visit to Lely's studio, \\"thence to Wright's the painters: but Lord, the difference that is between their two works\\".Unlike Lely, who was knighted, Wright never received significant recognition from King Charles. However, at least one admirer thought he did deserve it. In 1669, Wright and the miniaturist Samuel Cooper had met Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Cosimo later called at Wright's studio where he commissioned a portrait of the Duke of Albemarle from Wright. On 3 March 1673, perhaps some time after Wright had painted his state picture of Charles II (now in the Royal Collection), a strange letter was sent from an obscure \\"Mairie Lady Hermistan\\" (evidently a fellow Roman Catholic) to Cosimo, asking him to intercede with the King to grant Wright a baronetcy. However, nothing came of the request.  Question: What was the last name of the person who was allowed to exercise his right to sign his pictures \\"Pictor Regis?\\"? Output:","output":"Task: Answer the question \\"What was the last name of the person who was allowed to exercise his right to sign his pictures \\"Pictor Regis?\\"\\" using a phrase from the passage.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl Context: Max is a lonely child who creates a dreamworld named Planet Drool (similar to Fantasia), where all of his imagination and dreams come to life. He creates two characters, with the first one being Sharkboy who was raised by sharks and his dad. The second character is Lavagirl who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them alight. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In real life, Max's parents have little time for him, and he is bullied by fellow schoolmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, Mr. Electricidad's (whose name is Spanish for \\"electricity\\") daughter. Linus steals Max's Dream Journal, where all of his ideas are kept, and vandalizes it. The next day, a tornado rages outside the school, and moments later Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear and ask Max to come with them to Planet Drool. They reach Planet Drool via a shark-like spacecraft, where Max learns that the dreamworld is turning bad, courtesy of Mr. Electric (also portrayed by George Lopez), originally the guardian of the dreamworld but now corrupted.Sharkboy and Lavagirl save some children from an out-of-control roller coaster; then, with Max, confront Mr. Electric, who quickly drops them in a part of Planet Drool called the Dream Graveyard where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor (voiced by George Lopez), a robot toy that was never finished being built by Max, but offers them a lift to other parts of the planet. Whilst on the journey, the three form a friendship but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \\"plughounds\\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric and delivered to Linus's Planet Drool incarnation,... The answer to this question is:","output":"Max's dreamworld is named Planet Drool. In this imaginative world, all of Max's dreams and creations come to life, including his two main characters, Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Planet Drool is a fantastical place where Max can escape from the challenges of his real life, such as his parent's lack of attention and bullying from his schoolmate, Linus. On Planet Drool, Max, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl must work together to save the dreamworld from turning bad at the hands of the corrupted guardian, Mr. Electric, and ultimately rediscover their true purpose and friendship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnny and girlfriend Frankie are performers on a Mississippi River riverboat, which also has a casino. Johnny is a compulsive gambler who is down on his luck and in debt. Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a gypsy camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck. Back on the boat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden seducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by Johnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that the gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does Johnny's boss. In a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing with Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A Broadway recruiter sees the riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that Frankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City. Landing in New Orleans, the musical cast and riverboat crew attend a masked ball. Frankie, Nellie and Mitzi all rent the same Madame Pompadour costume. Johnny is eager for the luck of redhead Nellie to win more money, contrary to Frankie's expressed wishes. Being masked and in costume, Frankie and Nellie scheme to switch places to test Johnny's lucky-redhead theory. Johnny wins 10,000 at roulette, but when he kisses the woman he believes to be Nellie, he discovers the switch. Frankie is furious and throws all the winnings out of a window, into the street. Blackie, a dim-witted stooge who works for the boss, hears Braden drunkenly complain about how he has lost Nellie. Thinking he can be of help, Blackie switches the blank cartridge in Frankie's stage gun for a real bullet. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person whom the riverboat performer's girlfriend, Frankie, is jealous of is Nellie Bly. Nellie Bly is their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend and has red hair which makes Johnny believe she is the lucky charm the gypsy fortune teller mentioned. This causes tension and jealousy between Frankie and Nellie, as Johnny seeks out Nellie's presence to improve his gambling luck."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What type of company does Brewster set up? Title: Brewster's Millions Movie plot: Montague L. Brewster (Dennis O'Keefe), a newly discharged U.S. soldier back from fighting in Europe during World War II, rushes home in New York City to marry his sweetheart, Peggy Gray (Helen Walker). However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes. At the same time, Peggy breaks up with Brewster, but her wise mother (Nana Bryant) persuades her to go on a costly cruise with him and the cast of a failed play he financed after Smith and Harrison close it down. During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise. When Brewster's chartered yacht is disabled by a leftover U-boat mine, he escapes from his containment and makes it to the bridge to order the captain to radio for help. Brewster learns...

Article: A tender woman, or an independent one, which one would you prefer? Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter. This type of woman is called a nuhanzi (\\"tough woman\\"). Experts believe these characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao's friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finish tough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre water to her dormitory on the 5th floor. \\"I depend on no one but myself,\\" she says. According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women have become rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent said they are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like women with tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the opposite view. Why are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychological consultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to this trend. \\"Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,\\" Shen says. \\"In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.\\" Liu Xiao lin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believes tough women are brought up this way. They are often on close relationship with their fathers, who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive,\\" he says. As a result, these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and more tolerant to stress, according to Liu. Though Liu believes that this is a good trend, Hu Shenzhi, a psychologist at the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center, says the popularity of tough woman indicates an unclear line between gender identities, which can lead to relationship problems. \\"Some women with characteristics that differ from the traditional female image may have a difficult time finding Mr Right,\\" he says.\\"Even if they get married, their manly characteristics might cause family conflicts.

Leaving it in the garbage until then can generate smells, attract animals, and breed flies. Ideally it should be made of glass, such as a pickle or spaghetti sauce jar, with a tight-fitting lid.  Plastic jars can also be used, but may leak some odor. Sealable metal cans, such as coffee cans, can be used, but may create a rust ring if left in sink. Cardboard containers, like the cylinders oatmeal comes in, should be avoided.  They may leak when they get wet from decomposing food. Ideally the jar should be small enough for a single use.  Don't reopen it later, as this will let odor and potentially flies or fruit flies out, unless it has been kept frozen.  (It's also possible to dump the contents in the garbage and then rinse and reuse the slop jar, but this is messy, and should be done outside.) This will halt the decomposition process and kill any insects or larva.  This method can either be used in conjunction with a slop jar, or else large items, like a watermelon rind, can be placed in the freezer whole.  However, it's easy to forget these items on garbage day, so a Post-it note on the trash can is a good reminder.","output":"Sometimes we can't throw away food right away because the garbage truck comes only once a week.

Glass jars are best, but plastic or metal ones can work too; just be careful because they can leak or rust. Don't use cardboard containers as they can leak when wet. Use a small jar and don't open it again, or you'll let bad smells and bugs out. You can also freeze big food scraps to stop them from rotting and keep bugs away.
